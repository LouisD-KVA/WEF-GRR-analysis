CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

NOTE
Within the UNCTAD Division on Technology and Logistics, the STI Policy Section carries out policyoriented analytical work on the impact of innovation and new and emerging technologies on sustainable
development, with a particular focus on the opportunities and challenges for developing countries. It
is responsible for the Technology and Innovation Report, which seeks to address issues in science,
technology and innovation that are topical and important for developing countries, and to do so in
a comprehensive way with an emphasis on policy-relevant analysis and conclusions. The STI Policy
Section supports the integration of STI in national development strategies and in building up STI
policy-making capacity in developing countries; a major instrument in this area is the programme of
Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Reviews. The section also serves as the core secretariat
of the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD).
In this report, the terms country/economy refer, as appropriate, to territories or areas. The designations
of country groups are intended solely for statistical or analytical convenience and do not necessarily
express a judgement about the stage of development reached by a particular country or area in the
development process. Unless otherwise indicated, the major country groupings used in this report
follow the classification of the United Nations Statistical Office. These are:
Developed countries: the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (other than Chile, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Turkey), plus the European
Union member countries that are not OECD members (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta
and Romania), plus Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino. Countries with economies
in transition refers to those of South-East Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Developing economies, in general, are all the economies that are not specified above. For statistical
purposes, the data for China do not include those for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
China (Hong Kong, China), Macao Special Administrative Region of China (Macao, China) or Taiwan
Province of China. An Excel file with the main country groupings used can be downloaded from
UNCTADstat at: http://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/Classifications.html.
References to sub-Saharan Africa include South Africa unless otherwise indicated.
References in the text to the United States are to the United States of America and those to the
United Kingdom are to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The term “dollar” ($) refers to United States dollar, unless otherwise stated.
The term “billion” signifies 1,000 million.
Annual rates of growth and change refer to compound rates.
Use of a dash (–) between dates representing years, such as 1988–1990, signifies the full period
involved, including the initial and final years.
An oblique stroke (/) between two years, such as 2000/01, signifies a fiscal or crop year.
A dot (.) in a table indicates that the item is not applicable.
Two dots (..) in a table indicate that the data are not available, or are not separately reported.
A dash (–) or a zero (0) in a table indicates that the amount is nil or negligible.
Decimals and percentages do not necessarily add up to totals because of rounding.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

FOREWORD
Recent developments in frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology,
have shown tremendous potential for sustainable development. Yet, they also risk increasing inequalities
by exacerbating and creating new digital divides between the technology haves and have-nots. The
COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed this dichotomy. Technology has been a critical tool for addressing
the spread of the disease, but not everyone has equal access to the benefits.
It is time to ask how we can take full profit from the current technological revolution to reduce gaps that
hold back truly inclusive and sustainable development. The UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report
2021 examines the likelihood of frontier technologies widening existing inequalities and creating new
ones. It also addresses the national and international policies, instruments and institutional reforms that
are needed to create a more equal world of opportunity for all, leaving no one behind.
The report shows that frontier technologies already represent a $350 billion market, which could grow
to $3.2 trillion by 2025. This offers great opportunities for those ready to catch this technological wave.
But many countries, especially the least developed and those in sub-Saharan Africa, are unprepared
to equitably use, adopt and adapt to the ongoing technological revolution. This could have serious
implications for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Technology and Innovation Report 2021 urges all developing nations to prepare for a period of deep
and rapid technological change that will profoundly affect markets and societies. All countries will need to
pursue science, technology and innovation policies appropriate to their development stage and economic,
social and environmental conditions. This requires strengthening and aligning Science, Technology and
Innovation systems and industrial policies, building digital skills among students and the workforce, and
closing digital divides. Governments should also enhance social protection and ease workforce transitions
to deal with the potential negative consequences of frontier technologies on the job market.
The report also calls for strengthened international cooperation to build innovation capacities in developing
countries, facilitate technology transfer, increase women’s participation in digital sectors, conduct
technological assessments and promote an inclusive debate on the impact of frontier technologies on
sustainable development.
A key takeaway from the report is that technologies are not deterministic. We can harness their potential
for the common good, and we have an obligation to do so. That is why I launched a Strategy on New
Technologies in September 2018 to guide the United Nations system on how new technologies can and
must be used to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the realization of
the promise of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
New technologies hold the promise of the future, from climate action and better health to more democratic
and inclusive societies. As this report highlights, the guiding principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development to leave no one behind provides a compelling incentive for harnessing frontier technologies
for sustainable development.
Let us use them wisely, for the benefit of all.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

PREFACE
The Technology and Innovation Report 2021 critically examines the possibility of frontier technologies
such as AI, robotics and gene-editing widening existing inequalities and creating new ones. The
debate about the relationship between technological change and inequalities has a long tradition
in development studies. However, the broad reach, the seemingly unlimited and tight integration of
these new technologies through digitalization and connectivity, and the rapid pace of technological
change have put in doubt the relevance of the experiences of previous technological transformations
to inform the current policy debate.
Frontier technologies can bring enormous benefits to the lives of poor people. Prospects are immense in
agriculture, health, education, energy and other areas of development. There are numerous examples
on successfully mobilizing frontier technologies. However, many of these technology deployment
remains at pilot level. This Report discusses how to scale them up, how to bring their benefits to the
poor, what government interventions and business models work, what good practices and lessons
are there, and what the missing links are.
There is also a concern that automation, AI, robotics will destroy jobs and with that the dream of poor
people in developing countries to get out of poverty. There is a fear that the chasm between haves
and have nots would widen, while benefits are captured by a few with skills and capital. This Report
discusses the impact of these technologies on labour markets and how to prepare the work force to
benefit from the frontier technologies and minimize the risks.
The Report focuses on low and middle-income developing countries and least developed countries,
as well as on the most vulnerable segments of societies, while providing discussion on the effects
on high-income countries as parts of the broader context and major drivers of frontier technologies.
The Report argues that frontier technologies are essential for sustainable development, but they
also could accentuate initial inequalities. It is up to policies to reduce this risk and make frontier
technologies contribute to increasing equality. Low- and middle-income developing countries and
the least developing countries cannot afford to miss the new wave of rapid technological change.
Harnessing this new technological revolution will require countries to promote the use, adoption
and adaptation of frontier technologies. A balanced approach building a robust industrial base and
promoting frontier technologies is a must for success in the twenty-first century.

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

OVERVIEW
Human development in recent decades has been accompanied by rapid changes in technology
and an increasing proliferation of digitized devices and services. And the pace of change seems
likely to accelerate as a result of “frontier technologies” such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
biotechnology, and nanotechnology.
These technologies have already brought enormous benefits – dramatically highlighted in 2020 by the
accelerated development of coronavirus vaccines. But rapid advances can have serious downsides if
they outpace the ability of societies to adapt. There are fears, for example, that jobs are disappearing as
more economic activity is automated, and that social media is exacerbating divisions, anxiety and doubt.
Overall, there are concerns that frontier technologies will further widen inequalities, or create new ones.
Most of these issues have been voiced in developed countries. But the implications could be even
more serious for developing countries – if poor communities and countries are either overwhelmed
or simply left behind. This report considers how developing countries can catch the wave of frontier
technologies, balancing innovation with equity in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals.

1.

CATCHING THE WAVES

We live in an age of dramatic technological advances, mostly concentrated in developed countries,
but the great divides between countries that we see today started with the onset of the first industrial
revolution. At that point most people were equally poor and the gaps in per capita income between
countries were much smaller (Figure 1). Then with waves of technological change, Western Europe
and its offshoots – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States – along with Japan, pulled
ahead. Most other countries remained on the periphery. Every wave of progress was associated with
sharper inequality between countries – with widening disparities in access to products, social services
and public goods – from education to health, from ICT infrastructure to electrification. Nevertheless,
a few countries, notably in East Asia, were subsequently able to catch up through technological
learning, imitation and innovation.

Prosperity with inequality
During recent decades of digitization, the world has seen growing prosperity. People on average
are living longer and healthier lives. Rapid economic growth in emerging economies has fuelled the
rise of a global middle class. Nevertheless, there is persistent poverty, and rising inequality. Wealth
is highly concentrated, and there are also large disparities in income-earning opportunities, as well
as in standards of education and health. These imbalances constrain economic growth and human
development while heightening vulnerability, whether to pandemics, or economic crises or climate
change – and can soon destabilize societies.

Multifaceted inequalities
Inequality is a multifaceted concept related to differences in outcomes and opportunities between
individuals, groups or countries. These differences can arise along any dimension of development –
social, economic or environmental. Inequality of outcomes and opportunities are closely intertwined.
The outcomes for one generation affect the opportunities for the next – resulting in intergenerational
transmission of inequalities.
As indicated in Figure 2, there are still large inequalities between countries. People in low- and lowermiddle-income countries, on average, suffer from much higher levels of poverty and deprivation when
compared with people in upper-middle- and high-income countries.

Two-phase revolutions
There is no consensus on the dynamics of economic inequality – which is affected by many factors, such
as war and epidemics, as well as by political processes influenced by power struggles and ideologies.
Globalization and technological change have also been pointed out as drivers of income inequalities
within countries. Nevertheless, at the same time these impulses have helped reduce poverty in lowincome countries, and not only in larger, faster developing ones, such as China and India, but also many
others, including countries in Africa, as shown by the impact of smartphones.2
At the same time, inequality is also affected by technological revolutions. Technological changes combine
with financial capital to create new techno-economic paradigms – the cluster of technologies, products,
industries, infrastructure and institutions that characterize a technological revolution. In the countries at
the centre of these new technological waves, the surge can be considered in two phases. First is the
installation phase as technology is introduced into core industries – widening the gaps between workers
in these industries and the rest. Second is the deployment phase which also tends to be uneven: not
everyone gets immediate access to the benefits of progress such as a life-saving treatment, or access
to clean water. The result is widening divisions which can lead to public discontent.

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

At present, the world is reaching the end of the deployment phase of the “Age of ICT” and starting
the installation phase of a new paradigm, involving frontier technologies and sometimes called
Industry 4.0 (Figure 4). The deployment of ICT resulted in an enormous concentration of wealth in the
ownership of the major digital platforms. How will Industry 4.0 affect inequalities between countries?
Much will depend on whether countries are catching up, forging ahead, or falling behind – which in
turn will depend on their national policies and on their involvement in international trade.

Responding to inequalities
To some extent governments can mitigate inequalities within countries through progressive taxation
on incomes or wealth, or on income from capital. They can also make services such as education
freely available to all. Governments can also increase social transfers, such as unemployment
benefits, which reduce the risk of people falling into poverty. And in the workplace these actions can
be complemented by those of stronger trade unions which help to increase wages.
Reducing income inequality between countries will mean harnessing technology and trade for structural
transformation. If developing countries are to create economies that offer their people better-paid jobs
they will have to take advantage of the new technological paradigm. Developing countries, and whole
continents such as Africa, cannot afford to miss this new wave of technological change.

FORGING AHEAD AT THE DIGITAL FRONTIERS

The “frontier technologies” are a group of new technologies that take advantage of digitalization
and connectivity which enable them to combine to multiply their impacts. This report covers 11
such technologies: artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of things (IoT), big data, blockchain, 5G, 3D
printing, robotics, drones, gene editing, nanotechnology and solar photovoltaic (Solar PV).

These technologies can be used to boost productivity and improve livelihoods. AI, for example,
combined with robotics can transform production and business processes. 3D printing allows faster
and cheaper low-volume production and rapid, iterative prototyping of new products. As a group,
these 11 technologies already represent a $350-billion market, and one that by 2025 could grow to
over $3.2 trillion (figure 5).
Finance companies have used these technologies, for example, for making credit decisions, and
for risk management, fraud prevention, trading, personalized banking and process automation. The
manufacturing sector has used them for predictive maintenance, quality control and human-robot
combined work.
Many of the major providers of these technologies are from the United States which is home to major
cloud computing platforms. China is also a major producer, notably of 5G, drones and solar PV. For
each of the technologies, these two countries are also responsible for 30 to 70 per cent of patents
and publications.

A country readiness index
Only a few countries currently create frontier technologies, but all countries need to prepare for them.
To assess national capabilities to equitably use, adopt and adapt these technologies this report has
developed a ‘readiness index’. The index comprises five building blocks: ICT deployment, skills, R&D
activity, industry activity and access to finance.
Based on this index, the countries best prepared are the United States, followed by Switzerland, the
United Kingdom, Sweden, Singapore, the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea. The list also has
high rankings for some transition and developing economies – such as China ranked at 25 and the
Russian Federation at 27. Most of the least-ready countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, and in the
developing countries generally.

The countries ranked highest are largely the richest ones, but there are many outliers – countries
that perform better than their per capita GDPs would suggest. The greatest overperformer is India,
followed by the Philippines. On the R&D components of the index, China and India perform well, partly
because these countries have abundant supplies of highly skilled but relatively inexpensive human
resources. In addition, they have large local markets, which attract investment from multinational
enterprises. Viet Nam and Jordan also do well, reflecting supportive government policy.

HUMANS AND MACHINES AT WORK

Technological change affects inequalities through its impact on jobs, wages and profits. These inequalities
could arise between occupations, firms and sectors as well as between wage earners and owners of
capital. Another level in which inequality emerges is in the differences in the economic structures of
countries. The contribution of each of these and other elements to income inequality depends on many
factors, such as the country’s level of development, its economic structure and its social and economic
and labour policies, as well as the size of a specific sector or its firms. Therefore, at any given time, in a
particular country, technological change could cause inequality to rise or fall.
Is this any different from what happened with previous waves of technology? In principle, no. The channels
and mechanisms are similar. But each wave of technological change brings inequality in new shapes.

Automation taking jobs
Nowadays, a major concern is that AI and robotics will reduce employment. Indeed, since the onset
of the industrial revolution workers have expected new technologies to destroy jobs. Generally this
has not happened; new technologies have instead tended to create more jobs, and of different kinds.
But for frontier technologies, the situation could be different because the changes are coming so
quickly they could outpace the capacity of societies to respond.
Previously, many jobs were considered safe because it was difficult to teach computers how to perform
them. Now, however, the computers can often teach themselves. Some estimates suggest that over
the next 20 years, in Europe and the United States 30 to 50 per cent of jobs could be automated.
Others see a more modest impact – from 8 to 14 per cent across occupations. Nevertheless, while
some jobs will disappear, others will emerge – such as those requiring empathy, ethical judgements,
inventiveness, managing unpredictable changes, or making decisions based on understanding tacit
messages – all of which have to be carried out by humans.
Predictions on job losses are typically based on technological feasibility, but the more important
factors are often economic. Even when it is technologically feasible, capital may not replace labour;
much depends on relative prices. At the same time, the overall demand for labour could be increased
by macroeconomic effects.
Another concern for developing countries is that multinational enterprises could take advantage of
frontier technologies to keep production at home – or to reshore manufacturing that had previously
been moved overseas. This process could slow the shift of traditional industries such as garments,
footwear, and low-tech electronics from China to less-industrialized countries in Asia and Africa. The
feasibility of reshoring does, however, depend on many other factors, including ownership, and the
scale of production, and the country’s position in the supply chain. It may also make more sense
to keep production in developing countries that have growing populations and expanding middle
classes which offer prospects of growing markets.

Job polarization
Job displacement can also be accompanied by job polarization, which refers to an expansion in
high- and low-wage jobs combined with a contraction in middle-wage jobs. In developed countries
there are, for example, now fewer clerks doing routine middle-wage jobs. Thus far, there has been
less impact on the lowest-skill manual jobs, but that seems set to change with greater use of AI and
nimbler robots.
Not all job polarization can be attributed to technological change, much will also have been an
outcome of trade and international competition. In developed countries job polarization has been
associated with a reduction in manufacturing and medium-skill jobs, and an increase in services and
higher-skill jobs, while in middle-income countries there has been an increase in manufacturing and
medium-skill jobs (Figure 7).

The wide differences in the economic structure of low, middle and high-income countries, as well
as the unequal impact of international trade, are expected to also reflect in an uneven impact of
frontier technologies on job polarization in different economies. In this regard, low- and middleincome countries are likely to be less affected.

The gig economy
Frontier technologies are being used to provide services via digital platforms that have spurred the
creation of a ‘gig economy’. Some of this work is locally based, but there is also “cloud work” that can
be performed anywhere via the Internet. While the gig economy provides employment, this is typically
on insecure terms, creating a precarious class of dependent contractors and on-demand workers.
The consequences for inequality will depend on whether the gig workers are poor people who would
otherwise be unemployed, or middle-class people looking for small additional incomes. Inequality will
certainly rise if these jobs replace better-paid ones or replace full-time jobs with part-time ones, or if
profits grow faster than salaries. The gig economy may also heighten gender inequality: women are
less likely to be working on digital platforms, but they often do so for more hours than men and for
significantly lower wages.3
If service occupations are tradable internationally, salaries may converge. This has happened in
computer coding, for example, and in digital design as well as in medical diagnostics, paralegal
assessments, and image recognition.

Market and profit concentration
These new digital platforms benefit from network effects, so that markets tend to concentrate, leaving
a small number of large players. This reduces the incentive to cut prices – producing higher profits
which can widen inequality between wage earners and the owners of capital. And for some IT skills
these companies may be virtually the only employers – a “monopsony”. With few companies there is
also the temptation for tacit collusion as a result of data exchange through algorithms.

AI and global economic inequalities
The impact of AI on inequality between countries will depend to some extent on the type of input
data. If AI primarily uses ‘big data’ generated by users, this would mainly benefit the United States
and China, whose competing digital platforms gather massive amounts of such data. But if it primarily

uses big data gathered by the Internet of things this would benefit other economies with strong
manufacturing bases– such as the EU, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
A third AI scenario involves allowing computers to learn more like humans through repeated
interactions of AI models. This would not particularly benefit the United States or China, but would
still demand resources and capabilities more likely to be found in the developed countries, which
would enable them to pull further ahead of the developing countries.

Widening technological gaps
There is also a fear that the widespread adoption of frontier technologies in developed countries will
reduce the labour-cost competitiveness of today’s less industrialized economies in Asia and Africa,
increase the technological gaps between them and developed countries – make it more difficult to
catch up, diversify their economies, and create jobs. In the past, countries like China, Mexico, Brazil,
and a handful of Asian countries moved up the income ladder by transferring labour and capital from
relatively lower-productivity agriculture to higher productivity manufacturing and services. The fear
now is that frontier technologies and Industry 4.0 will upend these traditional development processes,
making a difficult journey even harder.

Challenges for developing countries
Theories and models point to possible channels of impact, but the actual effect will depend on
the sectors affected, on the capacities of countries, and on the policies and strategies adopted.
However, experience shows that over time new technologies are likely permeate to various sectors of
the economy and social activities. In these circumstances, developing countries should deliberately
adapt and use automation to increase productivity, promote economic diversification and create jobs.
Preparing people, firms and institutions for such changes can limit any negative effects on inequality.
In pursuing these policy objectives, developing countries will need to overcome a number of
challenges.
• Demographic changes – Low-income- and lower-middle-income countries typically have expanding
and younger populations – which will increase the supply of labour and depress wages, reducing
the incentives for automation.
• Lower technological and innovation capabilities – Low-income countries have fewer skilled people
and depend to a large extent on agriculture which tends to be slower to take advantage of new
technologies.
• Slow diversification – Developing countries typically innovate by emulating industrialized countries,
diversifying their economies, and absorbing and adapting new technologies for local use, but this
process is slowest in the poorest countries.
• Weak financing mechanisms – Most developing countries have increased their R&D expenditures,
but these are still relatively low. The African Union, for example, has established a target of one per
cent of GDP, but on average sub-Saharan African countries are still at 0.38 per cent.4 There is very
little private funding of industrial technologies for productive applications.
• Intellectual property rights and technology transfer – Stringent intellectual property protection
will restrict the use of frontier technologies that could be valuable in SDGs related areas such as
agriculture, health and energy.

Accelerating towards industry 4.0
Many national and local governments are working to stimulate the growth of new industries and
services that produce jobs and wealth and promote human development. To be fully effective, they
need to set strategic directions through national plans for research and innovation which can take on
emerging social challenges such as ageing and regional disparities.
TABLE OF
CONTENT

xx
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

National innovation policies also need to align with industrial policies. Keeping national or regional
industry competitive is a central goal in most strategic plans for AI and Industry 4.0 technologies.
These plans can take advantage of UNCTAD’s Framework for Science, Technology, and Innovation
Policy (STIP) Reviews which can lead to specific policies for harnessing frontier technologies for
smarter, more sustainable cities, food security and smart agriculture, and employment generation in
smarter factories.
In many cases this will require access to patented technologies. One option is compulsory licensing,
but there can also be more collaborative agreements, along with patent pooling, clearing houses,
and open-source licensing. At the same time, governments can finance R&D while requiring that the
benefits of this research serve the public good.
Some of the finance for innovations can come from official sources, but alternative models for funding
include impact investment, venture capital, crowdfunding, and Innovation and technology funds.
There have been some successes: in 2018, annual equity funding for tech startups in Africa doubled
to more than $1 billion.
At the same time, policymakers need to anticipate the impacts on the workforce. To take full
advantage of these technologies, workers will need competencies in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) – as well as in design, management and entrepreneurship. Workers who
cannot be trained or retrained, and lose their jobs, should be able to rely on stronger mechanisms
of social protection and workfare as well as on different forms of income redistribution such as
negative income tax, and universal basic income. There is also a renewed importance of labour
unions to defend workers’ rights and the legitimate concerns about their jobs in the digital economy
and increasing automation of tasks.
Finance for such measures could come from “robot tax” which would gather income from the
technologies that replace workers. Or there could be an automation tax, combined with removing
corporate tax deductions for investment. On the other hand, rather than taxing individuals or
technologies, it might be better to tax the resulting wealth.

4.

INNOVATION WITH EQUITY

Frontier technologies have huge potential for improving people’s lives and protecting the planet. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, for example, AI and big data have been used for screening patients, monitoring the
outbreaks, tracking and tracing cases of the disease, predicting its evolution and assessing infection risks.
Other examples have ranged from the use of IoT to monitor the quality of groundwater in Bangladesh, to
the use of drones for delivering medical supplies to remote communities in Rwanda and Ghana.
But technology is rarely a solution on its own. Problems such as poverty, hunger, climate change or
inequalities in health or education are inevitably complex and multidimensional. Technology, frontier or
otherwise, may support initiatives of all kinds, social, political, or environmental, but all technology needs
to be used carefully if it is to help rather than hinder, or produce unintended side effects.
Technologies are likely to have an effect on disparities, but inequalities can also shape technologies –
so that they reflect, reproduce and perhaps amplify systemic bias and discrimination. Currently most
technologies are created by firms in the global North and predominantly by men. They tend to focus on
the demands of the rich, crowding out innovations that might benefit the poor. Technological change
is also shaped by gender inequalities, partly because men have been more likely than women to study
STEM subjects.

Technologies affecting inequalities through access and design
People are affected as consumers of goods and services that apply frontier technologies. One of the
most critical aspects is access – which can be considered to comprise a combination of “five A’s”:
availability, affordability, awareness, accessibility, and ability for effective use. Access to technology

Innovation with equity

can also be restricted by social norms – for women, ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged
groups, even within the same household.
Another important aspect is design. Developers should also be mindful that the ways that they design,
and that people use, technologies can have unintended consequences.

Risks of bias and discrimination
Many concerns are related to the biased design and unintended consequences of AI. Biases within
AI systems can arise in a number of ways, either because they employ biased algorithms, or they
use biased data for training. For example, AI can perpetuate stereotypes and reduce the benefit of
products for women.
The benefits are also likely to be unevenly distributed in the case of gene editing: most of the research
is in richer countries with the prospect of monopoly ownership of technologies, which could limit their
contribution to achieving the SDGs, particularly those related to food production and health. Gene
editing also raises ethical questions of what constitutes an ideal human being. This could result in an
underclass of people who cannot afford genetic treatment.

Challenges for developing countries
Developing countries face three main challenges in promoting equal access to the benefits of frontier
technologies:
• Income poverty – Many people in developing countries cannot afford new goods or services,
particularly those in rural areas. In this case the barriers are not technological but economic and
social.
• Digital divide – Many frontier technologies rely on steady, high-speed fixed Internet connections,
but almost half of the world’s population remains offline. Many developing countries lack adequate
digital infrastructure, and for most of their people Internet costs are prohibitive.
• Shortage of skills – In developing countries, the basic and standard skills are on average 10 to 20
percentage points lower than in developed countries (Figure 8). Many frontier technologies require
at least literacy and numeracy skills. Other technologies require digital skills, including the ability to
understand digital media, to find information, and to use these tools to communicate with others.

Directed to sustainable development
To overcome these challenges, Governments and the international community need to guide new
and emerging technologies so that they support sustainable development and leave no one behind.
From the outset, it will be important to establish ethical frameworks, particularly for the deployment of
AI. Many voluntary initiatives are already aiming to ensure that the processes and outcomes are fair,
transparent, accountable, and inclusive. Similarly, for human germline gene editing there needs to be
a broad consensus on ethical and societal issues.

Governments should also try to foster supportive innovation ecosystems, based on assessments that
analyse different techno-system paths and their impacts on inclusive and sustainable development.
An example of international cooperation which assists with that task is UNCTAD’s programme on STI
Policy Reviews.
The chosen technologies then need to be deployed at scale, with plans to pass the baton from scientists
and engineers to entrepreneurs and others, and to boost household incomes. The technologies can
also be embedded in services provided by the public sector, with special attention for underserved
areas that are not commercially viable for private companies. Networks of activists, academics, and
practitioners can experiment with alternative possibilities – based on local knowledge and driven by
environmental and social needs.

PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE

Technological progress is essential for sustainable development, but can also perpetuate inequalities or
create new ones, either by limiting access to more privileged groups and affluent countries, or through
built-in biases or unintended consequences. The task for governments is thus to maximise the potential
benefits, while mitigating harmful outcomes, and ensuring universal access. Countries at all stages
of development should promote the use, adoption and adaptation of frontier technologies, preparing
people and firms for what lies ahead. An important requirement is effective national governance: the
state needs to create the vision, the mission and the plan for creating and shaping the market for
inclusive and sustainable innovations.
Governments will also need to invest in human and physical resources. To help them do so, developing
countries should be able to rely on international cooperation, communities of nations working together to build
an international institutional framework that embraces countries at all stages of technological development.
These official policies and programmes will need to be supported by vigorous social activism, with
people and organizations cooperating to identify mismatches between technological innovation and
societal responses. Keeping the SDGs as central guiding principles will require constant vigilance from
civil society organizations.
For reducing inequalities, governments can draw from a broad range of instruments including regulatory
measures and economic and fiscal instruments, as well as smarter policies on trade, investment,
industry, education and innovation. They can also ensure that vulnerable and low-income groups
have access to valuable new goods and services some of which can be subsidized or provided free.

Twin technology targets
To catch up and forge ahead, developing countries will need to adopt frontier technologies while continuing
to diversify their production bases by mastering existing technologies. They need to keep to both targets
in sight. This will mean strengthening innovation systems, while aligning STI and industrial policies, building
basic digital skills, and closing gaps in ICT infrastructure.
• Strengthen national innovation systems – Governments should engage a wide range of actors who can
help build synergies between STI and other economic policies – industrial, trade, fiscal, and monetary,
as well as educational policies.
• Align STI and industrial policy – Together these should attract firms into the core sectors of frontier
technology development and deployment. This would enable traditional production sectors to benefit
from multiple channels of diffusion, covering foreign direct investment, trade, and intellectual property
rights, patents and the exchange of knowledge and know-how.
• Develop digital skills – Education and training programmes should be inclusive and specifically involve
women.
• Focus on the furthest behind – Countrywide access to electricity and to ICT should aim to bridge gender
and generational gaps. Through inclusive National Digital Agendas countries can focus on the furthest
behind, leveraging ICT infrastructure and improved Internet access through fixed or mobile broadband.

Mitigating risks
There is always the risk that rapid technological change will cause harm or perpetuate or accentuate
inequalities. This should prompt public responses to:
• Strengthen social protection – During labour market disruptions workers should be able to rely on
robust systems of social protection. Options include universal basic income schemes which might
be financed by taxing capital, robots or other technologies.
• Ease workforce transitions – In addition to encouraging training and re-training through the public
and the private sectors, government agencies may also support workers with personal counselling
and improved job matching, and placement services. The youngest workers can benefit from
apprenticeship programmes.
• Anticipate the future –This will require ‘technological foresight and assessments’ – eliciting
knowledge from a variety of actors about the industrial growth areas that match a country’s
strengths to commercial opportunities.

Priorities for international cooperation
Developing countries should also be able to rely on technical and financial support through international
cooperation and official development assistance (ODA). In particular this will be needed to:
• Build stronger national capacities in STI – This will mean increasing the relatively small amounts of
ODA directed to STI in the least developed and low-income developing countries.
• Smooth technology transfer – The international community can facilitate technology transfer
for locally relevant products and services. This may involve liberalizing access to trade and to
technologies covered by intellectual property rights.
• Increase women’s participation – If women are to play their full part in frontier technologies,
governments and international organizations will need to encourage girls and women to study
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.
• Improve foresight and technological assessment – The international community can support
strategic ‘foresight and technological assessment’ initiatives to better understand the socioeconomic and environmental implications of new and innovative technologies.
• Promote inclusive debate – Developing countries, especially the least developed countries, need
to be part of international debates on how new technologies affect citizens’ rights, privacy, data
ownership and online security – and especially on how they can promote the SDGs. Developing
country concerns need to be reflected in normative frameworks and regulatory regimes – balancing
individual and collective rights, while encouraging private sector innovation.

Catching the wave
Developing countries, particularly low-income countries, cannot afford to miss this new wave of
technological change. Each country will need STI policies appropriate to its stage of development.
For some this will mean promoting frontier technologies, while renewing efforts to take full advantage
of existing technologies to diversify their economies and upgrade traditional sectors. Others can
engage more deeply with the development and adaptation of frontier technologies. But all developing
countries need to prepare people and firms for a period of rapid change. Success in the twenty-first
century will require a balanced approach – building a robust industrial base and promoting frontier
technologies that can help deliver the 2030 Agenda and its global vision of people-centred, inclusive,
and sustainable societies.

CATCHING
TECHNOLOGICAL
WAVES

CHAPTER I
Catching technological waves

Human development over the past two decades has been accompanied by rapid changes in
technology and an increasing proliferation of digitized devices and services. In many respects these
have been beneficial. Innovation has driven economic development – and the pace of change seems
likely to accelerate as a result of digitalization and advances in “frontier technologies” such as artificial
intelligence (AI), robotics, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, all of which could help countries
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
New technologies have also proved critical in combating COVID-19. Biotechnology, for example, has
been used to identify the virus and test for infection. And through broadband technologies and social
media people have been able to connect while in physical isolation – facilitating business continuity
and children’s education, as well as good mental health.1
But new technologies can also have serious downsides. Rapid technological change threatens to
outpace the ability of societies to adapt. There are fears that jobs are disappearing as more economic
activity is automated and that social media are exacerbating divisions, anxiety, and doubt. Overall,
there are concerns that frontier technologies will further widen inequalities, or create new ones.2
Most of the discussion has focused on developed countries, but these technologies also affect
developing countries. Here too there are concerns – about widening inequalities within and between
countries. Are these justified? In some measure, yes. The great divides between countries that we see
today started after the first industrial revolution, and we live at the beginning of a new technological
revolution.3 Before the industrial revolution, most people were equally poor and the gaps in per capita
income between countries were much smaller.4 But with the industrial revolution and subsequent
waves of technological change, a group of countries pulled ahead, with rapid and sustained economic
growth that enabled more of their people to escape poverty (Figure I1). Western Europe and its
offshoots – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States – along with Japan formed the
core of the global economy. Most other countries remained on the periphery with fickle or minimal
levels of growth and correspondingly low incomes.5

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

Every spurt of progress was associated with sharper inequality between countries – with widening
disparities in access to products, social services and public goods – from education to health, from
ICT infrastructure to electrification. Nevertheless a few countries, notably in East Asia, were able to
catch up through technological learning, imitation and innovation.
How will the latest frontier technologies affect inequalities for developing countries? How can
governments minimize risks and maximize opportunities? And how can international cooperation
help? This report seeks to answer these questions. It argues that developing countries can catch these
new waves of technological change and ride them to diversify their economies, promote structural
transformation and achieve sustainable development. This will require different strategies at different
stages of development. More technologically advanced countries can guide these technologies
towards positive goals, while other countries can selectively adopt and adapt those that best meet
their needs. But all countries should be using these technological advances to help tackle poverty,
reduce inequality and protect the planet.
Governments can shape the policy environment and build domestic productive and innovation
capacities so as to minimize the risks and maximize the benefits – achieving innovation with equity.
This will require a balanced approach, protecting people while ensuring that these new technologies
are used to build robust and sustainable productive capacities. At the same time, civil society
organizations should be pressing for more equal and sustainable futures. All this activity can be
supported by stronger international cooperation. The report was prepared in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic whose long-term implications are not yet clear. Nevertheless, the deep structural factors it
addresses will apply both in normal times and in times of crisis.
Chapter I – Catching technological waves – Summarizes the current state of global inequalities –
indicating both their extent and their drivers.
Chapter II – Forging ahead at the digital frontiers – Looks at the rapid proliferation of frontier
technologies, and introduces a readiness index which shows which countries are best prepared to
use, adopt and adapt these technologies.
Chapter III – Humans and machines at work – Shows how frontier technologies could transform
economies and workplaces, affecting jobs, wages and profits. It also indicates national strategies for
taking advantage of these technologies, promoting their use, adoption and adaptation to diversify
and transform the structure of their economies and generate higher and sustainable incomes.
Chapter IV – Innovation with equity – Assesses the impact of frontier technologies on users. In
particular, it looks at how the poor may be disadvantaged, either by lack of access, biased design
or unintended consequences. Governments will need to improve access to digital infrastructure,
develop the necessary skills and scale up innovations that target the poor.
Chapter V – Preparing for the future – Argues that countries at all stages of development should
promote the use, adoption or adaption of frontier technologies. The impetus needs to come not
just from national governments and civil society but also from the international community. Together
they can foster a global ecosystem that encourages innovation while protecting the vulnerable and
ensuring access for all.
The conceptual framework used in this report to link technologies and inequalities is presented in
Annex A. Conceptual framework.

A.

PROSPERITY AMIDST POVERTY

During recent decades of digitization, the world has seen growing prosperity. People on average are
living longer and healthier lives, getting more education and better access to clean water, sanitation
and electricity. Incomes too have been rising. Rapid economic growth in emerging economies has
fuelled the rise of a global middle class.
TABLE OF

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER I
Catching technological waves

At the same time there is persistent poverty; these advances have been accompanied by rising
inequality.6 Wealth is highly concentrated: the richest 1 per cent of the global population own more
than the poorest 90 per cent.7 There are also wide disparities in income earning opportunities as well
as in standards of education and health – which vary according to gender, urban or rural location, and
country of birth. Although inequality between countries has fallen recently, it remains high, and most
countries have seen a rise in income inequality.8 There are also urgent issues of racial justice: in many
cities across the globe people have taken part in widespread protests against systemic racism and
the corrosive divisions that it perpetuates.9
These disparities have come into sharp relief as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. At greatest risk are the poorest. People living in crowded slums
with poor sanitation, or in refugee camps, find it hard or impossible to practice
social distancing – and those with pre-existing health conditions are more
vulnerable, along with the elderly. Millions of the working poor employed in
small and middle-sized enterprises or in the informal sector have no savings
with which to weather the crisis. The pandemic has also hit children’s education
and nutrition. Some can log into remote learning systems, but many lack basic
Internet connections or devices. And while better-off children can get good
meals at home, the poorer children may miss out on nutritious school lunches.

The lower-income and least developed countries find it more difficult to support
people and businesses through the crisis. They have fewer resources, lower technological capabilities
and less productive industries and agricultural sectors. They also lack the foreign exchange needed to
import essential goods such as personal protective equipment.10
High levels of inequality not only undermine human development and reduce resilience in the current
crisis, they also heighten vulnerability to climate change, constrain economic growth and human
development, and can destabilize societies.

B.

MULTIFACETED INEQUALITIES

Inequality as covered in this report is a multifaceted concept. In the context of development, it relates to
differences in outcomes and opportunities across individuals, groups or countries. These differences can
be connected to any dimension of development – social, economic or environmental – and they have
been receiving increasing international attention. For example, a core principle of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development is to reduce inequalities “leaving no one behind.”
These inequalities may have arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the individual – ethnicity,
for example, country of birth, family structure or gender. They can also arise from factors that are intrinsic
to the individual such as talent and effort. However, a more significant contribution to the disparities is
inequalities in opportunities – in access to education, for example, or health services or to the goods and
services that people need to be able to make best use of their talents and efforts.11 Inequality of outcomes
and opportunities are closely intertwined. The outcome for one generation affects the opportunities for the
next – resulting in intergenerational transmission of inequalities.
Inequalities can be measured in terms of outcome indicators such as incomes, health standards or
educational attainment – looking at gaps between countries and between individuals and groups, based
on gender, age group, ethnicity or religion.12 Figure I2 illustrates the inequalities between country groups
across several development dimensions. Despite considerable progress, there are still wide inter-country
disparities. In upper-middle-income and high-income countries, the average share of the population living
in extreme poverty is only 2 per cent, but in lower-middle-income countries it is 14 per cent and in lowincome countries 45 per cent. Similar disparities are seen in child mortality rates and in the prevalence of
underweight children as well as in education, particularly at higher levels: in 2018, in low-income countries
only 41 per cent of the population in the relevant age group were enrolled in secondary education –
compared with 90 per cent in upper-middle-income and high-income countries.

Progress has been faster for access to essential services such as clean water and electricity, but slower
when it comes to access to basic sanitation and there are still wide disparities between low-income and
other country groups. In low- and lower-middle-income countries, only 63 per cent of the population have
access to basic sanitation, compared with 86 per cent in upper-middle-income countries, and universal
access in high-income countries.
The low- and lower-middle-income countries also tend to have wider internal inequalities. This is illustrated
in Figure I3 for selected SDG indicators. In 2018 in low-income countries, only 33 per cent of the rural
population had access to electricity, compared with 70 per cent in urban areas. This gap was much narrower
in lower-middle-income countries – rural 81 per cent and urban 96 per cent – and basically non-existent in
upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Low-income countries also had more pronounced gender
disparities in literacy rates, in the extent of vulnerable employment and in mortality-rates.

Existing inequalities also have severe effects on the capacity of people to weather shocks (Box I1).

Box I 1

Inequalities and resilience in times of COVID-19
COVID-19 has accelerated some global trends, such as digitalization, while decelerating others, including
greenhouse gas emissions. The pandemic has led to abrupt changes in work practices, and in educational
methods and health arrangements. In so doing it has further widened many inequalities.
Even within the most developed countries the pandemic has increased poverty and reduced access to food.13
During lockdowns, much of the burden has fallen on women, who are also 70 per cent of the front-line workers.
At the same time, there has been an increase in domestic violence and child abuse.
As schools closed, much education moved online. Some students started working online early on in the crisis,
while others had no access to online platforms – particularly students in less advantaged areas within developed
nations.
Work has also been moving online. During the lockdown in the EU more than one-third of the labour force was
teleworking. But not everyone could do so; lower skilled workers employed in “high-touch” jobs such as food
retail or transport had to show up for work, exposing them to COVID-19. These jobs were usually less well paid,

less secure and offered less access to healthcare. In most cases, the poorer the country, the harder it is to
telework.
During the pandemic, there have been some benefits from frontier technologies. For testing, for example,
machines are not only able to analyse lab results and work 20+ hours and perform over 600 tests a day, but they
also help professionals with social distancing.
How can the international community best respond, and transform the COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity? The
key is building resilience. This is understood at the country level as the capacity to recover and rebuild.14 This
notion should now be further expanded to transform societies in a sustainable, fair, and democratic manner.15 In
other words, resilience should enable a nation to bounce forward, to come out stronger and better prepared for
future shocks.
There have been some attempts to measure national resilience to external shocks. For example, in a forthcoming
study the European Union assessed countries on their ability to bounce back, on financial coping and life
attitudes.16 It found that the people most resilient were those in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Luxemburg and the
Netherlands.
Resilience originates in people, in their internal strengths, and in their safety nets, jobs, savings and well-being.
It also relies on well-functioning financial systems, digital infrastructure, social protection, and health systems
as well as on trust in governments. Governments act as the ultimate absorbers of risks and will need to build
resilience to prepare for future shocks.

WIDE INCOME GAPS

Many of the equalities illustrated also correlate with levels of income.17 Indeed income inequality can
serve as a proxy for other forms of disparity, though it should be noted that even countries with the
same levels of income can have very different development outcomes – with much depending on
public policies.18
Income inequality is usually measured using the Gini coefficient, which runs from zero to 1, where zero
represents complete equality, and 1 which means one person owns everything. In more egalitarian
societies such as those in Scandinavia, the Gini is 0.2 to 0.3. More unequal countries such as the
United States have Ginis around 0.4. In some Latin American and Asian countries, the level is around
0.5. But the highest levels are in Namibia (0.59), South Africa (0.63) and Zambia (0.57).19
Inequalities within countries erode their economies, social fabrics, and natural environments.20
• Economy – Highly unequal countries tend to have lower growth rates. People at the bottom of the
distribution scale are unable to acquire the skills and assets required to contribute to the economy,
thus reducing growth.21 22
• Opportunities – Higher inequality tends to be transmitted from one generation to the next.
• Poverty – Inequality also hinders poverty reduction. High initial levels of inequality reduce the effect
of economic growth on poverty reduction, while increasing inequality increases poverty for any rate
of growth.23
• Political control – More unequal societies also run higher risks of political capture by the rich. They
may then reduce their taxes and their support for public goods and services, including education
and health, that are mainly directed to the poorer segments of the society, thus reinforcing and
perpetuating inequalities.
• Polarization – Many consider inequality to be an important driver of the recent political polarization in
many developed and developing countries.24 It can reduce trust in democratic institutions.25
• Environment – There can also be environmental impacts, since unequal societies tend to show
lower support for environmental protection. At the same time, disadvantaged groups are more
affected by environmental threats, including the effects of climate change.

CHAPTER I
Catching technological waves

The term global inequality refers to inequality among all world citizens including the richest people in
rich countries and the poorest people in poor countries, so is understandably higher at around 0.7.26
Nevertheless, for the first time since the onset of the industrial revolution, over the past 10 to 15
years, global inequality has decreased.
This is because some large developing countries have grown faster and have been catching up with
the developed countries. Most are in Asia, notably China, along with India, Indonesia and Viet Nam.
To some extent these countries have followed the same trajectory of industrialization and structural
transformation as the richer countries. But they have had to do so in different circumstances in a
changing world economy that is more reliant on trade, investment, and technological learning. To
be able to compete in the 2000s they had to find their own path. Their advances also had benefits
for other developing countries in Africa and Latin America by increasing the demand for primary
resources. As a result, the middle of the global income distribution has become more populated,
while more people in relatively poorer countries have become less poor.27
However, in Africa, this trend to lower inequality is being countered by demographic change. Previously,
most African countries were among the poorest, but they had smaller populations so made a lower
contribution to global inequality. But populations in African countries are now growing faster than
those in other regions. The number of people in extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa has increased
in recent years and is now higher than the number of poor in all other regions combined.28 If countries
of the region are unable to catch up in terms of income the result will be greater global inequality –
with a widening gap between African countries and those in North America, Europe and Asia.

OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS
INCOME INEQUALITY HAS INCREASED
IN MANY COUNTRIES
In the longer-term the reduction in global inequality could also be derailed by climate change. Countries
that rely on a few primary products may experience new weather patterns that reduce agricultural
production and food security. Poorer countries and low-income groups in middle-income countries
are also vulnerable to weather disasters – whose frequency and intensity could be increased by
climate change. They are also exposed to health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
Achievements in global equality are also threatened by rising disparities within countries. Over the
past 40 years income inequality has increased, not only in the United States and Europe, but also in
developing countries such as China and India. In China, for example, between 1980 and 2015 the
top 1 per cent increased their share of pre-tax national income from 6.5 to 14 per cent while over the
same period, the bottom 50 per cent experienced a fall in its share from 27 to 15 per cent (Figure I4).
In India, the increase in disparity was greater; the top 1 per cent increased its share from 7 to 21 per
cent, while the bottom 50 per cent reduced its share from 23 to 15 per cent.
Thus, while disparities between countries have been falling, those within countries are widening. What
is the net effect for global inequality? To answer that question, we must consider the contribution of
inequality between and within countries to global inequality. Estimates suggest that the contribution
of between-country inequality is enormous; between 1820 and 2002 it has rose from 28 to 85 per
cent (Figure I5). In other words, in 1820, global income inequality was driven by class divides within
countries, while now it is driven by the lottery of country birthplace.

This has given rise to the concept of the `citizen premium’ for being born in a rich country. Estimates
suggest that just by being born in the United States instead of Congo, an individual will multiply his or
her income 93 times. Those born in poor countries thus suffer a ‘citizen penalty’. Moreover, the gap
between developed and developing countries is even larger for the very poor.29

Inequality between countries may have been falling in relative terms, but in absolute terms it has
never been higher and continues to increase. For example, in 1970, the average GDP per capita
in developed countries was $18,670, compared with $1,242 in developing economies (Figure I6),
resulting in a gap in absolute terms of $17,428. By 2018, this gap had reached $40,749. It is true that
in percentage terms, the increase was greater in developing countries than in developed countries.
However, the widening absolute gap means that in the global economy there is now much more
inequality in the access to goods and services.
This citizen penalty can lead to discontent and add to migration pressures. People feel that no matter
how hard they try they cannot increase their general standard of living in a country that is growing
slowly – and that the only way to close the income gap is to move to a country with a higher average
income.
In summary, between-country inequality is the most significant contributor to global inequality,
and in absolute terms, the gap between developed and developing countries has increased. For
policymakers in developing and developed countries, this is a critical trend that has to be reversed.

DRIVERS OF INCOME INEQUALITY

What is causing these changes in inequalities? There is no consensus about how the dynamics of
economic inequality should be interpreted. One influence is the structure of economies, along with
levels of industrialization. In the mid-1950s, the economist Simon Kuznets, introduced the inverted
U-curve hypothesis which suggested that under capitalist development income inequality would first
rise with industrialization, then begin to decline as more workers joined the high-productivity sectors
of the economy. However, others have argued that the natural state of capitalism is ever-increasing
inequality, and that Kuznets misinterpreted the temporary reduction in inequality after the Second
World War.30
Wars and epidemics have always tended to equalize, by pushing down the top of the income and
wealth distribution.31 Wars destroy the assets of the rich and reduce their incomes by higher taxation.
At the same time wars kill a large share of the population, which reduces the labour supply tending
to push up wages. Europe’s reconstruction after the Second World War, for example, ushered in a
long period of equitable growth – in probably unique and unrepeatable circumstances. Since then,
growth has been slower resulting in an increase in the capital-to-income ratio. Epidemics, such as the
Spanish flu or the recent outbreak of COVID-19, kill many people, reducing the supply of labour while
pushing up the wages for the surviving population, keeping physical capital intact, which reduces the
return to capital.
Globalization and technological change can widen income inequalities within countries, but in lowincome countries they can also help reduce poverty. They have done so not only in larger countries
such as China and India, but also in other countries, including many in Africa.32 In fact, from the onset
of the industrial revolution, technology and trade helped people escape from poverty in Western
Europe, the United States and other countries at the core of the global economy. The subsequent
divide between developed and developing countries was the result of uneven relations of trade,
investment and technological learning.33 Whether globalization or technological change facilitate or
hinder catch up between countries will depend to a large extent on the policies in place.
Inequality is also affected by more dramatic technological changes which combine with financial
capital to create new ‘techno-economic paradigms’ – the cluster of technologies, products,
industries, infrastructure and institutions that characterize a technological revolution. In the countries
at the centre of a technological revolution this surge can be considered in two stages, both of which
affect inequalities. 34 The first is the installation period as core industries explore potential solutions
with the new technologies. This can result in increasing income inequality between the workers in the
TABLE OF
CONTENT

11
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

core industries of the new paradigm and the rest. In particular, the financial sector fuels “irrational”
expectations of profits in new technology sectors which can decouple from the real economy in the
search for increasingly higher gains. The final part of the installation period could thus be marked by
stark inequalities.
The second phase is deployment. During this period more people participate in the growth of the
economy. Nevertheless, the gains are not spread equally and towards the end of the deployment
phase, there can therefore be rising discontent. Not everyone gets immediate access to the benefits
of technological progress such as a life-saving treatment, or access to clean water, or specific
knowledge, or to the wealth that is created by the development and production of new technologies.35
At this point there are also likely to be mergers and takeovers which serve to concentrate power in
few firms in the core of the paradigm, giving rise to great fortunes in the hands of a few.
The world is reaching the end of the deployment phase of the “Age of ICT” and starting the installation
phase of a new paradigm sometimes called “Industry 4.0” (Figure I7). The age of ICT offered widespread
progress but many of these promises were broken and the unequal outcomes have led to rising social and
political discontent – which is further fuelled by the enormous concentration of wealth in the ownership of
the major digital platforms. The new technologies of Industry 4.0 may also eventually widen disparities.
For example, those with higher incomes tend to be the first to adopt new technologies, and this differential
access creates new opportunities in areas such as education, health and employment for those already
possessing an advantage, further increasing disparities within and between societies. However, this has
yet to happen since the new paradigm is still in its early stages.
How will these new techno-economic paradigms affect inequalities in developing countries – and inequalities
between countries? For these critical questions, the techno-economic revolutions’ framework is less
informative. Much will depend on whether countries are catching up, forging ahead, or falling behind – which
in their turn depends on their national policies and on their involvement in international trade.

REDUCING INEQUALITY

Within-country inequality is tackled primarily with national policies. Governments can intervene with
progressive taxation on incomes and higher taxation of inheritance and wealth, or on income from capital.
They can also make services such as education freely available to all which reduces the inequality of

opportunities. Governments can also make social
transfers, such as unemployment benefits, which
reduce the risk of people falling into poverty.36
Government action can also be complemented
by that of labour unions. Stronger unions help to
increase wages in comparison to profits.

The effect of taxation and transfers is illustrated
comparing the Gini coefficient of market income
(before taxes and transfers) with that of disposable
income (after taxes and transfers) (Figure I8). For
all countries, the Gini is less for disposable income
but there are stark contrasts between countries.
For example, the United States and Germany have
about the same Gini coefficient before taxes and
transfers – around 0.5. But policy in Germany is
more progressive and redistributive, so inequality
after taxes and transfers is almost 10 points lower
than in the United States.37
Reducing income inequality between countries
will mean harnessing technology and trade for
structural transformation. During the industrial
revolution, technology and trade helped drive
the escape from poverty of Western Europe, the
United States and other countries. Nowadays
technology and trade have helped reduce poverty
in low-income countries, not just the large ones
like China and India, but also others in Africa. But
technological change and globalization can also
widen inequalities between countries, depending
on the policies in place.
Against this backdrop, people either try to
improve their circumstances where they are living
or move to somewhere more prosperous. With
the Internet people are much more aware of the
differences in living standards between countries
and may be enticed to migrate in the pursuit of a
better life.

If workers are to find better-paid jobs at home,
then developing countries will have to catch up
through structural transformation and faster
growth. To do so, and benefit from the new
paradigm they can use frontier technologies. The
next chapter assesses the current state of these
technologies and how ready countries are to take
advantage of them.

CHAPTER II
Forging ahead at the digital frontiers

There is no single definition of frontier technologies, but they are generally understood to be new
and rapidly developing technologies that take advantage of digitalization and connectivity. These
technologies can have dramatic impacts on economies and societies as well as on the development
of other technologies.1 This report covers 11 such technologies: artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet
of things (IoT), big data, blockchain, 5G, 3D printing, robotics, drones, gene editing, nanotechnology
and solar photovoltaic (Solar PV) (Table II 1). Most of these technologies have emerged in a period of
dramatic falls in the prices of data storage and solar energy.2
Frontier technologies can increase productivity and improve livelihoods.3 AI, for example, combined
with robotics can transform production and business. 3D printing allows faster and cheaper
low-volume production and rapid iterative prototyping of new products. Using these and other
innovations, enterprises in developing countries can leapfrog previous paradigms and move ahead
rapidly.4 Despite low resources and capabilities, many firms and farms are already doing so. In Nigeria,
for example, IoT is being used to generate advice on farming techniques. And in Colombia 3D printers
are being used to create fashion items such as caps, bracelets, and dresses.5 6

Table II 1

Frontier technologies covered in this report
Technology

Description

Artificial
intelligence (AI)

AI is normally defined as the capability of a machine to engage in cognitive activities typically performed
by the human brain. AI implementations that focus on narrow tasks are widely available today, used for
example, in recommending what to buy next online, for virtual assistants in smartphones, and for spotting
spam or detecting credit card fraud. New implementations of AI are based on machine learning and
harness big data.

Internet of Things
(IoT)

IoT refers to myriad Internet-enabled physical devices that are collecting and sharing data. There is a vast
number of potential applications. Typical fields include wearable devices, smart homes, healthcare, smart
cities and industrial automation.

Big data

Big data refers to datasets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional database structures to
capture, manage and process. Computers can thus tap into data that has traditionally been inaccessible
or unusable.

Blockchain

A blockchain refers to an immutable time-stamped series of data records supervised by a cluster of
computers not owned by any single entity. Blockchain serves as the base technology for cryptocurrencies,
enabling peer-to-peer transactions that are open, secure and fast.

5G

5G networks are the next generation of mobile internet connectivity, offering download speeds of around
1-10 Gbps (4G is around 100 Mbps) as well as more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices.

3D printing

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, produces three-dimensional objects based on a digital
file. 3D printing can create complex objects using less material than traditional manufacturing.

Robotics

Robots are programmable machines that can carry out actions and interact with the environment via sensors
and actuators either autonomously or semi-autonomously. They can take many forms: disaster response
robots, consumer robots, industrial robots, military/security robots and autonomous vehicles.

Drones

A drone, also known as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), is a flying
robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software with sensors and GPS. Drones
have been often used for military purposes, but they also have civilian uses such as in videography,
agriculture and in delivery services.

Gene editing

Gene editing, also known as genome editing, is a genetic engineering tool to insert, delete or modify the
genome in organisms. Potential applications include drought-tolerant crops or new antibiotics.

Nanotechnology

Nanotechnology is a field of applied science and technology dealing with the manufacturing of objects in
scales smaller than 1 micrometre. Nanotechnology is used to produce a wide range of useful products
such as pharmaceuticals, commercial polymers and protective coatings. It can also be used to design of
computer chip layouts.

Solar photovoltaic
(Solar PV)

Solar photovoltaic (Solar PV) technology transforms sunlight into direct current electricity using
semiconductors within PV cells. In addition to being a renewable energy technology, solar PV can be used
in off-grid energy systems, potentially reducing electricity costs and increasing access.

A number of studies have analysed the effects of these technologies separately, or in smaller groups
(e.g. AI, big data, and IoT), or on different dimensions of inequality.7 8 This report aims for a broader
appreciation of the impact of frontier technologies on inequalities so has assessed them as a larger
group. Such a synthesis can create new knowledge, help generalize the findings of separate studies
and guide evidence-informed decision making.9

A.

RAPID GROWTH OF FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES

According to some estimates, frontier technologies already represent a $350-billion market, and one
that by 2025 could grow to over $3.2 trillion (Figure II 1). To put this into perspective, the current global
market for laptops is $102 billion and for smartphones is $522 billion. Some estimates for frontier
technologies may be over-hyped, and there may also be considerable double counting, for example
in IoT which is also based on AI and big data, but market analysts clearly have high expectations.
Among the frontier technologies, the largest by market revenue is IoT. In 2018, sales
totalled $130 billion,10 and in the next five years could grow to $1.5 trillion – which is around half
of frontier technology revenues.11 This is because IoT covers such a vast range of devices: in 2017
there were already more IoT devices in use than people on earth – 8.4 billion. Another area of future
expansion is the industrial internet of things (IIoT) which uses multiple interconnected devices for
various forms of manufacturing, for the Airbus and Boeing factories of the future, for example, or
Amazon’s warehousing, or for agriculture for self-driving tractors.12
The market for robotics is also set to expand rapidly, from $32 billion in 2018 to $499 billion
in 2025.13 On the supply side, this growth is driven mainly by continued technical improvements and

the development of AI-enabled self-programming robots.14 On the demand side, growth will come
from the use of robots in large-scale manufacturing, packaging, and the automobile industry. But
even some small and medium-scale enterprises that are facing higher labour costs or cannot recruit
enough skilled workers are adopting industrial robots.15
Another expanding market is for solar PV. In 2018 market revenues were $55 billion and by 2026
may reach $334 billion.16 This is driven by increasing energy demand, favourable government
regulation and a shift towards sustainable consumption which has encouraged the use of renewable
energy.17 As indicated in Figure II 1, there will probably be a similar rapid growth in other frontier
technologies.18
Rapid market growth will also create more frontier-technology-related jobs:
• AI – Between June 2015 and June 2018, job offers for AI-related posts on a worldwide employment
search engine increased by nearly 100 per cent.19 The greatest increase was for software engineers
and data scientists. A study in 2019 found that China had the most AI professionals, with 12,113 jobs,
followed by the United States at 7,465 and Japan at 3,369.20
• Blockchain – Between 2017 and 2018 the demand for blockchain engineers in the United States
grew by 400 per cent.21 The average income of a blockchain engineer reached $150,000-$175,000
per year.22 Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft are all recruiting talent in this field.23
• Drones – Between 2013 and 2025 the United States is expected to add more than 100,000
drone-related jobs.24 The top three drone job locations are the United States, China and France.25
• 5G – By 2035, the global 5G value chain is expected to support 22 million jobs. This includes
employment in network operators, core technology and components providers, OEM device
manufacturers, infrastructure equipment manufacturers and content and application developers.
China may have the most 5G-related jobs (9.5 million) followed by the United States (3.4 million)
and Japan (2.1 million).26
• 3D printing – The market is growing rapidly, stimulating the demand for skilled professionals,
including engineers, software developers, material scientists and a wide range of business support
functions including sales and marketing.27
• Gene editing – Labour demand in gene editing is also expected to soar. Between 2017 and 2030,
the United Kingdom may add 18,000 new jobs.28 Between 2016 and 2026, the United States could
add 17,600 jobs including medical scientists and biomedical engineers.29
• IoT – By 2017 the global IoT industry had grown to 2,888 companies employing around
342,000 people.30 The largest number of IoT-related jobs were in IBM (4,420), Intel Corporation
(3,044), Microsoft (2,806), Cisco (2,703) and Ericsson (1,665).31
• Big data – As more industries have started to adopt big data there has been a significant shortage
of data scientists. In the United States, as of 2018, there was a shortage of 151,717 people with
a data science background, especially in New York City (34,032), the San Francisco Bay Area
(31,798) and Los Angeles (12,251).32
• Robotics – Robotics careers include robotics engineers, software developers, technicians, sales
engineers and operators.33 In 2016, the United States had 132,500 robotics engineers, and
between 2016 and 2026 the robotics engineer job market was expected to grow by 6.4 per
cent.34
• Nanotechnology – The job market in the United States is set to grow by 6 per cent per year
between 2016 and 2026.35 The expected salaries range between $35,000 and $50,000 for
graduates with associated degrees to $75,000-$100,000 for those with doctoral degrees.36
• Solar PV – Jobs are set to grow at a rapid pace, but as yet there is little evidence of a solar hiring
boom. The recent political and industry turbulence on solar energy has slowed growth.37

Notes: The finance sector is shown in blue, the manufacturing sector in orange and others in grey.

The finance and manufacturing sectors were early adopters of AI, IoT, big data and blockchain (Table II 2).
Finance companies have used these technologies, for example, for credit decisions, risk management,
fraud prevention, trading, personalized banking and process automation.38 The manufacturing sector has
used these technologies for predictive maintenance, quality control and human-robot combined working
activities.39
Major providers of frontier technology are shown in Table II 3. Many are from the United States, probably
because the United States is home to major cloud computing platforms. For AI, IoT, big data, blockchain
and other activities these platforms offer a wide range of one-stop services on a pay-as-you-go basis.
This concentration on large platforms is likely to continue. Users prefer not to build their own systems
from scratch, and because of existing network effects new competitors struggle to catch up.40 Chinese
companies are very active in 5G, drones and solar PV.41
The development of frontier technologies has generated a large number of publications and patents
(Figure II 2 and Figure II 3). The two major players are the United States and China, together holding a 30
to 70 per cent share in each technological field (Figure II 4 and Figure II 5). The United States is especially
active in robotics, gene editing and blockchain while China is active in IoT, big data and solar PV.42

B.

A FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES READINESS INDEX

Only a few countries currently produce frontier technologies and in the short run this is unlikely to change.
But all countries need to prepare for them. To assess progress this report has developed a country readiness
index. This takes into account technological capacities related to physical investment, human capital and
technological effort, and covers national capacities to use, adopt and adapt these technologies:43
Use – This requires basic capacities, passive skills and effort along with infrastructure, and some
technological knowledge. This might involve, for example, following AI-driven recommendation
from an e-commerce website, or using a chatbot.
Adopt – Active use for one’s own purposes requires more advanced capability levels. This
could mean using AI to produce recommendations or run a chatbot for a business website.
Adapt – Modifying the technologies requires further advanced capabilities – such as for tailoring
AI-driven recommendations or localizing the features of a chatbot.

Based on this index, the countries best prepared are the United States, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom (Table II 5). Other than the United States, Singapore and the Republic of Korea, most of the
leading countries are from Europe. The list also has high rankings for some transition and developing
economies – such as China ranked at 25 and the Russian Federation at 27.

Not surprisingly, the countries most ready for frontier technologies are also those most likely to use
them. This is clear in the case of solar PV where there is a strong correlation between the readiness
index and solar PV electricity capacity (Figure II 9). Similarly, it is possible to correlate the index with
the import of industrial robots and of nanomaterials, but most of the other technologies are difficult to
isolate since they can be embedded in such a diverse range of products.

Index Score

The index rankings might also be expected to correlate with those for per capita income, and generally
they do (Figure II 10). This could be explained in two ways: countries with higher per capita incomes
are more likely to have higher figures for ICT deployment, skills, R&D activity, industry activity and
access to finance – because they have more resources and capacities to make investments and
implement policies. On the other hand, high performance in these areas will itself boost productivity
and per capita incomes. However, it should be noted that per capita income is only one factor
associated with the readiness index, others

But there are clearly many outliers – countries
that perform better than their per capita GDPs
would suggest. The extent of “overperformance”,
measured as the difference between the actual index
rankings and the estimated index rankings based
on per capita income, is indicated in (Table II 6).
The greatest overperformer is India, by 65 ranking
positions, followed by the Philippines by 57.

China and India perform well for R&D. This reflects their abundant supplies of qualified and highly
skilled human resources available. They also have large local markets, which attract investment
by multinational enterprises.45 In the case of China the progress is partly a reward for spending
2 per cent of GDP on R&D.46

Jordan also does well, again reflecting supportive government policy. Jordan was one of the first Arab
countries to support ICT as a standalone economic sector and from 1999 had the first nationwide ICT
strategy. Jordan now has a young, digitally literate population and high Internet penetration.47
The Philippines has a high ranking for industry. This reflects high levels of FDI in high-technology
manufacturing, particularly electronics. MNEs are attracted by the country’s strong supply chains
and solid base of parts manufacturing. The Philippines also has pro-business
policies along with a skilled, and English-speaking workforce, and a network
of economic zones.48

Viet Nam has been successful in increasing its technological and productive
capabilities to further industrialize its economy. Between 2005 and 2018,
the proportion of exports made up of primary and resource-based goods fell
from 52 per cent to 22 per cent, while those of high-tech goods rose from 6
per cent to 35 per cent.49 The drive for industrialization started in the 1990s.
Export-led growth was promoted through a mixture of import substitution
measures and export subsidies. This encouraged inflows of FDI. Since 2000,
the new Enterprise Law has made it easier and faster for businesses to
register. Production has also been transformed through the establishment
of export processing zones and industrial zones, as well the development of
urban infrastructure and human resources.50
Overall, however, these top overperforming developing countries have lower rankings for ICT
connectivity and skills. This is true for the developing countries as a group (Figure II 12). By contrast,
the top five in the overall readiness ranking tend to have well-balanced performances across all
building blocks (Figure II 13).
One implication of this result is that developing countries need to work towards universal internet
access and ensure that all their citizens have opportunities to learn the skills to be more ready for frontier
technologies. At present there are generally wide urban-rural disparities. For example, in 2018 in China,

Frontier technologies offer a window of
opportunity for developing countries to increase
productivity and improve livelihoods. But
technological change, which is now driven
mainly by developed countries, could also widen
the gaps between countries and make it even
more difficult to catch up in terms of production
or consumption. Also, frontier technologies
could transform jobs and labour markets with
profound implications for societies as a whole.
The next chapter looks at this issue more closely.

The first three are aligned with the national technological capacities identified by (Lall, 1992): physical
investment (ICT deployment), human capital (skills), technological effort (R&D). Industry activity is
related to the assumption that the development of technological capabilities are path-dependent and
based on existing capabilities (Hidalgo et al., 2007); thus the current pattern of industrial activity
could inform the likelihood of adoption of frontier technologies. Access to finance is considered
a building block for innovations, based on a Schumpeterian view of the finance/innovation nexus
(Schumpeter, 1980, 2008).

This chapter discusses the impact of frontier technologies on labour markets and jobs, and the
consequences for inequalities within and between countries.1 In many respects, frontier technologies
have effects similar to those of earlier eras of technological innovation. They have great potential
for addressing existing needs, increasing productivity and improving livelihoods, and can play an
essential part in development.2
Nevertheless, while offering distinctive opportunities, fresh waves of technological change also create
new kinds of problem. One risk is that frontier technologies could disrupt labour markets. A standard
view has been that innovations in processes
increase productivity and thus destroy jobs, while

Innovation affects profits, jobs and wages
and thus create jobs. There is also the possibility

that frontier technologies could reduce the
labour component of production, so reducing the
incentive for developed countries to move labourintensive work to less industrialized economies.
In China, for example, this could delay or slow

Moreover, while frontier technologies offer a
window of opportunity for developing countries
to accelerate economic growth, they could also
widen technological gaps between countries,
making it even more difficult for less-industrialized
countries to catch up , diversify their economies
and create more jobs. Much will depend,
however, on the array of industries a country
can grow or attract, which in turn depends on its
strategic promotion of new sectors, investments
in people and infrastructure, as well as on its
business and regulatory environments.

winners and losers. International trade can then
transmit these impacts between countries.3
Technological change also affects wages and
profits, which in turn widens gaps within and
between wage earners and the owners of capital

disparities – as illustrated in Figure III 2. Gaps open up between the unemployed and the employed,
and also between workers due to differences in skills4 and occupations,5 as well as between
firms,6 and sectors.7 At the international level, inequalities can arise due to differences in economic
structures – on how each sector contributes to employment and productive capacity and thus to
average productivity and income.
Income inequalities also emerge between wage earners and the owners of capital. As well as
paying wages, firms distribute profits to investors through dividends and in some cases remunerate
white-collar workers with equity. However, much depends on the prevailing social and economic
frameworks – how different groups in society negotiate divisions of power, and what levels of inequality
they will tolerate. Inequality of all forms is always shifting as a result of a multitude of factors of which
technological change is only one.
Sweden, for example, has collective wage agreements that reduce the scope for variations in
wages between firms.8 The United States, on the other hand, has less collective bargaining and

between 1978 and 2013 an estimated two-thirds of the rise in the earnings disparity was due to
differences between firms.9 In Brazil between 1996 and 2012, inequality fell partly due to a levelling
off of productivity between firms.10
Disparities in income are not inherently harmful.11 Some differential in wages helps reallocate talent to
more productive activities.12 13 Similarly, if entrepreneurs see the prospect of higher profits they have an
incentive to innovate.14 And since most of the social returns of innovation are captured by consumers
(through new and improved products, more choices, and lower prices), society as a whole should be
better off. Moreover, some of these disparities may only be temporary – particularly those between
firms.15 For example, the computer services, software and office equipment industry between 1995
and 2019 saw major changes in company rankings driven mainly by innovation (Table III 1).
Disparities in income also reflect forms of discrimination in society of which one of the most important
is gender. Women and girls are less likely to use the Internet and they are also underrepresented in
STEM fields. They tend not to work in ICT specialist occupations and are found more in low-growth
occupations such as sales or clerical work – resulting in persistent gender pay gaps.16 These and many
other disparities such as those associated with ethnic origin can become connected and entrenched.17
Innovation will thus have an impact on jobs, wages and profits but its magnitude and stickiness will
depend on many factors – productive structure, demographic makeup, levels of development and
social and economic policies.

B.

RISKS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCREASING INCOME DIVIDES

How do frontier technologies make the processes described above different from the past? In principle,
there is no difference. Similar disparities have occurred before. Each technological revolution had its
winners and losers requiring societies to create new institutions to spread wealth more evenly and
re-establish social cohesion.18 However, each wave of technological change creates different forms
of inequality, and distinct problems which policy makers and institutions need to solve to ensure
sustainable outcomes.
Nowadays one of the major concerns is the impact on labour markets of AI and robotics combined
with big data and IoT.19 In particular there are fears that these technologies will replace middle-skill
jobs and encourage the growth of the gig economy which is associated with low wages and job
insecurity. They could also widen disparities between companies and sectors by concentrating the
profits from these technologies in a few dominant companies. A concern for developing countries is
the risk of widening technological gaps between countries and a rise in global inequality.

AUTOMATION TAKING JOBS

Since the onset of the industrial revolution workers have expected new technologies to destroy
jobs.20 In the past this has generally not happened; new technology has instead tended to create
many more jobs, and of different kinds.21 But some people believe that the situation could be different
for frontier technologies because the changes are so fast that they could outpace the capacity of
societies to respond.22
Previously, many jobs were considered safe because it was difficult to teach computers how to
perform them. Now, through machine learning, computers can teach themselves how to complete
some tasks.23 AI can also use modelling and a lot of data to make predictions that mimic human
intelligence.24 This alters the nature of jobs by increasing or reducing the number of tasks. Some jobs
will disappear, but others will emerge – such as those requiring empathy, inventiveness and ethical
judgements that need to be made by humans.
This is illustrated schematically in Figure III 3 which shows a hypothetical workflow for three jobs in
which tasks are performed in sequence; those by humans in blue, those by machines in grey. Tasks
that require decisions are associated with human intelligence – such as making predictions based on
data and previous knowledge. Before AI, these decisions were difficult to automate. In this case, after
AI the number of jobs increases but with a different distribution of tasks.

There is considerable debate regarding the pace and impact of technological change (see Box III 1).
Some analysts warn of imminent widespread disruption of labour markets – and even threats to
human existence.25 More conservative studies, usually from experts in specific technologies, are
cautious of overestimating effects in the short term and underestimating those in the long term.26

Box III 1

The Future Will Not Take Care of Itself  *
The industrialized world is undergoing rapid employment growth. A May 2019 cover story in The Economist
magazine declared that “most of the rich world is enjoying a jobs boom of unprecedented scope.”27
Nonetheless people throughout the industrialized world are pessimistic about the future of work. In 2018, the
Pew Research Center found that between 65 and 90 percent of those surveyed in advanced economies believe
that robots and computers will probably or definitely take over many jobs now done by humans.28
The possibility that machines may eliminate jobs is not bad news if these technologies deliver higher living
standards. But the Pew survey makes clear that citizens do not expect to benefit: most people believe that

TABLE OF
CONTENT

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER III
Humans and machines at work

automation will exacerbate inequality between rich and poor while making jobs harder to find. Less than one third
of those surveyed believe that new, better-paying jobs will emerge.
Why, after a decade of rising employment, are people pessimistic about job prospects? One possibility is that the
avalanche of alarmist “end of work” newspaper articles, books, and expert reports have overwhelmed the facts.
Perhaps, in the words of the Economist, “the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.”
Alternatively, public pessimism may reflect the hard-learned lessons of recent history. Citizens may worry that the
introduction of new technologies with human-like capabilities will generate enormous wealth for a minority while
diminishing opportunity, upward mobility, and shared prosperity for the rest of us.
Economic history confirms that this sentiment is neither ill-informed nor misguided. There is ample reason for
concern about whether technological advances will improve or erode employment and earnings prospects for
the bulk of the workforce. The last four decades of economic history in industrialized countries reveals a startling
disconnect between rising productivity and stagnant incomes for large fractions of the workforce. The challenge
is not too few jobs. Instead, it is the quality and accessibility of the jobs that will exist and the career trajectories
that they offer to workers, particularly to those with less education.
New and emerging technologies will raise aggregate economic output and boost the wealth of nations.
Accordingly, they offer the potential for citizens to realize higher living standards, better working conditions,
greater economic security, and improved health and longevity.
But whether nations and their populations realize this potential depends on the institutions of governance,
societal investment, education, law, and public and private leadership to transform aggregate wealth into greater
shared prosperity instead of rising inequality. By enacting far-sighted policies to invest in their citizens, protect
and augment workers, and shape not just the speed but also the direction of innovation, nations can cultivate
this historic opportunity to generate broadly shared prosperity. These opportunities are within our grasp, but they
are far from inevitable. The future will not take care of itself.

Most assessments of the impact of AI and automation on jobs have focused on more advanced
economies. Some estimates suggest that over the next 20 years, in Europe and the United States 30
to 50 per cent of jobs could be automated (Table III 2).29 Others see a more modest impact – from 8 to
14 per cent across occupations.30 Moreover, because of the uneven gender balance for occupations,
women and men will be affected differently.31

The large differences in estimates reflect different methodologies and assumptions. Some studies
overstate the impact by assuming the automation not just of specific tasks but entire occupations.32 This
distinction between occupations and tasks is critical since even occupations at high risk of automation
can perform tasks that are hard to automate.

More conservative
studies, usually
from experts in
specific technologies,
are cautious of
overestimating effects
in the short term and
underestimating those
in the long term.

Other studies focus on tasks.33 They try to identify those that are automatable
and then assess what proportions of the current jobs are composed of these
tasks. A problem of this approach is that it is difficult to estimate how AI will
develop in future and which tasks it will be able to replace. For example, in the
early 2000s it was thought that driving a car would be too difficult for AI;34 now,
AI is aiming for “driverless” cars.
Another challenge with this task-centred approach is that it does not account
for workers adjusting by taking on new tasks complementary to the new
technologies. As a result, the content of an occupation will change over time
even if its name stays the same. Thus, a journalist is now expected not just to
collect the information but also enter it into the publication’s computer system
taking over some of the tasks formerly done by a compositor.

However, the main problem with both occupation- and task-based predictions
is that they are based solely on technological feasibility. They may not consider economic factors – such
as how demand for jobs will change due to technological advances and the fact that the economy will
create entirely new occupations. Much depends on relative prices; capital may not replace labour even
when it is technologically feasible, while other macroeconomic effects could increase overall labour
demand.35 Nor do such predictions consider the social acceptance of automation. For example, some
of a nurse’s work may be susceptible to automation, but this option may be rejected because an
important benefit of hospital treatment is human interaction.
Another approach is to assess the potential impact of AI on jobs by using economic models.36 Instead
of predicting the number of jobs that could disappear, they seek to understand the channels of impact
of automation on jobs and tasks and the effects of the demand for skills. However, their application for
developing countries is limited because they do not consider the potential impact of AI and robots on
employment through changes in trade patterns.37
The Technology and Innovation Report 2018, concluded: “the impact of automation is likely to depend
less on its technological feasibility than on its economic feasibility”.38 Recently, commentators have
moved from doomsday scenarios to a more optimistic forecasts,39 although pessimistic outlooks are
still common.40
Another concern for developing countries is that MNEs could take advantage of AI, robots and 3D
printing, to reshore production back to developed countries. A study in Sweden found that one of
the stronger drives for reshoring for Swedish manufacturing companies was the increased degree of
automation.41 But the feasibility of reshoring depends on many other factors, including ownership, and
the scale of production, and its position in the supply chain. For the apparel and footwear industries,
for example, it may be more useful to keep production close to the sources of materials. A recent study
found that the risk of job displacement and reshoring were exaggerated for apparel, given the realities of
the factory floor.42 It may also make less sense to reshore from developing countries that have growing
populations and expanding middle classes that offer growing markets.

2.

JOB POLARIZATION

Job polarization refers to an expansion in high- and low-wage jobs combined with a contraction
in middle-wage jobs. This phenomenon is not new; it has been documented in many advanced
economies since the 1970s,43 though it is not yet happening to any great extent in developing
countries.44 45
TABLE OF
CONTENT

40
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER III
Humans and machines at work

Polarization has intensified in developed countries as skilled cognitive tasks are increasingly supported
by computers. Higher-paid occupations tend to benefit more because they use computers more
intensively than lower-paid ones.46 These occupations steadily absorb tasks from other professions;
for instance, when a manager starts to book her own travel instead of relying on an assistant.
Computerization reduces the demand for middle-wage jobs, such as those of clerks doing routine tasks.47
Thus far, there has been less impact on the demand for many of the lowest-skilled manual tasks, but that
seems set to change with greater use of AI and robots.48 A study based on data on robot adoption within
industries in 17 countries found that increased robot use reduced the share of employment of low-skilled
workers.49 In addition, ever-more-capable robots and AI software will put further pressure on workers
performing routine tasks, both manual and cognitive – from strawberry pickers to radiologists.50
AI can also affect the quality of employment – making it more interesting for high-skilled workers, but
more boring for low-skilled workers. AI systems can also make high-skill jobs more problem-solving
and demanding. In contrast, low-skilled workers are more likely to be receiving orders or instructions
automatically generated by an AI system.51 A recent survey examined differences in the use of AI
by workers in Denmark and found that high-skilled workers tended to use information compiled
automatically by the AI systems for making decisions or advising clients (Box III 2).

Box III 2

Artificial intelligence, work organization and skills in Denmark
One of the world’s first surveys of employees’ use of AI on job and skills was conducted in 2019 by IKE, Aalborg
University Business School, Denmark. This distinguished two uses of AI. The first is where the employee uses
information compiled by the AI system to help them make decisions or advise clients. This corresponds to the idea
that AI systems may enhance the skills of employees by providing useful inputs for further decision-making. The
second is where the employee merely receives orders or instructions generated automatically by the AI system.
The survey found that around one-quarter of all employees used AI in one or other of the two forms at least once
a month. However. the high-skilled workers were more likely to use the first form. As indicated in the figure below,
while a similar proportion of all three categories of worker used AI to receive orders, a much higher proportion of the
middle and high-skilled workers used it to support decision making.

The study also found that using AI for decision making increased the complexity of problem-solving tasks and
thus made the work more demanding and interesting, while just receiving AI-generated instructions tends to make
work more repetitive. The study shows the importance in both developed and developing countries of reshaping
education and training system to best prepare students for working life.

Not all job polarization can be attributed to technological change. In advanced economies job
polarization has been taking place during a period of globalization – and the shift in employment
from manufacturing to services (Figure III 4).52 In Sweden, for example, the 1970s and 1980s

were periods of pronounced job polarization, but one study concluded that this was not due to
routine-based technological change.53 For the low- and lower-middle-income countries the greatest
shift in employment has been from agriculture to services.
Over the same period, there has been a trend towards higher-skill employment (Figure III 5). In
upper-middle- and high-income countries, most work is in middle-skill jobs – such as clerical support
workers, service and sales workers, craft and related trades workers, plant and machine operators,
and assemblers. In the high-income countries there was a significant share of high-skill jobs. All
country groupings, however, saw an expansion of high-skill occupations. Only the high-income
countries had a reduction for medium-skilled workers.

Humans and machines at work

Some of the job polarization over this period will have been caused by automation, but much will also
have been the result of trade and international competition. A study of job polarization in Denmark
between 1999 and 2009 suggested that the main cause was import competition, through worker-level
adjustments – with the highly educated and skilled workers ending up in high-wage jobs whereas
less-educated workers ended up in low-wage positions.55 The workers most affected were those
doing manual tasks regardless of how routine they were.
Another study, in Germany, found that the decline in manufacturing employment was steeper in
import-competing than export-oriented sectors.56 However, the authors found that manufacturing
jobs were retained because of rising trade with China and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the increase in
services was caused by people entering the labour market, either young people or those returning
from non-employment.
Adjustment in local labour markets due to import competition can be slow. A study on the effects of
China’s emergence as an industrial powerhouse in local labour markets in the United States found that
in the cities more affected, wages and labour-force participation rates sometimes remained low, and
unemployment rates remained high, more than a decade after the start of the China trade shock.57
Technological change is thus interlinked with structural changes and international trade. Low
and middle-income countries are probably less exposed to potential negative effects of frontier
technologies such as AI and robots on job polarization.

3.

THE GIG ECONOMY AND AN EROSION OF LABOUR RIGHTS

Frontier technologies are being used to provide services via digital platforms that have spurred the
creation of a ‘gig economy’.58 Some of this gig work is location-based, as for example, provided
by Uber and Airbnb.59 But it also includes “cloud work”, tasks that can be performed anywhere via
the Internet, such as through Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower. The latter can include
captioning images and cleaning data that can then be used by AI algorithms.60 There are thus
opportunities for people in many developing countries to earn incomes, while also developing new
skills and joining professional networks.
While the gig economy provides work, this is typically on insecure terms, creating a precarious class
of dependent contractors and on-demand workers.61 These workers generally have fewer labour
rights and less negotiating power than waged-employees and can be underpaid with little social
protection.62 This employment also competes with more secure traditional occupations such as taxi
drivers and hotel workers.63
It is less clear what impact the gig economy will have on income inequality. Much will depend on
whether the gig workers are poor people who would otherwise be unemployed, or middle-class
people looking for a small additional income. Inequality will also rise if these jobs replace better-paid
ones or full-time jobs with part-time ones, or if profits grow faster than salaries.
If service occupations are tradable in the global labour market, these salaries may converge. This has
happened in computer coding, for example, and digital design as well as in medical diagnostics, paralegal
assessments, and image recognition. Anyone with access to the Internet and the right skills can join a
global labour market. But at the national level the impact on inequalities is more ambiguous because the
tradable work is usually for low- or middle-income occupations. The people earning the most such as
bankers, lawyers, and doctors are likely to be protected by market regulation, or in the case of business
executives and performers because they are already operating in a global market for talent.
The gig economy may also increase gender inequality. An ILO survey on digital platforms shows that,
on average, women represent only one in three workers; and in developing countries only one in five
workers.64 Another study found that, although women work on the platforms for more hours than men,
they earned only about two-thirds of men’s rates.65

MARKET AND PROFIT CONCENTRATION

These new digital platforms benefit from network effects so markets tend to concentrate, leaving a small
number of very large players, as illustrated in Table II 3.66 This could increase inequalities within sectors,
between firms, and between capital and labour. With fewer competitors there is less incentive to reduce
prices – and higher profits can widen inequality between wage earners and the owners of capital. And for
some IT skills these companies may become almost the only employers – a “monopsony”.
With few companies there is also the temptation for tacit collusion.67 This may happen unintentionally
given the extent of B2B data exchange through algorithms. This is a new area of research with many
unanswered questions.68 Some researchers argue that algorithmic collusion is more difficult to achieve
than legal scholars have assumed.69
Competition policies will need to be updated – and broadened to consider issues such as consumer
privacy, personal data protection, consumer choice, market structure, switching costs and lock-in effects.70
UNCTAD’s Digital Economy Report 2019 provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of digitalization
and the market concentration of global digital platforms, and presents an extensive discussion of the
regulatory issues and new challenges for competition and consumer protection policies.71

5.

AI AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES: THREE PROBABLE
SCENARIOS

Some estimates suggest that by 2030 AI will contribute an additional $15.7 trillion to the global
economy – of which 40 per cent will come from productivity gains and $9.1 trillion from consumption
side effects.72 This would be a consequence of government-led advances in China and corporate-led
advances in the United States.73 Although competing for global dominance in AI, both countries now
have digital platforms that gather massive amounts of data from global user bases. Of the total, China
would take $7 trillion and North America $3.7 trillion. On this scenario, these countries would leave the
rest of the advanced industrialized economies behind.74 A new ‘great divergence’ would thus be driven
not by manufacturing but by user-generated data.
In a second scenario, the main source of big data used by AI would not be human beings but the
internet of things (IoT). The IoT consists of machines talking to each other and finding new ways of
producing goods. This new wave of active AI will use incoming data to produce better machines and
final goods. If so, this would benefit the countries manufacturing those things – such as members
of the EU, Japan and the Republic of Korea. They could keep up with the United States and China
while pulling ahead of countries that have lower levels of AI automation or manufacturing. In an IoT
scenario, manufacturing is still the basis for competitive advantage among countries. As discussed
in Chapter I, this represents a continuance of the great divergence from 1820 to 1990, where West
European economies and their offshoots forged ahead by increasing productivity in manufacturing.75
This would thus accentuate an existing global divide rather than creating a new data-driven one.
A third scenario involves equipping machines with conceptual frameworks of how the world
works – allowing them to learn more like humans by recognizing patterns and generalizing from a few
examples.76 This method of mimicking human intelligence harks back to the origins of AI. In recent
years this top-down method appeared to have been set aside in favour of bottom-up, data-driven
methods. The latter have several disadvantages. One is the problem of “edge” cases for which the
machines have insufficient data – as when self-driving cars encounter real-life scenarios that were not
part of their massive training datasets. Also, if something goes wrong it can be impossible to work out
how a data-driven system arrived at a decision. There may also be ethical obstacles if governments
are concerned about their citizens’ privacy and limit the collection of training data.
In recent years new research and computational tools have revived the original prospect of equipping
machines with human-like reasoning capabilities. This typically involves probabilistic models that
TABLE OF

can deal with extensive uncertainty, work with limited data, and learn from experience. Such models
could be used anywhere, so would not particularly benefit the United States or China, but they would
still require the kind of resources and capabilities more likely to be found in the developed countries,
which could thus pull further ahead of the developing countries.

6.

WIDENING TECHNOLOGICAL GAPS

Extensive adoption of frontier technologies could enable developed countries to pull further ahead of
less- industrialized economies. A widening technological gap would make it more difficult for these lessindustrialized countries to catch up, diversify their economies, and create jobs. The alternative is for the
developing countries themselves to scale up the deployment of these technologies – a daunting, but
achievable, task.
In the past, countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, and a handful of Asian economies moved up the
income ladder by transferring labour and capital from lower-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity
manufacturing and services. Within manufacturing, following the “flying geese” model these countries built
capacity and skills, moving up the value chains, replacing low-wage, low-skill manufacturing activities with
higher-skill, higher-value added production.77 Meanwhile, recent newcomers to the development process
picked up the low-skill activities that the more advanced developing countries had outgrown.
The fear now is that frontier technologies and Industry 4.0 will upend these traditional development
processes, making a difficult journey even harder. While it is important to address these fears, the dangers
need to be put in context. LDCs and low-income countries may not be affected if they do not have the
low-wage assembly jobs that are in greatest danger of being destroyed by frontier technologies.78 At the
same time, there may be areas where low-income countries can benefit directly from frontier technologies.

C.

CHALLENGES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

The likely impact of rapid technological change on inequality is thus uncertain. The actual effect will vary
from sector to sector and depend on the capacities of countries, as well as on their policies and strategies.
Some workers will lose their jobs and have to find other occupations, and there will be consistently fewer
jobs in certain occupations and more in others. Some workers should be able to adapt through retraining
or switching careers. But change may also be faster than people’s ability to adapt; some may never be
able to do so. Therefore, all governments should aim to see frontier technologies disseminated through
production structures while devising ways to mitigate adverse effects.

GOVERNMENTS SHOULD AIM TO SEE FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
DISSEMINATED THROUGH PRODUCTION STRUCTURES
WHILE DEVISING WAYS TO MITIGATE ADVERSE EFFECTS
Developing countries can use automation to increase productivity and wages while also promoting
economic diversification that will create jobs. Nevertheless, in pursuing these policy objectives, developing
countries face several challenges, including demographic change and the lack of capacity, and a shortage
of finance. They could also be obstructed by more stringent protection of intellectual property.

countries, while the population in high-income countries is likely to remain stable. Between 2020
and 2050, most of the increase in population will be in sub-Saharan Africa, by more than one billion,
and in South Asia by almost half a billion (Figure III 7). Expanding and younger populations will
increase the supply of labour and depress wages, reducing the incentives for automation.
The actual process will vary between firms and industries and depend to some extent on government
policies.79 In India, for example, despite a large labour surplus, firms that have easier access to
foreign technology and imported capital have adopted advanced manufacturing techniques.80 In other
regions with falling populations, or slower increases, automation will not lead to mass unemployment.

2.

LOWER TECHNOLOGICAL AND INNOVATION CAPACITIES

Adopting new technologies should increase productivity. Between 1991 and 2019 average output per
worker increased steadily (Figure III 8). Globally the increase was from $21,205 to $37,782 per worker.
In absolute terms, the biggest increase was in the developed countries, but in relative terms, the most
significant increase was in upper-middle-income countries, from $12,710 to $35,916. There was also a
substantial increase in lower-middle-income countries, but very little progress in low-income countries
so the gap between these and other country groupings widened. This is partly because the poorest
countries depend to a large extent on agriculture which offers less scope than manufacturing for

The gap between developed and developing
countries can also be seen in their proportions of
medium and high-tech value added (Figure III 9 a).
Between 2000 and 2016, despite rapid progress
in countries such as China, India and Viet Nam,
the gap between developed and developing
countries remained about the same. Meanwhile,
the least developed countries were dropping
further behind, with their share falling from 17 to 9
per cent. Among the developing regions, SouthEast Asia was at the top and sub-Saharan Africa
at the bottom (Figure III 9 b).

World Development Indicators.

Most new technologies are likely to be used
for manufacturing and financial services in
which developing countries in particular LDCs
already lag far behind. This is reflected in their
low proportions of manufacturing value added
(Figure III 10) and in exports of financial services
(Figure III 11). High-income and upper-middleincome countries also dominate the automotive
and electronics sectors, which between 2005
and 2014 experienced a substantial increase in
robot density (Figure III 12).

Progress in using frontier technologies can also be measured through the number of relevant science
and technology publications. Here again, as illustrated in Figure III 14, the developing countries are
some way behind. They appear to be keeping pace when it comes to the number of patents, but this
is largely due to the contribution from China and India (Figure III 15).
Some technologies, such as 3D printing, offer the prospect of democratizing manufacturing and
allowing far smaller production runs. This promise has yet to be realised in developing countries.

The price of equipment did fall after the first wave of patents expired but not far enough for many
potential users in developing countries. Even more important, few users in these countries have the
skills for producing 3D designs.
The lower technological capacities of developing countries are also seen in the gaps in digital
infrastructure and skills, as discussed in Chapter IV.
These divides can thus both perpetuate existing inequalities and create new ones. Worst affected are
the low-income and least developed countries.

3.

SLOW DIVERSIFICATION

If developing countries want to upgrade jobs and production, they will need to move on to more
complex goods and services.82 At present their production systems are far less diverse than those

of developed countries. As illustrated in Figure III 16, generally the diversification of a country’s output is
associated with its total GDP. When countries develop, they diversify their economies by adding more
complex products. These more complex products can be found in any sector – agriculture manufacturing
or services – and they do not need to be new to the world, they can just be new to the country.83 In fact,
developing countries typically innovate by emulating industrialized countries, and absorbing and adapting
their technologies for local use.84
Emulation and diversification tend to be path dependent. What firms in a country produce
tomorrow will depend to a large extent on what they produce today; a country will generally emulate in those
industries for which it already has some capabilities. This path dependency can be illustrated with product
space maps (Figure III 17).85 The circles represent products which are connected to each other based
on how likely they are to be exported together. Some products, such as cars and computers, are more
extensively connected than others and offer greater scope for diversification. Others, such as commodities,
largely represent dead ends with little scope for moving to other types of production.
The approach will depend on the country’s level of economic development and its economic structure,
as indicated in Table III 3. Lower-income developing countries should innovate on two fronts. They should
adopt and use frontier technologies to improve basic infrastructure, while also investing in late-stage
technologies to diversify into more complex products in traditional sectors where they can gain dynamic
comparative advantage. High-income countries on the other hand, should promote inclusive and
sustainable development of frontier technologies while mitigating the negative impacts of job displacement.
Middle-income countries need to pursuit a more of a balancing act, involving innovation in both late-stage
and frontier technologies while diversifying their economies.
Developing countries may find it even harder to upgrade because of changes in global production structures.
In recent decades, firms in developing countries have been able to enter different, though traditional,
sectors by participating in global value chains (GVCs). Now the COVID-19 pandemic has created concerns
about the vulnerability of GVCs with potential reduction of cross-border investment.86 To reduce the risk of
disruption firms may shorten their value chains by keeping more production in developed countries (Box III
3). These changes in GVCs would make it more difficult for lower-income developing countries to maintain
their production bases and diversify to new sectors.

Potential impact of COVID-19 on global value chains
The COVID-19 outbreak delivered both supply and demand shocks to the global economy. Supply was
disrupted through lockdowns and production stoppages, logistics disruptions and labour shortages.
Demand was reduced through weaker consumption and lower imports. These shocks had adverse effects on
production, trade and FDI, and on global value chains (GVCs). UNCTAD projects a decline in global FDI flows
of between 5 and 15 per cent in 2020.
The dominant players in GVCs are multinational enterprises (MNEs). To reduce the risk of disruption, MNEs
could now shift to more local production – reshoring. This would deprive developing countries of GVCassociated capital flows and access to international markets that can help them build human capital and
knowledge.
However, MNEs might find this difficult. Depending on the types of firms, withdrawing entirely from a country
could entail more than just relocating manufacture or assembly. They may also have to relocate suppliers,
some of whom in turn rely on parts produced by other local companies. In any case, MNEs gain other
advantages from GVCs that onshoring cannot offer, such as access to foreign markets.
Instead, they may adjust in other ways. They can, for example, seek ad-hoc assistance from other partner
firms in a similar value chain. They may also increase the amount of inventory, and add production lines. To
build in more redundancy and make GVCs more resilient may also extend the chains into other countries –
offering opportunities to other African, Asian and Latin American countries.
The adjustments to GVCs will depend ultimately on how long the epidemic lasts and how quickly countries
can recover – and ultimately on the decisions of individual firms, as seen after Thailand’s flood in 2011 when
different firms, often in the same industries, responded in different ways.

WEAK FINANCING MECHANISMS

Another challenge for developing countries is a lack of finance for R&D. Although most developing
countries have increased R&D expenditures, these are still relatively small (Table III 4). Some regional
organizations have set targets for R&D expenditures, but progress has been slow. For instance,
the African Union established a target of one per cent of GDP, but on average sub-Saharan African
countries are still at 0.38 per cent.87 Just as important as the volume of expenditure is its composition.
Very little is funded by the private sector – to develop industrial technologies for production.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

A major issue for developing countries is that technologies from developed countries are protected
through intellectual property (IP) rights. IP protection can take various forms, including patents, trade
secrets, trademarks and copyrights.88 Without the patent system, there would be little incentive for
firms to develop and commercialize innovations. In principle, intellectual property regimes should be
geared to each country’s needs and capacities, striking an appropriate balance between granting
exclusive rights and encouraging follow-on innovation by competitors.
Digital content providers have, however, long been advocating for stronger intellectual property
enforcement – for broadening the scope of patents and increasing the duration of copyright works,
even though many of these patents remain unused. One practice is to create “patent thickets” by
acquiring overlapping patents to cover a wide area of economic activity and downstream inventions.
Another is “patent fencing”: excessive patenting with the intention of cordoning off areas of future
research. Both can extend patent protection over entire technological domains, and guarantee
continuing economic advantages to incumbent firms.
Of the various forms of IP, patents are less restrictive than trade secrets since the creator has to
disclose the invention – knowledge which can then be disseminated and used as a basis for follow-up
innovation.89
Stringent intellectual property protection can restrict the use of frontier technologies that could
be valuable in various sustainable development areas such as agriculture, health and energy. An
algorithm that could be used at almost no marginal cost could still be off limits for many who could
benefit from it. Arguably, frontier technology innovations should form part of a new type of technology
transfer – covering platform technologies, data collection and mining, processing algorithms and
artificial intelligence.90

D.

ACCELERATING TOWARDS INDUSTRY 4.0

National governments are already addressing the potential negative effects of frontier technologies
and have good ideas to share. Many national and local governments are working to stimulate the
growth of industries that produce jobs and wealth within their boundaries, which in turn reduces
inequalities between countries. National strategies should include:

1.

SETTING STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS

Many countries set their priorities for frontier technologies through national plans for research and
innovation. These usually aim to strengthen specific sectors either by encouraging new businesses to
form, helping existing businesses to grow, or attracting companies from outside. The plans also identify
changes needed in the regulatory environment and the need for investment in physical infrastructure and
in training. National plans and strategies can also promote technological applications that could help
disadvantaged groups or help stimulate economic development in rural areas or declining regions.
Several countries are using opportunities created by technological advances to take on emerging social
challenges:
Ageing – Several national plans mention the ways ageing populations could benefit from the new
technologies. Japan’s plan points to the issue of ageing and less mobility to which Japan’s strong
automotive industry can respond, and healthcare which could be supported
by robotics. The plan calls for reducing the number of nursing care patients
by allowing ageing individuals to remain in the workforce. It also explicitly

uses Special Economic Zones to work towards regional equalization.93 Most
plans mention the opportunity to spread new manufacturing jobs across unequal regions. Regions
can build or rebuild manufacturing capability if they work hand-in-hand with the expertise being
developed at the national level.
Diversity – In several cases, issues of diversity get attention, notably in the strategies by South Africa
and the United Kingdom. These issues arise in education, but also in the workforce, and in South
Africa in issues of ownership and control. The South African plan mentions the importance of female
entrepreneurs. Programmes to develop new skills can operate on a more egalitarian basis and bring
in groups that have previously been under-represented.
National plans for STI, in combination with environment and energy policies, enable countries to take
advantage of the “green window of opportunity” to promote the technological catch up in renewable
technologies (Box III 4).

Box III 4

Green windows of opportunity: latecomer development in the age of transformation towards
sustainability
A recent critical examination of the technological catch up in five renewable energies industries (solar PV,
biomass, hydro energy, and wind energy) shows that institutional changes are the main drivers for creating new
opportunities for latecomer development in the green economy. In particular, new policies and new legislations,
related to domestically or global sustainability transformation agendas, are central to latecomer catch up in all
sectoral ‘take off’ cases. Environmental and energy policies are critical for the emergence of Green Windows
of Opportunity (GWOs), based on their domestic deployment and market creation effects. At the same time,
industrial and innovation policies are also important to promote the firm and system level capabilities to respond
to opportunities.
The eventual effects of policy-induced opportunities depend on the actions of firms and other sectoral system
public and private actors, as well as on key sectoral characteristics, such as technology maturity and tradability of
products and services. Therefore, policies and firm strategies for green latecomer development need to be sector

specific and a one-size-fits all approach to green energy sectors is not viable. In some cases, the public policy
response is concentrated on mission-oriented technological change based on demonstration projects while in
other sectors, industrial policy measures such as local content requirements are put in place.
Given the low level of tradability of many products and services in the renewable energy industries, successful
latecomer strategies entail the protection of domestic investments. Thus, there is usually significant innovation
system openness during the formative phase of sectors, but restrictions are imposed during the scaling up
phases.
These findings have important implications for global green transformation policy. Cases of very rapid latecomer
catch up in renewable energies suggest that GWOs can be exploited by both developed and developing
economies. Countries that take active measures to enhance their technological capabilities and build open national
and sectoral innovation systems through trade and investment policies and internationalization of R&D, may
achieve faster catch up and, even, leadership. Moreover, the efforts of international organizations, governments
and non-governmental organizations across the world, have been effective in promoting institutional change-led,
mission-oriented initiatives.
These lessons have valuable policy implications for other sectors, such as public health and digital infrastructure,
which are critical for building an inclusive society. Policy coordination and the efforts of the global community
in ensuring equal access and responsible provision of global public goods, could create ‘global challenge-led
windows of opportunity’.

the age of transformation toward sustainability. Industrial and Corporate Change, 29(5).

There is also considerable room for countries to learn from each other in how to reduce inequalities
using opportunities provided by new manufacturing systems. All these projects can help countries
become technology leaders.

AI, big data and IoT
Many national innovation strategies have AI, Big Data, and IoT as priority areas. They also appear as
part of overall national approaches to the Digital Society, the Information Society, or the Information
Economy. While there is a degree of participation in producing these plans, the participants are largely
limited to industry, technical experts, and government agencies.
Several countries picture AI as a factor that could greatly improve efficiency in public sector services:
• Australia – Expects that AI can help target government services to those that need them most.94
• Italy – Stresses applications in health and disability as well as learning systems.95
• Japan – Has established a Strategic Council for AI Technology, in part to assure that appropriate
applications are being considered across government agencies.96 It is aiming for one-stop public
services that anyone can access and use at any time.97
• Republic of Korea – Proposes that new information technologies be applied first in the public sector
to solve social problems and thereby help create a market.98
• United Kingdom – The UK Information Economy Strategy includes improving the delivery of public
services.99
Some countries promote fronter technologies for regional development:
• China – Commits in its “Internet Plus” effort that “In the old industrial bases of the northeast and other
parts of China, we will implement policies and measures designed to ensure their full revitalization”
and further that: “We will increase support to old revolutionary base areas, areas with concentrations
of ethnic minorities, border areas, and areas with relatively high incidences of poverty.”100
• United Kingdom – The AI strategy for life sciences includes regional foci in Leeds, Sheffield, and
Oxfordshire.101

Few national plans refer to the SDGs. India’s discussion paper is an exception, addressing global
challenges with “moonshot” projects.102 Several national innovation strategies do point to SDG-related
areas, including health and water.103 But do not refer to the difficulties in implementing new technologies
in the least developed environments and describe advances that might just as easily may widen the
gaps between rich and poor.

Biotechnology – national programmes
Dozens of countries have reported biotechnology initiatives, and there are also programmes from
International organizations including UNESCO, UNIDO and the European Union.104 These generally
address “biotechnology and society”. Mostly they focus on safety, risk, and privacy rather the risk of
widening inequalities, though some do consider the following issues:
Rural livelihoods – The Sri Lankan plan sets, among other broad goals, poverty elimination and
reducing income inequalities.105 The plan points to the possibility of “bio-entrepreneurship” to
contribute to livelihoods in rural communities. India’s Biotechnology Plan also includes specific efforts
towards inclusive development.106 Farmer and community innovation receive attention. Medical
innovation should emphasize affordable techniques. A set of societal programmes address women,
rural communities, and scheduled castes. Ten per cent of the budget is devoted to development in
the underdeveloped Northeast Region. Other plans mention related issues more briefly. The EU-China
plan for biotechnology cooperation includes urban agriculture, and the European part of the plan
refers to rural development.107 A joint BRICS research programme108 includes a project on TB drug
resistance. The Canadian innovation plan from 2014, which includes biotechnology, makes reference
to the benefits of innovation for rural and urban poverty, aboriginal groups, and remote communities.109
The Czech plan has biotechnology as a chosen areas of specialization, and shows high awareness of
the implications for regional development.110
Inequalities between groups – Both Lithuania111 and Poland112 have research programmes targeted
at healthy ageing. The Canada plan aims most aspects of its human resource development at
young Canadians, either in the general workforce in science and engineering.113 The Canada plan
also acknowledges the under-representation of women in the science and engineering workforce.
Norway’s calls for more women scientists and engineers.114 Initiatives from Malta include programmes
targeted at female entrepreneurs.115 The 2019 Ireland innovation strategy includes a whole chapter on
gender inequalities and women’s careers in research.116

Biotechnology – International programmes
International programmes are more likely than national programmes to explicitly address inequalities.

Agriculture – There is a strong network of research institutions focused on developing new technologies
to help poor farmers. The nodes of the network are the CGIAR centres, and the partners are national
agricultural research institutions in dozens of countries of the global South.117 Active partners in the
North often come from agriculture-based universities, such as Michigan State and Wageningen. Over
time, the emphasis in the CGIAR centres has shifted from top-down, research-led innovations to
deeper consultations with farmers.118 The gender lens in these consultations is evident. The CGIAR
network originally operated in an environment where agricultural knowledge could not become
intellectual property but has taken the lead in adjustment to the newer legal regime.119 Because of
strong local connections, the CGIAR centres have been able to introduce some genetically modified
crops, with some striking successes such as Nerica rice.
Health – Policies to address inequalities include both “push” (knowledge creation) and “pull” (market
incentives). On the push side, resources have grown. For tuberculosis, for example, the top funders
in 2017 were in the United States: various institutes at the National Institutes of Health, the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, and USAID.120 Next on the list was UNITAID, a coalition of funders which
focuses on medical innovation, followed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals and the UK Department for
International Development. European Union funding has also increased.121 The emphasis has shifted
TABLE OF
CONTENT

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

from funding for research in the global North to collaborations and capacity building for research in
the global South.122

Public-private partnerships – These allow sharing of intellectual property rights which can encourage
partners into riskier but important ventures.123 They have been attracting attention to dengue fever,
one of the most neglected tropical diseases.124 Coalitions have also been effective for an oral cholera
vaccine125 and partnerships have grown up for schistosomiasis,126 rabies,127 and Ebola.128 Several
evaluations of public-private partnership mechanisms have reviewed the pros and cons.129
IP for drugs – One prominent area has been on intellectual property for drugs. India is
experimenting with open source drug discovery for TB drugs, creating a knowledge commons
through crowdsourcing.130 A lot of this work is being done by international organizations. UNITAID
has designed the Medicines Patent Pool to stimulate innovation for HIV/AIDS drugs, and the World
Intellectual Property Organization has established Re:Search to encourage product development for
neglected tropical diseases, and malaria, and tuberculosis.131 The World Trade Organization’s 1994
Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights agreement (TRIPS) increased basic research on drugs for
neglected diseases, though it has not yet led to clinical trials.132
Advance market agreements for drugs – These focus not on supply but on demand. One option
is an advance market commitment (AMC) or agreement, through which a set of buyers promises
to buy a certain quantity of an effective treatment at a certain price, giving the drug developer a
sufficient incentive to undertake development. The first AMC was established in 2007 and included
five national governments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, who promised a market for a
pneumococcal vaccine. So far, the mechanism has had limited application. Perhaps because of
complex implementation issues, national policymakers have generally only participated through their
development agencies.133

2.

ALIGNING NATIONAL INNOVATION AND INDUSTRIAL POLICIES

Countries should engage in STI dialogues on technology catch-up, adoption, and deployment.
They can draw lessons from Asia’s success with the mass production of electronics, but other
relevant examples might include experiences with medical devices and the solar industry, as well as
with software, and higher- value agriculture.134 These dialogues can take advantage of UNCTAD’s
Framework for Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (STIP) Reviews which can help national
governments, civil society stakeholders and international development partners with national
catch-up strategies, along with specific policies for harnessing frontier technologies for smarter,
more sustainable cities, food security and smart agriculture, and employment generation in smarter
factories.

Regional value chains – It should also be possible to create continental value chains. Africa, for
example, could take advantage of the Africa Free Trade Area to develop local value chains to support
the adoption of frontier technologies for such areas as transportation and logistics, fintech, potable
water and sanitation, waste to energy, smart cities, affordable housing, and low-cost, high-quality
health care. These chains could be supported by procurement programmes and financing
mechanisms involving local sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, institutional investors, and
guarantee instruments.
Competitiveness – Even affluent countries strive to be among the leaders in the new production
regime. Most strategic plans for AI and Industry 4.0 technologies aim to keep national or regional
industry competitive. China in its 2015 strategy aims to make the country a major manufacturing
power in ten years, mastering core technologies in key areas towards the goal of welfare and people’s
livelihoods.135 Germany, as part of its High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, aims to be a “lead market
and provider of INDUSTRIE 4.0 solutions and services.”136 Italy has a policy initiative for Industry 4.0, to
contribute to production flexibility, product quality, productivity, and faster movement from prototype

CHAPTER III

to product.137 Japan has a New Industrial Structure Vision that sees the Fourth Industrial Revolution
as “the key to a new phase of growth in Japan.”138

Regulatory environment – Competitiveness requires the right regulatory environment. Countries
trying to get into the IoT market are therefore aiming for interoperability and common standards.
India has a National M2M Roadmap that stresses the importance of such standards to allow its firms
to take advantage of IoT opportunities.139 The AI and big data spaces, on the other hand, generally
rely on privacy, security, and data ownership so regulation to facilitate interoperability could reduce
the security of data transactions.140 Malaysia is addressing these issues with a plan to set up a
central regulatory body to address both interoperability and privacy and security concerns.141 Many
frontier technologies rely on digital infrastructure, platforms and data, so governments will need to
guard against anticompetitive practices in digital markets. Open and contestable markets that foster
innovation will rely on robust monitoring and enforcement.142
Business startups – National and local governments are particularly interested in encouraging new
businesses in frontier technology areas.143 144 Thailand has Startup Thailand, which operates under
the Ministry of Science and Technology.145 Malaysia has a special corporation to support small and
medium-sized enterprises, with an emphasis on those owned by women.146 Brazil has worked to
connect startups with established firms and has a national startup acceleration programme.147 148
Hungary also provides venture capital for small businesses in the early stages of development.149
Governments can also help to fund leapfrog technologies in public infrastructure – as has been done
in water, telecommunications, and energy.150
Foreign direct investment – Industry 4.0 requires a strategic review of investment policies for industrial
development – reorienting incentives towards new technologies, facilitating investment and improving
screening procedures.151 Partnerships with foreign firms and FDI can help countries gain footholds
from which they can increase indigenous capabilities. In China, one study finds that FDI can stimulate
the diffusion of new technologies, depending on location and the capacity of the firm to absorb it.
Foreign-owned suppliers are more helpful in this regard than foreign customers or competitors.152
Affluent countries have used centres and hubs to serve as focal points for foreign investment. Ireland
has the SPOKES programme.153 Canada has Clean Growth Hubs.154 Transition countries are providing
subsidies for FDI. Lithuania has Smart FDI.155 Slovenia has the MGRT programme.156 Thailand has
Digital Park Thailand which provides both tax and non-tax incentives in a space designed for digital
global players to invest and for innovators to emerge.157
Preparing for smart factories – Smart factories can combine AI, open-source software, robotics, 3D
printing, cloud computing, and big data analytics. These are located primarily in developed countries,
but automobile-related smart factories are also springing up in Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and Viet
Nam.158 These require world-class high-speed Internet and cloud services integrated into broader
digital ecosystems. They will also need a workforce with the skills to thrive in smart workplaces.
Technical universities and technical colleges can work with factories to devise training programmes,
but national governments should be prepared to defray a substantial portion of the costs, especially in
the initial period. The ripple effects of smart factories will extend to second- and third-tier suppliers, but
these too will need to smarten up. They will need to receive up-to-the second data via the cloud and,
more importantly, make instant adjustments in design, production, and performance characteristics.
Governments will need to prepare a local cadre of smart suppliers to support these smart factories.
For this purpose, they can learn from the experiences of Mexico, Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Thailand
as well as more developed countries such as Republic of Korea.159 Governments, civil society and
local stakeholders will also need to develop parallel programmes to deploy frontier technologies for
the SDGs, including smart cities and smart farming.

FINDING INVESTORS

Seed-stage technology investors are generally unwilling to invest in products aimed at markets they do
not understand, where it may take longer to achieve profitability and where it is harder to sell the company
once it has grown. Several alternative models could be further explored.

Impact investment – In this case, the investor is looking beyond financial returns. Impact investing is
currently focused on developed countries and on mature private companies. Even impact investors
targeting developing countries are generally unwilling to invest in risky, unproven technologies and
business models. However, given its social and environmental orientation, impact investment could be
used to fund STI for the SDGs.
Venture capital – This is appropriate for countries that have some high-tech activity and scope for a
critical mass of startups and networks of angel investors.160
Crowdfunding – This is usually on a smaller scale and largely takes the form of donations, rewards and
preselling. At present it exists mainly in developed countries, focusing on social and artistic causes and
activities.
Innovation and technology funds – Financed by the public sector, international donors, development
banks or the private sector, these funds have become important instruments for innovation in developing
countries. They have the advantage of being relatively fast to introduce and flexible in design and operation.
They can also support strategic goals and target particular industries, activities or technologies.

There have been some successes. In 2018, annual equity funding for tech startups in Africa doubled to more
than $1 billion – around 2.5 per cent of total FDI.161 162 Nine countries received more than $10 million: Kenya,
Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Egypt, Malawi, Senegal, Rwanda and Ethiopia (Figure III 18). Some of the
largest recipients promote financial inclusion, such as Tala from Kenya which offers loans via a mobile app
using non-traditional loan scoring.163 But there has been less funding for solutions that promote the SDGs.
Education and health, for example, received less than 3 per cent of all equity funding (Figure III 19). In the
same year, total FDI to African countries amounted to $46 billion.

PREPARING THE WORKFORCE

Governments in low- and lower-middle-income developing countries should prepare their workforces with
specialized skills in Industry 4.0 technologies. This will require basic literacy and competencies in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics – as well as in design, management and entrepreneurship. These
countries will also need capacities for complex problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Given that
TABLE OF
CONTENT

58
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER III
Humans and machines at work

many of these capacities are usually learned by doing, countries will need to foster ecosystems of firms to
provide the jobs, training and experience.164
Some government plans anticipate increases in employment. Malaysia, for example, has set a goal of 14,270
jobs generated by IoT by 2020.165 The Republic of Korea sees the potential for IoT development to take the
country from 2,700 jobs in 2014 to 30,000 by 2020.166 Few plans address the concern about AI taking away
jobs. An exception is Finland’s, which has paid particular attention to the employment implications of AI.167
If these labour market transitions are also to achieve decent work and reduce inequality, they will need the
involvement of all relevant stakeholders, including trade unions – which have been under pressure with declining
membership in many countries.168 In the United States, precedent indicates that eliminating jobs through changes
in production processes is subject to negotiation, but specific clauses in contracts might eliminate that right.169
In an era of widespread automation, there is even speculation that labour unions may not survive.170
On the other hand, labour unions could take up new opportunities to represent workers’ legitimate concerns
about their jobs. Unions, working with broader coalitions, have achieved some changes and international
framework agreements with multinational corporations.171 Some multi-stakeholder campaigns have had dramatic
results: for example, after an energetic, broadly-based public campaign General Motors invested more than
$3 billion in Lansing, Michigan.172 Some labour leaders are viewing automation as an opportunity to establish
four-day working weeks and decent pay for everyone.173 In the United States, unions are drawing up plans to
confront autonomous vehicles.174 These include calls for a workforce transition fund, supported through fees on
autonomously driven vehicles.175 To prepare workers for more automated workplaces, unions are also promoting
professional training as an individual right.176
Governments can facilitate these dialogues. Germany weathered the 2008–09 recession better than some other
countries through a constructive relationship between businesses and unions.177 In Denmark, the Government
established a Council ensuring inclusion of all relevant stakeholders towards the adjustment process to frontier
technologies (see Box III 5). In Norway, the Government and the leaders of the trade unions and employers
agreed on the Norwegian Strategy for Skills Policy 2017–2021 and established a Skills Policy Council, a tripartite
group set up as a result of the agreement, which will follow up the progress. Preparation of workers should start
early and will need to be continuous:

Education systems – Governments should promote the study of STEM subjects, particularly among female
students, with at least as much attention to post-secondary technical opportunities as to university-level training.
Schools can use computer-based systems, and educators may be able to use AI tools to personalize the learning
experience and create more equal outcomes. Apprenticeship programmes that combine work- and schoolbased learning, for example, can support young people in transitioning from school to work. The United Kingdom
has a plan for growing the AI-ready workforce through 20,000 apprenticeships to be in place by 2020.178
Lifelong learning – The transition to frontier technologies and onwards will be a continuous process. This
training and re-training of workers will increasingly become the joint responsibility of governments, employers
and workers. Governments may also support workers in job transitions with job matching, personal counselling
and placement services. The EU’s vision for “resilient, sustainable and competitive manufacturing” plans both
to attract “young talents” and to retrain older workers.179 Malaysia’s Draft National Industry Policy Framework
emphasizes upskilling and reskilling labour pools.180
High-level expertise – As well as a broadly skilled workforce, countries will need concentrated, high-level
expertise – though this to some extent will foster an elite and worsen inequality. China’s 2025 strategy seeks
high-level professional and technical personnel, including university-trained advanced manufacturing engineers,
researchers, technicians, and “interdisciplinary professionals.”181 Under Italy’s policy initiative for Industry 4.0, by
2020, 200,000 students and 3,000 managers will be qualified in Industry 4.0 topics.182
Gender balance – Expanding a highly skilled specialist workforce, should allow better representation of women
and other groups normally underrepresented in science and engineering careers. Some countries see the
potential for AI systems to increase employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, by overcoming
physical or cognitive limitations.183

Social dialogue in Denmark for decent work and less inequality
To prepare for the future of work, Denmark has established the Disruption Council. This comprises ministries,
social partners and representatives of society. The Disruption Council’s initiatives include:

Agreement on a new unemployment benefit system
The agreement changes the rules for self-employed and atypical workers to bring them more in line with those for
employees when it comes to unemployment benefits and social assistance. This should offer greater security for
everyone regardless of their form of employment, and prepare for a more diverse labour market comprising fewer
permanent employees and more freelancers, platform workers and partially self-employed individuals.

National competence panel for higher education programmes
Higher education programmes need to respond to the changing competence requirements in the labour
market and adjust their curricula accordingly. For this purpose, the Government decided to establish a national
competence panel which will inform and advise the Minister of Higher Education and Science and higher
educational institutions about changes and trends in labour market demands.

Monitoring and supervision of competition conditions and tech giants
To support fair competition and consumer conditions, the Government plans to strengthen the Competition and
Consumer Authority’s supervision of digital platforms. The aim is to assess and detect abuses by big platforms in
their business conditions and pricing – and potential harm for competition especially for micro-enterprises, SMEs
and consumers.

Assistance for the most disadvantaged unemployed
The Council recognizes that there should be different paths into the labour market for those who have been
outside the labour market for long periods. In this regard, the Government intends to launch a partnership
to ensure closer cooperation between job centres, temporary work agencies and platform companies. The
partnership is to provide the most vulnerable unemployed persons with temporary employment opportunities
through which they can learn tasks and gain competencies.

PROVIDING INCOME SUPPORT

If joblessness becomes chronic, some observers foresee the need for stronger mechanisms of social
protection and income distribution.184 Social protection systems support workers during labour market
disruptions. However, only a third of the world’s population is covered by comprehensive social security,
while over half of the workforce has not social security at all.185 In addition, social protection systems
worldwide are under pressure – due to population ageing, smaller tax bases and low interest rates.
To address these challenges, a number of schemes have been proposed. They include negative
income tax, universal basic income, and workfare.

Negative income tax
In a normal system of income tax, citizens start to pay tax beyond a certain level of income. In a
system of negative income tax (NIT), if people are not reaching this threshold the government pays
them a percentage of the difference between that threshold and their income.186 It is designed so that
those who work make more money than those who don’t, and is simpler than providing subsidies for
specific items like food or housing while still offering incentives for work.187 Some studies show that
the evidence on NIT is mixed, with no overwhelming case for or against.188 Similarly with modelling
exercises. One study indicated that NIT can sharply reduce inequality and poverty, though at the
expense of output.189 Another predicted that in the United States NIT would show significant average
welfare gains, while increasing the proportion of high-productivity workers in the labour supply.190
Specific proposals for NIT have been made for Spain and Germany.191

Universal basic income
Another approach is for the government to offer everyone a minimum subsistence amount – a universal
basic income (UBI). The idea has been around for centuries, with proponents from across a broad range
of the political spectrum, from Friedrich Hayek to John Stuart Mill.192 193 But
given the potential for widespread job losses through automation, the idea is

The discussion on UBI has exploded in cyberspace.196 Others call it a “false

considerations of overall quality of life.198 There are also feminist and indigenous
perspectives.199

UBI lends itself to experimentation.200 Silicon Valley firms have expressed
interest in the mechanism and offered to fund trials.201 The city of Stockton, California, once described
as “America’s foreclosure capital,” has started its own experiment, distributing $500 a month to 130
residents of a low-income neighbourhood.202 Utrecht203 and Barcelona204 also have pilot projects. The
Canadian province of Ontario started an experiment but cancelled it within a year after a change in political
leadership.205 206 The results of an experiment in Finland showed that the unemployed individuals who
received monthly incomes were happier and healthier than a control group, but only marginally more likely
to find work.207 This result was not surprising since unemployment often arises from low skills, difficult life
situations, or health concerns.208
Proposals are by no means limited to affluent countries. Based on experience in India and Namibia,209 210
UBI has been proposed for the huge refugee populations in Syria.211 The case has also been made
for application in other low- and middle-income countries.212 Some parts of the developing world
have implemented their plans, including Macao, China, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Poland has a
programme, and in the Ukraine a private company is issuing credits.213 Alaska has a permanent fund.214
Several Native American nations have also distributed funds from joint investments, with positive effects.215

Public employment
Another way to address a shrinking private workforce is to increase the public workforce. One option
sometimes known as “workfare” includes public employment programmes on roadbuilding or other
infrastructure.216 In India, the benefits of such employment have been found to be large and greatly
underestimated.217
A second approach focuses on public employment. This can usefully be expanded for jobs that
invest in people, such as day-care, elder-care, education, and healthcare.218 These are skilled jobs,
that require more education and training than workfare jobs. They help to support households in the
middle of the income scale and can thus reduce inequality through both direct and spillover effects.219
Other more conventional steps to ameliorate lack of jobs and benefits include universal healthcare,
affordable education, and accessible childcare options; in short, a broader social safety net.

WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION

Paying for any of the options above will require increased resources. There have been a number of
proposals for widening taxation. The most directly relevant is a “robot tax” which would gather income
from the technologies that replace workers. If these workers were unable to move to non-routine
occupations, this would replace the income taxes they would otherwise have paid. For the United
States, for example, it has been suggested that a robot tax would be an optimal strategy when the
people displaced were still active in the labour force, but not after they had retired.220 Devising robot

Innovation with equity

or automation taxes raises a number of legal and other issues, starting from the legal definition of
robot and automation, and deciding how to impute an equivalent income value for robot activity. It
might also be possible to grant robots a “tax personality”.
Some researchers have dismissed these ideas since they could discourage efforts to increase
productivity, preferring instead to rebalance taxation between capital and labour income.221 If the
aim is to ensure that taxation is neutral between employing machines or people, this could be
accomplished by removing corporate tax deductions for automation, and creating an automation tax
to pay for unemployment schemes.222
Frontier technologies such as AI and blockchain open up the option of taxing cryptocurrency
operations – which would better target the relevant populations, activities and behaviours.223
Nevertheless, the increasing use of automation and AI in tax preparation and collection systems
could have unintended consequences; this needs to be carefully monitored to ensure that no one is
negatively affected by the actions of automated agents.224
Rather than taxing individuals or technologies through their income it might be more effective to tax
the resulting wealth. This principle received a lot of attention following the publication of Thomas
Piketty’s Capital in the 21st Century, in which a prominent recommendation was a global wealth
tax.225 He acknowledges that this may be impractical at present but would addresses the underlying
dynamic in the long run. This proposal has generated a remarkable range of comment.226 Critics
say it would hurt everyone by slowing down growth and that the same effect on distribution can be
achieved by existing taxation of capital gains and estates.227

7.

ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES

Many of the benefits of frontier technologies could be retained by a privilege few through the use of
intellectual property rights. One response to this is compulsory licensing – through which a government
or company can produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.
The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) allows for this,
covering the limitations and flexibilities of patent rights, but this is widely considered as an option of
last resort and is rarely used.
For solving ‘transactional bottlenecks’, private actions by industry may be more effective than statutory
interventions.228 Alternative collaborative arrangements include patent pooling, clearing houses, and
open source licensing. Governments can also buy out patents.
At the same time, governments can finance R&D while requiring that the benefits serve the public
good. This could include research grants and tax credits along with prizes and advance purchase
commitments for innovative products that address sustainable development concerns. At the same
time, international scientific collaboration can ensure that the skills in data analytics and machine
learning tools are more evenly spread between countries.
***
Frontier technologies can increase productivity and enable economic diversification in developing
countries, but they are also likely to affect inequalities within and between countries. The outcomes
will vary by sector and depend on the capacities of countries, and on their policies and strategies.
Some jobs and functions may become redundant while other jobs would be created. In the short term,
some workers would lose their jobs and would have to find other occupations. But in the medium
term there might be consistently fewer jobs in certain occupations and more in others. Change may
also be faster than people’s ability to adapt; some may never do so and will need long-term support.
Nevertheless, experience shows that new technologies permeate over time to the various economic
sectors and social activities and that governments can limit negative impacts on inequality by
preparing people, firms and institutions for change. Overall, governments need to facilitate the use,
adoption and adaptation of frontier technologies while mitigating the potential adverse effects.

INNOVATION WITH
EQUITY

CHAPTER IV
Innovation with equity

This chapter considers frontier technologies from the perspective of final users. It examines how
people are affected by goods and services that embody these technologies. In particular it considers
how the poor may be disadvantaged, either by lack of access, biased design or just unintended
consequences. Governments can direct technology towards sustainable development by extending
the access to digital infrastructure and STI skills and scaling up innovations that target the poor.

A.

TECHNOLOGIES AFFECTING INEQUALITIES THROUGH DESIGN AND
ACCESS

Frontier technologies have huge potential for improving people’s lives and protecting the planet
(Box IV 1). During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, AI and big data have been used for
screening patients, monitoring the outbreak, tracking and tracing cases of the disease, predicting its
evolution and assessing infection risks. Other examples have ranged from the use of IoT to monitor
the quality of groundwater in Bangladesh, to the use of drones to deliver medical supplies to remote
communities in Rwanda and Ghana.1
But technology is rarely a solution on its own. Problems such as poverty, hunger, and climate change,
or inequalities in health or education are inevitably complex and multidimensional.2 Technology is
neither inherently good nor bad; it is a means to an end. Technology, frontier or otherwise, may
support initiatives of all kinds, social, political, or environmental, but all technology needs to be used
carefully if it is to help rather than hinder.
Developers should also be mindful that the ways that they design, and that people use, technologies
can have unintended consequences (For a detailed discussion see Annex C. How technologies affect
inequalities in the user’s perspective). Given that many frontier technologies have general-purpose
usages, they could have a significant impact on the economies and societies as well as on the
development of other technologies, and trigger multiple side effects.3
The impact of these technologies on inequalities will also depend on how they are produced and
distributed. Initially, they are likely to benefit the better off. When companies develop new technologies
for goods and services they focus on wealthier consumers who can bear higher initial prices and thus
benefit first while contributing more to further development.
One of the most critical aspects is access
– which can be considered to comprise a
combination of “five A’s”: availability, affordability,
awareness, accessibility, and ability for effective
use (Figure IV 1).4 An example is Amazon’s AI
virtual assistant Alexa which is available in many
countries but not yet in all languages. In many
countries, it can only respond to people who
speak English. It also limited to those who can
pay for the hardware and the bandwidth.

Access to technology can also be restricted
by social norms – for women, ethnic minorities
and other disadvantaged groups, even within
the same household. New technologies pose
particular challenges to women, given their
underrepresentation in STEM fields and the
persistent gender gap in access to, and use of,
digital technologies.

technologies – so that they reflect, reproduce and perhaps amplify each society’s specific interests and
priorities.5 Currently most technologies are created by firms in the global North and predominantly by
men.6 Inequalities also affect the direction of innovation in ways that could further increase disparities;
for example, by focusing on the demands of the rich and crowding out innovation towards solutions
that benefit the poor.

Box IV 1

Frontier technologies for the SDGs
Frontier technologies are expected to become cheaper and easier to access and use. Some of the most important
developments have been in energy. The cost of solar panels has fallen by a factor of more than 100 over the last
40 years, and by 75 per cent over the past 10 years.7 Low-cost, high-efficiency solar panels can be used for
household rooftop solar installations as well as for village-level micro- and mini-grids. Household rooftop two-year
rent-to-own plans are priced as low as $6 per month.8 Over the coming years, there are likely to be further
breakthroughs in the design and manufacture of photovoltaic cells and battery storage systems, with possibly
the advent, in the not-too-distant future, of printed organic solar cells.9 10
Frontier technologies make it possible to shift from large, centralized water and power plants, for example,
to small-scale, distributed delivery systems such as village mini-grids, rooftop solar systems, and village or
urban neighbourhood water purification and distribution kiosks. These smaller scale distributed facilities are less
expensive to install and operate. They also potentially allow for more community control.
Other frontier technology breakthroughs include:
COVID-19 Management – Rwanda is deploying high-tech robots produced by the Belgian company
Zorabots,11 to “perform a number of tasks related to COVID-19 management, including mass temperature
screening, delivering food and medication to patients, capturing data, detecting people who are not
wearing masks, among others”.12 It is also using sophisticated mathematical algorithms developed by a
local epidemiologist to minimize the cost and maximize the effectiveness of COVID-19 testing.13
Water purification – With respect to SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, there is now an array of
high-performance, affordable water purification filters. These can covert polluted fresh water, brackish
water, and saltwater into WHO-quality potable water. Some filters can even be 3D printed.14 Further
innovations in this area could include the production of filters on-site and for personal use, making them
more readily available to remote communities.
Off-grid solar-powered services – In remote rural areas of Rwanda, Zambia, and India, the company Vanu
is providing off-grid, solar-powered, voice and data services.15 These are based on “ground-breaking
research in software radio at MIT,” For communities without grid power or Internet connectivity, these
services are providing many benefits to communities, through advances in agricultural extension (SDG 2),
telemedicine (SDG 3) and distance education (SDG 4).
Waste management – Waste-to-energy processes generate low-cost, renewable energy from animal and
human waste, organic waste from farming and food processing, industrial waste, and municipal garbage.
These frontier technologies also mitigate environmental damage from landfill and wastewater run-off into
ground and surface water.16
Sewer maintenance – A robot developed in India cleans sewer manholes remotely using computer vision
and robotic arms. The robots do away with the inhuman practice of manual scavenging. The company that
developed and deployed these robots is also training the scavengers, who are primarily from the lowest
castes, to become robot operators, thereby giving their families a life of dignity.17
Earthquake risks – Machine learning coupled with drone and satellite imaging can be used to develop risk
maps for rapidly growing cities in Africa and elsewhere. AI can help assess which buildings are at high
risk of collapse and therefore in need of retrofitting before the next earthquake or typhoon. New and more
affordable materials coupled with new construction technologies can enable poor households to retrofit
houses that are in danger of structural collapse.18
These examples are only the tip of the frontier technology iceberg. There are hundreds if not thousands of
solutions spanning the entire range of frontier technologies and SDGs.

Innovation with equity

Technological change is also shaped by gender inequalities. This is partly because men have been
more likely than women to study STEM subjects and have STEM careers, but the bias also extends
into the marketplace. One study concluded that women found it ten times more difficult than men to
secure investment for their technological innovations.19 It is also generally difficult to secure funding
for technologies that address women’s issues and priorities.

B.

RISKS OF BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION

Many of the concerns raised on the use of frontier technologies are related to biased design and the
unintended consequences of AI, and inequalities and ethical considerations of gene editing.

1.

AI ALGORITHMS WITH BUILT IN BIAS

Some products have built-in biases, designed or learned. Human beings also take biased decisions, but they
are more accountable and better able to explain their reasoning. AI, for example, can make biased decisions
on social questions for, say, the entitlements to benefits or automated legal aid for immigration applications. In
the United Kingdom, a survey in 2020 found that nearly half of local councils had used computer algorithms
to help make decisions about benefit claims, on who gets social housing and other issues – despite concerns
about their reliability.20
AI can also perpetuate stereotypes and reduce the benefit of products for women. For example, voice-recognition
in cars that reacts better to lower-pitched voices,21 fitness trackers that underestimate predominantly femaleassociated activities such as housework,22 and translation technologies that are gender-biased.23
In 2014 in the United States, an AI system for recruiting software engineers was found to penalize résumés
that contained the word “women”.24 This bias was not coded into the algorithm, but the AI learned it from the
company’s historical recruitment pattern. After identifying the problem, a fix was introduced. Nevertheless,
there were no guarantees that the system would not learn other biases and it was abandoned. Similar biases
can affect other groups. For example, in 2016 in the United States, an AI system to assist judges in making
better sentencing decisions based on predictions of the likelihood of criminals re-offending was found to be
biased against ethnic minorities.25
Another bias issue concerning public services is that some groups are overrepresented in government
databases especially those for social services.26 This overidentification arises as people applying for services
have to provide more information about themselves. For instance, when seeking treatment for drug addiction,
people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to use public clinics, while wealthier people
can get help privately. Governments thus tend to have less data on the wealthy who can thus remain under
the radar for behaviours that might raise red flags.27 This could matter when decisions are made on sensitive
issues. For example, if there are concerns about child welfare poor people are more likely to lose custody.
Algorithms also affect which groups are exposed to certain advertisements.28 One study found that being
signed into a Google account as a woman reduced the likelihood of seeing advertisements for higher-paying
positions.29 This finding was echoed in an experiment on Facebook, where ads for housing and employment
opportunities were skewed along racial and gender lines.30 Another empirical study found that cost-optimizing
algorithms were showing women fewer ads promoting job opportunities in STEM fields because women were
considered a prized demographic and ads of expensive products crowded out the job opportunity ads.31
Biases within AI systems can arise in a number of ways, either because they employ biased algorithms or they
use biased data for training.32 Biases may also arise from the use of fuzzy data where there are no clear binary
choices. For example, screening tweets from Twitter, or images from Instagram, or videos on TikTok, require
judgements on social acceptability. An AI system has to be programmed with, or develop, a measure – which
will inevitably be fuzzy and socially dependent.33 Some of the areas to consider are listed in Table IV 1.34
Efforts may be made to hide sensitive fields from algorithms, such as those on race and gender. But learning
algorithms can use probabilistic methods to recreate these fields and make discriminatory decisions. Artificial
agents learning from human-derived data will often learn human biases, both good and bad.35

Table IV 1

Types of biases in AI systems
Type
Historical Bias
Representation Bias
Measurement Bias
Evaluation Bias

Description
Historical bias is the already existing bias and socio-technical issues in the world and can seep into
from the data generation process even given a perfect sampling and feature selection.
Representation bias happens from the way we define and sample from a population.
Measurement bias happens from the way we choose, utilize, and measure a particular feature.
Evaluation bias happens during model evaluation.

Aggregation Bias

Aggregation bias happens when false conclusions are drawn for a subgroup based on observing
other different subgroups or generally when false assumptions about a population affect the model’s
outcome and definition.

Population Bias

Population bias arises when statistics, demographics, representatives, and user characteristics are
different in the user population represented in the dataset or platform from the original target population.

Simpson’s Paradox

According to Simpson’s paradox, a trend, association, or characteristic observed in underlying
subgroups may be quite different from association or characteristic observed when these subgroups
are aggregated. This can bias the analysis of heterogeneous data that is composed of subgroups or
individuals with different behaviours.

Sampling Bias
Behavioural Bias

Sampling bias arises due to non-random sampling of subgroups.
Behavioural bias arises from different user behaviour across platforms, contexts, or different dataset.

Content Production
Bias

Content Production bias arises from structural, lexical, semantic, and syntactic differences in the
contents generated by users.

Linking Bias

Linking bias arises when network attributes obtained from user connections, activities, or interactions
differ and misrepresent the true behaviour of the users.

Temporal Bias

Temporal bias arises from differences in populations and behaviours over time.

Popularity Bias

Items that are more popular tend to be exposed more. However, popularity metrics are subject to
manipulation—for example, by fake reviews or social bots.

Algorithmic Bias

Algorithmic bias is when the bias is not present in the input data and is added purely by the algorithm.

User Interaction Bias

User Interaction bias is a type of bias that can not only be observant on the Web but also get triggered
from two sources—the user interface and through the user itself by imposing his/her self-selected
biased behaviour and interaction.

Presentation Bias
Ranking Bias
Social Bias

Presentation bias is a result of how information is presented.
The idea that top-ranked results are the most relevant and important will result in the attraction of more
clicks than others.
Social bias happens when other people’s actions or content coming from them affect our judgment.

Emergent Bias

Emergent bias happens as a result of use and interaction with real users. This bias arises as a result
of a change in the population, cultural values, or societal knowledge, usually sometime after the
completion of the design.

Self-Selection Bias

Self-selection bias is a subtype of the selection or sampling bias in which subjects of the research
select themselves.

Omitted Variable Bias
Cause-Effect Bias

Omitted variable bias occurs when one or more important variables are left out of the model.
Cause-effect bias can happen as a result of the fallacy that correlation implies causation.

Observer Bias

Observer bias happens when researchers subconsciously project their expectations onto the research.

Funding Bias

Funding bias arises when biased results are reported in order to support or satisfy the funding agency
or financial supporter of the research study.

GENOMIC INEQUALITIES

The development and application of gene-editing technology should bring a number of benefits but
they are likely to be unevenly distributed – with three main sources of inequalities: R&D inequalities,
data inequalities, and therapy inequalities due to affordability.

R&D inequalities
Most human genomic centres around are in developed countries; very few in developing countries,
which have also produced only few biomedical publications.36 37 This is largely due to the high
costs of equipment and the lack of scientific personnel with sufficient training and experience.38 But
developing countries may also hesitate to invest in genomic research given that they have more
pressing health-related issues such as poverty, infectious diseases, and the lack of basic infrastructure.

Data inequalities
Most genomic data has been gathered from people in developed countries, very little from developing
countries.39 Data are typically produced through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) which
scan the genomes of many people to find variations associated with a particular disease. In these
studies, 96 per cent of subjects have been of European descent.40
Similarly, Africa carries the highest burden of both infectious and non-communicable diseases, and
hosts the greatest genetic diversity within its population, but only seven of the thousands of GWASs,
have been conducted exclusively on African participants.41 By 2017, less than 10 per cent of GWAS
data were coming from African populations, although this proportion is increasing.42 This is mainly
because Africa lacks the necessary biomedical research infrastructure or computation resources for
large-scale genomics studies. In collaborative research, African scientists generally only participate
in sample collection.43 This research has received little support from governments but there are some
initiatives to engage Africa in genomics research – such as the H3Africa Consortium, the Wellcome
Trust DELTAS programme, and the GSK Africa OpenLab.44
Other developing regions have also been under-represented. India, for example, has 20 per cent of
the world’s population yet its citizens have provided only 1 per cent of genetic data.45 Several startup
companies are seeking to gather more data from Asian populations. For example, GenomeAsia 100K
aims to create reference genomes of all major Asian ethnic groups starting with the sequences of
100,000 people.46

Therapy inequalities due to non-affordability
There is a similar imbalance in clinical trials. Most have been carried out in the United States (63 per cent)
and Europe (23 per cent). Most non-clinical gene-editing studies have also been conducted in the
United States (55 per cent), and China (19 per cent).47 This is mainly because gene therapy is costly.
Drug companies need to recoup the costs of initial development, and of production which has to be
tailored to each patient so is labour-intensive and expensive.48 Companies will also need to follow up
with patients for years. The rarer the disease, the fewer the eligible number of patients to cover the
costs and the more expensive the treatment. Glybera, for example, was developed to treat adults
with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, but at $ 1.1 million per treatment was only sold once in Europe
before it was withdrawn from the market due to lack of demand.49

3.

GENE EDITING AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Gene-editing is also constrained by patents.50 For some breakthrough biological research tools,
such as recombinant DNA and small interfering RNAs, companies and academic institutions can
get non-exclusive licenses. But in the case of CRISPR each patent-owning institution grants exclusive
licenses only for specific fields of use.51 There has already been a well-publicised patent battle over
TABLE OF
CONTENT

75
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CATCHING TECHNOLOGICAL WAVES
Innovation with equity

CRISPR technology between the Broad Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
University of California, Berkley.52
Patents on gene editing technologies are primarily held in large industrial firms or by academic institutions,
many of which go on to form business ventures. Most are in the United States but there are increasing
numbers in China.53 This raises the prospect of monopoly ownership of technologies which could limit
their contribution to achieving the SDGs, particularly those related to food production and health.
Article 27.2 of the TRIPS Agreement states that “[m]embers may exclude from patentability inventions,
the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect
public order or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious
prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation
is prohibited by their law.” However, no legal guidance is provided on what constitutes morality, which
is influenced by the cultural norms of different countries.
Patents are intended to encourage innovation and incentivize investment in research, but they can
also stifle further innovation, limiting access to critical genetic information. International cooperation in
genomic research will need to address patent protection issues to make gene therapies more accessible
and affordable for sustainable development.

4.

ETHICAL QUESTIONS IN GENE EDITING

The principle of using this new technology for genetic enhancement could also be very divisive since
it raises questions of what constitutes an ideal human being. This could result in the development of
an underclass of people who cannot afford genetic treatment.54
Moreover, if this technology is used to eliminate genetic disabilities it sends a clear message to those
in the disabled community about society’s view and value of their lives.55 56 The unregulated use of
germline gene editing would result in the termination of pregnancies based on these discriminations.57 58
In place of necessary societal change, germline gene editing proposes a technological solution. This
furthers the rhetoric that the disabled community has little to offer society because their disabilities,
viewed as problems, can be “fixed” with technology. An additional complex conversation concerns
who decides what conditions germline gene editing would target.
The process of gene editing also has specific implications for women.59 Research in germline gene
editing requires massive numbers of human eggs, and the long-term health effects of egg harvesting
are not well known. Current forms of assisted reproductive technologies already put women at risk
for obstetric and other maternal health complications.60 Germline gene editing runs the same risks as
both preimplantation genetic diagnosis and in vitro fertilization. Women partaking in germline gene
editing studies may also run unforeseen risks if edited foetal DNA enters the maternal bloodstream.61
It is important to consider the potential health risks for women in developing and implementing the
technology.62

THE LEGAL, ETHICAL AND MORAL BOUNDARIES
OF USING GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES ARE
INCREASINGLY UNCLEAR, CREATING
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR MISUSE AND ABUSE
Germline gene editing encourages the belief that parents should risk everything to give their child
the best start to life. This could put them under pressure to use the technology to optimize the life
chances of their children.63 This is worrisome eugenic vision for the future – one where the human
population is divided into two species: superhuman edited races and backward unedited races.64
TABLE OF

CHAPTER IV
Innovation with equity

It could also have military implications if research can be weaponized to target and harm specific
population groups. Gene-editing could also be used by armies to select for intelligence combined
with physical strength and resistance to injury and pain.65 The legal, ethical and moral boundaries of
using genetic technologies are increasingly unclear, creating opportunities for their misuse and abuse.

C.

CHALLENGES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Developing countries face particular challenges in promoting equal access to the benefits of frontier
technologies. Three main issues are the higher level of income disparities, digital divides and shortage
of skills.

1.

HIGHER INCOME POVERTY66

The major issue is the higher level of income disparities in developing countries as compared with developed
countries and the large share of the population in the lower end of the income distribution, with persistent
pockets of extreme poverty, particularly in rural areas. Income disparity translates into inequalities in social
and environmental dimensions, for example in health, education and higher vulnerability to disasters, which
are further magnified by social biases and discrimination, affecting women and girls disproportionately.
As a result, access to goods and services is inherently more difficult for a larger share of the population in
developing countries. The effect of affordability of technology on its broader access is a well-established
fact in the deployment of digital technologies.67 This challenge is common for access to any product or
technology – from clean water and sanitation to digital learning, from bicycles to air tickets.
Poor communities are harder to reach. In this case the barriers are not
technological but economic and social. Frontier technologies make it technically
possible to disperse many important services or products to poor communities.
Nevertheless, installing, managing, operating, repairing, financing, and collecting
payments from hundreds, if not thousands, of widely dispersed facilities will be
logistically and administratively complex.

Poor communities
are harder to reach.
In this case the
barriers are not
technological but
economic and social.

Consider the provision of safe, reliable, affordable access to potable water.
Scientists have developed nano filters that convert saltwater, brackish water
or polluted fresh water into WHO-quality potable water.68 But for a purification
mechanism to be operational it needs to be combined with pumps, hoses, and
cisterns. It also needs a financially sustainable business model for distributing
water to customers, collecting payments, and operating, maintaining and repairing the equipment.

The scientist who invented the nano filter is unlikely to leave the lab to devote time, money, and effort to
organizing and managing these tasks in hundreds or potentially thousands of scattered communities.
Someone needs to undertake this work – whether an equipment supplier, a local or international NGO, a
social enterprise, or community members themselves.
There are similar challenges in marketing new agriculture technology to smallholder subsistence farmers.
Many live in poorer, more remote regions with inadequate or non-existent infrastructure that makes them
expensive to reach. Moreover, they can be reluctant to depart from traditional practices due to local,
culturally-specific beliefs and socio-economic values.69 And those who want to take up new technologies
may be unable to afford them, or subsequently gain access to markets that would enable them to convert
greater productivity into higher incomes.
All too often, it is assumed that once an appropriate frontier technology solution has been developed
deployment will follow automatically, or that the scientists and engineers who invented a technology
can just use online platforms to identify people and communities who need it. Unfortunately deploying
technology is neither simple nor automatic and cannot be relegated to an afterthought.

DIGITAL DIVIDES

Many frontier technologies rely on steady, high-speed fixed Internet connections, such as fibre optic cable,
or on high-speed mobile connections. In the case of broadband many developing countries do not have
adequate digital infrastructure, and for most of their people Internet costs are prohibitive. Almost half of the
world’s population remains offline and there are huge regional, gender and other divides. The gaps between
countries are shown in Figure IV 2. In developed countries in 2018, around 33 per cent of the inhabitants had
fixed broadband subscriptions, while in developing countries the proportion was only 11 per cent. In 2018,
around 80 per cent of people in Europe were using the Internet, while in Sub-Saharan Africa the proportion
was only 25 per cent and in the least developed countries only 20 per cent.

Progress has been faster for mobile internet
connectivity. This is because the upfront costs for
mobile network infrastructure are lower, especially
for the last-mile connection. Globally in 2018 there
were 83 active mobile broadband subscriptions
per 100 inhabitants, though the number was lower
in developing countries at 75, and in the least
developed countries at 33.70

provider in Africa and Western Asia, for example, data use ranges from 200 MB per person per month in
Yemen to more than 5 GB in the Islamic Republic of Iran.71
These differences in use reflect differences in cost. In high-income countries the monthly price of 1GB of
data represents, on average, 1.1 per cent of GDP per capita per month, but in low-income countries this
proportion is more than 20 per cent (Figure IV 3). There are similar cost issues for mobile broadband. In most
developed countries, the cost of 1.5 GB of use remains below 2 per cent of per capita GNI, but in the least
developed countries the cost is higher; it costs between 5 and 10 per cent in 15 of these countries, 10 to 20
per cent in another seven, and above 20 per cent in the other nine.72
People’s Internet use is often constrained by high prices. In Argentina, Colombia, Ghana, Guatemala,
Paraguay, Peru and Rwanda, more than half of households limit their Internet use because of the cost.73
Moreover, even before they connect, many people still struggle to buy a device: in low- and middle-income
countries, many people do not own a phone because they cannot afford one.74

3.

SHORTAGE OF SKILLS

It is not necessarily easy to use frontier technologies. Many require at least literacy and numeracy skills,
and an aptitude for learning by doing. As more services, whether from the private sector or governments,
move online, people without either the connections or the necessary skills or aptitudes are increasingly
at a disadvantage. Digitalization of public services and the mandatory use of digital channels to access
social services and benefits, can improve efficiency and transparency, but could also punish the poorest.75
To some extent low literacy skills are now easier to overcome, by voice control of smartphones for example.
In 2018, in high-income countries 74 per cent of mobile connections were through smartphones. In subSaharan Africa the proportion was only 40 per cent, but the situation has been improving: between 2014
and 2018 smartphone use in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 28 percentage points.76
Nevertheless, benefiting from these technologies requires skills beyond basic literacy.77 At the very least,
these digital skills include the ability to understand digital media, to find information, and use these tools
to communicate with others. This requirement has been highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when
people needed digital skills not just for communicating, but also for finding information, buying food and
supplies online, and using new software and applications. Users also need to be critical of the content that
is delivered through digital platforms so as to counteract malicious misinformation and the use of fake news.
Most people are relative beginners: 30 per cent of individuals lack basic skills such as using copy and
paste tools.78 Only two out of five people have standard skills such as installing and configuring software
according to their needs. Typically in developing countries, the basic and standard skills are on average
10 to 20 percentage points lower than they are in developed countries (Figure IV 4) though, as technology
develops, the skills required and the fault lines between users and non-users are likely to shift.79
Without specific policies, strategies and programmes to promote the adoption of these technologies,
developing countries risk falling further behind – aggravating and perpetuating inequalities between
countries.

DIRECTING TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Public policy needs to guide innovation in new and emerging technologies so as to support sustainable
development, while dealing with any negative effects and ensuring that no-one is left behind. Governments
have a broad range of instruments, from regulatory measures and economic and fiscal instruments, to
education and regional policies that support innovation. While encouraging change, policymakers can
influence its direction and mitigate the risks of increased inequality. Governments should explore ways
to make goods and services that use frontier technologies benefit vulnerable and low-income groups,
including by offering services free, while extending access to digital infrastructure and skills. These efforts
can be supported by the international community, which can foster an inclusive global dialogue about
all aspects of fast technological change and its impact on society, including the ethical and normative
dimensions. International organizations can also help establish the appropriate governance frameworks.
At the same time, it will be important to have extensive social activism and grassroots innovation. All this
will mean expanding capacities in technology assessment at national, regional and international levels.

1.

SETTING ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS

There is the increasing concern about the ethical principles that are shaping technological development,
particularly AI (See Box IV 2). Many voluntary initiatives are aiming to ensure that the processes and
outcomes are fair, transparent, accountable, and inclusive. Over 160 principles, guidelines, and frameworks
have been developed by academics, NGOs and industry, along with governments and supranational
bodies. These are listed in Annex D.
In 2019, to contribute to the broader public debate, the United Nations, published a strategy on new
technologies,80 and established the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation.81 This has been a particular
concern for UNESCO which in 2020 released the first draft of its Advice on the ethics of artificial intelligence,
for possible adoption by UNESCO’s 41st General Conference in 2021.82 UNESCO’s advisory body, the
World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology, has addressed the issue of
robotics ethics.83
The wealth of diverse initiatives has revealed different and sometimes conflicting emphases and priorities.84
Overall, they do not endorse one single ethical principle but generally converge around five principles:
transparency, justice/fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility, and privacy. Translating these principles
into policies for global governance will require cross-national harmonization while respecting cultural
diversity and moral pluralism.85
Regarding gene editing, several prominent scientists, including some who worked on the development of
the original CRISPR technology, have called for a global moratorium on heritable gene-editing until there
is broad societal agreement on the use of the technology, the safety issues are addressed, and the longterm biological consequences are sufficiently understood.86
The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the European Society of Human
Genetics have identified many societal concerns including disability rights, the undermining of reproductive
autonomy, and enhanced or ‘designer’ babies. At the same time there are potential advantages of human
gene-editing by improving health and respecting reproductive autonomy, especially of people at high
genetic risk of having a child with a serious disorder.87
The World Health Organisation has formed an expert advisory committee on “developing global standards
for governance and oversight of human genome editing” which first met in March 2019. The committee will
examine the scientific, ethical, social and legal challenges and make Advices on appropriate governance
mechanisms.

CHAPTER IV
Innovation with equity

Despite the different viewpoints, at least two arguments are consistent throughout.88 First, the
need for further research and a greater understanding of the risks and benefits of human germline
gene-editing. Second, the need for on-going discussion involving a wide range of stakeholders
regarding the potential clinical use and ethical and societal issues.
Normative and ethical considerations are also being deliberated for other frontier technologies,
including synthetic biology, IoT, nanotechnology, drones, and neuro-technologies. All these discourses
must include developing countries, especially the least developed countries, which may not be
producing frontier technologies but will certainly be affected by them.

Box IV 2

AI as a global enterprise*
At a Politico event in Brussels in 2019 I was asked what kept me awake about AI if I think there are enough people
worrying about the ethical issues, and my answer was diversity. I include diversity very much as part of the ethics
of AI. I like to make the point that if it isn’t diverse, i.e. developed by a diverse team, then it isn’t ethical. It is so
important that AI products and services are developed by interdisciplinary and diverse teams so that they work
for the whole of society, not just a subset of it. This is particularly important in developing countries where they
may not currently have many people or companies with the technical skills needed to develop AI products and
services, but they will need to have people and companies who can support the deployment of AI throughout the
public and private sectors. This will require diverse – in the broadest sense of the word – sets of skills to ensure
the AI technology used is good for society and the development of emerging economies.
As developing countries create their own AI strategies, top of the agenda has to be skills. They need to foster
AI awareness throughout the education system and attract the brightest and the best to become involved in the
AI sector, both in terms of developing their own skills base of AI developers, and a skills base of policy makers,
company executives, lawyers, educators etc. who can steer the adoption of AI throughout the public and private
sectors and the adaptation of AI products and services into their own culture and economy to best effect. Above
all they need leaders who understand the importance of AI for the future development of any country and the
need for it to be managed and utilised responsibly. This has to be set in the context of the overall digital strategy
for each country.
We urgently need practical tools, techniques and methodologies to enable AI companies throughout the world
to develop AI in a responsible way as a matter of process, and governments to ensure, through the right mix of
regulation and practical guidelines, that this is the case. This will inevitably include data curation, analysis and
provenance tools to enable companies to detect data and algorithmic bias and check the veracity of data, tools
for explaining the output of an AI algorithm, and tools for performing AI audits to check that algorithms are doing
what the companies claim they are supposed to be doing, amongst many other things that will be required as the
AI developments of today move to become a mature industrial sector. We should be putting a lot more research
and innovation funding into this area as there are many problems to be solved before we can develop effective
and efficient solutions that can be used to underpin government regulations.
We can also learn from what has happened in the past with the development of scientific and technological
breakthroughs that can be potentially devastating if not dealt with responsibly, but have huge potential to deliver
world-changing and indeed life-saving results for the common good. For example, the world has relatively successfully
constrained the use of nuclear energy and biochemical agents in warfare, whilst harnessing those technologies for
the good of society. We need to do the same for AI, but hopefully we can achieve global agreements in this area
before a global disaster occurs rather than after. The United Nations will potentially play a very significant role here.
The United Nations can also play an important role to ensure that AI is used to support the Sustainable
Development Goals throughout the world. We will see the deployment of AI being managed differently in different
countries and different cultures to better meet local and regional needs. An interesting example here on a recent
visit to Dubai, where they were talking about cloud seeding to induce rain – an obvious application of AI as the
technology matures. If every country in the world seeks technology to disturb natural weather patterns for the
local good - we may have global agreement as to its application for the common good.
As mentioned earlier, the issue of ethics and AI is really important and it is one that needs to be discussed at all
levels – local, regional, national and international – but at the same time it is necessary to build AI systems in a

responsible way so we can see the effects they have, both good and bad, and can use the results to develop
ethical policies and frameworks for AI companies to comply with in practical ways. These should include diversity
in its broadest sense, and again this is something the UN can support globally at the highest levels.
National AI strategies are really important but it is just as important that we collaborate internationally as compete.
AI has the potential to solve or help manage the biggest challenges that society faces in the 21st century. If
countries pool resources (data, research results, expertise etc.) they could achieve a lot more a lot faster and still
enable companies to compete internationally to sell the products and services that are produced as a result. It is
also important to find ways to come to agreement internationally about what are the biggest threats that AI could
pose to human civilisation and seek to mitigate against these becoming a reality in a future world. It is here that
the role of international organisations like the United Nations become very important.

CONDUCTING TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT AND ASSESSMENTS

Technology assessments (TAs) examine the societal effects of technologies – analysing different
techno-system paths and their impacts on inclusive and sustainable development.89 A TA should be
problem oriented as well as scientific, interactive and communicative. It should help shape public and
political opinion on the social aspects of science and technology, on its risks and opportunities, and
it should provide effective, pragmatic and sustainable policy options.
New types of TA use broader inputs and go beyond purely technical or accounting exercises.90
They can catalyse social, political, and inter-institutional debates on the pros, cons, and associated
uncertainties across alternative directions (Box IV 3). They can involve foresight exercises bringing
together key agents of change and sources of knowledge, to explore possible scenarios and develop
strategic visions and intelligence to shape the future.
Technology assessment and foresight were important tools for policymaking in the 1980s and 1990s,
with many countries establishing technology assessment units in the parliament to inform legislation.
In the 2000s, the notion of technology assessment became somewhat out of fashion, with concerns
of being dependent of political interests and power struggles.91 But now there is an increasing interest
in TA and it is crucial to revive and develop national capacities in TA and foresight so as to enable
countries to identify and exploit the potential of frontier technologies for sustainable development.

Box IV 3

UNCTAD’s technical assistance on technology assessment
In 2021, UNCTAD is launching the project “Technology assessment in the energy and agricultural sectors in
Africa to accelerate progress on Science, Technology and Innovation.” The project aims to build capacity in three
selected African countries to carry out technology assessments in the energy and agricultural sectors, and to
utilize technologies as catalysts for sustainable development. The technology assessment activities will focus
on new and emerging technologies that have the potential to improve access to modern energy services and
enhance agricultural productivity and livelihoods.
The proposed technology assessments would also consider how new technologies contribute to solving
problems specific to women and girls or that affect them particularly. Through the principle of “leaving no one
behind”, gender considerations will inform project analysis, design, implementation and evaluation. Considering
the COVID-19 pandemic, the project will also investigate how technologies applied within the agricultural and
energy sectors can support improved resilience to pandemics and massive, short-term shocks, and help the
beneficiary African countries build the future better.

SUPPORTING INCLUSIVE INNOVATION

Inclusive innovation on frontier technologies needs a supportive ecosystem. Even the most brilliant
innovative or scientific mind will struggle to bring products to scale in a geographically remote
area. At the same time, decades of efforts on technology innovation for development have shown
the dangers of introducing technologies to resource-poor settings without meaningfully involving
people in the innovation process. The emergence of India and China as major innovation players has
somewhat increased the flow of relevant, innovative technologies addressing the needs of low-income
populations, but usually innovation worldwide still targets the needs of the middle-classes and above.
Lower-income countries will need assistance if they are to develop the capacity for inclusive
innovation. An example of an international cooperation to assist on that task is UNCTAD’s programme
on STI Policy Reviews, which helps developing countries strengthen their national innovation systems
(see Box IV 4). STI deployment roadmaps could help stakeholders identify adapt, adopt, and deploy
at scale the frontier technologies that will help them achieve the SDGs. For this purpose, the United
Nations has a Global Pilot Programme on STI for SDGs Roadmaps. These roadmaps should spell
out what is needed in terms of capacities and resources, as well as the various responsibilities of
governments, NGOs and enterprises and potential support from bilateral and multilateral development
partners.

Box IV 4

UNCTAD’s STIP Reviews: Strengthening national innovation systems of developing Countries
UNCTAD’s STIP Review programme aims to support the development of national productive capacity in
developing countries and the achievement of the SDGs through technological development and innovation.
Reviews are conceived to support STI policy-making in developing countries by assessing the effectiveness of
their current STI policies and identifying priorities for action leading to sustainable development outcomes.
STIP Reviews are undertaken at the request of member States. Following an extensive review and evaluation of
the country’s STI actors, networks, interactions, institutions, capabilities, policies and the overall environment,
which involves consultations with all the STI stakeholders, a diagnosis is established and policy options formulated
and presented to the STI policymakers and then to the other national STI players.
The outcome of the analysis is documented in a STIP Review report which sets out an action plan for consideration
by the Government. The STIP report is disseminated through the UNCTAD intergovernmental mechanisms, the
CSTD and among national STI stakeholders through workshops and other events.
As of the end of 2020, UNCTAD had implemented 19 national STIP Reviews and had initiated reviews in two other
countries. In several beneficiary countries, STIP Reviews have ignited significant renewal in STI policy, helped
raise its profile in national development strategies and facilitated the inclusion of STI activities in international
cooperation plans.

The environment for inclusive innovation can be strengthened by other initiatives. University students and
local research scientists, for example, could participate in mission-oriented research and deployment
programmes, stimulated by competitions. The Rwanda Innovation Challenge,92 the Rwanda Innovation
Fund supported in part by a $30 million loan from the African Development Bank,93 Grand Challenges
Canada,94 and USAID’s Grand Challenges For Development95 provide interesting examples of how these
mission-oriented innovation programmes can be organized and administered.96
Major inroads have already been made in this effort by foundations like Gates, coalitions such as
GAVI. There are also “open lab initiatives” such as the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation that allows
independent researchers to access GSK R&D facilities, resources and expertise to help them advance
their own research focused on medicines for endemic infectious diseases (see Box IV 5). These initiatives
have incentivized pharmaceutical companies and others to take on infectious diseases that primarily affect
the developing world.

Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation
In 2001, the pharma company GSK converted one of its major laboratories in Tres Cantos, Spain, into a profit-exempt
laboratory dedicated to developing drugs to treat diseases affecting primarily people in the developing countries. In
2010, the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation was created to allow independent researchers to access GSK R&D
facilities, resources and expertise to help them advance their own research focused on medicines for endemic
infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis. In their turn, these researchers are encouraged to share their
work with other researchers. The Foundation also provides funding to support the researchers.
The Foundation combines funding with access to state-of-the-art industrial facilities and expertise. This approach
facilitates transfer and co-creation of tacit knowledge on drug discovery and pre-clinical R&D through the colocation of
external researchers with GSK scientists. It also facilitates learning-by-doing by allowing access and integrating Open
Lab fellows into the work in the Lab’s industrial facilities.

Governments can also establish centres of excellence. Modelled after the Manufacturing USA Institutes,97
these centres would help all stakeholders identify and evaluate potential solutions for which government
procurement can help build national markets.98 Governments could, for example, contract with social
enterprises to put rooftop solar and potable water kiosks in schools, health clinics, municipal buildings
and other government facilities. By providing initial markets and assured revenues they can help social
enterprises gain footholds in regions where they were not previously active.
International development partners could help to support these initiatives in two ways. First, foundations
and bilateral donors could establish a Global Know-How Transfer Fund to help transfer successful
implementation models from one country to another. Foundations and bilateral donors may also wish to
establish a Deployment Support Fund to help entrepreneurs expand into new markets.99
Support comes from organizations such as Grand Challenges Canada,100 USAID’s Grand Challenges
for Development,101 and the National Innovation Foundation – India which specializes in grassroots
innovation.102 Innovations in Healthcare is dedicated to improving “access to affordable, quality care for
people who need it most.”103 IEEE Empowering a Billion Lives focuses on developing new strategies “to
scale energy access solutions 1000x”.104 Feed the Future/Partnering for Innovation105 “builds partnerships
with agribusinesses to help them sell new products and services to smallholder farmers.” Mission
Innovation is “working to accelerate clean energy innovation.”106
Just as important as developing these technologies is finding ways to deploy them at scale on a financially
sustainable basis. Global Good, which is developing an extensive pipeline of development solutions for Medical
Cold Chain Equipment, is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and aims to “direct technology
to the poorest people on Earth—to transform the lives of people who need their lives transformed.”107 Also
funded by the Gates foundation is Global Health Technologies – a coalition of organizations and businesses
to accelerate the creation of new drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and other tools.108

DEPLOYING AT SCALE

Pilot solutions that work well in one place often need adapting to work elsewhere in the same province
or country, not to mention in neighbouring or more distant countries. If this does not happen, the
result is a proliferation of pilot projects. Between the piloting and scaling phases proven technologies
can get stuck in a “stagnation chasm.”109 To avoid this, governments and companies can consider
the following suggestions.

Be guided by a vision – Organizations deploying technology should start with an ambitious vision,
such as to provide drinking water to at least 100,000,000 people in the next five years. They then need
TABLE OF
CONTENT

84
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER IV
Innovation with equity

to determine how to achieve it with strategies for mobilizing the required technical, financial, human
capital, partnership, political and other essential resources, and then develop a plan for scaling up.110

Talk to users – Parachuting top-down solutions into unsuspecting communities or to potential
customers is a recipe for failure.111 This is true irrespective of whether the potential customer is
a sophisticated technology firm in Silicon Valley or a smallholder, subsistence farmer in Africa. To
launch a successful deployment programme, customers need to participate in both the product
development and product marketing phases because, successful deployment programmes are a
function of “culture, values, ethics, trust, leadership, history, politics,” as well as superstition, local
customs, and social structures.112 If the scientific community ignores non-science factors, deployment
will founder irrespective of the technical parameters.
Pass the baton – Harnessing frontier technology for the SDGs, is akin to a relay race in which
the baton must be passed smoothly, quickly, and efficiently from the scientists and engineers who
develop new technological solutions to a completely different group of individuals – primarily nonscientists – who will take the lead in deploying these innovations at scale.
Generate incomes – Income generation should not be viewed as a distraction or minor add-on
to existing deployment programmes but rather as an indispensable component of sustainable
deployment. No matter how heavily subsidized the technology, people will
not continue to use it if they cannot afford it. The solution, therefore, is to use
technology that will generate more income for households and communities
The solution is to use
by providing better access to more remunerative formal markets, especially in
technology that will
generate more income
rural areas. Similarly, they will need to extend credit, training and support that
for households
will enable smallholder farmers to fit into complex value chains. For example,
and communities
Twiga is using digital technology to link Nigerian smallholder farmers to more
by providing better
lucrative formal urban commercial markets,113 while in India, Promethean
access to more

dairy farmers with formal food processing enterprises.

markets, especially in
rural areas.

IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES

New technologies can also be used to decrease inequalities by improving
services provided by the public sector.115 This will mean (1) investing in the capacity of civil servants,
(2) facilitating the free flow of information, (3) working together to solve problems, (4) using rules to
support the innovation process.116
An important principle is that government services should not restrict access to those who are willing
to use the new technologies. In 2019, 3.6 billion people, almost half of the world’s population, did not
have access to the Internet.117 There is a clear digital divide between developed regions, where 87 per
cent of the population are using the Internet, and the least developed countries, where the proportion
is only 19 per cent.
The government’s procurement power can create markets for technologies that would make lives
better for poor households. Governments can also help absorb frontier technologies by investing in
strengthening the capacity of the public service workforce. For example, in many countries, healthcare
workers are primarily public employees and the whole health system could benefit from their increasing
capacity on the use of new technologies in healthcare.
Another procurement option is for the management of foreign trade. In 1981 UNCTAD established the
Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) programme to help developing countries modernize
their customs services and automate the customs clearance process. ASYCUDA covers most foreign
trade procedures, and is an example of an effective programme that has applied new technologies in
public sector services while helping governments make the required institutional changes and create
environments for the successful deployment of these technologies (see Box IV 6).

Innovation with equity

Another area where public sector investment can affect inequalities is through educational
innovation.118 The systems that have innovated the most tend to produce the most equitable student
learning outcomes, as in Indonesia, for example, and the Republic of Korea.119

Box IV 6

UNCTAD’s Automated System for Customs Data – ASYCUDA
The Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) programme was established by UNCTAD in 1981 to support
the efforts of developing countries to modernize their Customs Services and to automate customs clearance
processes. Since then, the ASYCUDA programme has become the leading Customs Reform Programme and
the ASYCUDA Integrated Customs Information System, developed by UNCTAD, is among the world’s most
comprehensive Customs automation systems. ASYCUDA combines state-of-the-art information technology and
proven field experience.
ASYCUDA has become UNCTAD’s largest technical assistance programme with more than 100 user countries,
including 41 African countries, 39 Least Developed Countries, 34 Small Island Developing States and
21 Landlocked Developing Countries.
ASYCUDA projects, comprise expertise, technical assistance activities, implementation of the ASYCUDA system
and corresponding training. They aim to speed up the customs clearance process while enforcing security,
through the introduction of computerization, along with simplifying procedures and thus minimizing administrative
costs.
During the last few years, at the request of member countries, the ASYCUDA programme has been broadened to
include automating trade facilitation procedures using frontier technologies such as AI and blockchain.
Countries interested in implementing the system, increasingly fund their own ASYCUDA projects. For those
countries that do not have a budget allocated for that purpose the ASYCUDA programme has been able to
assist countries in securing funds for implementation. Donors include the African Development Bank, Asian
Development Bank, COMESA, Enhanced Integrated Framework, EU, German Corporation for International
Cooperation, Southern African Development Community, TradeMark East Africa, and the World Bank.

BRIDGING DIGITAL DIVIDES

Over the past two decades, national governments and the international community have aimed to extend
digital services across the world. This has had some success. At the beginning of this century, only a
privileged minority had Internet access, but by 2018, for the first time in history half of the people on the
planet were connected, and progress was continuing across all regions.120 A pivotal moment was the World
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in 2003 and 2005 (Box IV 7) which has been followed
up by various stakeholders, including the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for
Development, for which UNCTAD serves as the secretariat. There is an annual WSIS Forum and the WSIS
outcomes are due to be reviewed again by the United Nations General Assembly’s WSIS+20 review in 2025.

Box IV 7

International cooperation for bridging the digital divides
The UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD) acts as the focal point for the United
Nations system-wide follow up to the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), with its core principles
and action lines in terms of digital cooperation agreed by the international community. The CSTD is also the
United Nations inter-governmental process with a mandate and expertise to articulate the critical role of STI as
enablers of the SDGs and to inform and advise the United Nations General Assembly, the ECOSOC, the HLPF
and other relevant forums.
The United Nations Group on the Information Society, currently chaired by UNCTAD, is an inter-agency mechanism
to coordinate the implementation of WSIS outcomes throughout the United Nations system, which meets annually
during the WSIS Forum. To support this process, the WSIS stocktaking platform, maintained by ITU, provides
information on more than 12,000 ICT and development activities undertaken by diverse stakeholders across

different WSIS action lines. The International Chamber of Commerce coordinates WSIS-related activities through
its Business Action to Support the Information Society initiative and contributes to international discussions
including the WSIS Forum. ITU also works with governments to support infrastructure deployment, including the
development of national broadband strategies and communications regulation.
International cooperation has also focused on addressing new gaps that emerged in terms of broadband
connections. In this regard, the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development was launched in 2010
by ITU and UNESCO to boost the importance of broadband on the international policy agenda and expand
broadband access in every country.
Another essential mechanism is the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), launched in 2006, which provides a platform
for exchanging information and good practices. More recently, the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation was
established in 2018 to consider collaboration on addressing the social, ethical, legal and economic impact of
digital technologies.

ICT infrastructure continues to improve, especially in the developed countries, as companies implement 5G
networks. To ensure that developing countries are also an important part of this, the World Bank and other
international financial institutions provide support for infrastructure projects. The Bank has committed $25
billion to connect all African Governments, businesses and citizens to high-speed broadband by 2030
– which would cover one-quarter of the total cost requirements. The World Bank Digital Development
Partnership provides a platform for digital innovation and development financing.
Special attention is needed for underserved areas that are not commercially viable for private companies.
Here, governments can include specific network rollout obligations as conditions for granting licenses.
They can also encourage network infrastructure sharing and mutualization among operators to reduce
costs. They can also share the costs of some services through public-private partnerships.
A common tool is the Universal Service Fund (USF)121 which collects funds from telecommunication
operators as subsidies that can be used for private companies to extend ICT infrastructure and operate
services in underserved areas. However, the experiences with USFs in over 70 countries have been
mixed. Frequently there have been failures in design, with a lack of political independence and problems
with training, education and maintenance.122 On the other hand, successful USFs have been able to work
on these issues while maintaining a high degree of transparency.123 USFs can also finance terminal and
connecting equipment. Although the price of these devices has constantly been decreasing, their cost
is still a significant barrier. Governments may consider various forms of subsidy both for devices and the
costs of connection.
Bridging digital divides will also require basic literacy and numeracy skills. In the first decade of this century
some training was available in local ITC community centres. The widespread use of mobile phones has
reduced the need for places to connect, but it is still important to raise awareness of the benefits of being
connected (Box IV 8). This would offer opportunities for public-private partnerships in which governments
raise levels of skill.
Governments that want to improve digital skills will need to do so in an inclusive manner with regard to the
elderly, people with disabilities and other marginalized groups. In Singapore, for example, the Government
is providing courses on basic digital skills for senior citizens,124 while in the United Kingdom there are now
some digital drop-in services.125 Policymakers can also support social enterprises that provide training on
digital skills to unemployed and underqualified people.126

Box IV 8

Policies and civil society actions for universal Internet access
Many of the frontier technologies are directly or indirectly dependent on Internet infrastructure. While we have
made progress regarding solving the digital divide, new divides seem to be at the horizon. Indeed, many types
of technologies require large amounts of data and/or low latency capabilities, and basic connectivity is no longer
enough. In this regard, the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), a global coalition to bring down the cost of
Internet access in low- and middle-income countries, is advocating for a meaningful connectivity (MC) target, a
tool to raise the bar for internet access and set more ambitious policy goals for digital development. The MC sets
these minimum thresholds across the four dimensions of internet access that matter most to users, according to
the following (A4AI, 2020a):
•

Regular internet use - minimum threshold: daily use,

•

An appropriate device - minimum threshold: access to a smartphone,

•

Enough data - minimum threshold: an unlimited broadband connection at home or a place of work or
study,

•

A fast connection - minimum threshold: 4G mobile connectivity.

There is increasing awareness of the need to strengthen Internet infrastructure, and this means not only thinking
about policies in the “last mile” but also policies related to parts of the ecosystem that are less visible and/or
known, such as supporting digital skills and content development. Many governments have been creative in
developing initiatives focused on solving connectivity gaps, and many of these are the result of innovative
approaches to universal access policy. Some successful initiatives related to universal service and access funds
(USF) are briefly described below:
•

In Malaysia, the government used its USF and its national broadband plan to increase broadband availability
and implement supply side interventions such as access pricing regulation. The latter resulted in a 40 per
cent price drop for 1 Gbps and only a few months after the policy was implemented in 2018 (A4AI, 2020b);

•

In Costa Rica, the government launched in 2015 a country wide policy (CR Digital) with an ambitious goal
of connecting the country within two years. While this was not achieved, the country was able to use the
USF to partially subsidize Internet access as well as ICT equipment, bringing over 40,000 families online
(A4AI, 2020c);

•

In Pakistan, which has a market approach to telecommunication infrastructure regulation, the USF was
established in 2006. Besides having increased the level of penetration and access to the Internet, the
USAF was also used to finance contractors to facilitate people’s access to telemedicine, e-learning, and
e-government at telecentres, since digital literacy is still a barrier to many (A4AI, 2020d);

•

In Rwanda, the USF resources, which are managed by the regulator, Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority
(RURA), are used to provide connectivity to all districts in the country, including through telecentres, and
public and private universities. Affordability has improved dramatically, and while in 2015, the price of 1GB
of data was 20 per cent of the average Rwandan’s monthly income, the same data package costs around
3.4 per cent today (A4AI, 2020e).

Establishing clear targets to ensure timely disbursement of USF funds is as crucial as dedicating part of these
funds to projects focused on women’s access and use, especially as the digital gender gaps continue to hinder
development opportunities. Since 2018 the Web Foundation, A4AI and UN Women have been advocating for
USF to dedicate a minimum of 50 per cent of their unused funds to support women and girls centred projects.
They further recommended that (i) project design and implementation should be more gender-responsive; (ii)
transparency of fund financing, disbursements and operations should be increased; and (iii) USF’s governance
aspects should be taken into consideration, with increased awareness of gender targets and concerns (World
Wide Web Foundation et al., 2018).
These are only some examples of how governments are addressing universal access provision, but much more
remains to be done. A necessary step is designing policies that focus on affordable and meaningful connectivity
that is truly enabling for users. Working towards bridging these gaps sooner rather than later, would help avoiding
future gaps related to frontier technologies.

Innovation with equity

Beyond digital literacy, people who want to go further and adapt frontier technologies for their own
purposes will need more specialized training in statistics, for example, programming languages and
big data analytics. And at the more advanced level, for creating new technologies they will need
sophisticated programming skills and knowledge of complex algorithms, including those used in
machine learning.
Regional economic development initiatives often build infrastructure in areas of a country that are
being left behind. More than 30 countries report such initiatives. The Republic of Korea is using R&D
Special Districts and efforts to strengthen industrial clusters as part of its regional innovation effort.127
Finland is synchronizing its national and regional innovation strategies.128 Mexico has an Institutional
Fund for Regional Development of Science, Technology, and Innovation Activities.129

7.

INVESTING IN STI SKILLS

Digital capabilities are increasingly important, not only for jobs, but also for social and civic
participation in current and future societies. People will not just need basic technical skills but
should also be able understand media, be able to search for information, be critical about what
is retrieved, and communicate through a variety of digital tools and applications.130 Many frontier
technologies are designed to be used in countries with extensive infrastructure and abundant natural
and social resources. Developing countries will therefore need sufficient technical skills to introduce
modifications.131
Skills can be at four levels of engagement:132
1. Adoption – basic education, literacy and familiarity with technology devices
2. Basic use – understanding of new technologies, knowledge of digital rights, privacy and
security, ability to use digital technologies to collaborate and create
3. Creative use and adaptation – basic computing skills and familiarity with algorithms
4. Creation of new technologies – sophisticated programming skills and knowledge of complex
algorithms.
Countries where technology development remains in its early stages need basic technical and generic
skills. On the other hand, in countries where economic growth is already driven by manufacturing,
the workforce must have specialized skills in robotics, automation and the IoT. In any case, it is
critical to recognize that a lot of this learning happens on the job and through interacting with the
technology. Building capacity in these skills are part of a broader process to build and strengthen
innovation systems that develop productive capacities for industry, manufacturing, services, and
higher value-added activities and exports.
Most government programmes that support innovation are directed towards human resources in
educational institutions.133 Direct support goes to established researchers, post-doctoral researchers,
PhD students, undergraduate, masters, and secondary school students, and teachers. Many of these
programmes address horizontal inequalities; for example, in the policy database maintained by the
EU and OECD more than 35 countries list national initiatives on gender in science and engineering.134
There are also programmes for other disadvantaged and excluded groups, including those focused
on assistive technologies,135 indigenous groups,136 displaced populations,137 and the elderly.138

8.

SUPPORTING ACTIVE SOCIAL CITIZENS

Technologies often amplify human capacities and magnify existing social forces, through institutions,
networks and social norms, but the impacts will ultimately depend on how societies respond, and
in particular on the extent of social citizen activism, which can help steer technological development
towards sustainable outcomes. Networks of activists, academics, and practitioners can experiment

with alternative possibilities based on local knowledge and driven by environmental and social
needs.139
An example of contemporary grassroots effort is the maker movement, which has driven informal
experimentation in microelectronics, software, robotics, and digital fabrication. Through hackerspaces,
fab labs, and makerspaces, the maker movement encourages open-source technologies, free
information, an economy of sharing and sustainable technologies. The One Million Cisterns Project,
for example, was conceived by a network of over 700 NGOs, farmers’ groups, and civil society
organizations, and provided water cisterns in a large semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil.140 The
technology was built by farmers and masons and was used to foster community-based learning and
empowerment.
Social citizen activism and grassroots innovation can be supported through initiatives that provide
funding, link grassroots innovation to existing R&D institutions, and support international networking
for increased visibility and legitimacy.141

CHAPTER V
PREPARING FOR
THE FUTURE

CHAPTER V
Preparing for the future

Technological progress is essential for sustainable development, but can also perpetuate inequalities or
create new ones, either by limiting access to more privileged groups and affluent countries, or through
built-in biases or unintended consequences. The task for governments is to maximise the potential
offered by frontier technologies, while also mitigating harmful outcomes, and ensuring access for all.
Countries at all stages of development need to promote the use, adoption and adaptation of frontier
technologies, preparing people and firms for the new possibilities ahead.

A.

KEY REQUIREMENTS FOR EQUITABLE OUTCOMES

The previous chapters have indicated some of the basic requirements. First, effective national governance
to guide technological change. Second, international cooperation for supporting developing countries
and strengthening a global framework for STI for development. Third, vigorous citizen activism that can
raise awareness and create a critical mass to ensures that society and institutions steer technological
change towards sustainable and inclusive development.

1.

National governance

The world already has a broad framework for giving direction to technological progress. Innovation
and choice should be guided by the Sustainable Development Goals. In practice, however, left to their
own devices, private firms will not make investments primarily for the public good. If private sector
options and choices are to be guided by the SDGS towards sustainable transformations then the state
should have “the vision, the mission and the plan” to create and shape the market for these inclusive
and sustainable innovations.1 Governments will also need to make investments in human and physical
resources. Some existing funds can be reallocated to better uses, such as research and education, but
governments will also have to mobilize new resources through changes in taxation.2

2.

International cooperation

In parallel it will be important to revitalize international governance and cooperation. The global
community should fully embrace STI for sustainable development – promoting the use, adoption and
adaptation of frontier technologies while extending access far and wide and ensuring that no one is
left behind. Most developing countries will not have sufficient resources on their own. They will need
international cooperation to help them align their STI goals with national development objectives and
the SDGs, formulate coherent STI policies, and design appropriate policy instruments.
Governments should also work together more closely to build an international institutional framework
that embraces countries at all stages of technological development. This is especially important for
developing countries which have distinct interests and priorities and need to be represented on the
global stage. Individual governments and firms, and other stakeholders may resolve to make technology
work for the public good but nothing can take the place of truly international cooperation.

3.

Social activism

Accelerating reform of institutions will require vigorous social activism, with people and organizations
working together to identify mismatches between technological innovation and societal responses.
Laws, regulations and behaviour developed for previous technologies are usually ill-suited for radical
new challenges. Due to both societal and institutional inertia these changes have been slower and have
lagged behind technological transformation. Indeed, for previous technological revolutions, completing
these changes has taken one or two generations.3 Keeping the SDGs as central guiding principles
requires proactive participation of all stakeholders including civil society organizations. It will take
time, but the combined efforts of civil society groups can lead to changes in regulations and laws and
eventually trigger changes in user and consumer behaviour so as to align frontier technologies with
societal goals.

B.

KEY POLICY AREAS

Previous chapters provide examples of existing policies, strategies and institutions that can foster frontier
technologies and address some of their unintended consequences. This section provides an overview of
key policy areas for developing countries. These should be addressed through a whole-of-government
approach – with close policy coordination and multi-stakeholder participation – and with bold ambition
that recognizes the potential transformative power of frontier technologies and the new wave of
technological change to move the world towards an inclusive and sustainable future.

1.

Guiding innovation towards reducing inequalities

Governments should steer technological change towards societal needs, while also taking measures to
deal with unintended consequences and mitigate the risks of increased inequality. For this they can draw
from a broad range of instruments including regulatory measures and economic and fiscal instruments,
as well as smarter policies on trade, investment, industry, education and innovation. Governments
should also ensure that vulnerable and low-income groups have access to valuable and socially relevant
new goods and services enabled by frontier technologies, some of which can be subsidized or provided
free as public services.

Set strategic directions using the SDGs
The SDGs should serve as the basis for collective priorities – social, economic and environmental.
These should drive national plans for research and innovation and for the use, adoption and adaptation
of frontier technologies – aiming to reduce inequality between social groups, individuals, regions and
countries. STI policy instruments should cover such areas as: funding for research and development
and innovation; tax incentives for adopting and adapting technology; public procurement to create or
stimulate markets; creating clusters, industrial zones and technology parks; and providing training and
business advisory services.
Public policy should also direct the use of critical new frontier technologies to sectors that might
otherwise be slow to exploit them – including parts of agriculture, healthcare, energy and transport. For
example, there are now emerging best practices on how to integrate general-purpose technological
knowledge to tackle climate change. Similar attention needs to be given to the opportunities offered for
the SDGs by other frontier technologies.

Extend frontier technologies to the poor
People at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid should not fall further behind. Wide-scale
deployment of the associated products and services will not happen automatically, particularly in
low-income and vulnerable settings. Extending the benefits of frontier technologies to the poor will
require energetic public policy – devising plans, raising awareness, and creating incentives within a
national innovation system, while also encouraging investment and community participation. Moreover,
these solutions should generate incomes. The poor should not be limited to being users or beneficiaries,
they should also be able to take the opportunities provided by the frontier technologies to boost their
incomes and improve their livelihoods.

Use frontier technologies in the public sector
A part of this will be achieved through smart procurement. The government should use its buying
power to create markets for technologies that will stimulate economic development while also making
lives better for poor households. Based on procurement, governments should steadily embed frontier
technologies in services such as health and education. This will require careful design, paying close
attention to potential changes in vertical and horizontal inequalities.
TABLE OF
CONTENT

98
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION REPORT 2021

CHAPTER V
Preparing for the future

Support inclusive innovation systems
Technology use tends to be shaped by existing social and economic inequalities, and in their turn, these
technologies can perpetuate and exacerbate these inequalities. Therefore, technological applications
on their own are unlikely to cause large-scale social changes towards equitable outcomes. In this
context, social citizen activism and grass roots innovation play an essential role in directing innovation
and knowledge diffusion to promote social inclusion. Governments can in turn respond to alternative
models of technological change by facilitating funding, linking these models to existing R&D institutions,
and increasing their visibility through international networking.

2.

Adopting frontier technologies while mastering existing technologies

To catch up and forge ahead, developing countries should adopt frontier technologies while continuing
to diversify their production bases by mastering many existing technologies. To ensure that they benefit
from the window of opportunity offered by the new wave of technologies, they should keep both targets
in sight. This will mean strengthening their innovation systems, while aligning STI and industrial policies,
building basic digital skills, and closing gaps in ICT infrastructure.

Strengthen national innovation systems
In many developing countries, innovation systems tend to be weak and prone to systemic failures
and structural deficiencies. Governments should strengthen their national innovation systems, drawing
in a wide range of actors who can help build synergies between STI and other economic policies
(e.g. industrial, trade, fiscal, monetary and educational policies). In this regard, UNCTAD has written
extensively on innovation systems and how to build an enabling STI environment.4 UNCTAD’s STI Policy
Reviews can also help governments integrate STI policies into their national development strategies
while working towards the SDGs.

Align STI and industrial policy
New technologies can re-invigorate traditional production sectors and speed up industrialization and
economic structural transformation. It is essential therefore to align policies for STI and for industry.
Together these should draw firms into the core of frontier technology development, so as to achieve
fast increases in labour productivity. This would enable traditional production sectors to benefit from
multiple channels of technology diffusion, including foreign direct investment, trade, intellectual property
rights, patents and the exchange of knowledge and know-how. Countries should foster these linkages
by supporting collaborative research and strengthening business partnerships.
Rapid exchanges of information can fuel innovation, giving firms a better sense of consumer needs,
technological possibilities, and opportunities for increasing competitiveness. Some collaborative
innovation will occur spontaneously, but other links, especially those related to social and environmental
challenges, will need to be deliberately forged by governments or organizations from civil society.5
An important part of STI policy is the establishment of science parks, incubators, accelerators, and
innovation labs.6 These enable scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to work in clusters to facilitate
experimentation and enable faster development. Just as important, STI policy should promote the
scaling up and dissemination of successful innovations that emerge from these hubs – encouraging
academia and civil society to engage with the private sector to deploy new products in marginalized
and vulnerable communities.

Develop digital skills
Policymakers also need to consider how people can acquire the necessary digital skills and competencies
to adopt and adapt frontier technologies into countries’ existing production bases. Digital competencies
include technical skills, but also generic and complementary skills. Skills are needed at all levels from
the basic ability to adopt new applications and products, to the higher-level programming and other
TABLE OF

skills to adapt imported technologies and create new ones.7 Education and training programmes
that focus on digital skills for all should be inclusive and accessible to everyone. Skills learning also
happens through learning-by-doing and on-the-job training. The competencies needed will vary across
sectors, countries and levels of industrial development. Digital policies should be calibrated according
to countries’ readiness to engage and benefit from the digital economy.
From the outset all these training opportunities should involve women. Everyone should be aware of the
potential impacts of technologies on gender disparities, as well as of women’s specific needs, and the
critical contribution that they can make. Governments should facilitate women’s access to technology,
ensuring that they participate in setting priorities, shaping policy decisions and creating research and
development agendas.

Connect everyone focusing on the furthest behind
All these policies will demand much greater digitalization and connectivity. Country-wide access to
electricity and to ICT should aim to bridge gender, generational and digital divides. Through inclusive
National Digital Agendas countries can focus on the furthest behind, leveraging ICT infrastructure and
improved Internet access through fixed or mobile broadband.
Reaching remote areas and vulnerable groups may not be viable for the private sector, so governments
will also need to consider incentives and subsidies – not just for internet access but also for providing the
devices through which people connect to the network. Although the cost of these devices consistently
falls over time, it is still a significant barrier for many of the poorest people.

3.

Mitigating risks

There is always the risk that rapid technological change will cause harm or perpetuate or accentuate
inequalities. Governments should strengthen social protection systems to provide safety nets for
workers who may lose their livelihoods. They should also enable these workers to move to new jobs and
economic activities by matching their skills to future needs, reforming education, and training systems,
and promoting lifelong learning.
Both companies and regulators need to be vigilant to ensure that technologies using AI do not
incorporate or learn social biases and forms of discrimination that can further disadvantage vulnerable
groups.

Strengthen social protection
During potential labour market disruptions, workers should be able to rely on strong systems of social
protection. Other options include universal basic income schemes. Several redistribution policies have
been proposed to generate the additional revenue required, including by taxing capital, robots or other
technologies. Evidence on the impact of these policies, especially universal basic income schemes,
remains scarce, and policy experimentation is needed.

Ease workforce transitions
All over the world, countries are facing up to the needs for lifelong learning. Workers may need to change
careers or skillsets several times through their working lives. The necessary training and re-training
are increasingly seen as a joint responsibility of governments, employers and workers. Governments
may also support workers who need to change jobs by combining skills development with personal
counselling and improved job matching, and placement services. The youngest workers can benefit
from apprenticeship programmes combining work- and school-based learning that can smooth the
transition from school to work. There is also a role for stronger labour unions to take up workers’
legitimate concerns about the implications of rapid technological change for their jobs.

Preparing for the future

Anticipate the future
If societies are to plan for technological change, policymakers will need to consider the potentially
disruptive effects for years or even decades ahead. This will require strategic vision and intelligence
in the form of ‘technological foresight and assessment’ developed in conjunction with key agents of
change and sources of knowledge. The evidence is needed to support policy and implementation, for
example combining methodologies and data for technological, economic, social and environmental
impacts. Such assessments help to elicit knowledge from a variety of actors about the industrial growth
areas that match a country’s strengths to commercial opportunities.

C.

PRIORITIES FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will mean using all available tools to harness
rapid technological change. Most of the necessary resources will come from national budgets, but
many governments should also be able to rely on technical and financial support through international
cooperation and official development assistance (ODA). In particular this will be needed to:

1.

Build stronger national capacities in STI

The international community should give priority in its support to developing countries to build their
technological and innovation capacities. In this regard, UNCTAD provides support for governments that
wish to integrate STI policies into their national development strategies. Technical cooperation delivered
through ODA is also important; this will mean increasing the relatively small amounts of ODA directed
to STI in the least developed countries. Voluntary contributions are also invited to support capacity
building in STI for SDGs in developing countries, and in particular the efforts in this area by UNCTAD
and other agencies participating in the IATT of the Technology Facilitation Mechanism.8

2.

Smooth technology transfer

The international community should help developing countries close technology gaps by facilitating
technology transfer and by translating technologies into locally relevant products and services. Part
of this will involve liberalizing access to trade and to technologies covered by intellectual property
rights. Several reforms of the global IP regime are needed to strike the delicate balance between
the advantages and costs of IP rights for developing countries to get frontier technologies, including
broader room for compulsory licensing, strengthening patent standards of novelty, and limiting the
length of patent protection. This is a rapidly changing environment with increasing digitalization and
connectivity creating new risks and challenges, so more research will always be needed on the best
forms of technology transfer. One option is to offer free online access to information on patent-free
technologies that are readily available for firms in developing countries.

3.

Increase women’s participation in STEM

The international community should encourage girls and women to study and seek employment in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, which have driven the rapid development of
frontier technologies. At present these subjects are typically dominated by men. If women are to play their
full part in frontier technologies, governments and international organizations will need to encourage girls
and women to study these subjects and enter corresponding professions. Women should have full access
to all forms of technology and be able to help set priorities, participate in decision making and shape
research and development agendas. Overall, governments and the international community need a much
better understanding of the gender impact of technological change.

4.

Improve foresight and technological assessment

The international community should help countries undertake strategic ‘foresight and technological
assessment’ initiatives to better understand the socio-economic and environmental implications of new
and innovative technologies. Foresight and technological assessments help to identify the risks and
benefits of technologies and the policy options for steering innovation so as to leave no one behind.

5.

Promote inclusive debate

Most developing countries, especially the least developed countries, are not engaged in development
of frontier technologies. Nevertheless, they need to be part of the international debates on how such
technologies affect citizens’ rights, privacy, data ownership and online security – and especially on
how they can promote the SDGs. Their concerns need to be reflected in normative frameworks and
regulatory regimes on data collection, use and access, and for data privacy and security – balancing
individual and collective rights, while allowing private sector innovation.
For this purpose, the United Nations offers an impartial and trusted platform where the international
community can deliberate these contentious issues. Two existing mechanisms that have brought frontier
technologies and sustainable development to the forefront of the global debate are the United Nations
Commission on Science and Technology for Development and the Technology Facilitation Mechanism
created by the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.

D.

CONCLUSIONS

Whole economies and societies are being reshaped by rapid technological change. As with earlier
waves of technological revolution, the full picture will be slow to emerge. But it is safe to say that the
long-term changes will be more far-reaching than we imagine – along all dimensions of development. To
address these, governments and the other development actors will need to prepare fast.
Developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, cannot afford to miss this new wave
of rapid technological change. Governments cannot know how technologies will develop but they can
help shape the paths that such technologies take in their own economies and societies.
Each country will need STI policies appropriate to its stage of development. For some this will mean
promoting frontier technologies while renewing efforts to take full advantage of existing technologies to
diversify their economies and upgrade traditional sectors such as agriculture. Others can engage more
deeply with the development of frontier technologies. But all countries need to prepare people and firms
for a period of rapid change. For developing countries, success in the twenty-first century will require a
balanced approach – building a robust industrial base and promoting frontier technologies that will help
deliver the 2030 Agenda and its global vision of people-centred, inclusive, and sustainable societies.

ANNEX A. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
This report uses a conceptual framework for linking technologies to inequalities (Figure 01). People’s
well-being is a central part of this framework because inequality is ultimately felt at a personal level.
Even when dealing with divergences at aggregate levels such as countries, regions, sectors, firms
and social groups, the analysis focuses on how inequality operates between people. As per the
‘capability’ approach developed by the economist Amartya Sen, individual well-being relates to the
real opportunities that people have to do and be what they have reason to value – their “capabilities”.
These include being able to avoid such deprivations as premature death, preventable illnesses,
hunger and undernourishment, as well as having the necessary skills and education to engage in
productive work, enjoy political participation, be part of a community, and be respected. At the
individual level, development is the expansion of the set of capabilities that a person has, while
poverty is the deprivation of capabilities.1 Inequalities are the manifestation of the disparities in the
set of capabilities that people have.
Goods and services (provided by nature, charity, governments or markets) are the means necessary
for expanding people’s well-being. For example, a mobile phone device combined with a mobile
phone service is the means to instantaneously communicate with people in other places while moving
around a wide geographic area, which enables the capability to communicate more freely. But the
relation between goods and services and the capability set is influenced by the individual, social and
environmental context. This affects how a person can convert goods and services into capabilities.2
For example, if a person has a disability that prevents her from hearing someone over the phone, or
if the person lives in a mountainous area where the mobile service is not reliable, or if the person is
not allowed to use a mobile phone for socially-imposed reasons, then the mobile phone will be of
limited use in enabling the functioning of freer communication. The government provides some of the
goods and services as public goods, such as national security, street lighting, flood control systems,
epidemic control, and so on. Others are provided privately but with characteristics of public goods
such as broadcast radio and television, or other sorts of information goods and knowledge. Still
others are freely provided by nature, such as solar energy, clean air, water and biodiversity. However,
a considerable share of goods and services is not freely distributed in the economy through public
goods, charity or some system of automatic sharing. Most goods and services have to be bought
in the market. From the vantage point of the person, what is important is not the supply of goods
and services in the economy but the set of goods and services over which the person can establish
ownership and command.3

Innovation with equity

The entitlements that a person has over goods and services are very much determined by how he or
she makes a living. In turn, how a person makes a living depends on two factors. First, the ownership
of productive resources, such as her own knowledge and labour-power, as well as capital such as a
productive plot of land or livestock. Second, the production possibilities that exist in the economy. In
other words, a person may acquire the ability to buy goods and services by getting a wage income or
by organizing productive factors held by her or others, but this will depend on the employment and
entrepreneurial opportunities, which rely on the production possibilities of the local economy.
This is where technologies come in: available technologies determine the production possibilities.
These technologies can be either capital-embodied technologies, such as machines and infrastructure,
or labour-embodied technologies, such as procedures followed by workers to produce goods and
services, or business models and management practices.4 Therefore, the complete set of technologies
in the country determines the country’s productive capacity. Some technologies are required by many
economic activities; clear examples being ICT infrastructure, the power grid or transport infrastructures
such as roads, ports, airports or railways. The combination of the different technologies results in
distinct economic activities, represented by the goods and services they produce.5 This report follows
UNCTAD’s tradition and theoretical foundation that understands economic development as a process
of structural transformation.6 This may be hindered by factors that limit the capacity and willingness
of private firms in developing countries to innovate and upgrade their productive and technological
capacities.
A national system of innovation (NIS) is the broad network of actors required to develop new
technologies and combine them with existing ones into new products and processes of production.
Private firms have a unique role in technological change, being the place where new technologies are
usually conceived, developed, and eventually commercialized, but they typically do not innovate in
isolation. Firms are part of a system which also comprises universities, research centres, civil society
organizations, financial institutions and governments, among others, whose interactions allow the
flow of ideas and resources required for innovations. The market provides firms with incentives to
develop new technologies, through either new processes or new products. The government has the
primary responsibility for policies, rules and regulations that provide an environment that can enable
technological change.
Based on this framework, technologies affect inequalities through jobs and through goods and
services. In that connection, we need to consider how people use technologies both as consumers
and as providers of labour in the economy.7
The forces surrounding new technologies are not confined to national boundaries. The connections
often extend internationally, with firms as parts of global industries. New firms are part of new industries,
and enter into variety of competitive and complementary roles in various countries. Globalization
of both manufacturing and services in the late 20th century created influential networks of such
relationships in the form of global value chains (GVCs). Firms in one industry develop connections with
supplier industries and with both businesses and consumers in other countries. These networks also
include universities, research centres, and civil society organizations which are part of a country’s NIS.
They promote international technology transfer, learning and cooperation. Each country’s economy
then consists of its unique array of firms, some with only local markets and others drawing from and
selling into the “traded” or global economy. For firms, each country in which it operates provides a
different human resources environment, as well as a different financial, competition, and policy and
regulatory environment. At the same time international institutions work to establish shared standards
on some of these variables, aiming to level the playing field and help the global economy grow.
Through trade, GVC and changes in production patterns, technological change could critically affect
jobs in developing countries (Figure 02). Inequality between countries stems from the particular array
of industries a country can grow or attract, which in turn depends on its investments in people and
infrastructure as well as its business and regulatory environments. If a country houses only firms in

industries that are being displaced through new technologies in the global economy, its people will
suffer. If a country is able to establish a role in an industry emerging through rapid technological
change, its people may improve their living standards. Multinational firms, however, make their own
decisions about where they operate. They may establish facilities and abandon them at will. Smaller
countries, and those dependent on firms in a particular industry, are always vulnerable to these
external decision processes unless they can encourage local firms to innovate and stay.

The adoption of frontier technologies could reduce the labour-cost competitiveness of less industrialized
economies. This process may also delay or slow the shift of more traditional industries such as
garments, footwear, and low-tech electronics from countries such as China to less-industrialized
countries in Asia and Africa. Moreover, while frontier technologies could offer a window of opportunity
for developing countries to accelerate economic growth, technological change could also increase
the technological gaps between countries and make it even more difficult for less industrialized
countries to catch up, reducing the prospects for diversifying their economies and job creation. Given
that most people are suppliers of labour, if they are pushed or kept out of labour markets, they will
not be able to consume the benefits of most of these technologies.

ANNEX B. FRONTIER TECHNOLOGY TRENDS
This annex details the status of key frontier technologies, to help analyse the impact of these
technologies on sustainable development. Frontier technologies present economic and social
opportunities as well as challenges, thus the key features and status of these technologies need to be
well understood. This annex covers relevant technical and commercial aspects such as R&D, prices
and market structure. The developments in frontier technologies have been so rapid that this attempt
can only serve as a snapshot, but it could still offer a good starting point to discuss the potential
effects of these technologies on society. Among various frontier technologies, 11 are covered in this
annex: AI, IoT, big data, blockchain, 5G, 3D printing, robotics, drones, gene editing, nanotechnology
and solar PV.
While discussed independently in the following sections, frontier technologies are increasingly
interrelated, and they often expand each other’s functionalities. For instance, AI uses big data
securely stored in blockchains to improve predictions using machine learning.8 An increasing number
of devices connected within an IoT network are data collection tools that contribute to building up big
data.9 3D printing can create more complex items that require more data by leveraging big data, and
items can be printed remotely through IoT10 with AI-enabled defect detection functions.11 Industrial
robots assist 3D printing at various production stages such as replacing a printer’s build plate, and
washing, curing, and final finishing of additively manufactured parts.12 5G has the potential to allow
near-instantaneous response for robots by dramatically shortening response times.13

SUMMARY OF FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The United States and China have driven research on AI. During the period 19962018, there were 403,596 publications related to AI, led by the United States
(73,773), China (52,837) and the United Kingdom (22,912). The top three affiliations
were Chinese Academy of Sciences (3,414/China), Carnegie Mellon University
(2,619/United States) and CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
(2,510/France). During the same period (1996-2018), there were 116,600 patents
filed with the three top assignees’ nationalities being the United States (28,963),
China (23,298) and Germany (12,056). Top three current owners were BASF (1,961/
Germany), Bayer (1,416/Germany) and Siemens (1,320/Germany).
Companies in the United States are the main AI service providers. The top service
providers commonly referred to include Alphabet, including their affiliates such as
Google and DeepMind, Amazon, Apple, IBM and Microsoft.14 The top service users,
measured by spending on AI, are the retail, banking and discrete manufacturing
sectors.15 Prices of AI depend on the applications and their requirements, but overall
AI is becoming affordable.16 For instance, insurance fraud detection tools cost
between $100,000-$300,000 and chatbots are available at a range of $30,000$250,000.17
The AI market ($16 billion in 2017) is growing rapidly.18 Growth on the supply
side of the market is mainly driven by factors such as the expansion of big data,
improved productivity, distributed application areas,19 the availability of large-scale
government funding, and advances in image and voice recognition technologies.20
The major restraint on the supply side is the limited number of AI technology
experts.21 On the demand side, growth is mainly driven by the increasing adoption
of cloud-based applications and services, increasing demand for intelligent virtual
assistants,22 and increased client satisfaction.23 One potential restraint on the
demand side is the perceived threat to human dignity by AI although the impact is
anticipated to be minimal.24
Employment is booming in the AI Industry. AI-related job posts on a worldwide
employment-related search engine increased by nearly 100 per cent between June
2015 and June 2018.25 A study covering 15 countries conducted in 2019 found
that China was home to the most AI professionals, with 12,113 AI jobs, followed by
the United States (7,465) and Japan (3,369). Software engineer and data scientist
are the two most in-demand AI job categories.26

Internet of Things (IoT)

China and the United States lead research on IoT. During the period 1996-2018,
there were 66,467 publications related to IoT, with the most from China (10,081),
the United States (7,520) and India (5,700). The three leading affiliations were Beijing
University of Posts and Telecommunications (589/China), the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (560/China) and the Ministry of Education China (393/China). During the
same period, there were 22,180 patents filed, the leading countries of assignees
being China (9,515), the Republic of Korea (5,106) and the United States (4,275).
The three leading current owners were Samsung Group (2,508/Republic of Korea),
Qualcomm (1,213/United States) and Intel (667/United States).
Companies from the United States are major IoT service providers. The IoT
providers (IoT platformers) most commonly referred include Alphabet, Amazon,
Cisco, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, PTC, Salesforce and SAP (Germany).27 In 2018, the
leading user sectors, measured by spending on IoT, were consumer, insurance,
and healthcare provider.28 The price of an IoT system depends on the type of
application. For instance, ECG monitors range between $3,000 and $4,000,
environmental monitoring systems are priced from $10,000, energy management
systems cost from $27,000, and building and home automation systems start from
$50,000.29
The IoT market is already large ($130 billion in 2018) and expanding at a fast pace.30
The growth on the supply side is driven by factors such as technological advances
in semiconductors, offering possibilities for lightweight and efficient devices.31 On
the demand side, the growth is mainly driven by factors such as the rising demand
for advanced consumer electronics in growing economies, the increasing adoption
of smart devices and internet-enabled devices, the rise of tele-healthcare services
and the emergence of automation technology in various sectors.32 However,
cybersecurity risks and privacy concerns could negatively affect market growth.33
The growth of the IoT market has led to skill shortages. Research in 2017 showed
that the global IoT industry had grown to 2,888 companies employing around
342,000 people, and had a hard time hiring people with the right skills at a speed
that could keep pace with the rapid market growth.34 As of 2017, the companies
with the largest number of IoT-related employees were IBM (4,420), Intel Corporation
(3,044), Microsoft (2,806), Cisco (2,703) and Ericsson (1,665).35

Big data

China and the United States are the frontrunners in big data R&D. During the period
1996-2018, there were 73,957 publications related to big data, the three top source
countries being China (15,931), the United States (14,365) and India (4,094). The
three leading affiliations were the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1,240/China),
Tsinghua University (668/China) and Ministry of Education China (545/China).
Within the same period, there were 6,850 patents filed with the top nationality of
assignees being China (3,200), the Republic of Korea (1,700) and the United States
(1,100). The top three current owners were State Grid Corporation of China (424/
China), Huawei (158/China) and IBM (145/United States).
United States companies lead the big data market. The main providers of big data
(storage platform, analytics) services include Alphabet, Amazon, Dell Technologies,
HP Enterprise, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP (Germany), Splunk and Teradata.36 The
top user sectors of big data, measured by spending on big data services, are
banking, discrete manufacturing and professional services.37 Prices of big data
systems depend on the objective. For example, building and maintaining data
warehouses can cost between $19,000 and $25,000 per terabyte (TB) annually,
meaning a data warehouse containing 40TB of information (a modest repository for
many large enterprises) requires an annual budget of around $880,000, assuming
each TB comes with $22,000 in upkeep.38
The big data market ($31.93 billion in 2017) is set to expand rapidly.39 On the supply
side, the growth is mainly driven by increasing use of the Internet, and adoption of
cloud services and solutions, and increases in the amount of data40 and the number
of mobile devices and apps.41 However, the lack of skilled workers is inhibiting
growth of the big data market.42 On the demand side, growth is mainly driven by
the increasing adoption of big data by the finance sector for risk management
and customer service, and greater demand for real-time analytics from various
sectors.43 However, lack of awareness of the benefits of big data, as well as privacy
and security concerns, could hinder market growth.44
The big data industry is facing a significant shortage of scientists. As more industries
adopted big data, the demand for data scientists rose.45 For instance, in the United
States as of 2018, there was a shortage of 151,717 people with data science
backgrounds especially in New York City (34,032), the San Francisco Bay Area
(31,798) and Los Angeles (12,251).

States (1,277), Antigua and Barbuda (300) and China (270). The top current owners
were nChain (336/United Kingdom), Mastercard (181/United States) and IBM (134/
United States).
United States companies are the leading blockchain service providers. Top
providers of blockchain (blockchain-as-a-service providers)46 include Alibaba
(China), Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP (Germany).47 Top user sectors
measured by spending on blockchain services were the finance, manufacturing
and retail sectors (IDC, 2019b). Blockchain is a feature-dependent technology, so
the final price depends on the specific project requirements. The development cost
of a blockchain project typically ranges between $5,000 and $200,000.48
The blockchain market is relatively small compared with the other frontier
technologies ($708 million in 2017), but it is expected to grow rapidly. On the
supply side, the application fields of blockchain have expanded to include financial
transactions (online payments and credit and debit card payments) as well as IoT,
health and supply chains.49 Potential market constraints are issues associated with
scalability and security, uncertain regulatory standards and difficulties posed by the
technology in integration with existing applications.50 On the demand side, growth
is mainly driven increasing by online transactions, digitization of currencies, secure
online payment gateways, the growing interest of the banking, financial services
and insurance sectors and the number of merchants accepting cryptocurrencies.51
The blockchain job market is growing very fast. Demand for blockchain engineers in
the United States increased 400 per cent between 2017 and 2018.52 The average
income of a blockchain engineer is around $150,000-175,000 per year, making it
higher than the $135,000 average software engineer salary.53 This trend is further
driven by the large technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, IBM and

be energy utilities, manufacturing and public safety.56 At the inception stage around
2017 and 2018, prices for 5G technology were available from only a limited number
of carriers. In the United States, for example, compared to 4G networks, Verizon
charged $10 more per month, AT&T charged $20 more per month (for the mobile
hotspot) while T-Mobile kept the price the same.57 Countries expected to be the
early adopters of 5G technologies are the Republic of Korea, China, Japan and the
United States.58
The 5G market ($608 million in 2018) is expected to more than double every year
until 2025.59 On the supply side, the rollout of 5G takes around five years to achieve
broad coverage. One constraint is the need to upgrade the infrastructure such as
microcell towers and base stations60 the costs of which could impede diffusion.61
On the demand side, growth is mainly driven by rising demand for mobile broadband,
the growing use of smartphones and smart wearable devices, and the increase in
mobile video adoption,62 as well as rapid developments in IoT and the rising number
of connected devices, initiatives towards smart cities, and the shift in consumer
preference from premise- to cloud-based solutions.63
5G is set to create many job opportunities. It is estimated that by 2035, the global
5G value chain, including network operators, core technologies and components
providers, OEM device manufacturers, infrastructure equipment manufacturers
and content and application developers, will support 22 million jobs globally. China
will have the largest number of 5G-related jobs (9.5 million) followed by the United
States (3.4 million) and Japan (2.1 million)64

Market size

Market size data, as measured by the revenue generated in the market, is based on various market
research reports available online. Since each market research report yields somewhat different
numbers, the market size data was collected so that the compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
was the largest. Also, the number of years between the base year and the prediction year used to
calculate the CAGR varies by technology, ranging from six to nine years.

4.

Frontier technology providers

Since there was no structured, reliable information about market share or company profit readily
available for frontier technologies, the top frontier technology providers were identified through
an online search, listing companies most commonly referred to as top providers. The number of
companies listed is not the same across the 11 frontier technologies because there is no effective
way to narrow down the list to the same number for each technology. Moreover, the online search
was conducted in English, potentially leading to more favourable results for companies from Englishspeaking countries. Therefore, the technology providers information is indicative only and needs to
be interpreted cautiously.

5.

Frontier technology users

Frontier technology users (sectors) are ranked according to the scale of spending by the user sectors
of each technology. The exceptions were 5G, gene editing, nanotechnology and solar PV for which
spending data was not available and hence estimates available online were used instead.

Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is when
an external service provider sets up all
the necessary blockchain technology and
infrastructure for a customer for a fee. By
paying for BaaS, a client pays the BaaS
provider to set up and maintain blockchain
connected nodes on their behalf. A BaaS
provider handles the complex back-end for
the client and their business.

ANNEX C. HOW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT INEQUALITIES
IN THE USER’S PERSPECTIVE
Frontier technologies could impact inequality through the products (goods and services) that use
or are produced and distributed using these technologies. This Report adopts elements from the
Capability Approach1 to identify the channels through which products that apply frontier technologies
affect inequalities. There is a sizeable literature that applies the Capability Approach to technology,
particularly in the area of ICT, although there are still many areas of debate.2
Products that apply frontier technologies (e.g. AI systems, industrial robots, drones, gene editing
therapies, solar PV systems) have characteristics that can give people certain capabilities to function
(e.g. improved decision, strength, move objects across long distances, become free from disease,
use electricity) (Figure 01). A particular technology can be applied in a multitude of products (goods
and services); therefore, in the discussion of the frontier technologies and inequalities, it is essential
to have in mind what specific product we are talking about. In the case of many of the frontier
technologies, which have characteristics of general-purpose technologies that can be used in many
contexts and in the development of several other technologies, this consideration becomes even
more important.
A critical element is the characteristics of a product. These characteristics are a combination of the
results of the design of these products, which determines their technical characteristics (e.g. unit
cost, aesthetics, weight, size, performance), and the business models used for bringing them into
reality, which determine the market characteristics of these products (e.g. target user, unit price,
delivery channels). These market characteristics exist even when the product is not traded in the
market, but is, for example, provided publicly by the government or through another non-market
mechanism. Those technical and market characteristics define, in their turn, what the product is, its
purpose, where and when it is available.
The products that apply frontier technologies can give people some capabilities (increased choice)
depending on personal, social, and environmental factors. The availability of the product combined
with the interaction of the product with the factors mentioned above determine the access that a
person has to that particular product. Therefore, the design and business model for the provision of
a product, combined with the diverse conversion factors of different people, result in differences in
access to these products.
Access in this context can be described by: availability, affordability, awareness, accessibility, and
the ability for effective use of the technology.3 The differential access to the goods and services that
apply technologies could reinforce inequalities. For example, those that get access to the benefits of
the technology first get ahead, and usually, they are those already well-off in the first place. First users
can also influence the development of the technology itself via user-producer interactions, helping
make the technology evolve in a direction more aligned with their needs and context. The differential
access to products is itself the result of previous disparities (e.g. in income levels), in a vicious cycle.
Unequal access is not a particular feature of products that apply frontier technologies. Not all
innovations are the result of an explicit effort to make the end product, for example, more affordable.
As with any new technology, many companies, when they innovate and develop new goods and
services, they tend to focus on higher-income consumers that can bear the higher initial prices of
these products. High-income consumers benefit from new technologies first, but they end up paying
the costs of further development and diffusion of new technologies. Similarly, in terms of availability
and awareness, products cannot reach the whole world at the same time. In terms of ability to use
and accessibility, not everyone may be able to use the product.
The social context also affects access to technology. For example, social norms can restrict access
to technology for women, ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups, even within the same
household.

Innovation with equity

However, having the access (in the broader definition used above) to the products that use frontier
technologies, and therefore the capabilities associated with them, does not mean that a person
realizes those capabilities automatically. It depends on the choices that people make. The aggregation
of the choices that people make (including people who do not have access to the products that apply
frontier technologies) affect developmental outcomes such as inequality (in its various dimensions),
poverty reduction, environmental protection, and climate change. These consequences do not
have to necessarily move in the same direction (towards positive outcomes). An innovation applying
frontier technology could, for example, contribute to reducing poverty (e.g. use of blockchain to
enable a cryptocurrency that can be used to send remittances) and at the same time be harmful to
the environment (e.g. high need for energy in some of the cryptocurrency systems).
Products and services can also reduce the capabilities of people, either directly, for example when a
person takes a particular medicine, and that causes a severe adverse side effect, or indirectly through
some externality of the use by other people, for example through pollution. Therefore, technologies
are used in products that could benefit or harm people. In fact, it is possible that technologies are
beneficial for some people and harm some other people at the same time. Or even that it benefits
some people in some dimension (e.g. economic) and harm some of these same people in some other
dimension (e.g. environmental).
These implications of the products that apply the technology could be intended or unintended
consequences, based on the design and business model of the provision of the products.
The products that use frontier technologies are the fruit of innovations that emerge from the national
system of innovation. Therefore, these innovations reflect the context and biases of the actors of the
innovation system. Technology in itself is not neutral as it is developed in specific social and political
contexts which shape its attributes.
In summary, the design and business models affect the access (in broader terms) to the products that
apply frontier technologies, which could affect inequalities. Those that have access to the technology
first get an advantage. Inequalities in access to frontier technologies are the result of existing disparities
and reinforce those inequalities. Design and business models could also affect the consequences of
the use of the products that apply frontier technologies, intentionally or unintentionally, also affecting
inequalities (among other developmental outcomes). Therefore, to contribute to reducing inequalities
and to sustainable development, products that use frontier technologies should be designed, and the
business models to bring them into the market should be developed, taking into consideration the
access to these products and the intended and unintended consequences of their use.

TECHNICAL NOTE – READINESS FOR FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES INDEX

As a result of a review of the literature, UNCTAD’s analytical and technical cooperation work,
consultation with experts within and outside UNCTAD, as well as taking into consideration data
availability, five building blocks were selected for the index to measure the capacity to use, adopt
and adapt frontier technologies: ICT deployment, skills, R&D activity, industry activity and access to
finance. The five building blocks and the selected indicators are as follows (Table 6):
1. ICT deployment – This is the level of ICT infrastructure. Using, adopting and adapting frontier
technologies requires sufficient ICT infrastructure, especially since AI, IoT, big data and blockchain
are internet-based technologies. Two aspects of ICT infrastructure need to be considered: the
prevalence to ensure that everyone has access and that no one is left behind; and the quality of
infrastructure that allows for more advanced and efficient use. For these purposes, internet users
as a percentage of the population captures the prevalence of internet infrastructure, while the mean
download speed measures the quality of internet connection.
2. Skills – Using, adopting and adapting frontier technologies needs people equipped with
relevant skills. These may be advanced but are generally lower than those required to originate
the technologies. Two types of skills need to be considered: skills acquired through education,
and skills acquired in the workplace through practical training or learning-by-doing. The overall
educational attainment of the population is measured through expected years of schooling, while
the skill level in the labour market is measured by the extent of high-skill employment – defined
by the ILO as the sum of managers, professionals and technicians and associate professionals
following the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). These indicators need to
be interpreted with caution, especially in developing countries, because of the emigration of highly
trained or skilled people, the “brain drain”, as a result of which the actual skill level could be lower
than the official estimate.
3. R&D activity – R&D activity is needed not just for the production of frontier technologies, but also
for adoption and adaption, as these technologies often require adjustment or modification for local
use. R&D activities are measured using the number of publications and patents filed on the 11
frontier technologies in a country. The publication and patent search queries used are the same as
shown in the Technical note in Annex B, the only difference being the year of interest – a single year
for the index instead of 1996-2018. The countries of publication of authors and patent assignees
were analysed. It should be noted that, especially in developing countries, there are informal R&D
activities that do not result in a publication or patent so the R&D scores might not reflect the actual
scale of activities.
4. Industry activity – This building block aims to capture ongoing activities in an industry related
to the use, adoption and adaption of frontier technologies. It considers three sectors that are early

adopters: manufacturing, with high-tech manufacturing as the frontrunner; finance; and ICT, which
tends to interact with other technologies. Then it uses export data, on high-technology manufactures,
as well as on digitally deliverable services which cover both finance and ICT. However, especially in
developing countries, activities are also undertaken by firms in the informal sector – which are often
outside official statistics. The scores from these countries could therefore be lower than the actual
activity.
5. Access to finance – This assesses the availability of finance to the private sector. Better access
to finance could accelerate the use, adoption and adaption of frontier technologies. For this
purpose, domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP was selected as part of the
index. This indicator measures resources provided by financial corporations such as finance and
leasing companies, money lenders, insurance corporations, pension funds and foreign exchange
companies. It also includes various financial instruments including loans, purchases of non-equity
securities, and trade credits and other accounts receivable. However, there could also be other,
unconventional financing providers or financial instruments that are not covered sufficiently by this
indicator.

The selection of building blocks and underlying indicators was constrained by data availability. As
the objective of this index is to cover as many countries as possible, especially developing countries,
every effort was made to find indicators with the widest possible country coverage. In addition, in
order to ensure that the chosen indicators are directly linked to the building blocks and the final index
of interest, certain types of indicator were avoided. These included perception indicators such as
policy effectiveness for which it is difficult to ensure objectivity or cross-country comparability, and
input indicators whose effects may not be as straightforward as those of output indicators. Based on
these considerations, some of the indicators excluded are indicated in Table 7.
The underlying indicator data were then statistically manipulated to form the index. Firstly, the data
were imputed using the cold deck imputation method (i.e. retroactively filling the missing values with
the latest values available from the same country). It should be noted that as this index deals with
frontier technologies whose development is a recent phenomenon and happening rapidly, cold deck
imputation could potentially understate a country’s performance in the year of interest since it could
still be at the initial phase of technological development. An alternative imputation method, such as
multivariate imputation, was considered, however, the variables were unlikely to be suitable explanatory

variables to impute missing values hence this method was not used. Therefore, imputation is one
area that could potentially be further improved in future versions of the index. Following imputation,
countries with missing values as well as those with extreme outlier values were removed from the
dataset. Then, variables that had very skewed distributions (both p-value for skewness and p-value
for joint skewness and kurtosis were 0) were transformed using a log transformation. After that, the
Z-score standardization was conducted using the following formula:

Where:

X is a value to be standardized;
μ is the mean of the population;
σ is the standard deviation of the population.

The standardized value of each indicator was then normalized to fall between the range of 0 to 1
using the formula below:

Where:

X is a Z-score standardized score to be normalized;
Max is the largest score in the population;
Min is the smallest score in the population.
After these procedures, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted, mainly because of
its advantage to remove correlated features among indicators and reduce overfitting. Based on the
variance explained criteria method, PCA found that three principal components could retain more
than 80 per cent of the variation. Thus, the final index was derived by assigning the weights generated
by PCA with rotation to the three principal components, and then standardized and normalized to fall
within the range of 0 to 1 (Table 8).

Separately, PCA was also performed on each building block of the index to derive the score and
country ranking within each building block. Here again, PCA used the minimum number of principal
components that could retain more than 80 per cent of the variation. PCA was not conducted for the
access to finance building block as it contained only one indicator.
