BIS 79th Annual Report

79th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 29 June 2009

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 79th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2009.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 446.1 million, compared with
SDR 544.7 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial
year 2008/09 may be found on pages 176–80 of this Report under “Financial
results and profit distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 144.7 million
in payment of a dividend of SDR 265 per share, payable in any constituent
currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs. This year’s proposed dividend per
share is the same as paid out last year.
The Board further recommends that SDR 30.1 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund and the remainder – amounting to SDR 271.3 million – to
the free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2008/09 will be payable to shareholders on 2 July 2009.

I. Rescue, recovery, reform

The financial
system is the
plumbing of the
economy …

… and it has been
critically damaged

How could this happen? No one thought that the financial system could
collapse. Sufficient safeguards were in place. There was a safety net: central
banks that would lend when needed, deposit insurance and investor
protections that freed individuals from worrying about the security of their
wealth, regulators and supervisors to watch over individual institutions and
keep their managers and owners from taking on too much risk. And when an
individual country faced a banking crisis, experts – feeling they knew better –
would criticise the authorities for their mistakes. Prosperity and stability were
evidence that the system worked. Inflation was low, growth was high, and
both were stable. The policy framework, built on sound economic principles
combined with a bit of learning, had delivered the Great Moderation in the
industrial world. The emerging market world was wisely following the lead.
What a difference two years make. Since August 2007, the financial
system has experienced a sequence of critical failures.
The financial system is the economy’s plumbing. And like the plumbing
in a house, it is taken for granted when it works, but when it doesn’t, watch
out. In the same way that modern living depends on a reliable flow of water
running through pipes, the modern economic system depends on a reliable
flow of financing through intermediaries. On an average day, billions of
individual payments are made, each requiring the transfer of funds. But daily
life is even more reliant on financial intermediation than this suggests.
Many people in the industrial world own the home in which they live because
they saved a portion of their income each month in a financial institution, and
then combined those savings with a mortgage to purchase the home.
Obtaining the mortgage almost surely required obtaining fire insurance from
an insurance company. The electricity, water and heating bills are probably
paid each month using funds deposited automatically by the homeowner’s
employer into the homeowner’s account at a commercial bank. Travelling to
work each day means either riding on public transport financed in part by
bonds and taxes or driving in an insured car on a publicly or privately
financed road. And that’s really just the beginning. Modern life requires the
smooth operation of banks, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual
funds, finance companies, pension funds and governments. These institutions
channel resources from those who save to those who invest, and they are
supposed to transfer risk from those who can’t afford it to those who are
willing and able to bear it.
Over the past few years, this essential and complex system of finance has
been critically damaged. Evidence of serious trouble emerged when banks
became less willing to lend to each other, because they were no longer sure
how to value the assets held and the promises made – both their own and

those of potential borrowers. For a time, central bank lending was able to fill
the gap. But, as described in Chapter II, from August 2007 the stress in the
financial system increased in waves. By March 2008, Bear Stearns had to be
rescued; six months later, on 15 September, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt;
and by the end of September, the global financial system itself was on the
verge of collapse.
The financial system is based on trust, and in the wake of the Lehman
failure that trust was lost. Ordinary people had placed their confidence in those
who ran and monitored the financial system, only to discover that the system
could fail anyway. The crisis shattered lenders’ trust that a loan previously
thought to be of high quality was likely to be repaid, and it dissolved the
confidence of investors in the long-term safety of their investments. As the
difficult and time-consuming task of cleaning up institutions’ balance sheets
went on, property rights that are normally taken for granted were being
questioned; and so financial institutions – normally run, at least in part, by
traders and loan officers together with the risk managers who try to control
them – were placed in the hands of lawyers. Unfortunately, once lost, trust is
regained only slowly. And before trust can be fully regained, the financial
system will have to be rebuilt.
The modern financial system is immensely complex – possibly too complex
for any one person to really understand it. Interconnections create systemic
risks that are extraordinarily difficult to figure out. The fact that things
apparently worked so well (up until the time that they did not) gave everyone
a false sense of comfort. After all, when things are going well, why rock the
boat? But this understandable complacency, born out of booms that make
everyone better off, sows the seeds of collapse. Hence, as we attempt to
explain and fix what has failed, it is essential to keep in mind that the new
financial system must take better account of our inherently limited ability to
understand complex processes and to foresee their potential for failure.

What went wrong?
A financial crisis bears striking similarities to medical illness. In both cases,
finding a cure requires identifying and then treating the causes of the
disease. Looking at the past few years, we can divide the causes of the current
crisis into two broad categories: macroeconomic and microeconomic. The
macroeconomic causes fall into two groups: problems associated with the
build-up of imbalances in international claims and difficulties created by the
long period of low real interest rates. The microeconomic causes fall into
three areas: incentives, risk measurement and regulation.1

While they will be treated separately here, it is important to keep in mind that the macroeconomic
and microeconomic causes of the crisis are related. For example, financial innovation is connected to
credit booms. In the case of the current financial crisis, one could point to information technology as an
important link. Without the advances in computer processing speed seen over, say, the past two
decades, financial engineers would not have been able to value the complex instruments they were
fabricating. And unless you convince investors that you know how to price a new instrument, there is
no way to sell it. So, technological innovation that produced low-cost, high-speed computing contributed
to the credit boom.

The crisis was
caused by a broad
set of failures

Macroeconomic causes: imbalances and interest rates
The macroeconomic
causes of the crisis
were global
imbalances …

… combined with
export-led or
leverage-led
growth …

… and low interest
rates …

One set of macroeconomic causes of the developing crisis stemmed from the
notorious global imbalances – the persistent and large current account deficits
and surpluses resulting in capital flows from capital-poor emerging market
countries to capital-rich industrial economies, especially the United States. The
high level of the saving rate in the emerging market world and its low level in
the United States were associated with these flows. Over the years from 1999
to mid-2007 – from the end of the Asian crisis to the beginning of the current
crisis – the cumulative US current account deficit was $4.6 trillion. The US
Treasury estimates that, by the end of 2007, US gross external debt was
roughly $13.4 trillion, nearly four times what it had been just nine years earlier.
As this pattern of international capital flows was developing, its cause
was hotly debated. One hypothesis was that it came from a global saving glut,
which in turn was a consequence of the rise in the saving rate in emerging
markets. Another proposition was that it arose from the dearth of investment
opportunities worldwide. A third candidate was fast-growing emerging market
countries’ desire for both international diversification and low-risk liquid
assets. And a fourth possibility was that emerging market economies were
accumulating foreign exchange reserves to fight the appreciation of their
currencies that would have naturally accompanied the current account
surpluses associated with their export-led growth. Related to this last view is
the possibility that emerging market countries saw these reserve stockpiles as
welcome war chests to help them defend against sudden capital flow reversals
of the sort that had occurred during the Asian crisis.
It is difficult to know what to do about the dependency that developed
between the export-led growth in much of the emerging world (described in
Chapter V) and the leverage-led growth in a large part of the industrial world
(discussed in Chapter IV). Surely there is a need to ensure that national saving is
neither too low nor too high – but what policies could achieve that? And should
anything be done about the magnitude of foreign exchange reserve holdings?
It is important to keep in mind that persistent current account imbalances
are not the only thing that matters. Those imbalances just measure the net
flows of goods and services and the matching net flows of private capital plus
changes in official reserve holdings. Apart from the net flows, the total stock
of claims is important as well. The stock measures the quantity of the claims
of residents in one country on the residents of another, and these claims are
critical for at least two reasons. First, if the appeal of investing abroad suddenly
drops, it is the stock of claims that investors will try to repatriate. Second, and
even more importantly here, if one country is producing assets that are grossly
mispriced and whose quality is lower than is generally perceived, they can act
as a virus, carrying the disease abroad from the country of issue. That is, foreign
investors overpay for the bad assets and then become as sick as domestic
investors. When that happens, as it did with the securities backed by US
subprime mortgages, the critical measure is the total quantity of the bad assets
that are being held, not the net changes in holdings over any given period.
The second set of macroeconomic causes of the brewing crisis stemmed
from the protracted period of low real interest rates in the first half of this

BIS 79th Annual Report

decade. The proximate cause of the low rates was the combination of policy
choices in both the industrial and emerging market economies together with
the capital flows from emerging market countries seeking low-risk investments.
A fear of deflation in those years led policymakers to keep short-term real
interest rates unusually low. The real federal funds rate in the United States
was consistently below 1% from mid-2001 up to the end of 2005; indeed, for
much of this period it was negative (see Chapter IV). There were two reasons
why the low real rates in the United States had a much greater effect on
global economies and financial conditions than the size of the United States
in the world economy would suggest: international contracts are often
denominated in dollars, and many fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes
use the dollar as a reference currency.
Real interest rates in the other major industrial economies were not much
higher than those in the United States. In response to sluggish growth in the
euro area, the ECB held short-term real interest rates below 1% for most of the
period between mid-2001 and 2005; in Japan, real interest rates have been
hovering between 0 and 1% for most of the past decade. And – in part to contain
exchange rate appreciation pressures – many emerging market economies
followed suit.
Low real interest rates had a variety of important effects, some more
predictable than others. On the more predictable side, by making borrowing
cheap they led to a credit boom in a number of industrial economies. For
instance, credit in the United States and the United Kingdom rose annually
by 7% and 10%, respectively, between 2003 and mid-2007 (see Chapter III). It
is always difficult to establish clear causal links, but in this case it seems
reasonable to conclude that cheap credit formed the basis for the increase in
home purchases as well as for the dramatic rise in household revolving debt.
A second predictable effect of low interest rates was to increase the present
discounted value of the revenue streams arising from earning assets, driving
up asset prices. This was one element feeding the property and stock market
booms. Real house prices in the United States, the United Kingdom and a
number of European countries increased more than 30% between 2003 and
the peak reached three to four years later, while global equity markets rose
more than 90% from 2003 to mid-2007.
Among the less expected effects of the low interest rates were the
incentives they created in the asset management business. Financial
institutions regularly enter into long-term contracts committing them to produce
relatively high nominal rates of return. When interest rates become unusually
low, the returns promised in those contracts can become more difficult to
generate. At that point, the institution responds by taking on more risk in the
hope of generating the returns needed to remain profitable. Something similar
is true of asset managers whose clients expect high nominal returns. Again,
increasing risk (and, in this case, hiding it) is one way of meeting clients’
demands. So, low interest rates increase risk-taking.2

… which caused a
credit boom

The boom caused
distortions …

… that need to be
unwound

All of this – the housing boom, the boom in debt-financed consumer
expenditure and the search for yield – helped distort the macroeconomic
structure of a number of countries. The clearest signs of the distortions
were dramatic increases in residential construction, in consumer durables
consumption, especially of cars, and in the size of the financial sector.
Those distortions had important short- and medium-term effects. In the
short term, they fooled investors, consumers and policymakers into thinking
that trend growth was higher than it really was. And in the medium term, they
created the need for substantial adjustments. Where do these misperceptions
show up? Unsurprisingly, bubbles tend to be concentrated in sectors where
productivity growth has, or is perceived to have, risen. In the 1990s, that
sector was high technology; in this decade, it was finance. The pattern is
straightforward: the boom makes capital relatively cheap for the favoured
industry, creating overemployment, overinvestment and overproduction. While
less of a problem in the current decade than in the previous one, the result is
a temporary rise in measured average productivity gains across all sectors,
which everyone, including policymakers, can easily mistake for an increase in
trend growth.
The bubble-induced distortions have medium-term implications for the
economic structure that are more familiar than the short-term effects. We have
seen these regularly when relative prices changed in a manner requiring
significant adjustment in the composition of the capital stock. Historical
examples include the impact of the sudden increase in oil prices, in 1974 and
again in 1979, which left households and firms with appliances, automobiles,
machinery and buildings that were more energy-intensive than could be
justified by the new operating cost. This time, countries have been left with
bloated financial sectors, the ability to build more cars than their populations
need and, in some cases, surplus housing stocks.

Microeconomic causes: incentives, risk measurement and regulation
Microeconomic

incentives, risk

regulation

Distorted incentives

monitoring …

The financial stress that began in the summer of 2007 has revealed a myriad of
limitations in microeconomic financial arrangements. These include problems
with incentives; flaws in techniques used to measure, price and manage risk
and in the corporate governance structures used to monitor it; and failings of
the regulatory system. Jointly, these weaknesses allowed the entire financial
industry to book profits too early, too easily and without proper risk adjustment.
The crisis has revealed distorted incentives for consumers, for financial
sector employees and for rating agencies. First, consumers failed to watch out
for themselves. Few people have any knowledge of the balance sheets of
the banks where they do business or of the finances of the firms in which
they invest through the purchase of equity or debt securities. And the overall
level of financial literacy among the general population is low.3 This lack of

Indeed, it would seem that the majority of people do not understand the mechanics of interest rates. In
response to a question about how many years it would take for a debt to double if the interest rate is 20%
per year compounded annually and nothing is repaid, only 36% of 1,000 respondents chose the correct
option (“Less than 5 years”), and nearly 20% answered “Do not know”. See A Lusardi and P Tufano, “Debt
literacy, financial experiences, and overindebtedness”, NBER Working Papers, no 14808, March 2009.

knowledge combined with the existence of financial oversight structures made
people all too willing to mistake the complexity of the system for sophistication.
And it made them all too willing to assume that their investments were safe.
After all, someone else was watching – be it a trusted manager, an equity
analyst, a credit rating agency or a government official. But none of them were.
The system that consumers so readily assumed was sophisticated and safe
was, in fact, recklessly complex and opaque.
As if that wasn’t enough, managers of financial firms saw a need to drive
up returns on their equity to satisfy shareholders. That led to an explosion
in debt financing. The reason is straightforward: the return on equity equals
the return on assets times the ratio of assets to equity – that is, higher
leverage yields higher returns to the owners. This private incentive to
increase leverage created not only fragile institutions but also an unstable
financial system.
Compensation schemes further encouraged managers to forsake longrun prospects for short-run return. In some cases, profits calculated with
complex mathematical models were used to determine rewards even when
markets for the assets underlying the calculations did not exist and so they
could not be sold. Equity holders (because of limited liability) and asset
managers (because of their compensation system) were unduly rewarded for
risk-taking: they received a portion of the upside, but the downside belonged
to the creditors (or the government!). Moreover, managers of assets in a
given asset class were rewarded for performance exceeding benchmarks
representing average performance in that investment category. As a result,
even if managers recognised a bubble in the price of some asset, they could
not take advantage of that knowledge by selling short for fear that investors
would withdraw funds. The result was herding that caused arbitrage to fail.4
In the end, the overall difficulty in distinguishing luck from skill in the
performance of asset managers, combined with compensation based at least
in part on the volume of business, encouraged managers and traders to
accumulate huge amounts of risk.
Added to failures in monitoring by individuals and flawed compensation
schemes were the skewed incentives of the rating agencies. These organisations
are designed to mitigate the information problems that plague debt financing
by providing a third-party evaluation of the likelihood that a borrower will
repay a loan or bond. There are a number of problems with this system.
Ratings are expensive, difficult to produce and impossible to keep secret.
Once information becomes public, its reproduction is costless. Knowing that,
the rating agencies charge those who need the ratings most – the bond
issuers. Although neither new nor unique – rating agencies have charged
bond issuers for decades, and auditors are paid by those they audit – this
arrangement helped distort incentives. Moreover, the complexity of the financial
instruments and the pace of issue – the flood of asset-backed securities and
structured finance products issued over the past decade – made the rating

managers from bad ones, see J Stein, “Why are most funds open-end? Competition and the limits of
arbitrage”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol 120, no 1, February 2005, pp 247–72.

Challenges to risk

included:

the infrequency of
infrequent events;

new instruments;

business both more difficult and more profitable. And because of the
complexity of the instruments, reliance on ratings increased even among
the most sophisticated institutional investors.5 In the end, the rating agencies
– assigned the task of assessing the risk of fixed income securities and thus
of guarding collective safety – became overwhelmed and, by issuing
unrealistically high ratings, inadvertently contributed to the build-up of
systemic risk.6
Next on the list of microeconomic causes of the crisis is risk measurement.
Measuring, pricing and managing risk all require modern statistical tools based
largely on historical experience. Even when long data histories are available,
the belief that the world evolves slowly but permanently means down-weighting
the importance of the distant past. The implication is that a long period of
relative stability will lead to the perception that risk is permanently lower,
driving down its price.
Addressing this misperception is an enormous challenge. The major risks
– those that require substantial compensation – are large, infrequent events.
In the parlance of statisticians, we need an accurate assessment of the size of
the tails of the distribution of outcomes. But such an assessment can only
come from historical experience, and infrequent events are, well, infrequent.
Thus, the statistical models needed for measuring, pricing and managing risk
will, almost by definition, be inaccurate because of a lack of data. Given its
simplicity, the natural assumption is that returns of many different assets are
normally distributed (and so have thin tails). And, although tail events are
infrequent, in reality they are more frequent than is predicted by a normal
distribution. Even though the problem with assuming a normal distribution
was well known, the assumption persisted with the unsurprising result that
insurance against infrequent catastrophes was underpriced.
The difficulty of assessing the tails of the distribution of outcomes is even
greater for new financial instruments. With no history, their riskiness cannot
be statistically measured at all. This lack of experience was one of the problems
associated with securitising subprime mortgages in the United States. The
innovation of pooling together large numbers of what were objectively lowquality loans, and then creating a mix of high-quality and low-quality securities
backed by the pool, allowed debt market access to an entirely new class of
borrowers.7 The major flaw, however, was that originators generally retained
little of the default risk, and so as the boom developed, the quality of the loans
progressively worsened. But even if originators had been forced to retain a

limitations of ratings as measures of risk, see Committee on the Global Financial System, “The role of
ratings in structured finance: issues and implications”, CGFS Publications, no 23, January 2005.

Differences in the methodologies used by the rating agencies also provided incentives for the
originators to structure their asset-backed securities in ways that would allow them to “shop” for the
best available combination of ratings (across both rating agencies and the liabilities structure of those
instruments). See I Fender and J Kiff, “CDO rating methodology: some thoughts on model risk and its
implications”, BIS Working Papers, no 163, November 2004.

significant first loss, securitised pools of subprime mortgages might still have
run into trouble because of a lack of default experience.
Reliance on historical performance to measure, price and manage risk
has another pitfall – it can offer misleading conclusions about the correlation
among various risks. Risk is reduced through (1) hedging, whereby two risks are
thought to offset each other because their payoffs are negatively correlated;
and (2) diversification, whereby risk is spread among assets whose returns are
less than perfectly correlated. The problem is that historical correlations may
be poor guides to future price movements. For example, before the crisis,
investing globally was thought to reduce risk, as prices in various regions of
the world would not move together. This assumption turned out to be false
when everyone most needed it to be true. When asset prices that previously
moved independently (providing diversification) or in opposite directions
(providing a hedge) start to move together, what used to reduce risk increases
it. When the bad times came, correlations became large and positive. What
was risk reduction became risk concentration.
Finally, there were governance problems in risk management practices.
For both structural and behavioural reasons, senior managers and board
members were neither asking the right questions nor listening to the right
people. The structural problem was that risk officers did not have sufficient
day-to-day contact with top decision-makers, often because they did not have
sufficiently senior positions in their organisations. Without support from top
management, it didn’t matter much what the chief risk officer said or to whom
he or she said it. The structural problem was compounded by the behavioural
response to a risk officer whose job it is to tell people to limit or stop what
they are doing. If what they are doing is profitable, it is going to be difficult to
get managers and directors to listen.
Risk management in financial institutions has of course improved over
time in addressing the incentive-related problems that arose during previous
booms. But while there had been progress, it was based on a world with less
leverage and risk-taking than we saw in the latest boom.
Beyond the problems with incentives and risk measurement was the
fact that financial institutions found it relatively easy to move activities outside
the regulatory perimeter. Inside the supervisors’ sphere of influence, banks
are required to hold capital in order to engage in risky activities. While it
may be hard to believe, the regulatory capital requirement did limit the
build-up of leverage on bank balance sheets. However, lower leverage meant
lower profitability, so bank managers found ways to increase risk without
increasing the capital they were required to hold. That is the story of the
structured investment vehicle. More generally, the crisis showed that the
enlarged financial sector – comprising both traditional banks and an
increasingly important parallel financial system composed of non-bank
intermediaries and off-balance sheet entities – had become much riskier than
in the past.8

There were danger signs. Pervasive current account deficits were unsustainable.
And households could not borrow forever – they would need to repay their
loans eventually. In many regions, house prices were rising more quickly than
they ever had, and price levels far exceeded both replacement costs and
values justified by rental incomes. Rather than seeing their houses as merely
a place to live and a hedge against future increases in the price of housing –
a view that could have dampened the boom – many home buyers thought that
they would profit from rising prices, feeding the boom.
There were warnings. Observers noted that risk was underpriced and
that, constrained by low policy rates, asset managers were too aggressive in
their search for yield. Some worried that monetary policy was inattentive to
the dangers that arise when an asset price boom is coupled with a credit
boom.9 They warned that a single-minded focus on price stability (combined
with prudential regulators’ narrow focus on individual institutions) left officials
insufficiently aware of systemic threats arising from credit and asset price
booms.10 Commentators cautioned about the deterioration of credit standards,
especially in the issuance of mortgages.11 And they warned about the risks
that come with rapid financial innovation.12
Many of these warnings turned out to be accurate, but obviously they were
issued in vain.13 While people agreed on the general nature of the stresses
that were building in the system, there was little agreement on the details. The
implications of the porous regulatory perimeter – through which firms could
easily move activity beyond the view of officials – and the build-up of financial
leverage – in which the capital structure shifted to one with relatively more debt
and relatively less equity – were simply not well understood. Although some
people called for effective regulation of hedge funds, they were much less
vocal about the need to keep intermediaries from shifting loans to conduits
and structured investment vehicles that had virtually no capital. Finally, almost
no one realised that the US assets being spread around the world would turn
out to be toxic.
It is not surprising that government officials and market participants were
largely deaf to the alarms. A common response was: “Even if you are right,
and the financial system is in danger, what do you want me to do?” Monetary

policymakers’ only available instrument was the short-term interest rate, and
there was a broad consensus that this tool would be ineffective against the
alleged threat. At the macroeconomic level, the expectation was that price
stability would be enough and that asset and credit booms would self-correct.
And at the microeconomic level, officials believed that investors’ self-interest
would lead them to pay attention to the risks inherent in what they purchased
and act as their own regulators. The narrow focus on regulated institutions,
combined with a belief in the efficacy of self-regulation, meant that officials
were insufficiently alert to system-wide threats. And across countries, markedly
differing views about what could and should be done sharply limited progress
on what turned out to be an international problem.
Discussions of the need for someone to monitor and address the risk in
the financial system as a whole mostly fell flat. Numerous central banks took
their financial stability objectives seriously, issuing periodic reports on the
subject. Some, especially in Asia, fashioned tools aimed at moderating booms
in asset prices and credit. Examples were Thailand’s implementation of limits
on credit card issuance, Hong Kong SAR’s control over mortgage loan-to-value
ratios, and India’s tightening of capital requirements and provisions. Authorities
in many central and eastern European countries, as well as in Spain and some
Latin American countries, strengthened their monitoring and enforcement
of provisioning and loan evaluation and required banks to increase regulatory
capital consistent with the underlying risks. Active use of reserve requirements
to tighten or loosen liquidity denominated in both domestic and foreign
currencies was also a feature in some emerging market economies. But overall,
action of this sort was the exception, not the rule. In the industrial economies
– especially the United States, where the problem was becoming the most
severe – there was little discussion of what types of tools policymakers might
try to use to combat the property and credit booms, and the consequent
build-up of systemic risk. And it is easy to see why. Making what would have
been wholesale changes to the monetary and regulatory policy frameworks in
many countries would have presented nearly insurmountable political and
intellectual difficulties. Why would anyone risk such a move when the existing
apparatus appeared to be working so well?

The crisis evolves
The next five chapters of this Report provide a detailed description of what
has happened so far in the crisis in financial markets and institutions and in
the real economy, as well as how policymakers have responded. The story is
divided into five stages, described in detail in Chapter II: (1) the prelude, leading
up to the March 2008 takeover of Bear Stearns; (2) the gradual deterioration
in financial conditions from mid-March to the failure of Lehman Brothers on
15 September 2008; (3) from mid-September to late October, a global loss of
confidence, a massive flight to quality and the near collapse of the financial
system; (4) from late October, the severe decline in the global economy; and
(5) beginning in mid-March 2009, the deepening downturn and the first signs
of stabilisation. Table I.1 presents a summary.

Our analysis of the crisis leads to a variety of conclusions and highlights
a number of risks for the financial system. In a modern financial system, bankbased finance and market-based finance should be viewed as complementary
rather than as rivals or substitutes. The crisis revealed that the presumed
benefits of diversification derived from the creation of financial conglomerates
– the hypermarkets of the financial system – were an illusion. When the crisis
hit, all business lines were affected. Similarly, the benefits of slicing risk into its
smallest components through financial engineering were oversold. However,
reducing the size of the bloated financial industry should not be confused with
a recommendation of financial autarky. The retreat of finance back inside
national borders must be resisted. If left unchecked, the process would result
in protectionism.
For industrial economies, a powerful interaction between the financial
sector and the real economy began to take hold in the last quarter of 2008. A
dramatic loss of confidence was combined with the unwinding of imbalances
that had built up on household, industrial and financial system balance sheets
in the industrial economies since the beginning of the decade. The outcome
has been a severe downturn in both real activity and inflation. But since
leverage has only begun to adjust – credit in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors of the economies that have had credit booms remains well
above the level of only a few years ago – it is reasonable to anticipate both a
protracted downturn and a slow recovery.
For the emerging market economies, circumstances are quite different, as
they initially exhibited a great deal of resilience to the financial crisis. The high
degree of economic and financial integration that supported an extended
period of rapid growth also left them exposed to sharp reversals in capital
flows and declines in demand for their exports. Countries that maintained
prudent policies and low public debt, such as those in Asia and parts of Latin
America, still have flexibility to respond. However, some countries with large
current account deficits, and some where banks were making foreign currency
loans, have run into external financing difficulties requiring external official
assistance.
Policymakers have implemented a wide array of responses aimed at
restoring confidence in large banks and repairing the financial system. Interest
rates in most industrial economies were cut until they were at or near the zero
lower bound. A number of central banks expanded their balance sheets
massively to ease the acute tensions in financial markets. But even though
governments have taken on large commitments, they continue to be unwilling
or unable to fully address the impaired assets on bank balance sheets.
Traditional and unconventional central bank actions have been matched in
many places by equally aggressive fiscal expansion. Clearly, different countries
have different needs and capacities for increases in government spending. In
any case, an assessment of the various spending programmes will have to wait
until they take full effect.
Policymakers face enormous challenges. They must complete the urgent
task of financial repair while they keep the financial system operating in the
short term. At the same time, they must design exit strategies from the various

BIS 79th Annual Report

13

policy measures that have been implemented. And, all the while, officials
must work to build a resilient framework for the long term, crafting a system
capable of quickly returning to its normal state of operation in the event of
a failure.
A healthy financial system is a precondition for a sustained recovery.
Delaying financial repair risks hampering the efforts on other policy fronts. To
speed economic recovery, authorities must act quickly and decisively in their
efforts to repair the financial system, and must persevere until the job is done.
Officials will face a number of difficulties in exiting from the various crisisrelated policy interventions. When real activity returns to normal, inflated
central bank balance sheets will have to be slimmed down and policy interest
rates raised in a timely way. Public sector borrowing will have to be pulled
back to a sustainable path. And the intermediation now being conducted by
central banks will have to be returned to the private sector at the same time
that the financial sector shrinks.
Ensuring financial stability requires a redesign of macroeconomic as well
as regulatory and supervisory policies with an eye to mitigating systemic
risks. For macroeconomic policies, this means leaning against credit and asset
price booms; for regulatory and supervisory policies, it means adopting a
macroprudential perspective. Importantly, reform must focus on identifying
systemic risks arising in all parts of the financial system – risks that arise from
the complexity, opacity and ownership concentration of financial instruments;
from the counterparty risk and margining practices in financial markets; from
the risk of joint failure created by interconnections and common exposures;
and from the procyclicality that is inherent in financial institution management
and can be compounded by microprudential regulation.

II. The global financial crisis

The period since last year’s Annual Report saw the financial crisis enter its
second year and transform into a generalised loss of confidence in the global
financial system. The onset of the crisis in 2007 followed an extended period
of unusually low real interest rates, easy credit conditions, low volatility in
financial markets and widespread increases in asset prices that had generated
large-scale but hidden vulnerabilities. When these vulnerabilities crystallised
in the wake of repeated series of asset writedowns, key financial markets
became dysfunctional and the solvency of large parts of the global banking
system was challenged. In response, governments conducted successive
rounds of intervention on an unprecedented scale. Yet, despite the success of
these policy measures in halting the financial crisis, the market environment
remained fragile, suggesting that the process of normalisation was uncertain
and likely to be protracted.
So far, the crisis has developed in five more or less distinct stages of
varying intensity, starting with the subprime mortgage-related turmoil between
June 2007 and mid-March 2008 (Graph II.1). Following this first stage, during
which the primary focus was on funding liquidity, bank losses and writedowns
continued to accumulate as the cyclical deterioration slowly translated into
renewed asset price weakness. As a result, in the second stage of the crisis,
from March to mid-September 2008, funding problems morphed into concerns
about solvency, giving rise to the risk of outright bank failures. One such
failure, the demise of Lehman Brothers on 15 September, triggered the third
and most intense stage of the crisis: a global loss of confidence, arrested only
after unprecedented and broad-based policy intervention. Stage four, from

late October 2008 to mid-March 2009, saw markets adjust to an increasingly
gloomy global growth outlook amid uncertainties over the effects of ongoing
government intervention in markets and the economy. Stage five, beginning
in mid-March 2009, has been marked by signs that markets are starting to
show some optimism in the face of still largely negative macroeconomic and
financial news, even as true normalisation – the end of the crisis – still appears
some way off.

The early stages
Stage one: prelude (up to mid-March 2008)
Subprime losses
escalated into
widespread
financial stress …

… culminating in
the takeover of
Bear Stearns …

… and leaving the
financial system
badly weakened

During the first stage of the crisis, concerns over losses on US subprime
mortgage loans escalated into widespread financial stress. In brief, what initially
appeared to be a problem affecting only a small part of the US financial system
(Graph II.2) quickly spread more widely, as complex linkages among credit
(Graph II.3) and funding markets (Graph II.4) increasingly translated into
broad-based financial sector pressures (Table II.1).1
Starting in June 2007, losses from subprime mortgages exposed largescale vulnerabilities. These included the widespread use of leverage and offbalance sheet financing, so that supposedly low-risk assets – many of which
related to US mortgage market exposures – were effectively financed on a
rolling basis by short-term funds. Accumulating losses on the underlying assets
eventually disrupted the short-term funding model on which these positions
were based, triggering a process of forced reintermediation. On 9 August
2007, the turmoil spread to interbank markets, signalling the advent of a
broader financial market crisis. Valuation losses mounted during the following
months, putting pressure on bank balance sheets and eventually triggering a
severe liquidity shortage at Bear Stearns in mid-March 2008. These events
culminated in the government-facilitated takeover of the troubled investment
bank by JPMorgan Chase.
While an outright bank failure was avoided, this first stage of the crisis left
the financial system severely weakened. Large overhangs of credit exposures
weighed on markets, while banks struggled to replenish their capital positions.
Elevated volatilities were consistent with investor uncertainty about the
economic outlook and its implications for asset valuations (Graph II.5). Credit
default swap (CDS) spreads, in turn, were well above historical levels
(Graph II.6, centre panel) and equity prices had fallen substantially from the
peaks reached in October 2007 (Graph II.7, left-hand panel). At the same time,
bond yields (Graph II.8) and policy rates (Graph II.9) in the major economies
continued to reflect different cyclical positions as well as expectations that the
economic fallout from the crisis would primarily affect the United States.
Robust domestic growth in many emerging market economies in the first half
of 2008 initially lent some support to this view.

Stage two: events leading up to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
(mid-March to mid-September 2008)
With the economic
outlook
deteriorating …

… and interbank
markets strained …

During the second stage of the crisis, after a short respite following the
takeover of Bear Stearns on 16 March, financial asset prices came under
renewed pressure. A distinctive feature of the period up to mid-September
was an increased investor focus on emerging signs that the deepening US
recession had spilled over to other major economies, triggering a synchronised
economic downturn. The resulting outlook for earnings, defaults and
associated financial sector losses renewed stress on bank balance sheets,
raising concerns about banks’ ability to proceed with their recapitalisation plans.
Investor attention thus turned increasingly from questions about funding
liquidity to those about bank solvency, putting particular strains on those
institutions known to be highly leveraged and exposed to impaired assets.
Although the Bear Stearns rescue ushered in a period of relative stability
and rising prices for financial assets, interbank markets failed to recover.
Spreads between interbank rates for term lending and overnight index swaps
(OIS) continued to hover at levels significantly above those observed before
August 2007 (Graph II.1; Graph II.4, left-hand panel). Banks, therefore, appeared

reluctant to commit their balance sheets to lending activities involving other
banks, with the premium charged for such interbank loans pointing to some
combination of greater preference for liquidity and concerns about counterparty
risk. Concerns persisted despite unprecedented measures taken by central
banks to support money market functioning and to substitute for the funds
previously supplied by the broader financial markets, including through US
dollar swap facilities with the Federal Reserve (see Chapter VI for details on
these and subsequent policy responses to the crisis).
Pressing concerns about banks’ capital positions resurfaced in June,
following negative news about the troubled monoline insurance sector.2
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s had taken negative rating actions on MBIA
and Ambac, two major monolines, early in the month, the first in a sequence
of downgrades of similar insurers over the following weeks. Related fears
about valuation losses on the securities insured by these companies added to
news about weak investment bank earnings. As a result, valuations in both
credit and equity markets deteriorated on a broad basis from mid-June
(Graphs II.3 and II.7, left-hand panels), with financial sector assets leading the
decline in the broader market indices.
Financial sector pressures were most acute, however, for the two major
US housing finance government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. Against the backdrop of further weakness in housing markets,
house price depreciation in the United States was projected to extend well into
the future (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). As a result, and despite announcements
by their regulator that the GSEs remained adequately capitalised, credit spreads
Monoline insurers provide credit enhancement to bonds and structured finance instruments,
including guarantees on senior tranches of securities backed by mortgages or other assets as well as on
municipal bonds. In this context, the monolines’ own credit ratings will tend to determine the ratings of
the instruments they insure.

for the GSEs …

on their debt and on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) underwritten by these
institutions had risen back to levels last seen in March around the time of the
Bear Stearns takeover (Graph II.2, right-hand panel). Equity prices plummeted,
generating valuation losses of more than 70% from the levels at end-May
2008. With much of the remaining mortgage origination activity dependent
on agency guarantees, the US government stepped in on Sunday 13 July,
enabling the US Treasury to increase an existing line of credit and to purchase
GSE stock.
These backstop measures for the US GSEs provided some temporary
relief across financial markets. Credit spreads tightened and equity prices
began to recover part of their previous losses. The introduction of new US
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) emergency measures curbing
short selling of stocks in the largest banks and brokerage firms also helped
ease pressures. As a result, and reflecting generally declining risk premia,
implied volatilities across asset classes retreated from their previous highs but
stayed above the levels prevailing at the start of the first stage of the crisis, in
mid-2007 (Graph II.5).
At the same time, uncertainties about bank funding needs and
counterparty risk persisted in money markets. Thus, Libor-OIS spreads
remained elevated for key currencies, including the US dollar. Similar patterns
in foreign exchange swap markets reflected asymmetric funding pressures in
US dollars and other currencies that were pushing up the cost of dollar funds
(Graph II.4).3 This was despite steps taken by the US authorities in late July to
enhance the effectiveness of liquidity facilities introduced around the time of
the Bear Stearns takeover. These enhancements included longer-maturity
See N Baba and F Packer, “Interpreting deviations from covered interest parity during the financial
market turmoil of 2007–08”, BIS Working Papers, no 267, December 2008, for a discussion of the
spillover effects between money markets and foreign exchange swap markets.

(84-day) loans under the Term Auction Facility (TAF), with correspondingly
longer terms on US dollar funds auctioned by both the ECB and the Swiss
National Bank.
Pressures in housing markets also persisted, reigniting investor concerns
about the health of the US housing GSEs. Prices for GSE shares resumed their
previous slide and, following news of larger than expected quarterly losses at
both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in August, fell to levels not seen since the
late 1980s. Confidence in the continued solvency of the two GSEs vanished,
and the US government formally took control on Sunday 7 September. The
takeover largely eliminated credit risk for both senior and subordinated holders
of GSE debt while diluting equity holdings through the government’s new
senior preferred equity stake. This development foreshadowed the effects of
future bank rescue packages, and was thus a source of uncertainty regarding
the implications of such future measures for claims at different levels of
seniority.
While news of the takeover led to tightened spreads on GSE-sponsored
MBS and debt instruments, it failed to ease concerns about the financial sector
more broadly. Instead, it served as a reminder of additional losses to come on
top of the $500 billion or so in global writedowns that had accumulated by the
end of August 2008. It also suggested that central bank efforts aimed at
substituting for market-provided funding had probably run their course, with
investors increasingly focusing on issues of solvency. Thus, when investor
attention turned away from the US housing GSEs to refocus on bank balance
sheets, financial equity prices and credit spreads came under renewed
pressure. This, in turn, added to banks’ problems in replenishing their capital
bases and satisfying their funding needs in markets unwilling to accept

and the implications of those models for exposures to impaired assets, funding
and leverage. In that environment, the major investment banks experienced
the heaviest pressure (Graph II.10).
When a long-awaited capital injection for Lehman Brothers did not
materialise in early September, pressures on that investment bank became
particularly intense. Spreads on CDS insuring Lehman’s debt surged almost
200 basis points, to around 500, causing the firm’s clearing agent to demand
additional powers to seize collateral and short-term creditors to cut lending
lines. The company’s already battered stock fell 45% on Tuesday 9 September,
and it dropped further the following day when weak results for the third quarter
of 2008 were released. Despite the simultaneous announcement of plans to
spin off business units, confidence in the firm’s ability to secure urgently
needed funding faded quickly. This, in turn, triggered speculation that the
authorities would try to broker a Bear Stearns-style takeover the following
weekend, 13–14 September.

The crisis of confidence
Stage three: global loss of confidence (15 September to late October 2008)
The Lehman
failure …

The tipping point came on Monday 15 September, when Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection: what many had hoped
would be merely a year of manageable market turmoil then escalated into a
full-fledged global crisis. Suddenly, with markets increasingly in disarray, a
growing number of financial institutions were facing the risk of default. The
resulting crisis of confidence quickly spread across markets and countries,

BIS 79th Annual Report

making it obvious that policy action would have to shift from liquidity support
to broader-based measures, including system-wide bank recapitalisations. At
the same time, as emerging markets were hit by collapsing exports and
tightening financing conditions, the universal nature of the crisis became
increasingly evident, as did the need for a global policy response.
Going into Lehman’s bankruptcy filing, concerns had centred on the
company’s role as a broker and reference entity (ie the source of default risk
that buyers of protection seek to insure against) in the CDS market. In fact,
exposures to Lehman’s outstanding debt securities turned out to be more
fateful. Three events helped to shield CDS market participants from the
Lehman failure. First, a special trading session was organised on Sunday
14 September, just before the bankruptcy filing. The objective was to help the
main CDS dealers net out counterparty positions involving Lehman and
rebalance their books through the replacement of trades. Second, AIG, a large
insurer known to be holding more than $440 billion of notional positions in CDS
contracts – often monoline insurance-type transactions involving client banks –
received a government support package on 16 September. That package,
which would be repeatedly restructured and extended during the following
months, prevented the disorderly failure of AIG. It also kept CDS-related risks
from being brought back onto clients’ balance sheets in an already fragile
environment. Third, Lehman-referencing CDS exposures turned out to be
smaller than feared. They eventually translated into relatively modest net
settlement payments of about $5.2 billion, which would be closed out without
incident in late October. Consequently, the CDS market infrastructure held up
rather well. Even so, market opacity added to policy uncertainty during the days
immediately preceding the bankruptcy filing and exacerbated existing strains

Money market funds amplify instability in the wake of the Lehman failure
A loss of confidence in US dollar money market funds amplified the financial strains arising from the
September 2008 Lehman Brothers failure. The following discussion illustrates why the run on these
funds coincided with the deterioration in global interbank markets.

The build-up to the run on money market mutual funds
As documented more fully in Chapter III, non-US banks’ overall need for US dollar funding was an
unchecked vulnerability in the global financial system ahead of the financial crisis. European banks in
particular had increased their US dollar assets sharply over the past decade, to more than $8 trillion by
mid-2007. Moreover, these exceeded their estimated US dollar liabilities by more than $800 billion,
implying cross-currency financing and hence a heavy reliance on instruments such as foreign exchange
swaps. Banks also financed their positions by borrowing directly in other wholesale interbank funding
markets and from non-bank providers of short-term funding, such as money market funds.
When dollar funding in interbank markets dried up starting in August 2007, European banks
increasingly turned to foreign exchange swap markets to obtain dollars against European currencies,
driving the corresponding funding cost well above an already elevated US Libor rate (Graph II.4, centre
panel). Such interbank market strains made it critical for non-US banks to retain access to other sources
of dollar funding, especially the largest: US dollar money market funds. Most funds that purchase
private paper, so-called “prime” funds, invest heavily in non-US issuers. Records of the mid-2008
holdings of the 15 largest prime funds, accounting for over 40% of prime funds’ assets, show that these
placed half of their portfolios with non-US banks (and roughly 85% of that sum with European banks).
Thus, US money market fund investments in non-US banks reached an estimated $1 trillion in mid-2008
(out of total assets of over $2 trillion), more than 15% of European banks’ total estimated US dollar
liabilities to non-banks.
Until September 2008 US dollar financing continued to be forthcoming, and US money market
funds appear to have increased their outright investment in non-US banks in the period immediately
preceding the Lehman failure. Assets at US money funds grew strongly as investors withdrew from less
safe short-term investments. Non-US banks benefited as prime fund managers adopted a less risky
investment mix and shifted their portfolios away from commercial paper (CP) towards certificates of
deposit (CDs). This shift suggests that prime funds increased their role as providers of unsecured dollar
funding to non-US banks, given the much larger share of non-US banks as issuers of CDs than of CP held
by those funds. At the same time, the shift also meant that any run on dollar money market funds was
bound to result in funding difficulties for European banks.

The run on US money market funds
On 16 September, the day after Lehman’s failure, Reserve Management Co, manager of the fastestgrowing fund family over the previous several years, announced that, due to losses on Lehman notes,
shares in its flagship fund, Reserve Primary, were worth 97 cents and those in its Caribbean fund
91 cents. Reserve Primary’s “breaking the buck” was without precedent for a major fund, and only the
second instance in the history of all money market funds. It set off broad-based, though differentiated,
shareholder redemptions that resembled a bank run. Reserve Primary had $25 billion of redemption
orders on 15 September and by 19 September another $35 billion, for a total of $60 billion out of
$62 billion. Although it reported an unbroken buck, Reserve’s $10 billion US Government Fund faced
some $6 billion in redemption payments. Other prime funds also suffered redemption calls; meanwhile,
government funds received inflows.
Institutional investors fled much more quickly than individual investors. On the Wednesday and
Thursday following Tuesday’s breaking of the buck, institutional investors liquidated $142 billion in 102
prime institutional funds, 16% of their holdings (Graph II.A, left-hand panel). On those same days, they
purchased $54 billion in government funds, a similar percentage increase. Individuals sold a more
modest $27 billion from prime funds (3%) and bought a net $34 billion in government funds.
The largest redemptions occurred at prime institutional funds managed by those remaining
securities firms and small independent managers that investors doubted could support their funds.
Two-day redemptions at the largest prime institutional funds managed by the three largest securities
firms ranged from 20 to 38% of assets, well above the 16% average. By contrast, the largest such
funds managed by affiliates of seven large banks met two-day calls of between 2 and 17% of assets
(Graph II.A, right-hand panel).
The flight to safety, represented by both the shift to government funds and changing portfolio
compositions, resulted in new demand for Treasuries, agency securities and repos at the expense of
demand for CP and bank CDs. Prime funds’ holdings of repos, at 11% of portfolio, could not meet even
the first two days’ redemptions at many funds. Liquidating repos forced up average maturities and led
funds to reinvest only at the very short term.
The run on money market funds thus threatened a run first on the CP market and then on the CD
market and thereby on non-US banks, destabilising already strained global bank funding markets. The
policy responses designed to stop this run, and the degree to which they replaced private with public
funding, are discussed in Chapter VI.

in funding markets.4 Those markets now came under pressure from losses on
exposures of money market mutual funds to short- and medium-term notes
issued by Lehman.
The systemic nature of money market fund exposures became apparent
when a large US fund, Reserve Primary, wrote off more than $780 million
worth of Lehman debt (see box). As a result, Reserve Primary became the first
major money market mutual fund ever to “break the buck”, ie report less than
one dollar’s worth of net assets for each dollar invested. This event, in turn,
triggered unprecedented volumes of US money market fund redemptions – a
“bank run” in all but name – forcing fund managers to liquidate assets into
essentially illiquid markets. While pressure across funds was not uniform,
strains quickly spilled over into the markets for commercial paper (CP) and
bank certificates of deposit, where money market funds are a key investor group.

Unsecured financial paper suffered the largest outflows: total outstanding CP
volumes in the United States plummeted by more than $325 billion between
10 September and 22 October, from a total of about $1.76 trillion (Graph II.4,
right-hand panel). Foreign banks and those US institutions without their own
retail deposit base thus lost access to an important source of funds at a time
when they needed to support – or take onto their balance sheets – the money
market funds that they sponsored. In response, demand for US dollar interbank
funds surged, causing short-term credit and money markets to seize up.
The resulting turmoil quickly spread through the global financial system.
With banks hoarding liquidity, US dollar Libor-OIS spreads surged from already
elevated levels of around 80 basis points in early September to near 250 points
at the end of the month. Movements in other markets, such as those for euro
and sterling funds, showed similar signs of disruption. Strains were particularly
evident for foreign exchange swaps, where rising financial sector credit spreads
and the mounting global demand for US dollar funds raised the implied cost of
dollars to historically high levels above Libor (Graph II.4). With the viability of
key players suddenly challenged and perceptions of counterparty risk spiking,
the benchmark US investment grade CDS index spread jumped by 42 basis
points on 15 September alone, and US high-yield spreads rose 118 basis
points on the same day (Graph II.3). Credit spreads in other major markets
moved by similar amounts, in tandem with their US counterparts. Equity prices
fell by some 4% in the United States and Europe on the day of the Lehman
bankruptcy and declined further until 17 September (Graph II.7).
In an environment of acute systemic pressure, policymakers increased
the pace and scope of their initiatives. On 18 September, UK bank HBOS
was forced into a government-brokered merger with one of its competitors.
Concomitantly, the UK authorities sought to ease pressure on financial stocks
through a suspension of short selling – the US authorities followed suit the
very next day. Simultaneously, major central banks reacted with a new round

BIS 79th Annual Report

27

of coordinated measures to address the squeeze in US dollar short-term
funding. These actions were followed on 19 September by the US Treasury’s
announcement of a temporary guarantee for money market fund investors, a
measure aimed at arresting the escalating run on the US money market mutual
fund sector. Redemptions slowed in response, with total assets eventually
returning to their pre-15 September levels.
Markets recovered from the initial reaction to the Lehman bankruptcy, but
pressure on banks and other financial sector firms did not abate. Helped by
early details of a proposed $700 billion US plan to take troubled assets off
the books of financial institutions, credit spreads retreated temporarily from
the highs reached earlier in the week. Equity markets also recovered, aided
in part by the new ban on short sales. The S&P 500 rebounded 4% on
19 September, with several high-profile banking stocks rising even more
sharply, and European stock markets gained more than 8% on the same day.
Even so, on Sunday 21 September, in a move aimed at halting ongoing
transfers of counterparty positions and client funds to third parties, investment
banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained permission from the US
authorities to convert themselves into bank holding companies, and US thrift
institution Washington Mutual was taken over by the authorities during the
following week.
The ultimate proof of the depth and breadth of the crisis came on Monday
29 September. That day, authorities in a number of European countries were
forced to counter threats to the stability of individual institutions within
their national banking systems. Following negotiations over the weekend, the
United Kingdom moved to nationalise mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley,
while banking and insurance company Fortis received a capital injection from
a group of three European governments. On the same day, Hypo Real Estate,

a German commercial property lender, secured a government-facilitated credit
line, which was later backed up by additional support measures.
These measures notwithstanding, confidence in the stability of the banking
system had been lost: financial markets were now clearly focusing on the need
for comprehensive policy action. Later on 29 September, when the US House
of Representatives voted to reject the first version of the Treasury’s proposed
rescue plan for the US financial industry (it would be passed into law in revised
form at the end of that week), the market response was swift: the S&P 500 fell
8.8%, with the decline again led by financial shares, and other indices saw
comparable percentage declines that would accumulate to losses of about 30%
by late October. Credit markets came under extreme pressure as well, with the
major CDS index spreads surging back to, and surpassing, the highs reached in
the days immediately after the Lehman failure. Longer-term government bond
yields fell (Graph II.8) and volatilities spiked across asset classes (Graph II.5)
as the deepening crisis resulted in a broad-based flight to quality.
Emerging market countries were being increasingly drawn into the
unfolding turmoil, even though their direct exposures to impaired assets were
known to be limited. Having outperformed their industrial country counterparts
between the beginning of the crisis (August 2007) and May 2008, emerging
market stocks, as measured by the MSCI index, dropped by about 28% in local
currency terms between mid-May and the day before the Lehman failure
(compared with a loss of about 12% for the S&P 500). Up to that point, losses
had been driven largely by the implications of the crisis for export demand,
both directly and through the impact of weakening demand on commodity
prices (see Chapter V). Following the Lehman event, emerging market assets
weakened further on a broad basis as fears about the stability of banking
systems in the major economies triggered a combination of concerns about
collapsing global growth, lower commodity prices and the availability of external
sources of funding. In response, sovereign spreads widened dramatically and
equities, which plummeted in tandem with those in the industrial economies,
weakened significantly more than during past periods of market turbulence
(Graph II.11).
While pressures were particularly intense for countries that investors
regarded as among the most vulnerable, signs of more indiscriminate asset
disposals emerged in the course of October. Concerns about access to foreign
funding became apparent early in the month, when the near simultaneous
demise of three Icelandic banks caused international investors to reassess
their exposures to countries with large current account deficits and associated
financing needs, including those in central and eastern Europe (see Chapter V).
In recent years, a sizeable fraction of the capital inflows into markets with
foreign-dominated banking systems – and the resulting access to large pools
of foreign currency deposits – had been in the form of foreign currency loans
to businesses and households. Now lenders became more hesitant to roll over
existing loans or to extend new ones. In addition, as key parts of the global
financial system turned dysfunctional, plummeting valuations in industrial
country markets increasingly translated into heavy banking and portfolio flows
out of emerging market assets. Pressure on asset prices mounted and market

volatility surged. This broadened the sell-off, despite efforts by emerging
market central banks to enhance their domestic and foreign currency lending
operations and, in several countries, the announcement of full or partial
guarantees of bank deposits. As a result, the MSCI emerging market index
would lose about 40% from its level just before the Lehman failure, reaching
values last seen in October 2004.
By mid-October 2008, with the flurry of unprecedented policy initiatives
taken across countries increasingly adding up to a joint approach, markets
were finally showing signs that the crisis of confidence had been arrested. On
8 October, the authorities in the United Kingdom announced comprehensive
measures to recapitalise UK banks. The move was followed by the first ever
round of coordinated cuts in policy rates by six major central banks, including
the ECB, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Efforts to implement
additional, broad-based policy measures continued in the following weeks: on
13 October, for example, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks
increased existing swap lines to accommodate unlimited quantities of US dollar
funds. On the same day, the euro area member countries jointly announced
guarantees and equity injections aimed at stabilising the banking sector.
These were followed, on 14 October, by news that the US Treasury would use
$250 billion of the previously authorised $700 billion rescue package to
recapitalise major banks. Given that large amounts of financial institutions’
senior liabilities had thus effectively become quasi-government debt, investors
reacted by pushing financial sector spreads down from the peaks reached
earlier in the period under review (Graph II.10, left-hand panel).
Signs of easing pressures were also evident in other markets. After
peaking at 364 basis points on 10 October, the three-month US dollar LiborOIS spread steadily fell, ultimately dipping below 100 basis points in January
2009 (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). Euro and sterling Libor-OIS spreads

behaved in a similar fashion, suggesting that interbank markets had begun to
stabilise. In the meantime, key equity indices showed temporary signs of relief,
rebounding from lows reached in late October. Conditions in emerging markets
also stabilised, following successful efforts by a number of countries to obtain
assistance from the IMF and other international bodies as well as news, on
29 October, that the Federal Reserve had established US dollar swap lines
with key emerging market monetary authorities. However, asset prices
remained under pressure from country-specific vulnerabilities, contributing
to the underperformance of credit and equity indices for emerging Europe
(Graph II.11, left-hand and centre panels).

The next crisis stage, starting in late October, was one of uncertainty with
regard to both financial sector stability and the likelihood of a deepening global
recession. Although the global crisis of confidence had come to an end, policy
action continued on an international scale as governments sought to support
market functioning and to cushion the blow of rapid economic contraction.
Even so, with many details unspecified, questions about the design, impact
and consistency of these measures remained. As a result, financial markets
were roiled by increasingly dire macroeconomic data releases and earnings
reports, punctuated by short-lived periods of optimism – often in response to
the announcement of further government interventions.

Recession fears were clearly evident from government bond yields, which
continued on a downward trajectory in November and December. Reductions
in policy rates and a flight to safety pushed US and euro area two-year
yields dramatically lower, below 1% and 2%, respectively, by mid-December
(Graph II.8, centre panel). US 10-year yields, in turn, fell to a record low near
2.05% on 30 December (the previous record was around 2.10%, established in
1941). In line with these yield movements, expectations about the path of nearterm policy rates were revised downwards. Meanwhile, federal funds futures
prices signalled expectations of low and broadly steady policy rates in the
United States for much of 2009, consistent with depressed to negative growth
over the coming quarters. In the euro area, interest rate swap prices pointed to
expectations of a further lowering of policy rates by the ECB over the next 12
months, reflecting in part the relatively slow pace of ECB rate adjustments seen
since the start of the crisis. In Japan, where the policy rate had been cut in late
October, forward rates suggested expectations of unchanged policy rates for
most of 2009. In turn, break-even inflation rates (ie the difference between
nominal and inflation-indexed yields) were in line with expectations of rapid
disinflation, especially at shorter horizons. At the same time, movements in
long-term break-even rates seemed to be due largely to technical factors, such
as safe haven demand for the liquidity of nominal Treasuries and rising liquidity
premia in index-linked bonds. By introducing a pessimistic bias, these technical
factors thus limited the usefulness of long-term break-even rates as an indicator
of inflation expectations (Graph II.8, right-hand panel).5
Both credit and equity markets recovered somewhat into the new year, as
previous policy actions showed signs of traction. One such example of
tentative, policy-induced normalisation in a disrupted market was the US
securitisation sector, where spreads for agency MBS and bonds as well as
securities backed by consumer loans eased in response to a number of
support measures announced after the Federal Reserve’s first such initiative,
on 25 November (Graph II.2, right-hand panel).
However, when the scale of the global economic downturn became fully
apparent in January 2009, prices for financial assets were dragged lower once
again. Against the background of weak fourth quarter data that suggested that
economic activity was in the midst of the worst slump in decades (see Chapter
IV for details), markets resumed their earlier slide. Major equity indices declined
in the wake of deteriorating earnings; they would continue to do so into March,
eventually falling back below the troughs reached in November (Graph II.7,
left-hand and centre panels): on 9 March, the S&P 500 dropped to around
676 points, a level last seen in October 1996. Credit markets also weakened
once again, as the ongoing slowdown in economic activity suggested further
credit quality deterioration. An especially large widening in Japanese spreads
(Graph II.3, left-hand panel) was accelerated by sectoral and credit qualityrelated index composition effects as well as by low market liquidity.
Emerging markets experienced similar pressures. GDP data for the fourth
quarter confirmed the deepening impact of the financial crisis on economies

that had hitherto depended on exports to support growth, particularly in Asia.
Korean fourth quarter GDP fell more than 3% year on year, and China reported
a slowdown in growth of more than 4 percentage points over the same period,
driven in part by falling export demand (see Chapter V for details). In a reflection
of financial sector problems, the collapse in trade flows was probably exacerbated
by counterparty risk concerns among banks involved in trade finance and by a
related disruption of net flows of trade credit between exporting and importing
countries. Plunging exports, in turn, were reflected in declining asset prices.
However, compared with the immediate crisis of confidence in September and
early October 2008, patterns across countries and regions were more differentiated
(Graph II.11, left-hand and centre panels). The differentiation helped to cushion
the impact on overall emerging market equity indices, which generally fared
better during the fourth stage of the crisis than their industrial country
counterparts. For example, although weakening from early January onwards,
the MSCI emerging market index did not return to the lows established in late
October, as countries from other regions compensated for the underperformance
of economies across emerging Europe (Graph II.11, centre panel).
Continued problems in the financial sector also drove part of the renewed
weakness in the equity and credit markets of industrial countries. Signs that
the sector’s stability had not been restored on a sustained basis had emerged
early in 2009, despite the injection of a combined $925 billion of private and
government capital since the third quarter of 2007 (Graph II.10, centre panel).
Losses at a large German bank had to be backstopped by a government bailout
on 8 January, and similar measures followed across a number of European
countries and in the United States. Financial sector credit spreads and equities
thus led the deterioration in overall indices seen into March (Graph II.7).

BIS 79th Annual Report

At the same time, existing guarantees and expectations of further support
measures generally limited movements in financial sector credit spreads.
However, while state guarantees contributed to a surge in financial sector debt
issuance (Graph II.6, right-hand panel), spreads no longer tightened in
expectation of government support. In contrast with developments in late
2008, investors thus appeared to be increasingly uncertain about the
necessary scope of such measures and about any impact on their debt
holdings. Related uncertainties also contributed at times to significant pricing
differences across the capital structure, reflecting changing expectations about
relative recovery rates in the face of government intervention (Graph II.10,
left-hand panel). Heavy discounts on subordinated debt, in turn, induced
numerous banks to retire these securities and to bolster core capital through
retained earnings. Meanwhile, equity prices for the former standalone
investment banks outperformed those for the broader banking sector; that
difference was in line with improved capital positions and signs that the cyclical
deterioration had contributed to a shift in the focus of concerns about bank
exposures from the trading book to the banking book (Graph II.10, right-hand
panel; see also Chapter III).
Uncertainty was also driven by indications that large-scale financial sector
rescue and economic support packages were starting to strain government
finances. Industrial country sovereign CDS spreads had drifted upwards from
low levels ever since the initiation of the first backstop measures in the summer
of 2008, and they rose further into March (Graph II.11, left-hand panel).
Increases came in the wake of rising fiscal commitments, with correlation
patterns among different sovereigns suggesting the presence of a strong
common driver. Correlation between spreads for sovereign CDS and those for
senior financial sector credit, in particular, increased relative to the period
before the Lehman failure. This pattern was in line with investor beliefs that
major governments had underwritten the risks of substantial parts of the
banking system, but it did not necessarily reflect the specifics of these
commitments at the individual country level. Similar developments were
evident in government bond markets, where expectations regarding large
future issuance volumes had started to offset the downward pressures
exerted on yields by safe haven flows and the economic outlook (Graph II.8).

Stage five: first signs of stabilisation (from mid-March 2009)
Events took another turn in mid-March. Volatilities declined and asset prices
recovered from their previous lows, as further and more determined policy
action induced markets to show some optimism in the face of what remained
a largely negative macroeconomic and financial outlook. At the same time,
and despite further improving conditions in a variety of markets, signs of
dysfunction and related distortions remained, suggesting that the combined
efforts of governments and central banks had not yet fully restored confidence
in the global financial system. Thus, the process of normalisation seemed likely
to be protracted and subject to considerable risks.
A key factor behind improving asset valuations was the confidence effect
from announcements by major central banks of expansions of both the range

and the amount of assets that they would be prepared to purchase outright.
Early in March, the Bank of England announced plans to purchase private
sector assets and government bonds. On 18 March, the Federal Reserve
followed with news that it would acquire up to $300 billion worth of longer-term
Treasury securities. In anticipation of the extra demand, investors drove
10-year Treasury yields to their biggest one-day decline in more than 20 years –
47 basis points. Shorter-term Treasury yields also fell, as did yields on Japanese
government bonds, the latter driven by the authorities’ announcement on the
same day that they would increase by 29% the annual amount devoted to
outright purchases of such securities. Despite the leeway provided by policy
rates that remained higher than those in other major economies (Graph II.9),
speculation about the possibility of similar measures being taken by the ECB
also affected euro area bond yields. Although these yield declines were quickly
reversed, announced purchases at least temporarily countered pressures from
growing supplies of government bonds (Graph II.8). Similar “signalling
effects” (see Chapter VI) were evident in the markets for US consumer
debt-backed securitisations, where support from government programmes
had contributed to a tightening of spreads (Graph II.2, right-hand panel), and
would later be observed also in Europe, following an announcement in early
May that the ECB was to start purchasing euro-denominated covered bonds
(Table II.1).
Broader asset markets also recovered, albeit from depressed levels. The
announced bond purchases added to the optimism that had taken root earlier
in the month following the release, on 10 and 11 March, of favourable
performance data from large US banks. In response, both equity and credit
markets bounced back from their lows, again driven by the financial sector.
Both markets expanded these gains in the following weeks, supported by
announcements of additional policy action, investor beliefs that the initiatives
launched at the G20 summit in London would help boost the global economy,
and robust first quarter earnings at major banks and corporates. With tentative
improvements in key macroeconomic indicators providing further impetus,
the S&P 500 rose by 29% between 9 March and end-April, with other major
indices climbing by similar amounts. Emerging market assets also rose during
this period; the gains reflected positive developments in key markets, such as
China, and recovering equity prices in emerging Europe, where broad regional
indices outperformed those in industrial countries (Graph II.11, centre panel).
Yet despite these positive developments, continuing financial sector risks
were underlined by persistent signs of market dysfunction. Although repeated
central bank injections of liquidity and the provision of government guarantees
had helped to calm interbank lending and to lower Libor-OIS spreads, observed
levels remained substantially higher than before the start of the crisis in 2007,
partly because of considerable lingering uncertainties about the scope and
effectiveness of government support (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). Forward
rates, in turn, pointed to investor expectations of only limited further
improvement in Libor-OIS spreads up to end-2009. Similar concerns prevailed
in credit markets. The pricing differential between CDS contracts and
corresponding cash market bonds, the so-called CDS-cash basis, had moved

BIS 79th Annual Report

35

to unusually negative levels in the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy. The
arbitrage activities that would usually tend to compress the basis require
investors to commit both funding and capital; wide price differentials therefore
pointed to persistent balance sheet constraints along with large relative liquidity
premia across markets (Graph II.3, right-hand panel).6
In mid-May, despite further valuation gains across various asset classes
in the wake of bank stress tests conducted by the US authorities, market
conditions continued to be fragile. Unprecedented policy action had managed
to halt the financial crisis, but normalisation was bound to be a protracted
process. With a sustained recovery unlikely to take hold without a lasting
stabilisation of the financial sector, questions remained about how effective
past and future policy measures would be in maintaining the improved tone in
markets (see also Chapter VI). Substantial reductions in policy rates and yields
reflected aggressive policy action as well as a deteriorating macroeconomic
environment (Graphs II.8 and II.9). Major equity markets had fallen to levels
some 45% below their October 2007 highs, and valuations, as measured by
forecast-based price/earnings ratios, were back to values last seen in the early
1990s (Graph II.7, left- and right-hand panels). Credit spreads, while having
come down substantially from their peaks, were still wide by historical
standards, reflecting expectations of sharp increases in default rates and
associated losses on bond and loan portfolios (Graph II.6, left-hand and centre
panels; see also Chapter III). While the cyclical deterioration in credit quality was
thus bound to continue, forward CDS spreads suggested that risk premia were
expected to revert to more normal levels over the medium term (Graph II.3,
centre panel).

Factors commonly driving the CDS-cash basis include funding constraints, counterparty credit risk
and relative liquidity conditions. See J De Wit, “Exploring the CDS-bond basis”, National Bank of Belgium
Working Papers, no 104, November 2006.

III. The financial sector under stress

Financial sector firms were subjected to extreme stress during the period
under review. The turmoil that originated in the subprime mortgage market in
early 2007 gradually developed into a full-fledged crisis that reached historic
proportions in mid-September 2008. Financial institutions entered a protracted
period of illiquidity in asset and funding markets, and suffered outsize losses.
A number of firms failed. Chief among them was Lehman Brothers, whose
bankruptcy played a catalytic role in the dynamics of the crisis (see Chapter II).
Other institutions came to the brink of bankruptcy before being taken over by
larger firms or the public sector. The size and nature of policy interventions
were unprecedented.
Over the medium term, the health of financial firms will depend on the
interplay between their response to losses and the dynamics of the
macroeconomy. The feedbacks between the two become particularly strong
when the capital cushions of financial firms are depleted. In the first stage
of the crisis, capital raised from private investors met the cost of writedowns
on securities portfolios. In subsequent stages, private capital had to be
supplemented on a large scale by public sector resources to address
mounting losses on institutions’ loan books driven by rapidly deteriorating
macroeconomic conditions. The pace and shape of recovery will be critically
linked to the ability of financial firms to manage their leverage and capital
positions in a challenging environment without unduly restricting the flow of
credit to the economy.
From a longer-term perspective, the crisis carries important messages for
the structure and stability of the financial system. The events of the past two
years highlighted how strong the interdependencies between financial system
components can become. Market participants and also, arguably, prudential
authorities underestimated the complementarities in the roles of different actors
along the securitisation chain, the close interlinkages among financial markets
and institutions, and the interplay between asset market and funding liquidity.
Decisions taken by private sector participants and policymakers in dealing
with the crisis will help shape the future structure of the financial sector.
Their actions will, for instance, influence not only the speed with which
intermediation activity adjusts to the availability of capital at the current juncture,
but also the type of institutions that will emerge from the crisis. Private and
public sector decisions will also determine whether the secular trend towards
greater international openness will continue or stall.

March 2008. Revenues fell and funding costs surged. The crisis affected a wide
array of institutions across a number of countries. The stress on the financial
system was compounded by the feedback effects of a rapid decline in global
economic activity, which put further pressure on balance sheets and revenues.
Market participants’ growing concern about financial sector solvency was
reflected in the soaring costs of insurance against the default of individual
large firms and the system more broadly. Premia on credit default swaps
(CDS) referencing those firms widened across segments and geographical
jurisdictions. The market price of insurance against systemic-scale losses in the
financial sector increased in waves. It reached new heights during the third
and most acute stage of the crisis, starting in mid-September 2008, doubling
from the previous peak of six months earlier (Graph III.1, left-hand panel). The
systemic nature of the episode is reflected in the increased importance of a
common driver of default risk across the different segments of the global
financial sector. This has been particularly noticeable for insurance companies
and European banks (Graph III.1, right-hand panel).

A systemic crisis

Bank profitability
The profitability of banks plunged last year owing to the realisation of losses
on marked to market (securities) portfolios and the progressive deterioration
of loan books as the economic slump deepened. Although the decline in bank
profits was a global phenomenon, the way banks have been affected by the
crisis has differed somewhat according to the circumstances in their respective
home markets.

BIS 79th Annual Report

Banks’ earnings

… in the United

… and Europe

Banks in the United States saw their pre-tax profits in 2008 more than
halved compared with the previous year (Table III.1). The full-year results,
however, conceal the sharp deterioration in the second half. For example, one
in three US banks lost money in the fourth quarter, and the sector as a whole
recorded its first quarterly loss since 1990. Net interest margins also came
under pressure, especially for smaller banks that found it hard to reduce their
deposit rates. There was a surge in US bank failures in 2008. A total of 25
deposit-taking institutions failed, with combined assets of $372 billion, about
10 times higher than during the previous peak in bank failures in 1993. The
failure of Washington Mutual accounted for $307 billion of the total and was
the largest US bank failure in history (Table II.1). The bank was eventually
absorbed by JPMorgan Chase, another large bank, with the assistance of the
supervisory authorities. Besides the failed banks, the number of institutions
on the US deposit insurer’s list of problem banks swelled to 252 with total
assets of around $159 billion. Further large failures were averted as weakened
institutions were acquired by others with healthier balance sheets.
In Europe, the general picture of bank performance in 2008 was broadly
similar to that in North America. Profits plummeted across the board, and as
a group the largest banks in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom registered a net loss. The size of the earlier residential property
boom in Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom posed an especially large
challenge to banks in those countries once real estate markets slowed. Certain
German banks were also affected by real estate exposures, albeit mainly
indirectly through securities positions and exposures to commercial property.
French and Italian banks were less affected by losses on structured finance
investments, given their stronger focus on the domestic retail market.

Continental European banks, in contrast to their UK peers, partially cushioned
losses through an increase in their net interest margins.
A number of European lenders averted outright bankruptcy thanks to
direct support from the public sector (see Chapter VI for a discussion on
financial sector rescue packages). Of particular interest was the case of the
banking and insurance company Fortis. Its substantial cross-country operations
were split as a result of the intervention by the prudential authorities and the
support that it required from the public purse. In Germany, the crisis gave
some impetus to the restructuring of the domestic banking sector. It acted as
a catalyst for a number of mergers between lenders, including some of the
country’s Landesbanken, while the government encouraged further mergers
as a condition for the financial support it provided to the industry.
Having put the loan problems of the previous decade behind them,
Japanese banks were thought to be in a position to gain from the weaknesses
of their international competitors. They started 2008 showing relative resilience
to the troubles of their peers in other advanced economies because of
smaller exposures to subprime and structured products. Some of the larger
lenders made tentative investments in the recapitalisation of foreign banks.
Nevertheless, the profitability of Japanese banks remained poor, partly
because of their structurally narrow net interest margins. Consequently, their
capital base remained weak. And any plans for international expansion were
put on hold in the second half of the year when the domestic economy fell
into recession and losses intensified.

Bank failures

Composition of bank losses
As the macroeconomic situation worsened over the course of the past year,
institutions faced increasing pressure on earnings and mounting losses on
their credit risk exposures. The shifting composition of bank losses reflected
the evolution in the character of the problems confronting the industry.
During the first stage of the crisis, writedowns were closely linked to
traded portfolios of structured finance products and securitised exposures to
the subprime mortgage market. Losses were exacerbated by illiquidity in the
markets for those instruments, which led to substantial reductions in their
marked to market valuations (see Chapter II and Table III.2). While there was
considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the losses and their
distribution across the system, they were perceived as being contained within
a certain class of assets.
The general economic slowdown that ensued in the later stages of the
crisis, in particular after the global crisis of confidence in September and
October 2008, meant that bank losses became more closely connected to
macroeconomic performance. In this period, the majority of writedowns were
more directly linked to a surge in borrower defaults (Graph II.6, left-hand panel;
Graph IV.5, right-hand panel) and to anticipated defaults as evidenced by the
increase in the amount and relative importance of provisioning expenses.
Loan loss provisions as a fraction of bank assets were universally higher
in 2008 than in previous years (Table III.1). Compared with 2007, the rate at
least doubled for Australian, French, Swiss and US banks and jumped even

higher in the case of German, Dutch and Swedish lenders. Credit costs are
likely to continue on an upward trajectory as weakening economic activity will
probably impair the private sector’s ability to service debt. Rating agencies
expect corporate default rates to increase further. In addition, the performance
of banks’ household credit portfolios will depend on the length and depth
of the contraction in incomes. Initial signs of problems in US banks’ credit
card portfolios indicate a stronger pass-through from unemployment to
delinquencies than that suggested by historical experience. The close
interdependency between financial sector performance, the supply of credit
and the debt servicing capacity of borrowers implies greater uncertainty in the
overall outlook for banks.

Investment banking
The hostile market
environment …

The crisis has left deep scars on the investment banking industry, which was
arguably the hardest hit segment of the financial sector. The magnitude of
firms’ losses combined with a difficult trading and funding environment was
especially punishing. Their portfolios were highly exposed to the most affected
asset classes. Large holdings of structured securities, including those with the
highest risk, and unhedged exposures in the securitisation pipeline were
marked down dramatically. The illiquidity of asset and funding markets proved
particularly challenging for the investment banking business model. Firms
could no longer rely on an increasing volume of transactions to generate
revenue growth or on cheap and readily available short-term financing to
support high levels of leverage.
Industry observers estimated that net revenue for the largest investment
banking operations fell by more than 90% in the third quarter of 2008 compared
with the same period a year earlier, as market activity seized up. All lines of
business were affected. Securities underwriting declined for the year as primary
market issuance slowed and associated revenues fell (Graph III.2). Merger and
acquisition advisory business held up better by comparison, although it also
slowed in the first quarter of 2009.

The demise of the standalone investment bank has been a salient feature
of the crisis, the second stage of which spanned the period between the March
2008 near collapse of Bear Stearns and the September bankruptcy filing by
Lehman Brothers, two of the largest independent firms (see Chapter II). During
those six months, all of the other major Wall Street firms either were absorbed
under stress by larger banking organisations or took on a banking charter in
order to improve their access to the prudential safety net. More generally,
investment banking operations were reduced across the board independently
of their institutional affiliation. Employment declined radically. Staffing levels
at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were cut by more than half as their
operations were taken over by other institutions. The staffing cuts at other
firms broadly mirrored the size of their realised losses.
The restructuring of the sector, however, goes beyond headcount. Lossmaking firms have been rebuilding their balance sheets while restructuring and
reorienting their operations in response to lower fee income and in an effort to
reduce leverage and risk. Some have diversified their funding model away from
wholesale capital markets towards operationally more expensive but arguably
more stable sources, such as deposits. As a result, the volume of securities
financing transactions, including through repurchase agreements, has fallen
(Graph III.2, right-hand panel).
As larger firms have shrunk in size, albeit not in complexity, smaller
specialised operations have emerged. Some were set up by senior staff fleeing
the industry leaders either because of restructuring or, given the backlash
over executive pay in the financial sector, in anticipation of a reduction in
compensation. These smaller, so-called boutique, firms are breaking with past
industry strategy that regarded consolidation as the main path to profitability.
If successful, they could provide a competitive alternative to larger and more
integrated firms, including universal banks that absorbed large, distressed
investment banks.

Bank capital and deleveraging

Banks’ capitalisation
took a hit …

The crisis seriously impaired banks’ balance sheets. The losses weakened their
capital base and obliged them to raise new capital or preserve existing capital
by scaling down their activities.
Banks have struggled throughout the crisis to maintain capitalisation at a
level regarded as adequate by markets and supervisors. During the first crisis
stage, banks shored up capital by raising funds from various private sector
sources. Some issued new rights in public markets, while others struck direct
agreements with private investors or foreign sovereign wealth funds. As losses
kept mounting through the second and third crisis stages, those sources
became increasingly expensive or unavailable. The cost of equity capital, for
example, surged as the market value of banks’ shares plummeted (Graph III.3).
Higher funding costs reflect the uncertainty about the resilience of bank
balance sheets and the expectation that the economic slowdown will have an
additional negative impact on earnings. Public sector funds, via capital
injections and guarantees of bank liabilities, replaced private sector sources in
the later stages of the crisis (see Chapter VI).
Banks have generally been expected to raise capitalisation levels, even
though their capital ratios at the end of 2008 compared favourably with those

BIS 79th Annual Report

43

seen in the years of rapid balance sheet expansion prior to 2007 (Table III.3).
Markets and supervisors have been scrutinising the level as well as the loss
absorption quality of banks’ capital cushions. Market participants, investors
and counterparties have derived only limited comfort from capital reserves
that are barely in line with regulatory minimum requirements. Markets have
discounted the importance of hybrid capital instruments because they can be
partially shielded from losses. Nor have public funds been regarded as proper
substitutes for private capital for a number of reasons. First, from the
perspective of competitive equality, public support of banks unlevels the
playing field while blunting market discipline. Second, from the viewpoint of
investors, public injections of funds may not offer the highest form of
protection if, as is often the case, they take the form of preferred shares, which
are senior to common equity and have enhanced rights and thus do not have
the same loss-absorbing capacity. Finally, from the perspective of banks’
management, public support comes with implicit or explicit restrictions on
their decision-making.
A number of banks responded opportunistically in managing their capital
position. Some broke with historical practice and surprised investors by not
calling subordinated debt issues prior to the contractual step-up in interest
payments, preferring to incur a higher cost than to access the market with a new
issue. Others took advantage of depressed secondary market prices by buying
back previously issued debentures: the difference between the market price
and the book value of these liabilities boosted core capital buffers. In response
to capital deficiencies identified by supervisory-led stress tests of balance
sheets at major US banks, a number of institutions announced recapitalisation
plans for the second half of 2009.

Table III.3

BIS 79th Annual Report

The difficulties banks have faced in maintaining capital buffers that satisfy
investors, counterparties and supervisors illustrate that the interaction between
the availability of capital and uncertainty about incipient risk can be intensely
procyclical. Uncertainty about the path of future revenues and concern about
continuing losses drove the quest for higher levels of protection at the same
time that banks had to deal with a surge in writedowns. The same uncertainty
also limits the supply of capital to banks in periods of systemic stress, precisely
when it is most needed. Such experiences offer strong arguments in favour of
providing incentives to institutions to build buffers in good times that can be
used during more stressful periods (see Chapter VII).

Deleveraging
The elevated cost of funding has forced banks to trim the assets side of their
balance sheets. The effective degree of leverage at banks has been coming
down from the heights reached prior to 2007, even though the effect on total
credit extended may not be as easily discernible in aggregate statistics.
Credit flows have been a lagging indicator of the impact of the crisis on
financial intermediation. Aggregate statistics show a sharp slowdown in the

growth of credit to the private sector starting late in the first stage of the crisis
(Graph III.4, top panels). These figures, however, conceal more pronounced
shifts in lenders’ attitudes, and have been influenced by the effective closure
of many securitisation markets. Banks tightened their lending standards
throughout the first three crisis stages across all types of loans, although
arguably more sharply in the case of household credit, including mortgages
(Graph III.4, bottom panels). The tightening of standards affected new credit.
During the early stages of the crisis, reported credit growth remained robust,
but to a large degree this reflected special circumstances. The first of these was
market and supervisory pressure on banks to consolidate previously off-balance
sheet exposures to securitisation vehicles. This tended to swell balance sheets
without, of course, reflecting any fresh extension of credit. Second, borrowers
pre-emptively raised funds in anticipation of credit tightening by drawing down
credit lines that had been granted before the crisis, often at very favourable
terms. In the later stages of the crisis, as problems were transmitted from
the financial sector to the real economy, the decline in the growth of credit
aggregates arguably also reflected a slowdown in demand. Firms and
households refocused towards capital preservation as well as towards
managing excess capacity and high levels of debt. The continuing increase in
lenders’ credit costs associated with the higher incidence of defaults suggests
that the process of adjustment is far from completed. Conceivably, credit growth
may continue to contract through the early stages of the eventual recovery.
The impact of deleveraging can be clearly seen in declining debt issuance
linked to leveraged buyouts (LBOs). In the years leading up to the crisis, the
rapid increase in the activity of private equity funds was accompanied by a
boom in the issuance of debt, which peaked in early 2007. In fact, the
combination of debt overhang, tighter credit conditions and a downward
revision in corporate earnings forecasts has brought the LBO market to a
virtual halt (Graph III.5). Some private equity funds, unable to find profitable

opportunities, have returned capital to their investors. Others have been trying
to manage their debt levels by seeking concessions from creditors.
Experience with the aftermath of previous financial crises can provide a
benchmark for the potential effect of the current crisis on credit (Graph III.6).
Across a number of countries, the current decline in the ratio of credit to GDP
from its recent peak is about four fifths of its average post-crisis decline.
Property markets, which are an important factor in the dynamics of this credit
cycle, also do not appear to have fallen in line with past experience. In contrast,
declines in equity markets in a number of economies appear to have overshot
the average for past episodes. An important caveat, however, is the international
character of the current crisis relative to others in the recent past. Problems in
the financial sector have been particularly deep-seated and synchronised
across the industrial world. Similarly, the slowdown in economic activity has
been global in nature. This suggests that the current crisis may prove to be
longer and the process of economic recovery slower than in earlier, less
international episodes.

Insurance companies and pension funds

Investment losses
for insurance
companies …

Insurance companies and pension funds have been affected by the crisis in
several ways. Asset price declines and lower long-term interest rates delivered
large hits to both sides of their balance sheets. For individual insurers, the
foray into insuring against credit risk was a source of considerable stress.
For the majority of insurance companies, the main effect of the crisis has
been on their financial performance rather than on premium income. The crisis
does not appear to have had a major immediate impact on sales of insurance
products. Life insurance premiums grew, albeit at a more moderate pace than
in previous years, even as non-life premiums stagnated. This trend may not
continue if liquidity-constrained clients decide to raise cash by cancelling their

BIS 79th Annual Report

47

insurance policies. The impact of the asset market slump was reflected primarily
in the performance of financial asset portfolios. Companies suffered losses as
prices fell across a broad array of asset classes. Individual companies also
registered significant losses on holdings of instruments related to subprime
mortgages. For life insurance companies, the decline in the level of long-term
yields also meant an increase in liabilities on long-maturity policies. The
announcement of losses in the insurance industry has lagged that in banking
in part because differences in accounting practices mean that the former is
slower to recognise investment portfolio results.
The firms affected most by the crisis were those involved in the provision
of credit risk insurance. Monoline insurance companies, which specialise in the
provision of credit guarantees, remained under strain and the intervention of
prudential authorities was necessary to avert bankruptcies on a large scale. As
the creditworthiness of borrowers declined, concerns about the ability of monoline
insurers to honour their guarantees mounted and led to significant marked to
market losses for banks that had purchased insurance (Table III.2). The near
collapse of AIG, an insurance conglomerate, was directly linked to the underwriting
of credit risk. Its writedowns surged along with soaring CDS spreads. The size
of its liabilities and the central role its credit derivatives operation played
as counterparty in the over-the-counter market repeatedly necessitated
extraordinary official intervention to provide substantial financial support.
The value of pension fund assets is estimated to have fallen by about 20%
over the course of 2008. As the value of liabilities swelled, the coverage ratios
of the funds declined sharply, and with them the funds’ risk appetite. As a
result, many funds increased their portfolio allocation to government bonds.
Looking ahead, the retreat from riskier investments could contribute to
pressure on equity markets, delaying their recovery. Similarly, the decline in
the pension wealth of households participating in defined contribution plans
and of employers sponsoring defined benefit plans has implications for
aggregate spending (see Chapter IV).

… and pension
funds

Hedge funds
Hedge funds have not played a central role in shaping the dynamics of the
crisis, but they have been greatly affected by events. Their asset performance
has been hit hard, and their funding conditions have worsened dramatically.
As a result, a number of funds have found themselves in serious difficulty.
The past year was one of the worst on record for hedge fund
performance. Financial results were negative across practically all investment
strategies, as well as for funds of funds (Graph III.7), as returns in asset
markets plummeted and the cost of funding soared. In addition, the general
shortage of liquidity in the markets coupled with investors’ withdrawal
from risk-taking had a large impact on hedge funds. As counterparties pressed
for increased transaction margins and investors withdrew funds on an
unprecedented scale, the industry contracted sharply. Estimates of assets
under management shrank by more than one third in the course of the second
half of 2008, with bad performance and customer withdrawals playing an

equal role in the decline. A number of funds closed. Many fund managers
attempted to preserve capital by restricting withdrawals, thereby lengthening
investors’ effective lock-in period.
The crisis is likely to accelerate the trend in the industry, already in
evidence for some time, towards greater institutionalisation and transparency.
To avoid the fate of smaller funds that were liquidated as a result of investor
withdrawals, many larger funds have oriented their marketing more towards
institutional investors. Such a shift engenders demands for greater
transparency about the investment strategy and greater scrutiny of risk
management processes. The headline news about massive fraud by a large
New York-based fund is likely to have similar effects. Although it is best not to
generalise from this particular incident, due diligence by wealth managers,
who channel the investments of high net worth individuals into hedge funds,
will intensify as a result. Responding to the challenges of the investment
environment, some of the larger funds introduced lower fee schedules and
processes that pay closer attention to the needs of large institutional clients.
Finally, a number of official recommendations for the reform of the prudential
framework imply tighter oversight of the industry. Such reforms include the
registration of all hedge funds, more demanding reporting requirements for
the larger funds and direct supervision of those whose operations have
implications for systemic stability.

The long-term implications of the crisis for the financial sector
The crisis has already profoundly affected the global financial system. The
scale of the losses suffered has seriously damaged financial firms’ balance

sheets. However, the efforts by institutions to rebuild their strength will have
implications not only for their short-term performance but also for the financial
structure beyond the current episode. Similarly, official initiatives aimed
primarily at resolving the crisis are likely to exert a lasting influence on the
financial landscape.
The crisis is bound to condition the understanding of financial risk both at
the level of the single firm and at the level of the financial system. In particular,
this episode has highlighted the degree to which the interactions among
the components of the financial system, as well as between the system and
the real economy, had been misjudged. At the level of the firm, it pointed
to shortcomings in the functioning of securitisation markets that, when
overlooked, can reverse the diversification benefits these markets can offer.
Similarly, it demonstrated the vulnerability that can arise from the use of
market-based funding channels for financial institutions, especially when
combined with high leverage. At the systemic level, the crisis showed that the
interconnections between financial markets and institutions place a natural
limit on how far systemic risk can be reduced through the existence of
multiple channels of intermediation.

The shortcomings of securitisation
The crisis highlighted several shortcomings in the originate-to-distribute
business model. During the early stages of the crisis, some observers labelled
it as the first such episode of the securitisation era. While this characterisation
arguably exaggerates the causal influence of securitisation, it does reflect the
fact that exposures to securitised loans accounted for the bulk of the financial
sector’s early losses. Failures in information flows along the securitisation chain
played a key role in shaping the dynamics of the crisis.
The potential benefits of securitisation are easily understood. By divorcing
the origination of credit from the ultimate bearing of risk and allowing greater
risk dispersion, securitisation can improve the overall efficiency of financial
intermediation. Actors along the securitisation chain can make best use of
their comparative strengths in processing information or managing particular
types of risk.
The events surrounding the crisis revealed how these benefits can
be undermined by weaknesses stemming from the interactions between
individual incentives and the quality of the information flow along the
securitisation chain. Originators, intermediaries, investors and third-party
assessors of risk each have specific responsibilities and different perspectives.
The integrity of the securitisation process depends critically on those
interlocked interests reinforcing the incentive of all parties to seek and make
use of information. In the event, potential reputational costs from sub-par
evaluation and monitoring of risk by originators and intermediaries were
outweighed by the incentive to pursue growth created by volume-linked
revenue structures. Investors’ self-preservation incentives appeared numbed
in an environment where the presumption of liquidity marked up the
portfolios of seasoned securities on the basis of the prices of newly issued
transactions. The complexity of securitisation structures contributed to the

50

breakdown in incentives by obscuring the relationship between ultimate
claims and underlying risks. Few understood the full implications of complex
structures for the risk-and-return characteristics of these securities and in
particular the sensitivity of their valuation to underlying assumptions.
Moreover, the complexity of the transactions combined with rapid growth in
the market led investors to rely excessively on rating agency assessments of
risk. In retrospect, the poor quality of ratings contributed to the mispricing of
securitised products.
The crisis underscored the critical importance of having high-quality
information available to all parties, of ensuring that the responsibilities of all
parties are clear, and of strengthening discipline by ensuring that all parties
retain a sufficient degree of exposure to the overall risk. A central lesson has
been that dispersion of exposures may provide only illusory risk diversification
to individual participants in the securitisation chain if the system as a whole
is exposed to concentrations of mispriced risk.

Interdependencies between institutions and markets

The interdependencies
between markets
and institutions …

… pose challenges
for prudential policy

An efficient financial system channels resources from savers to investors, and
allocates risk to those most capable of bearing it, in the least costly way. The
existence of markets that rely on arm’s length transactions to perform these
functions alongside financial firms that intermediate on their balance sheet
has been a desirable feature of advanced financial systems. Substitutability
between the two alternative channels of intermediation has been viewed as a
source of system stability and robustness: the risk of systemic bottlenecks
would be reduced through diversification across the two channels.
The crisis revealed once more that this view does not emphasise
sufficiently the strong interdependencies between on-balance sheet and
market-based intermediation. Institutions depend on markets for revenue
generation, risk management and funding, while market functioning depends
on institutions to provide market-making services, securities underwriting and
lines of credit. These interdependencies between markets and institutions
were showcased by the difficulties that institutions faced in funding their
operations in illiquid markets and the problems created in the functioning of
markets when the participating institutions were under stress. Heightened
concern about counterparty risk led to a seizing-up of markets and undermined
the liquidity of portfolios and firms’ funding strategies, causing large losses.
An important message from the crisis is that the stability of both channels of
financial intermediation is supported by a common capital base. Table III.4
suggests the key role of large financial firms in both the on-balance sheet and
market-based intermediation channels by highlighting that the same set of
institutions are involved in both functions.
Such interdependencies present considerable challenges for prudential
policy aimed at ensuring that problems with individual institutions do not
generate systemic disruptions. Dealing successfully with systemic risk requires
that policy instruments be designed and calibrated taking into account the links
between the various components of the financial system and, more generally,
that policy implementation adopt a systemic perspective (see Chapter VII).

Limits to international diversification?
The secular trend towards greater internationalisation of banking has been an
important feature of the financial system. Internationally active banks have
broadened their investment portfolios and extended their presence in foreign
jurisdictions. The outstanding stock of BIS reporting banks’ foreign claims
grew from $11 trillion in 2000 to over $30 trillion by mid-2007, a major
expansion even when scaled by measures of economic activity. The pursuit of
diversification opportunities has been an important motivation. However, the
crisis has called into question the perceived degree of asset and liability
diversification attained by banks with international operations. The responses
of individual institutions as well as changes in the policy framework may
betoken a slowing of this trend.
On the assets side, a heightened sense of risk associated with foreign
exposures may now be inducing a “home bias” in lending. In a global systemic
crisis, the benefits of international diversification are reduced, as institutions
see their domestic and foreign exposures deteriorate simultaneously and as
host economies import the strains foreign banks face in their home markets in
the form of a reduced supply of credit. Moreover, cutting down expenses may
be easier in the case of foreign country operations than in the home country,

where public and political pressures are stronger. There are some signs that
the process of deleveraging has affected the positions of banks at home and
abroad asymmetrically: claims on non-banks residing outside the banks’ home
markets have shrunk significantly in recent quarters (Graph III.8). The signs of
a pulling-back from international lending are more evident for US and German
lenders than for others, and the effect is more pronounced when exposures to
emerging market economies are considered (see Chapter V).
On the liabilities side, European banks seeking to fund their US dollar
exposures were particularly affected by the shortage of funding liquidity in
the past year. European lenders had built up over $5 trillion of claims on the
private sector, including investments in retail and corporate loans as well
as structured finance products related to US mortgages (Graph III.9, top lefthand panel). To finance those positions, they borrowed US dollars from the
global interbank market, from reserve-accumulating central banks and
from non-bank entities. The balance of US dollar funding was made up by
borrowing in domestic currency from home country residents (shaded area
in the bottom left-hand panel of Graph III.9). The currency risk associated with
such cross-currency funding was probably offset to a large extent through
banks’ reliance on foreign exchange swaps. Banks were thus exposed to
a maturity mismatch as both interbank borrowing and foreign exchange
swaps tended to be shorter-term than the investments they supported. This
imbalance has been vulnerable to the disruptions in the interbank and swap
markets since August 2007. The problems for European banks intensified
with the retreat of money market funds in the wake of the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy (see Chapter II). The resulting US dollar shortage prompted the
US Federal Reserve to arrange currency swaps with other central banks,
enabling them to provide US dollars to banks in their respective jurisdictions
(see Chapter VI).
The policy response to the crisis may also contribute to a potential halting
of the process of internationalisation. The crisis brought to the fore the limits of

national authorities in dealing with troubled banks with international operations
and exposed their difficulties in addressing domestic market problems caused
by disruptions in the international flow of liquidity. As a result, new policy
requirements aimed at strengthening the resources of local branches and
subsidiaries to deal independently with such risks are likely to reduce the
operational benefits of centralised risk and liquidity management by institutions
with cross-border business.

The size of the financial sector
An event of the magnitude and depth of the current crisis is also likely to be
long drawn out. Following the stages of acute strains in September and
October 2008, the financial system now has to face the structural implications
of the crisis. The progress that the financial sector makes in dealing with the
damage caused as well as the vulnerabilities revealed by the crisis will not only
shape the recovery but will also determine its timing.

capacity will be
necessary

Historically, a prerequisite for successful recovery from a financial crisis
has been the shedding of the excess capacity that is inevitably created in the
financial sector during the preceding boom. In the run-up to the current crisis,
various metrics pointed to considerable growth of the financial sector in the
advanced economies. They include the size of financial firms’ balance sheets,
their equity market capitalisation, their share of aggregate profits and their
overall contribution to aggregate GDP. This increase in financial capacity was
driven by expectations of continuing profitability, fuelled in the latter stages in
part by an increase in leverage. The ability of financial firms to raise capital to
support the same scale of activity will be limited in the near term, and a
consequent deleveraging is consistent with financial firms shrinking in size in
order to survive the current environment. At the same time, markets and
supervisors have raised the benchmark for the capital adequacy of financial
institutions. This implies that investors’ expectations and financial firms’
targets for rates of return will need to be adjusted to less ambitious levels. The
elimination of excess capacity in the sector is thus a prerequisite for achieving
sustainable levels of profitability.

IV. Fallout for the industrial economies

Several industrial economies began to contract in the first half of 2008. In
the second half, recessionary forces became much stronger and more global.
The resulting plunge in world trade was more rapid than at any time in the
past half-century and hit all export-oriented economies hard (Graph IV.1). The
coincidence of the end of a long global upswing, a collapse in trade and a severe
financial system shock made the downturn an unusually synchronised worldwide
phenomenon. With industrial production, exports and confidence becoming
highly correlated across economies, global output and inflation declined sharply.
Most leading international forecasters envisage a contraction in global
output of 1–2% in 2009. The United States, the euro area and Japan are in a deep
recession, and growth in emerging market economies as a whole has slowed
abruptly. The consensus forecast as of May is for global growth to recover but to
remain well below trend through 2010. As a result, several major economies are
expected to see zero or negative year-on-year inflation rates in 2009. The US
current account deficit has narrowed in recent months, with a correspondingly
large fall in the surpluses of Germany, Japan and countries in the Middle East.
The surpluses of China and other emerging economies in Asia remain large.
The short-term outlook is highly uncertain, one reason being the difficulty
in assessing the complex interaction between the real economy and the financial
system, and the impact of the exceptional policy measures introduced over
the past year or so. Recent policy measures should help support demand, ease
downward pressures on asset prices and credit flows and lead to a return of

confidence. But the very speed of the recent downturn could create larger than
average second-round effects. In particular, if the propensity to save were to rise
further in the industrial economies – as could easily happen, given the high
overhang of household debt and dramatic reduction in household wealth –
contractionary impulses in the global economy could be prolonged.

Before the crisis
“Global saving
glut” prior to the
crisis …

The current crisis was preceded by a major shift in global macroeconomic
conditions. A key element of this shift was a significant rise in global gross
saving as a percentage of GDP, from about 21½% in 2001 to almost 24½% in
2007. Most of the increase reflected the relatively high saving rate of the
emerging market world, where a more than threefold rise in aggregate saving
between 2001 and 2007 had lifted the marginal propensity to save to 43%.
Average saving rates rose in most emerging market regions, but the trend was
particularly marked in China and the Middle East (Table IV.1). In addition, in
several emerging Asian economies, investment rates fell from their mid-1990s
level, leading to even higher excess saving.
In contrast, the average saving rate of industrial economies fell. The
decline was led by a sharp drop in the saving rate, notably in the United
States. In some economies (eg Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the
United States), the composition of capital spending shifted markedly towards
residential construction during the first half of the 2000s.

Graph IV.2

One effect of this pattern of spending was the concentration of
consumption growth in only a few countries: the United States, in particular,
contributed about one third of the increase in global consumption between
2000 and 2006. Another major consequence was the rise in the US current
account deficit from a little over 3% of GDP at the end of the 1990s to a peak
of 6% in 2006. By 2007, current account surpluses as a percentage of GDP
had soared in countries that were major exporters of manufactured goods –
in China to more than 10% of GDP; in Germany to almost 8%; and in Japan
to about 5%. Current account surpluses in the Middle East were boosted by
higher oil prices.
The pre-crisis household spending boom in many advanced economies
was sustained by several interrelated factors. One was a significant decline in
real long-term interest rates, made possible not only by the strong rise in
global saving but also by a reduction in the term premium led by increased
demand for long-term securities by institutional investors, particularly emerging
market central banks (Graph IV.2).1 The expansionary impact of low long-term
interest rates was magnified by easy monetary conditions in major advanced
economies, where real short-term interest rates remained low or negative
between 2002 and 2005.

There are a number of theories on the link between global saving and long-term interest rates.
According to the “saving glut” hypothesis, the real long-term interest rate must fall to establish the
global equilibrium at a higher level of investment; see B Bernanke, “The global saving glut and the US
current account deficit”, Homer Jones Lecture, St Louis, 14 April 2005, www.federalreserve.gov. Yet
another hypothesis is that financial crises and high saving in emerging markets, combined with limited
financial development, created a global shortage of low-risk assets, leading to lower long-term bond
rates; see R Caballero, E Farhi and P Gourinchas, “An equilibrium model of ‘global imbalances’ and low
interest rates”, American Economic Review, vol 98, no 1, March 2008, pp 358–93.

During the upswing, credit conditions eased the most in the United
States: real long-term rates on 30-year fixed rate mortgages fell from about
5% in the early 2000s to 1–3% in 2005, and non-price lending terms were
eased considerably (see Chapter III). A near doubling of real household credit
growth, from an average of 4% in the 1990s to about 7.5% during 2000–06, led
to a substantial build-up of household debt relative to income. Household
indebtedness also increased significantly in the United Kingdom, where
mortgage rates, linked to short-term interest rates, also fell sharply. Greater
household leverage thus made many households highly vulnerable to
negative income and asset price shocks.
A second factor in the spending boom, partly driven by the first, was a
surge in house prices in several countries. Not only did this lead to increased
speculative buying of property, but it also facilitated higher borrowing against
housing collateral. From the early 2000s to the peak of the housing price cycle,
real house prices increased more than 90% in the United Kingdom and Spain
and more than 60% in the United States (based on the Case-Shiller home price
index). In several countries, the share of residential investment in GDP rose
sharply above trend. In the United States, this share reached a peak of 6.2% in
2005 and the homeowner vacancy rate jumped by 50% between 2001 and
2006, to over 2.5%. Residential construction rose well above trend in Spain
and Ireland (to 9% and 12% of GDP, respectively, in 2007) as well as in Australia
and Canada.
A third factor was that the spending boom in several industrial economies
may have generated excessive optimism among producers of goods and
services, leading to overinvestment and a significant misallocation of resources
during the pre-crisis period. In particular, a marked rise in household spending
on consumer durable goods, including cars, led to a build-up of production
capacity. In the United States, for instance, expenditure on consumer durables,
which had picked up since the mid-1990s, accelerated during the early 2000s,
with its ratio to GDP rising from about 7% in the mid-1990s to a peak of about
11% in 2007.2 In the US automobile sector, production capacity increased by
about 55% between 1996 and 2006 compared with growth of less than 25%
during the preceding 10 years.

From boom to bust
The boom ended
in a sharp and
synchronised
global downturn …

Since the second half of 2008, household expenditure (including on houses) in
the advanced world has contracted as asset prices and confidence have fallen
sharply and as credit market conditions have tightened. The following section
focuses on the dynamics of the current downturn in advanced economies
and the factors behind it, while Chapter V provides a discussion of how the
downturn has affected emerging market economies.
Although growth has weakened considerably in the United States since
mid-2007 and in other major industrial economies since early 2008, the
Spending on consumer durables also has an investment element. Including this element in tangible
assets raised the US household saving ratio by 2.5 percentage points during 2000–06; the increment fell
to 0.5 percentage points by the final quarter of 2008.

downturn became truly global only towards the end of 2008 (see Table I.1
for an overview of the stages of the crisis). Output fell at seasonally adjusted
annual rates of 14% in Japan and over 6% in the United States and the euro
area in the fourth quarter of 2008, followed by even larger declines in the first
quarter of 2009 in Japan and the euro area (15% and about 10%, respectively).
However, there have been some signs that the pace of decline in output has
started to ease since March. The monthly rate of decline in industrial production
slowed in the United States in April and production increased in Japan in
March and April. In addition, most survey measures of manufacturing output
(eg purchasing managers’ indices) continued to improve in the G3 economies
up to May, suggesting that the outlook for a recovery has strengthened.
The downturn has been unusually deep, involving most components of
spending. Private consumption contracted in all major economies in the final
quarter of 2008, but nowhere as quickly as in the United States, where it
plunged by an annualised 4.3%, accounting for almost half of the decline in
output. The hardest hit category was spending on consumer durables, which
slumped during the second half of 2008 (Graph IV.3). By the fourth quarter, the
share of consumer durables expenditure in US GDP had already fallen by
about 1 percentage point from its peak in 2007. The outsize fall was followed
by a rebound in the first quarter of 2009, but its sustainability, in the face of
large wealth losses and credit market disruption, remains uncertain (see the
next section). In contrast, consumption accounted for only a small part of the
drop in output in the euro area and Japan; the downturn in these economies
was led instead by a major collapse of net trade, accounting for about 75%
and 50% of the decline in output in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the
first quarter of 2009, respectively, and for about 60% of the decline in the euro
area in the final quarter of 2008.
With consumption deteriorating faster than income, household saving
rates increased in several advanced economies, particularly in those where

they had been low. The United States recorded a sharp rise of almost
4 percentage points of disposable income (to 4.2%) between the last quarter
of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009. Australia and the United Kingdom also
saw a jump in household saving, from almost zero and a negative saving
rate in the first quarter of 2008 to 8.5% and 4.8%, respectively, in the fourth
quarter. The propensity to save of euro area households also increased
markedly, with the saving rate rising by 1 percentage point (to 15.1%) in the final
quarter of 2008.
The decrease in residential investment was most rapid in the United
States, where residential construction declined to a low of 2.7% of GDP in the
first quarter of 2009. In Spain and the United Kingdom, the crisis further
impaired an already weakened residential sector. Residential investment also
started to fall in Germany towards the end of 2008, and housing starts suggest
that a major housing downturn has been under way in Japan since the
beginning of 2009. At the end of 2008, the ratio of residential investment to
GDP still exceeded the average since 1980 in a number of industrial economies
(notably Canada, Ireland and the Netherlands), suggesting that the adjustment
has further to go in many cases.
A squeeze in credit supply to commercial real estate developers,
combined with low demand for office and commercial properties, accentuated
the weakness in non-residential construction. Moreover, as consumer demand
prospects deteriorated and overseas orders plummeted, business investment
projects were either postponed or cut heavily. In the United States, for
instance, non-residential fixed investment contracted by a record 38%
(annualised) in the first quarter of 2009 following a 23% fall in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Business investment also contracted sharply in Japan and the euro
area. The steep decline in capital goods orders up to March 2009 suggests that
the investment downturn remains deep (Graph IV.3).
The recession was aggravated by pressure to curb excessive inventories
as actual sales fell more rapidly than expected. In addition, there is evidence
that investment may have suffered because of shortages of trade credit.
Surveys in the United Kingdom, for instance, suggest that interfirm trade credit
suffered as payment delays increased, as the probability of business failures
rose, and as firms accumulated cash to reduce exposure to volatile markets.
The greater reluctance of banks and non-bank financial institutions to discount
trade invoices could also have contributed to the investment downturn.

The downturn, balance sheets and credit
Household balance sheets
Very weak household
balance sheets …

A key factor leading the downturn was the severe weakening of household
balance sheets as a result of the financial crisis. Equity prices fell rapidly, and
the decline in nominal house prices, which had first been confined to the
United States, became more widespread across advanced economies. From
the second quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008, US households lost
around 20% (about $13 trillion) of their net worth; as a percentage of

disposable income, this loss was greater than the wealth accumulated over
the previous five years (Graph IV.4). Wealth losses in the euro area have also
become more widespread across assets and countries, far exceeding those
suffered during the equity market meltdown in 2001, when rising housing
wealth offset the negative effects of large equity losses.
Such declines in household wealth, particularly housing assets, are likely
to constrain consumption for some time, although there could be forces
working in the opposite direction. Falling house prices imply a reduction in
the implicit rental cost of housing, offsetting some of the negative wealth
effects. Moreover, lower prices make houses more affordable for prospective
homeowners, reducing their need to save for a given down payment. In addition,
some decline in household wealth – particularly from depreciating financial
assets – may be perceived as temporary.
Although researchers disagree on the estimates of the wealth effect
on consumption, the impact of housing wealth is generally assumed to be
significant – ranging in several studies between 3 and 7 cents per dollar in
Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. It is assumed to
be relatively small for the euro area.3 The decline in homeowner equity is
likely to cause particularly large reductions in spending among households
that had borrowed against housing equity to finance consumption. The fact
that loose credit standards in some countries had made borrowing against
collateral considerably easier during the upswing could lead to a strong
negative effect as standards are tightened. It is possible that asset price declines
that leave many households with large negative equity generate asymmetric
wealth effects on consumption.
In addition, increased financial vulnerability stemming from such a large
loss of wealth may lead households to shift away from less liquid assets

But the impact is
likely to vary across
economies

A key risk is a
further sharp rise in
household saving

(houses mainly, but also durable goods) towards more liquid, financial assets.
In particular, highly indebted households with substantial contractual debt
obligations may increase their financial saving and reduce spending on
housing, cars and other high-value consumer durables.4
Furthermore, the steep decline in the value of pension fund assets may
force individuals nearing retirement who have defined contribution pension
schemes – in which benefits are linked to the market value of assets – to
increase saving or defer retirement. In the case of defined benefit plans, the
large funding gaps could harm the financial position of the corporations
sponsoring them and reduce their ability to provide guaranteed benefits or
maintain existing employment.
That said, the impact of the wealth contraction is likely to vary across
countries depending on institutional arrangements. Equity extraction from
housing wealth was significant in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and
the United States during the upswing, so household spending is likely to be
more affected in these countries than in others. Some estimates suggest that,
in the United States, about 1¾% of consumption annually was financed through
home equity withdrawals during 2001–05, or 3% if withdrawals used to repay
non-mortgage debts are included.5 In the United Kingdom, home equity
withdrawal has reversed, plummeting from over 7% of post-tax income in 2003
to –1% in 2008. By contrast, equity extraction played a relatively minor role in
household spending in the euro area as a whole because of both a low home
ownership ratio and, in some countries, a less developed mortgage market.
Nevertheless, the fact that household debts increased so much in so
many countries suggests that large wealth and income losses are likely to
raise the saving rate still further in much of the advanced world. How
protracted this rise might prove to be remains uncertain. In the 1970s US
recession, the household saving rate went from a low of 8.0% in mid-1972
to a peak of 12.5% in mid-1975. A similar trough-to-peak rise in the saving
rate was observed in the early 1980s US recession. In contrast, the 1990s and
early 2000s recessions had little impact on the saving rate. The rate of
household saving in the current US recession was, however, much lower at its
lowest point than in previous recessions, and household indebtedness much
higher at its peak. The increase in saving could thus be stronger and more
protracted than in the past. Household saving rates could also rise further in
Australia and the United Kingdom as well as in several euro area economies
(eg Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain), where they are still below their
historical averages.

Corporate balance sheets
Unlike in the household sector, debt levels in the non-financial corporate
sector remained fairly stable or even fell during the first half of the 2000s.
This factor appears to have played an important role in the rise of US household saving following the
1970s stock market downturn; see F Mishkin, “What depressed the consumer? The household balance
sheet and the 1973–75 recession”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol 8, no 1, 1977, pp 123–74.

Between 2005 and 2008, however, corporate debt levels as a percentage of
GDP rose considerably (Graph IV.5). The crisis further weakened balance
sheets by sharply reducing profitability as well as the value of corporate
investments. In addition, widening credit spreads cut the access of many firms
to capital markets, leading to major funding problems.
During 2008, US non-financial non-farm corporations suffered an
aggregate decline in net worth of 7%; this was led by a sharp decrease in the
value of their real estate assets (down 12.8%) and a somewhat smaller decline
in their financial net worth (down 5.3%). In contrast, net financial worth
(excluding equity) of euro area and Japanese non-financial corporate firms
deteriorated much more rapidly, falling by about 50% in 2008. Corporate
sector distress has risen to very high levels, with the number of corporate
bankruptcies approaching or exceeding historical peaks in many industrial
economies (Graph IV.5).
The weakening of corporate financial positions and profitability seems
likely to reduce business investment, with feedback effects on the economy
and balance sheets. The severity of such negative financial accelerator effects
depends on the structure and the initial strength of corporate balance sheets.
In the euro area and the United Kingdom, outstanding gross corporate
financial liabilities (including debts, trade credits and other liabilities) were
about 130% of GDP at the end of 2008. That level, which is well above the
1990s average, represents a heightened vulnerability to adverse financial
shocks. Although US corporate financial liabilities have also risen, reaching
90% of GDP by the end of 2008, they do not seem to be excessive relative to
the 1990s average.

The downturn in the credit cycle
The crisis has provoked a sharp turn in the credit cycle. Sizeable policy rate
cuts have helped bring down interest rates on funds borrowed by households
and businesses over the past year. But the impact of interest rate reductions

on credit flows has been muted by a sharp tightening of non-price lending
standards by banks (see Chapter III).
Aggregate private credit growth in many advanced economies fell over the
past year or so, most dramatically in residential credit markets. Nominal housing
credit (excluding home equity loans) contracted at an annual rate of 1–2% from
the second quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009 in the United States, and
it stopped growing in the euro area by March 2009. Consumer credit slowed
significantly in many advanced countries, the exception being the United
States, where it grew at an annual rate of 9% in the first quarter of 2009.
Although business credit continued to expand in many countries, it was
probably driven by an increase in the use of existing credit lines rather than
by new lending.
While the credit squeeze has been holding back potential first-time home
buyers and other credit-constrained consumers, declines in income appear to
have made more households credit-constrained. The disappearance of
alternative financing offered in the past by non-bank lenders has tended to
magnify such effects. Business investment has also suffered – recent lending
surveys report significant cuts in new credit lines to firms, particularly in the
United States. In addition, with growth weakening and balance sheet positions
deteriorating rapidly, the credit downturn is being exacerbated by a substantial
reduction in credit demand as firms scale back investment plans and
households reassess their income and wealth prospects.
The depth and duration of the credit downturn will thus depend on how
banking system deleveraging (see Chapter III) interacts with balance sheet
adjustments by firms and households. While such interaction is hard to predict,
past credit and financial crises can provide some guidance.
It is useful to compare the current US credit cycle with previous
US cycles, even though their proximate causes are different. In particular,
the early 1990s credit market downturn provides an interesting benchmark
(Graph IV.6). Even though losses from the reduced value of commercial
property were modest, real private credit fell for 14 consecutive quarters
beginning in the third quarter of 1990. The ratio of credit to GDP also
contracted during this period. The close link between the credit and household
spending cycles was notable, although the credit contraction ultimately
proved to be more protracted than declines in household spending. In
addition, non-residential investment weakened considerably in the 1990s
downturn.
Another useful point of reference is provided by the 1990s Nordic banking
crises, in which the booms and busts of real estate prices also played a key role.
The Nordic crises precipitated a contraction in the credit/GDP ratio in the region
that lasted five to seven years and were followed by a protracted decline in
spending. In Norway and Sweden, household spending and business
investment both weakened well before the peak in the output cycle and
contracted for several years following the crises. Even so, as discussed in
Chapter VI, differences in crisis resolution regimes also matter. By the time
authorities intervened in the Nordic crises, credit and economic activity had
already deteriorated significantly. By contrast, the authorities have intervened

at an early stage of the credit and business cycle in the current crisis in order
to cushion the downturn.
Of relevance to current problems in the household sector is Japan’s
experience in the 1990s, which illustrates the adverse interaction between a
banking crisis and a large overhang of debt in the corporate sector. The
collapse of asset prices in Japan in the late 1980s increased bank losses and
severely weakened the balance sheets of non-financial corporations, which
had debt levels exceeding 150% of GDP in 1990. This led to a protracted
period of debt reduction, cuts in capital spending and weak demand for credit.
With the corporate sector debt/GDP ratio falling sharply in subsequent years,
the credit/GDP ratio also contracted.

… and the

crisis

Factors accentuating and propagating the recession
Balance sheet and credit market adjustments have an enduring effect on the
economy, but their short-run impact in the current crisis has been aggravated
by several cyclical factors. One is the slump in employment triggered by

66

BIS 79th Annual Report

Sharp falls in

aggravating the
downturn …

… as is fragile
confidence …

the growing threat of business bankruptcies, which has greatly added to
households’ financial uncertainty. In the United States, for instance, total hours
worked were cut at an annualised pace of 9% in the first quarter of 2009
following an equally large cut in the preceding quarter, lifting the
unemployment rate to 9.4% by May 2009. While the current US employment
cycle has already proved to be quite deep by historical standards, according
to May consensus forecasts the US unemployment rate is expected to be
approaching 10% by 2010. In the euro area, sustained growth in the labour
supply, coupled with weak demand for labour, was behind the steady increase
in the unemployment rate, which reached 9.2% by April 2009.
Employment uncertainties facing euro area households could last longer
than in the United States, where the employment cycle tends to be shorter. In
the 1980s and 1990s downturns, for instance, employment fell for 12 and eight
quarters, respectively, in the euro area compared with about four quarters in
the United States. Employment in Japan has continued to be weak since the
late 1990s. A marked decline in the ratio of job offers to applicants since the
beginning of 2009 suggests that the employment downturn in Japan is likely
to deepen further.
A second, and related, cyclical factor is the sharp weakening of consumer
and business confidence (Graph IV.7). In the past, confidence tended to
explain a small part of spending, after controlling for other major determinants
of consumption such as income, wealth and interest rates.6 However, if weaker
confidence reflects expectations of lower future income, it may foreshadow a
downward shift in future spending. A key risk is that weak confidence becomes
self-fulfilling by reducing spending and employment and increasing income
uncertainty.

Graph IV.8

A third cyclical factor is the sharp decline in international trade
(Graph IV.8), which has contributed to the spreading and deepening of
the downturn across economies. The worldwide collapse of manufacturing
demand has affected all advanced countries, but those heavily dependent on
manufacturing exports, especially Germany and Japan, have been hit the
hardest. Moreover, as Germany is the major hub of the European production
network, its loss of export business has been felt beyond its borders. Australia
and Canada have been affected by a fall in commodity prices, although the
negative impact in Australia has been muted not only because the country is
a net importer of oil but also because the fall in agricultural prices has been
relatively modest.
A fourth factor is changes in exchange rates. In particular, a sharp
appreciation of the real effective value of the yen since late 2008 has depressed
Japan’s exports. In contrast, the tradables sector in the United Kingdom has
benefited from a substantial reduction in the effective value of sterling. A real
depreciation of the euro also helped euro area exports in 2008, but the
exchange rate reverted to its appreciation path in the first quarter of 2009. In
the United States, however, the dollar’s appreciation during the second half
of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 has meant that the exchange rate, on
balance, has become more neutral in the evolution of trade over the past year.

Inflation developments in industrial economies
The downturn has led to a sharp decline in inflation pressures in industrial
economies. Not only have year-on-year headline inflation rates fallen rapidly
since mid-2008 (Graph IV.9), but by the first quarter of 2009 they became
negative in the United States and Japan and fell to zero in the euro area by
May. Although an assessment of inflation prospects is complex under current
conditions, recent disinflation has raised concerns among many observers
about risks of deflation in the short run.

… led by the slump

Prospects for
inflation are
uncertain

Two major factors are responsible for current disinflation pressures. One
is the 55% decline in oil prices between mid-2008 and May 2009, which has led
to a marked reduction in import prices in many oil-importing countries. In
addition, forecasts of global oil demand for 2009 have been revised downwards.
In May 2009, the International Energy Agency expected a decrease in world oil
demand of 2.6 million barrels per day in 2009 compared with 2008, the
sharpest single-year fall since 1981. Metal prices, which started to decline in
2007, dropped more sharply in the second half of 2008 and in early 2009. Food
prices have also fallen, although not as dramatically as oil prices because of
their relatively weak link to global growth. Softening demand has also resulted
in substantially lower shipping rates.
The second factor is that downward pressures on prices have been
accentuated by considerable economic slack. Capacity utilisation in
manufacturing has fallen particularly heavily in the major advanced economies.
Notwithstanding the substantial uncertainties involved, the projected output
and unemployment gaps suggest that the level of economic slack is expected
to remain high in 2009 and 2010. Core inflation has declined sharply in Japan
since the beginning of 2009, although it remained relatively more stable in the
United States and the euro area up to April 2009 (Graph IV.9). There is a risk
that the unusually synchronised downturn, combined with a possible jump in
household saving, could well aggravate disinflation pressures over the next
year or so.
Yet there is considerable uncertainty regarding inflation prospects. First,
the timing and extent of the impact on spending of recent stimulus measures
remain unclear. Developments since the beginning of 2009 have somewhat
reduced downside risks to growth forecasts. In addition, there is no reliable
estimate of the macroeconomic impact of the large-scale, unconventional
monetary policies recently introduced by central banks.

The impact of the current crisis on potential output
Estimates of potential output and the output gap help monetary authorities gauge the current state of
the economy. Potential output is usually defined as the maximum level of output that an economy can
achieve without causing inflationary pressure, and is largely determined by supply side factors, including
technological progress, demographic trends and institutional arrangements in labour and financial
markets. Yet potential output is unobservable and thus has to be estimated. Even in normal times,
uncertainties surrounding potential output estimates can be considerable because changes in structural
factors might be hard to detect. In addition, frequent and sometimes substantial revisions of data on
GDP and its major components diminish the usefulness of potential output estimates for real-time
policymaking. For example, mean absolute revisions to US GDP growth have tended to be large,
ranging from 0.5 (first annual revision) to 1.3 percentage points (third). Around cyclical turning points,
mean absolute revisions are substantially larger, often well over 2 percentage points.
A key question in the current conjuncture is to what extent potential output might be affected by
the ongoing financial crisis. Several factors are likely to have an impact on the level of potential output,
its growth rate, or both. First, the crisis could lead to a severe disruption of the credit intermediation
process for years to come, reducing credit availability and increasing risk premia. Second, potential
output could be adversely affected by a possible rise in structural unemployment. The protracted nature
of the current crisis implies that a non-negligible proportion of workers could permanently drop out of
the effective labour force. The natural rate of unemployment could therefore be markedly higher in
some countries following the global recession, as many jobs might have vanished forever in industries
such as automobile manufacturing and financial services. In the United States, “permanent” layoffs
(of workers not expected to ever regain the same job) rose to a record 52.9% of the unemployed in
May 2009.
Third, the financial crisis could have a negative impact on total factor productivity by sharply
reducing funding for research and development activities. In Japan, for instance, a fall in the growth rate
of total factor productivity and a drop in average hours worked per week from 44 to 40 between 1988
and 1993 were found to have led to a change in the slope and level of the steady state growth path
(Hayashi and Prescott (2002)). Fourth, the global nature of the current downturn and the high degree of
global economic integration could magnify the impact of the crisis on potential output. Given the
significant increase in cross-border lending and investment in the past decade, a financial crisis in one
country or region could result in large negative effects on other economies. If factors of production are
not perfectly mobile, a loss of export markets in some countries could, for instance, render a significant
part of their capital stock and labour force idle for an extended period of time, leading to a decline in
potential output.
Evidence based on past crises provides some illustrative guidance about the likely effects of the
current episode on potential output. In a panel study of output behaviour in 190 countries, Cerra and
Saxena (2008) found large and persistent actual output losses associated with financial crises, with
output falling by 7.5% relative to trend over a period of 10 years in the event of a banking crisis. Based
on the same methodology and using data for 30 OECD economies from 1960 to 2007, Furceri and
Mourougane (2009) found that, on average, a financial crisis could lower potential output by between
1.5% (OECD production function-based measures) and 2.1% (measures based on the Hodrick-Prescott
filter) within five years. More severe crises (Spain in 1977, Norway in 1987, Finland and Sweden in 1991,
and Japan in 1992) were estimated to have a far greater negative impact on potential output (3.8%).
Empirical studies also indicate significant negative impact of financial crises on the growth rate of
potential output. Haugh et al (2009), for instance, examined six major banking crises (Spain in 1982, the
United States in the 1980s, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1991, and Japan in 1997). They found that
actual output losses were much greater in downturns associated with a major banking crisis. Compared
with the preceding five-year period, they found that the growth of potential output in the five years after
the onset of a banking crisis was reduced by 0.9, 0.5, 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in Norway, Finland,
Japan and Sweden, respectively.
To a large extent, the impact of the current crisis on potential output will depend on how soon and
how effectively government policy measures succeed in restoring credit market intermediation while
minimising any distortionary effects they may generate. Steps designed to safeguard labour market
flexibility and to boost long-term productivity growth could also play a significant role in supporting
potential output.

box). If so, the output gap might be less negative than current trends would
suggest, leading to an overestimation of disinflation pressures. Following the
early 1970s oil price shock, for instance, the adverse impact of higher oil prices
on potential output may well have been underestimated in advanced
economies, leading to an underestimation of inflationary pressures.
Third, recent wage developments do not suggest that a downward wageprice nexus has developed, at least in the G3 economies. Unit labour costs,
for instance, rose by 4.8% in the euro area in the fourth quarter of 2008 year
on year. In the United States, unit labour costs have also tended to rise at a
faster rate in 2009 (2.2% in the first quarter, up from 1.6% in the fourth quarter
of 2008). The rise in unit labour costs may partly reflect a cyclical downturn
in productivity as well as the lagged adjustment of employment to a fall in

output, but it is also likely to reflect the degree of wage flexibility in an economy.
In the euro area economies, for instance, firms’ ability to reduce labour costs
may be constrained by a degree of downward nominal wage rigidity.
Such uncertainties highlight the key role of expectations in inflation
prospects. Short-term inflation expectations of households in the G3
economies have fallen markedly since mid-2008, but long-term expectations
have remained relatively stable (Graph IV.10). One downside risk is that
a further sharp reduction in short-term inflation expectations, combined
with doubts about the capacity of policy to arrest the downturn, may lead
households to postpone spending, resulting in a larger than projected fall in
the inflation rate or even a sustained period of declining prices. But if agents
base their spending decisions on steadier expectations about long-term inflation,
the risk of deflation will be considerably reduced. Also, a danger exists that
long-term inflation expectations will rise if private agents come to believe that
public debt burdens will not be manageable without higher inflation to erode
that debt.7

Summing up
The global financial crisis has led to an unprecedented recession accentuated
by rapid declines in trade volumes, large employment cuts and a massive loss
of confidence. How deep and prolonged the downturn will be is uncertain. In
the industrial countries, there are some signs that the rapid pace of decline
in spending witnessed since the fourth quarter of 2008 has started to ease.
But a strong, sustained recovery in those countries could be difficult given
attempts by households and financial firms to repair their balance sheets.
Nevertheless, substantial fiscal stimulus and exceptional monetary easing in
many countries should help bring the recent contraction to an end. The
policymakers’ task in the near term will be to ensure a sustained recovery. In
the medium term, however, it will be to ensure that policies are adjusted
sufficiently to maintain the stability of long-term inflation expectations.

V. Fallout for the emerging market economies

The unfolding financial and economic crisis hit emerging market economies
(EMEs) with full force in the final quarter of 2008. The bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008 was followed by an unprecedented drop in export
demand that coincided with a significant reversal in international bank lending
and foreign portfolio investment. Exchange rates in many countries
depreciated, equity prices declined and the cost of external financing rose
sharply. Depressed consumer and investor spending in the advanced
economies led to a slump in demand for EME exports, which reinforced the
capital inflow reversal. An extended period of export-led growth supported by
capital inflows thus came to an end (Graph V.1).
In examining these events, this chapter first sets the context by reviewing
the pre-crisis period. Export-to-GDP ratios rose and investment – funded to a
significant extent by foreign capital inflows – shifted to the tradable goods
sector. In some major EMEs, notably China, this development was associated
with very high saving that exceeded investment, resulting in large current
account surpluses and reserve accumulation. In other EME regions, however,
particularly in central and eastern Europe (CEE), current account deficits were
large in spite of rapid export growth. Second, the chapter discusses some
features of the recent downturn in economic activity in EMEs, and the
difficulties encountered in boosting domestic demand. Third, drawing on BIS
statistics, it discusses the sharp reversal in capital inflows, noting new
vulnerabilities that arose because private sector external borrowing in EMEs
remained high even when public sector external borrowing had declined.

Finally, it discusses two elements that have supported EME economic activity
since the start of the crisis: foreign currency liquidity and resilient domestic
credit.

Before the crisis
Before the onset of the crisis, EME growth had been very strong, but the
structure of that growth planted some of the seeds of the recent downturn.
From 2003 until mid-2008, most emerging economies experienced robust,
export-led growth that was associated with increased gross saving and
attracted large capital inflows. Foreign exchange reserves accumulated on an
unprecedented scale, and economic and financial integration with the
advanced economies proceeded rapidly and became more complex. In
particular, the global integration of production chains made many EMEs more
dependent on exports than they had been a decade or so earlier. In addition,
the EMEs’ financial sectors became more closely integrated with those of the
advanced economies and dependent on them as a source of investment
opportunities or, in some cases, net external finance.
For the emerging markets as a group, real GDP growth accelerated to an
average of 7.4% per year during 2003–07 from 6.0% during 1992–96, the
period leading up to the Asian crisis. Much of this acceleration in growth came
from improvements in production efficiency that reflected greater competition
and the technological spillovers associated with increased exports. In China
and India in particular, the ratio of exports to GDP was as much as 100% higher
in 2007 than the average for 1992–96 (Graph V.2, left-hand panel). In other
economies in emerging Asia, exports rose from already high levels to about
75% of GDP in 2007, and in CEE to more than 40% of GDP.

Greater share of
global gross
saving …

… but large
differences across
regions

Large two-way
capital flows

The growing importance of exports for EMEs led to a significant shift in
the structure of fixed investment. In Brazil, China, India, Korea and Poland, the
average per-country investment in gross fixed capital in the tradable sectors
(agriculture, mining and manufacturing) increased by 3.2 percentage points
between 2003 and 2007, to 39% of total fixed investment. By comparison, in
the first half of the 1990s tradable industries had accounted for about 28% of
total fixed investment in China (vs 36% in 2003–07) and about 19% in Brazil
(vs 56% in 2003–06).
While the EMEs were becoming much more important in global trade, they
were also becoming a key source of global saving (see Chapter IV). In gross
terms, the share of EMEs in global saving rose from 25% in 1992–96 to 30%
in 2003 and 40% in 2007. In comparison, the EME share of world GDP did not
rise quite so rapidly, moving from 21% in 1992–96 to 31% in 2007.
Saving-investment balances differed notably across EME regions in the
2003–07 period. In China, gross saving exceeded gross investment by a large
margin: the saving rate reached 58% of GDP in 2007 even though China also
maintained one of the highest investment rates in the world (44% of GDP in
2007; Graph V.2). Enterprises kept a growing portion of after-tax profits, and
households upped their saving partly as a precaution against the diminishing
social safety net. India saw a sharp rise in the saving rate as well, but the gain
was more than matched by the increase in the investment rate. Other Asian
emerging economies saw only a modest rise in saving and investment rates
between 2003 and 2007, with both remaining below the levels preceding the
Asian crisis (Graph V.2).
In contrast, in CEE (as well as in South Africa), gross investment exceeded
gross saving by a wide margin, resulting in current account deficits of 5–7% of
GDP for the region as a whole. These deficits were financed by relatively large
private capital inflows – in this respect, CEE was similar to emerging Asia
before the 1997 crisis. Another similarity between CEE and emerging Asia was
the widespread use of foreign currency loans by borrowers without foreign
currency income. However, there were also some important differences
between the two regions. In particular, CEE countries opened their banking
systems to foreign ownership and as EU members or candidates aligned their
institutions, laws and governance practices with those of the European Union.
CEE thus entered the current crisis with a legal, regulatory and supervisory
framework that was stronger than emerging Asia’s in 1997.
Finally, as a complement to EMEs’ increased role in global trade and
saving, their financial sectors rapidly integrated with those in the advanced
economies. Foreign private portfolio investment in emerging market financial
assets and cross-border lending by banks from advanced economies both
increased significantly in the period preceding the current crisis. Gross private
capital inflows to EMEs thus rose from 4% of their combined GDP in 2003 to
10.7% in 2007 (Table V.1), compared with an increase from 4.7% to 5.7% of
GDP between 1992 and 1996. At the same time, companies from Brazil, China,
India, Korea, Russia and several other EMEs became major direct investors in
many advanced and developing countries. In addition, China, the oil-exporting
countries and several other EMEs invested part of their official reserves

(including through investment vehicles such as sovereign wealth funds) in the
bonds and equities of advanced economies. Gross private capital outflows from
EMEs thus rose from 2.3% to 7.3% of GDP between 2003 and 2007 (Table V.1),
compared with an increase from 1.5% to 2.5% of GDP between 1992 and 1996.
The large capital inflows together with large current account surpluses
led to strong appreciation pressures on many emerging market currencies.
Until about 2007, concerns about appreciation had also led to substantial
and prolonged intervention in foreign exchange markets, which resulted in
large increases in foreign reserves. Foreign reserve growth in the larger
EMEs accelerated from $0.3 trillion in 2003 to over $1 trillion in 2007, an
unprecedented amount, but then slowed considerably in 2008 to $0.4 trillion,
most of which was in China. However, as discussed below, foreign reserve
holdings declined sharply in a number of EMEs after reaching peaks in 2008.
Foreign reserves in EMEs stood at over $4.3 trillion in January 2009.
Until the first half of 2008, very large foreign reserve accumulation was
associated with increases in liquidity that were to varying degrees offset by
sterilisation or the sale of government securities to the public. On balance,
monetary conditions eased significantly, as reflected in low real interest rates
and rapid growth in bank credit to the private sector. Real interest rates in Asia
and Latin America fell between 2001 and 2005, to close to zero or lower,
although they subsequently rose. Growth in domestic bank credit to the private
sector in EMEs averaged over 23% per year in 2006 and 2007, with particularly
rapid increases observed in Latin America (over 30%), CEE (24%) and Russia
(nearly 50%). While credit growth had slowed significantly by the end of 2008,
it remained close to 20% or higher in Latin America, India, Indonesia, CEE and
Russia. One factor behind the increased liquidity was low interest rates in the
advanced economies. In particular, many EMEs were reluctant to raise policy

rates when inflation was rising in 2007 and 2008, because of worries that higher
policy rates would attract greater capital inflows and accentuate appreciation
pressures.

Severe shock to the real economy
Partly protected by their relatively robust financial positions, including large
foreign reserves (see below), EMEs were generally not severely affected
by the global financial crisis between August 2007 and mid-2008. However,
they have since been increasingly affected by two developments in the real
economy: the fall in demand from industrial countries for consumer durables
and the sharp decline in commodity prices.

Contracting economic activity

Falling demand
for consumer
durables …

… and declining
commodity prices

Collapsing growth in advanced economies led to a sharp contraction in
economic activity in EMEs in the fourth quarter of 2008, with double digit
declines in exports and industrial production and marked slowdowns in retail
sales (Graph V.3). The synchronised fall in exports intensified in the first quarter
of 2009 with an average year-on-year decrease of around 25% in a set of larger
EMEs. In some commodity-exporting countries, notably Chile and Russia,
exports fell by more than 40% in the first quarter of 2009.
The decline in spending on consumer durables in advanced countries
over the second half of 2008 (see Chapter IV) has sharply reduced EME exports
of automobile and information technology (IT) products. The automobile sector
accounts for a significant share of GDP in a number of EMEs (3% in Turkey,
6% in Mexico, 8% in Korea and Thailand, and more than 10% in central Europe)
and exports have declined rapidly, eg by 45% in Mexico in February 2009 and
54% in Turkey in the first quarter of 2009. The IT sector is especially important
for East Asia and was largely responsible for the slowdown in the region
during the 2001 US recession. In the current downturn the inventory-to-sales
ratio of electronic goods has risen sharply in East Asia, and exports and
production have decreased. For example, Korean IT export growth fell for six
consecutive months, and the year-on-year decline for March 2009 was about
27%. The inventory-to-sales ratio for Korean IT products rose from 104% in
September 2008 to a peak of 129% in December 2008 before falling to 93% in
February 2009.
Turning to commodities, prices fell sharply as world growth slowed.
Between July 2008 and March 2009, oil prices dropped by 65% and non-oil
commodity prices by 34%. This has benefited commodity importers by
increasing disposable income and reducing costs. However, commodity
exporters have experienced declining incomes, which would tend to reduce
demand and growth. For example, commodities make up more than 40% of
total exports in Latin America (over 20% in Mexico). Recent IMF estimates
imply that the 30% drop in commodity prices between July and December
2008 could reduce regional growth in Latin America by over 2 percentage
points. The recent rebound in commodity prices (roughly 19% since the trough
in December) may, however, help cushion any further declines in growth.

The plunge in commodity prices and the increased economic slack
resulting from the sharp slowdown in growth have reduced the high rate of
EME inflation, which is forecast to decline from 6.0% in 2008 to less than 5%
in 2009. Headline and core inflation have fallen abruptly in Asia (Graph V.4),
and underlying inflation in China and Thailand has exhibited deflationary
tendencies in recent months. In China, the loss of foreign export markets has
created overcapacity that has added to the downward pressure on prices. By
contrast, inflation showed more persistence until early 2009 in Latin America
and Russia. In some countries (eg Mexico and Russia), inflation concerns
have been accentuated by depreciation pressures, a combination that poses a
dilemma for monetary policy.

Prospects for recovery
The experience of the 20th century indicates that trade expansion will
be needed to bring about a robust global economic recovery. In particular,
export growth played an important role in recoveries from the emerging
market crises of the 1990s, and research suggests that increased trade boosts
economic growth over the medium term.1 However, the heavy reliance of
EMEs on external demand could delay recovery this time. One reason is the
unprecedented severity of the import decline in advanced economies. For
example, US imports are forecast to fall at double digit rates in 2009 (compared
to 3% during the 2001 US recession). The corresponding forecast declines for
the euro area and Japan are also in double digits. Another reason is that
the scale of borrowing in advanced economies that had supported imports

from EMEs in the past proved unsustainable. In the future, increases in
developed country imports may need to be associated with higher exports to
EMEs. More generally, deleveraging and the correction of global current
account imbalances imply that saving has to rise or investment spending to
fall in some advanced economies, and the reverse in some EMEs. This kind of
adjustment may take time.
The outlook for recovery in EMEs also depends to a large extent on whether
domestic demand is sufficiently resilient to offset the slowdown in demand
from advanced economies. As noted in last year’s Annual Report (Chapter III),
there are a number of issues in this regard. In spite of robust growth and efforts
by some EMEs to boost real consumption or investment spending, their share
of GDP has generally not risen in this decade. During the current downturn, the
ability to support consumption and investment spending will depend in part
on the scope for countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies (see Chapter VI),
which is limited in many EMEs. Furthermore, lower exports will tend to
constrain investment and consumption spending by reducing prospective
returns and incomes. So far, indicators of consumer and business sentiment
in EMEs have declined sharply and retail sales have fallen in most EMEs.
China’s apparent success in boosting domestic demand through fiscal
stimulus measures and rapid domestic credit growth could help support the
demand for exports in other countries. During the 2000s, the emergence of
China as a global manufacturing hub has generated very large imports of
intermediate and capital goods from other EMEs to produce final goods for
export. However, the fall in demand for China’s exports from the advanced
economies has reduced China’s demand for such imports. Other Asian EMEs
are particularly affected, as China accounts for 20% of their exports on average.
The extent to which China could offset this reduction by increasing its imports
for domestic consumption appears to be limited. On the one hand, in response

BIS 79th Annual Report

79

to the significant stimulus provided, China’s growth is expected to remain
relatively high in 2009. In spite of a double digit decline in export revenues,
industrial production growth has remained positive, retail sales growth has
been robust (Graph V.3) and growth in credit has accelerated. On the other
hand, some research suggests that China’s propensity to import for its own
domestic demand is small. Indeed, China’s imports other than for export
processing fell sharply in the last quarter of 2008, and have shown no
recovery to date.
Looking ahead, considerable uncertainty surrounds the outlook for EMEs.
Consensus forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 are negative for most of the larger
EMEs, with the exception of China and India. Growth is forecast to be positive
in most EMEs only in 2010. However, early signs of recovery are already
apparent in some EMEs, including a pickup in China’s exports to the European
Union and the United States in March 2009 and increases in China’s imports
from Chinese Taipei and Korea in February and March 2009. These increases
in trade reversed declines that had been observed for about half a year, but
whether they indicate a sustained recovery remains unclear. The path of
recovery will also depend on the rate at which international capital flows,
which have played such a large role in supporting growth, recover from the
sharp reversals experienced in 2008.

More difficult external financing
Most emerging market crises of the 1980s and 1990s were associated with
reversals in gross private capital inflows that reflected a loss of confidence in
emerging market policies. Developments in capital flows during the current
crisis are somewhat different. With the notable exception of some CEE
countries, many emerging market economies adopted sound policies before
the crisis and thus were more resilient to reversals in capital flows, at least
initially. But as the crisis progressed, some developments in capital flows
followed a pattern similar to that of past crises. As described below, countries
with larger current account and fiscal deficits, and sectors with significant
foreign exchange exposures on their balance sheets, were more affected by
the tightening of external financing conditions and withdrawals of capital.
During the first half of 2008, gross capital inflows to EMEs held up
remarkably well, in many cases reaching 60–70% of the record high inflows in
2007. Capital inflow reversals were felt for the most part in equity markets,
where prices began to slide after reaching historical peaks in the last quarter
of 2007. The fact that other investors (banks and bondholders) maintained
their positions in EMEs may be attributed to a number of factors cited earlier,
including much larger official foreign exchange reserves and more robust
banking systems in many cases. Better developed local bond markets also
played a role in some countries.
International banks started to withdraw funding from some emerging
markets in the third quarter of 2008. At first, countries with sound and relatively
liquid banking systems were affected. For instance, cross-border loans to
banks and the non-bank sector in China, Chinese Taipei, the Czech Republic,

Exposures in the
corporate sector

Malaysia and Poland decreased by $30 billion in the third quarter. Central
banks and market commentary at the time suggested that some international
banks may have reduced loans to these EMEs in order to overcome severe
liquidity shortages in their home markets.
Disruptions in emerging market finance became more widespread
following the 15 September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the
resulting interruptions in financing in global interbank markets (see Chapter II).
Reversals of portfolio equity inflows accelerated, emerging market currencies
weakened substantially, spreads on international sovereign bonds widened
sharply and domestic bond yields rose in many EMEs (Graph V.5). Among the
first to be affected by the rising cost and reduced availability of external
finance were countries with large current account deficits (eg CEE countries
and South Africa), and those where surpluses decreased due to the slump in
oil and commodity prices (eg Argentina, Russia and Venezuela).
In the EMEs with more robust external positions, the initial impact on
capital flows came via the corporate sector. As exchange rates depreciated
sharply against the major international currencies, corporations that had
borrowed heavily in international debt and credit markets to finance investment
(eg Russian energy companies) encountered difficulties rolling over that debt.
In addition, the turmoil in September 2008 had revealed some types of
vulnerabilities of which the authorities and markets previously seemed to have
been unaware. In particular, many corporations in Brazil, Korea, Mexico and
Poland had entered into derivative contracts with foreign or domestic banks
during 2007 and 2008 to protect export earnings against a sharp appreciation
of local currencies and, in some cases, to speculate on a continuing
appreciation. These positions were typically held off corporate balance sheets.

When local exchange rates fell against the dollar or the euro, the corporations
suffered heavy losses, currently estimated at about 0.8% of GDP in Korea and
more than 1% of GDP in Poland.
In international debt markets, primary issuance froze and secondary
trading of emerging market bonds was greatly reduced in September and
October, even for highly rated corporations and sovereigns with relatively
sound fiscal positions (eg Brazil, Malaysia and South Africa). After net
borrowing of $28 billion during the first three quarters of 2008, the last quarter
saw net repayments by EMEs of $27 billion (Table V.2), as many emerging
market corporate borrowers lost their access to international capital markets.
Net repayments were especially large in Korea, Latin America and oil-exporting
countries (Graph V.6). Syndicated loan issuance in the fourth quarter decreased
by a total of $65 billion compared with the third quarter, with Hong Kong SAR,
Singapore and countries in the Middle East being affected in particular. In
addition, non-resident holdings of local EME currency bonds declined, reflecting
not only increased demand for cash by foreign investors but also their risk
aversion, as local bond markets in many EMEs (including Hungary, Indonesia,
Mexico and Turkey) had become highly volatile.
The reversal in cross-border banking flows also became more severe in the
last quarter of 2008. According to the latest BIS international banking statistics,
banks from advanced economies reduced cross-border loans to developing
countries by $205 billion during the fourth quarter (1% of the combined GDP of
EMEs), reversing more than 60% of the inflows recorded during the previous
three quarters (Table V.2). Brazil, China, Korea, Turkey and oil-exporting
countries, including Russia, were particularly affected (Graph V.7). Loans to
banks declined more sharply than loans to the non-bank sector. At the same
time, residents of many EMEs (especially in central Europe and oil-exporting
countries, including Russia) withdrew part of their deposits and other foreign
assets held in BIS reporting banks. This provided an important cushion to the
emerging markets that had been unavailable in the past. However, some
deposit withdrawals may have reflected official foreign exchange intervention
rather than the autonomous response of emerging market banks to the
reduced availability of cross-border finance.
One question of interest is whether the presence of foreign banks in
EMEs has had any visible impact on banking flows. This question can be
addressed by assessing whether cross-border loans and local currency loans

of foreign bank affiliates in EMEs have been more stable in countries with a
larger foreign bank presence.
Cross-border loans appear to have been temporarily more stable in some
smaller countries with a larger foreign bank presence. In particular, smaller
economies in CEE (the Baltic states and countries in southeastern Europe),
whose banking systems are almost fully foreign-owned, were less affected by
the decline in cross-border loans to banks in the fourth quarter of 2008 than
were the larger CEE economies (the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and
Turkey), where foreign bank ownership is not dominant (with the exception of
the Czech Republic) (Graph V.7, right-hand panel).
The resilience of cross-border loans in smaller CEE countries is surprising
because many of them have sizeable external deficits. However, in February
2009 it became clear that the state of these economies was deteriorating faster
than expected. Many borrowers faced challenges repaying or rolling over their
loans. The loss of investor confidence suddenly exposed long-standing
vulnerabilities, such as the widespread practice of foreign currency borrowing
by households and by small and medium-sized enterprises. Whether parent
banks from western Europe have maintained support for their subsidiaries in
these smaller countries will become clearer after the release of data for the first
quarter of 2009 in early July.
As for local currency loans, whether such loans have been more stable in
countries where foreign-owned banks have a larger presence remains unclear.
Adjusting for exchange rate changes, local currency claims of foreign bank
affiliates have exhibited resilience in a number of EMEs; for example, in the
fourth quarter of 2008 these claims increased in Brazil, China, Poland and
Turkey, and remained stable in smaller CEE economies with a large foreign
bank presence. However, they decreased in some other countries (eg Korea
and South Africa).

Graph V.7

Another question of interest is whether countries with more developed
local bond markets have fared better in the face of capital outflows. EMEs had
in recent years sought to reduce their vulnerability to capital inflow reversals by
increasing issuance in domestic debt markets. However, the crisis appears to
have prompted investors (particularly foreign ones) to attempt to withdraw from
local bond markets in EMEs and switch to more liquid foreign currency assets.
These attempts affected local bond markets in Hungary, Indonesia, Mexico and
Turkey, among others, and exacerbated depreciation pressures in many cases,
given the severe impairment of the operation of international currency swap
markets at the time (Graph II.4, centre panel). For example, in Hungary there
were no bidders at government bond auctions in mid-October. Non-resident
holdings of local currency bonds declined as well, reflecting increased demand
for foreign currency by foreign investors. At the same time, international banks
were not prepared to swap euros for forints, triggering a sharp depreciation
with contagion effects throughout CEE (eg the Czech koruna fell by 9% against
the euro during the fourth quarter despite much sounder fundamentals).
In late 2008 and early 2009, the severe contraction in external demand
compounded the negative effects of the global financial crisis on emerging
market capital flows. The effects were especially evident in the case of trade
finance. In Latin America, for instance, leading international banks were
reportedly renewing just 50–60% of the previous year’s trade credit lines in the
first quarter of 2009. A major part of this decrease reflected lower trade volumes
and commodity prices. But the decrease was also due to the drying-up of the
secondary market for trade finance and reduced credit lines from banks
specialising in the provision of such finance. Although it has also affected
some Asian exporting economies, the lack of trade credit may be most serious
for African nations because of their underdeveloped financial systems and the
inability of governments to increase the supply of such credit.

FDI less affected so
far …

… but the outlook
is highly uncertain

The behaviour of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, which have been
more stable than other capital flows in previous crises, also raises concerns.
Gross FDI inflows held up fairly well in 2008 compared with 2006–07,
especially in emerging Asia and Latin America (Graph V.8). However, recent
reports indicate that FDI inflows were lower in a number of countries in early
2009. One reason is that roughly one third of recent FDI inflows were related
to mergers and acquisitions, which are typically financed by international bank
loans. Significantly lower issuance of syndicated loans in the fourth quarter of
2008 and the first quarter of 2009 provides some support for this view. In
addition, profit remittances from some EMEs increased sharply, as many
multinational enterprises, in the same way as international banks, needed
liquid funds in their home markets. According to the OECD Development
Centre, reinvested earnings and intracompany loans are also being sharply
curtailed as companies repatriate financial resources to their parents.
Since the current crisis is associated with an unprecedented contraction
in global economic activity, it is extremely uncertain when and how far private
capital inflows to emerging markets might recover. Equity markets have
rebounded strongly since March 2009. In addition, international bond issuance
resumed in the first quarter of 2009 (Table V.2), but only for high-grade
sovereigns and top-rated corporates, and even then at much higher premia
than in early 2008. Furthermore, because the crisis originated in the financial
systems of advanced economies, the standard remedy in the past – reforming
policies in emerging market economies – is not likely to restart the flow of
capital to EMEs on its own. Moreover, it is not clear how global current
account imbalances – which were an important factor in the surge of capital
flows to and from emerging markets in the period before the crisis – will
eventually be resolved.

Factors supporting economic activity
Apart from the scope for countercyclical policies discussed in Chapter VI, two
factors will influence the extent to which activity in EMEs can be maintained in
the face of declining exports and capital inflow reversals. One is the degree of
success in stabilising foreign exchange markets and maintaining the flow of
foreign currency financing, through the provision of foreign currency liquidity
by authorities. The other is the stability and lending capacity of the domestic
banking system, which are related to the financial condition of banks and recent
measures to support the financial sector.

Provision of foreign currency liquidity
As noted earlier, an important feature of the current crisis is that many
sovereigns had reduced or stabilised their external debt in the pre-crisis
period, but private external debt had remained high or increased. As capital
inflows reversed, central banks took steps to ensure the availability of foreign
currency so that the private sector could meet its payment obligations. They
intervened in foreign exchange markets to stabilise them and dampen
exchange rate volatility. They also used their foreign reserves to smooth the
flow of external financing to the private sector, seeking in particular to reduce
rollover risks and cover shortfalls in trade financing by providing funding or
guarantees.
While conditions in EME foreign exchange and funding markets appear to
have stabilised relative to the period of extreme financial stress around October
and November 2008, markets remain comparatively unsettled, and there has
been no full recovery (Graph V.5).
One concern is that intervention in foreign exchange markets has in some
cases entailed a very large depletion of foreign reserves. For example, in the
first quarter of 2009, foreign reserves were at 80% of their June 2008 levels in
Korea and India, around 75% in Poland and 65% in Russia. Given the possibility
that external shocks could persist, such depletions raise questions about
reserve adequacy, although conventional indicators suggest that reserve
holdings are still ample. In spite of significant interventions in the fourth
quarter of 2008, many EMEs still had larger foreign reserves at the end of 2008
than they did in 2007 (Table V.3). Furthermore, a well known rule of thumb (the
so-called Guidotti-Greenspan rule) is that foreign reserves should cover 100%
of external debt coming due within one year. In 2008, almost all EMEs far
exceeded this threshold – coverage was more than 400% in Asia and Russia
and around 300% in Latin America. Another rule of thumb, that foreign
reserves should cover three to six months of imports (ie 25–50% of annual
imports) was also typically exceeded at the end of 2008. These figures suggest
that many EME central banks could meet the foreign currency financing
requirements of the private sector for well over one year. However, a severe
economic downturn and a delayed recovery in capital inflows could produce
future episodes of market instability that could lead to a much faster draining
of reserves than suggested by these indicators. Under these conditions, the
withdrawal of financing to EMEs could severely impair the pace of economic
recovery.

Alternatives to
foreign reserves

Table V.3

A further consideration is that foreign reserve adequacy also depends on
other characteristics of the economy not captured by conventional indicators.
For example, Chile’s foreign reserve holdings have been comparatively low
relative to its short-term external debt and its export revenues have fallen
sharply; however, its foreign reserves have been remarkably stable and the
Chilean peso rebounded earlier than other Latin American currencies. One
reason is that the government (through its sovereign wealth fund) and
households (through pension funds) have large holdings of foreign assets. In
spite of lower returns on international investments that may have temporarily
influenced the exchange rate, the robustness of the financial and corporate
sectors has on balance helped to limit calls on these foreign reserves. By the
same token, countries with much larger foreign reserve holdings but less
robust financial systems might be less resilient.
In this setting, an important issue is how much EMEs might rely on external
resources or reserve pooling arrangements rather than costly foreign reserve
holdings to improve resilience. The crisis has led to three unprecedented
measures that could eventually reduce the need for large foreign reserve
holdings. First, in October 2008 four EME central banks each entered into a
$30 billion reciprocal currency arrangement with the US Federal Reserve.
Second, a $120 billion multilateral facility, drawing on international reserves,
was recently established in East Asia. This significantly extends the scope of

BIS 79th Annual Report

87

existing bilateral currency swap facilities set up under the so-called Chiang
Mai initiative. Third, recent G20 initiatives have called for large increases in
resources for international financial institutions, supporting steps taken by
these institutions to enhance the scope and effectiveness of their crisis-related
operations. An important development in this context is the decision of some
EMEs (Colombia, Mexico and Poland) to seek access to the IMF’s recently
created Flexible Credit Line, which targets countries with sound macroeconomic
fundamentals.

Resilience of banking systems and credit
The sharp reversal in cross-border bank financing cited earlier (Graph V.7) has
affected both the non-bank and banking sectors in EMEs. Corporate borrowers
facing reduced access to external funding have sought to borrow in the
domestic market instead. One indicator of how much domestic credit would
have to rise if all external borrowing shifted to domestic banks is the ratio of
non-bank external borrowing to bank domestic credit. Data for the third quarter
of 2008, before cross-border bank flows fell sharply, show that this ratio was
around 45% in Mexico and Turkey, and about 30% in central Europe, the Baltic
states and southeastern Europe.
Meeting this increased demand for credit could help support continued
economic activity. But domestic banks’ ability to do so may be limited, in
particular, by reductions in their own access to external financing. The extent of
vulnerability varies considerably across countries: the ratio of loans to deposits
is above unity (indicating a possible reliance on external financing) in Hungary,
Korea and Russia, countries that have experienced significant pressure in
foreign exchange markets, but also in Colombia and South Africa, where such
pressures have been much lower. Another indicator of reliance on external
financing – the share of foreign liabilities in the total liabilities of the banking
system – has ranged from about 15 to 30% in Hungary, Korea, Poland, Russia
and South Africa.
However, in spite of sharp declines in cross-border bank lending to nonbanks and banks in the fourth quarter of 2008, credit growth, while slowing,
remained in double digits (over year-earlier levels) in many EMEs well into the
first quarter of 2009. Indeed, in a number of EMEs, domestic bank credit has
remained stable or been on an upward trend (Graph V.9).
One factor that may have supported domestic credit growth is the strength
of EME banking systems, which has improved considerably in the course of
this decade. Profitability (as measured by the median2 return on assets across
countries for a group of 23 larger EMEs) rose from less than 1% at the
beginning of the decade to 1.5% in 2007. By 2007, the larger EMEs typically
had regulatory capital ratios well in excess of the minimum Basel threshold of
8%, with median ratios of around 13%. In some countries (eg Brazil, Indonesia,
Turkey) regulatory capital ratios were around 19%. Median non-performing loan
The median is more suitable as a measure of the central tendency if we want to know whether a
representative (50%) share of the sample of countries has performed better over time. In contrast, a
simple average would give more weight to unusually good or unusually poor performance, even if it
applies only to a very few countries and is therefore not representative.

(NPL) ratios declined from around 10% at the beginning of the decade to less
than 3% in 2007. However, these tend to be lagging indicators. An alternative
indicator, Moody’s Financial Strength Index, which rates banks according to
their standalone (ie excluding external support) capacity, also shows significant
improvement, although strength ratings tend to be low. Excluding two financial
centres with relatively high strength ratings (Hong Kong SAR and Singapore),
the median rating rose from 26 (out of a possible 100) in December 1998 to 34
in January 2008 and then fell to 33 by April 2009.
Another factor that may have supported credit growth is the move by EME
authorities to provide domestic liquidity and to furnish support to domestic
banking systems. As discussed further in Chapter VI, these measures have
included provision of central bank liquidity through monetary operations, lower
policy rates and reserve requirements. Deposit guarantees, support to banks
(including, in some cases, bank recapitalisation), measures to stabilise money
and capital markets, and steps to ensure financing to priority borrowers such
as small and medium-sized enterprises have also contributed to lowering the
cost of financing and maintaining the flow of bank credit in EMEs.
However, there is a significant risk that this resilience will be temporary and
domestic credit will decline sharply. One concern is that, as we know from past
experience, the severity of the ongoing economic slowdown could worsen
banks’ balance sheets by sharply raising NPLs, even though a large increase
is not currently forecast.

Conclusions
Two concerns arising from the global economic crisis may be highlighted. First,
there is a significant risk that economic recovery in EMEs will be delayed. In
particular, there is a risk of a destabilising negative feedback loop: the severity

BIS 79th Annual Report

89

of the downturn could deter a recovery in capital flows to EMEs, which could
in turn further impair growth. Economic recovery is also likely to require a
rebound in trade with reduced global imbalances; but bringing about the
needed adjustments in both EMEs and advanced economies could take time.
In this setting, domestic credit, whose resilience has supported economic
activity, could decline sharply given the depth of the economic downturn.
Second, in response to a sharp reversal in capital inflows, EMEs have
relied on foreign exchange market intervention and other measures to provide
foreign currency liquidity. This has helped stabilise economic activity by
ensuring the continued functioning of foreign exchange markets and
smoothing the flow of financing to EMEs. Looking ahead, an important
question is whether available EME foreign reserves and new initiatives that
have considerably enhanced the availability of foreign currency resources (eg
bilateral foreign currency swaps involving EME central banks, reserve pooling
arrangements and recent large increases in official financing for EMEs) will help
bring about an early recovery in capital flows to EMEs. Over the medium term,
these new initiatives could also help EMEs reduce their reliance on reserve
accumulation, which in turn could contribute to reduced global imbalances.

VI. Policy responses to the crisis

The intensification of the global financial crisis during the third stage in
September–October 2008 and the subsequent sharp downturn of the world
economy in the fourth stage (see Table I.1 for an overview of the stages of the
crisis) led to an unprecedented response by policymakers. Central banks
around the world cut policy rates aggressively, in many cases to levels near
zero (Graph VI.1, top panel). Normally, this would have provided a massive
stimulus to economic activity, but the dysfunctional state of the financial
system severely blunted the impact of lower interest rates. Major central
banks therefore took additional measures. At the same time, a first wave
of bank rescue packages unveiled in the last quarter of 2008 turned out to
be insufficient to stabilise the financial system. Governments were thus

subsequently forced to modify their terms and expand their scope. Towards
the end of 2008, it became increasingly clear that neither monetary policy nor
rescue packages were sufficient to prevent a sharp contraction of the real
economy. Governments responded by introducing sizeable fiscal stimulus to
support aggregate demand (Graph VI.1, bottom panel).
The exceptional deterioration in the outlook for the economy in late 2008
and early 2009 clearly called for extraordinary policy actions, which are
discussed in some detail in the next three sections of this chapter. At this
writing, the ability of those plans to generate a sustained recovery is an open
question. The major reasons for doubt, discussed in the final section, are
limited progress in addressing the underlying problems of the financial sector
and the risks associated with the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies
put into place during the period under review.

Monetary policy
In the middle of 2008, amidst the financial turmoil, central banks faced the twin
problems of slowing output growth and persistently high inflation. The extent
and timing of the slowdown differed across countries. Economic growth in the
major advanced economies had been relatively strong in early 2008, but turned
negative towards mid-year (see Chapter IV). Emerging market economies
continued to experience solid growth, but the export-oriented economies of
East Asia and central Europe showed signs of slowing before the crisis of
confidence in September and October (see Chapter V). Inflation rates were well
above (implicit or explicit) targets almost everywhere, owing to sharp rises in
food and energy prices during the first half of 2008.
Finding the appropriate monetary policy response in this environment
proved challenging. With the benefit of hindsight, one can see that
policymakers underappreciated the extent of the slowdown in mid-2008 and
the strength of the associated disinflationary forces. Although slowing growth
would at some point create the slack necessary to stabilise prices, few central
banks expected inflation to fall before late 2009. In the meantime, there was a
real danger that persistently high inflation might feed into permanently higher
inflation expectations, which in turn could result in a higher pass-through
from commodity prices to other prices and wages. As a consequence, central
banks in both advanced and emerging market economies either held rates
constant or raised them.
The 15 September bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, followed by weeks of
extreme pressure in the credit markets, escalating threats to the stability of
major financial institutions and an accelerating pullback in economic activity,
marked a turning point for the world economy and for monetary policy. On
8 October, when they simultaneously announced cuts in their policy rates, six
major central banks undertook the first ever round of coordinated rate action.
Other central banks around the world also began rapidly cutting rates
(Graph VI.1, top panel, and Graph VI.2). The worldwide declines in output and
inflation in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009 far exceeded those
implied by the downside risks to growth identified only a few months before.

Graph VI.2

By the end of May 2009, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England, the Bank of Canada, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank
had brought policy rates close to zero. The European Central Bank lowered its
main policy rate by 3¼ percentage points between September 2008 and May
2009, but stopped well before it reached the zero lower bound. However, the
ample supply of central bank balances from late 2008 onwards pushed
overnight rates close to the rate on the ECB’s deposit facility, and thus almost
to zero. Central banks in many emerging market economies also reduced
interest rates, albeit from a much higher level.
Not all central banks had room to lower policy rates. A run on the currency
forced the central banks of Hungary, Iceland and Russia to tighten policy
in late 2008 despite declining inflation and slowing real activity, although
they started to reduce policy rates gradually over the course of the following
months.
Notwithstanding the rapid and sizeable easing in policy rates after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the limitations of interest rate policy became
more apparent in many countries. Financial market tensions and the rise in
credit and liquidity risk premia (see Chapter II) impaired the transmission
mechanism. For example, yields on corporate bonds increased despite sharp
declines in policy rates. Banks generally passed reductions in their funding
costs on to their customers, but they tightened credit standards significantly,
offsetting the impact of cuts in the policy rate on overall financial conditions
(see Chapter IV).
As policy rates in many countries reached historically low levels, the zero
lower bound became a binding constraint, making it impossible to follow
policy rules that called for negative nominal interest rates in many advanced
economies in view of widening output gaps and falling inflation rates.
Moreover, a number of considerations led central banks to stop easing once

policy rates reached a level slightly above zero. Given that bank deposit rates
are generally below money market rates, the former may reach zero even if
the latter are still positive. When that happens, any further reduction in market
rates may not be passed on to households and firms, as banks need to
maintain a margin between deposit and lending rates to remain profitable.
Similarly, money market mutual funds may become unprofitable once rates
fall to a certain level.

Broadening the scope of policy
In this context, many central banks took additional steps to improve the
functioning of credit markets and to ease financial conditions. Given the
unprecedented breadth of actions in many countries, it is useful to outline a
framework for reviewing the various facets of central banks’ responses.
Nowadays, central banks generally conduct monetary policy through
targets on very short-term interest rates. This approach comprises two core
elements: signalling the desired policy stance through the announcement of
a key interest rate (the policy rate);1 and liquidity management operations,
defined broadly to encompass various aspects of the operating framework –
including the maturity, pricing and collateral requirements for central bank
liquidity – that supports the desired stance by keeping the relevant market rate
consistent with the policy rate. Typically, liquidity management operations are
designed and implemented carefully to ensure that they influence only the
specific market rate targeted by policy. As such, they play a supportive role,
neither impinging upon nor containing any information relevant to the stance
of policy.
Liquidity management operations, however, can also be used deliberately
to influence specific elements of the monetary transmission mechanism, such
as certain asset prices, yields and funding conditions over and above the
impact of the policy rate. In this case, liquidity operations no longer simply play
a passive role but become an integral part of the overall monetary policy
stance. Such operations generally result in substantial changes in central
banks’ balance sheets – in terms of size, composition and risk profile. They
will henceforth be referred to as balance sheet policy.
The various forms of balance sheet policy can be distinguished by the
particular market that is targeted. The most common, familiar form is sterilised
foreign exchange intervention. Here, purchases or sales of foreign currency
seek to influence the level of the exchange rate separately from the policy rate
that defines the official policy stance. In the current crisis, balance sheet policy
has also been employed to target term money market rates, long-term
government bond yields and various risk spreads. While the justification,
underlying mechanics, channels of influence and balance sheet implications
are analogous to the case of foreign exchange intervention, the choice of
market is atypical and in some cases unprecedented. It is the choice of market
that renders recent central bank actions “unconventional”, not the overall
The policy rate can take the form of a rate actually set by the central bank in its operations, such as
the ECB’s minimum bid rate, or may be simply an announced target for a market rate, such as the
Federal Reserve’s target federal funds rate.

approach of seeking to influence specific elements of the transmission
mechanism over and above the policy rate.
An important feature of balance sheet policy is that it can be implemented
regardless of the prevailing interest rate level. Foreign exchange interventions,
for example, are routinely carried out in this manner. As long as central banks
possess the capacity to carry out offsetting operations on reserve balances,
neither expanding asset holdings nor altering their composition will necessarily
impinge on central banks’ ability to maintain their policy rates close to target.
Indeed, many Asian central banks that intervened actively in foreign exchange
markets in recent years have been able to attain their official interest rate
targets despite sizeable expansions of their balance sheets.
In principle, the effects of balance sheet policy may be transmitted
through two main channels. The first is a signalling effect, analogous to that
used to attain short-term interest rate targets. In this case, operations
undertaken by the central bank, or their communication, influence public
expectations about key factors that underpin an asset’s market valuation.
Those factors include expectations regarding the future course of policy,
inflation, relative scarcities of different assets or their risk and liquidity
profiles. For example, the announcement that the central bank is prepared to
engage in operations involving illiquid assets may in itself boost investor
confidence in those assets, thereby reducing liquidity premia and stimulating
trading activity. The signalling effect can be quite powerful, as illustrated by
the sharp drop in long-term government bond yields and exchange rates in
the United States and the United Kingdom following announcements by the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of England of plans for outright purchases of
the respective government bonds (Graph VI.3, left-hand panel; see Chapter II
for further examples).

The second channel – a broader version of the standard portfolio balance
effect – works through the impact of central bank operations on the
composition of private sector portfolios. When assets are imperfect substitutes
for one another, changes in relative asset supplies brought about through
central bank operations materially alter the composition of portfolios. To
compensate, relative asset yields typically need to change, and such changes
may in turn influence the real economy. To the extent that this process leads to
stronger balance sheets, greater collateral values and higher net worth, it may
help loosen credit constraints, lower external finance premia and hence revive
private sector intermediation. For example, when risky private securities are
purchased from banks in exchange for risk-free claims on the public sector,
the resultant improvement in the overall risk profile of bank balance sheets
may enhance both the willingness and the ability of banks to lend.
A clear illustration of the portfolio balance effect in the current episode
is the impact of the Federal Reserve’s Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)
on repo financing spreads between Treasury and non-Treasury collateral – a
gauge of the relative scarcity of the two types of collateral. The effectiveness
of such securities lending operations comes directly from their impact on the
relative supplies of collateral in the market. As such, the observation that repo
financing spreads declined only after the TSLF was implemented – and not
when it was announced – demonstrates the influence of the portfolio balance
effect that is clearly distinct from the signalling effect (Graph VI.3, right-hand
panel).
There is ongoing debate as to whether the particular structure of central
bank liabilities matters for the effectiveness of balance sheet policy. For
example, the focal point of quantitative easing – as used to describe operations
by the Bank of Japan during 2001–06 – is the expansion of bank reserves,
which are on the liabilities side. Credit easing operations by the Federal
Reserve in the current episode, on the other hand, concentrate squarely on
the asset composition of the central bank’s balance sheet and the influence
that this has on private sector credit conditions. From the perspective of
quantitative easing, bank reserves are special either in their ability to act as a
catalyst for bank lending or because they contribute to market stability and
confidence. Credit easing, on the other hand, does not attach particular
significance to bank reserves, implicitly treating the various forms of central
bank liabilities as very close substitutes, not only for one another but also for
certain kinds of government debt. From this perspective, the manner in which
balance sheet policy is funded – be it by issuing central bank bills, issuing
short-term treasury bills and depositing the proceeds at the central bank, or
simply increasing bank reserves (which may be interest bearing) – is of
secondary importance as far as effectiveness is concerned. Clearly, policy
communication also differs significantly between the two approaches.

The third consists of responses aimed at supporting specific credit markets –
particularly the non-bank segments – and easing financial conditions more
broadly. The last two categories, insofar as they involve operations directed at
particular segments of the transmission mechanism over and above the

With respect to the first category, the implementation of interest rate
targets largely involved accommodating the greater instability in the demand
for reserves through a more flexible supply, in terms of both size and
frequency. To help anchor short-term rates to the policy target, the Bank of
England and the Federal Reserve also reduced the width of the effective
corridor on overnight rates by changing the rates applied on end-of-day
standing facilities. At the same time, central banks had to expand their
capacity to reabsorb excess reserves to neutralise the impact on overnight
interest rates of the much expanded operations. As reflected in the
composition of central bank liabilities, this was implemented in a number of
ways (Graph VI.4). The Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank began

Box VI.A: Policy coordination by central banks during the crisis
Information sharing with other monetary authorities is part of the daily routine of central bankers. They
share many aspects of their policy frameworks and economic thinking with each other and thus are likely
to adopt similar measures when facing common challenges, but explicit coordination among central
banks is unusual. And while coordinated intervention to limit exchange rate movements was not
infrequent in the past, it has become rare – at least among central banks in industrial economies.
During the current financial crisis, however, central banks have coordinated actions to an
unprecedented extent. This box investigates some of the reasons why coordination was a preferred
policy option.

Coordinated actions during the crisis: liquidity and interest rates
The closest coordination has been seen in efforts to address foreign currency funding shortages in
interbank markets, especially for US dollars. The strains in the US dollar money markets during the
crisis rendered it very difficult for non-US banks to obtain US dollar funding, as reflected in dislocations
in the foreign exchange swap markets and increased Libor-OIS spreads (see Chapters II and III). In
response, the Federal Reserve established swap lines with central banks in Europe to alleviate the US
dollar shortage there. After the Lehman failure, it became clear that the growing shortage in US dollar
funding needed to be addressed in all major markets simultaneously; the swap lines were subsequently
expanded in both scale and geographical scope (Table VI.A). Similar arrangements were later put in
place to address the euro and Swiss franc shortage in Europe; existing swap lines were also drawn upon
to address the yen shortage in Asia.
Interest rate policies are usually not coordinated, but on 8 October 2008 a number of central banks
in the industrial economies took the unprecedented step of jointly announcing interest rate cuts.

Why did coordination take place?
The provision of foreign exchange through swap lines had advantages on both sides. For instance,
addressing the US dollar shortage of foreign banks helped the Federal Reserve to enhance its control
over the rates paid for US dollar funding in money markets and reduced the risk of “fire sales” of dollardenominated assets by foreign institutions. Admittedly, in its domestic operations the Federal Reserve
was already providing US dollar liquidity to US affiliates of non-US banks through various programmes.
However, extending direct liquidity distribution to foreign banks across more time zones and institutions
would have involved the challenges of setting up additional lending arrangements, including modifying
requirements for collateral or assessing the credit risk of these counterparties. By contrast, through swap
lines with other central banks, the Federal Reserve could use the existing infrastructure of lending by the
foreign central bank to its domestic financial institutions, including settlement arrangements and
monitoring of counterparties and eligible collateral. Lending via the foreign central bank also helped to
align liquidity support operations with the foreign central banks’ supervisory responsibilities.
For the foreign central bank, the shortages of foreign currency funding for its domestic counterparties
posed a potential threat to the stability of the economy’s financial system. The central bank could have
mobilised existing foreign exchange reserves or used foreign exchange borrowed from the market. But
those strategies are unattractive in a crisis if foreign exchange reserves are limited or foreign exchange
markets are impaired – hence the attraction of accessing a swap line with another central bank.
Finally, policymakers may want to be seen to be cooperating during a global crisis, thereby
increasing confidence. Indeed, this is the most compelling explanation for the coordinated interest rate
cuts in October 2008.

Did it work?
Many market participants reported that the extended swap facilities improved term funding conditions.
Indeed, actual usage peaked in late October and gradually declined thereafter, with some central banks
never actually having drawn on the swap lines. Foreign exchange swap market deviations declined in
particular in EUR/USD and CHF/USD, and overall Libor-OIS spreads narrowed. While many other policy
actions were taken at the same time, it seems fair to say that some of this improvement was due to the
introduction of central bank swap lines.
 The details of central bank swap lines during the crisis are discussed in C Ho and F-L Michaud, “Central bank measures to
alleviate foreign currency funding shortages”, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2008, pp 14 –15.  See N Baba and F Packer,
“From turmoil to crisis: dislocations in the FX swap market before and after the failure of Lehman Brothers”, paper presented
at the conference The global financial crisis: causes, threats and opportunities, Warwick, 6 April 2009.

to issue central bank bills; the ECB and the Reserve Bank of Australia relied
increasingly on accepting interest bearing deposits; and the Federal Reserve
took in greater amounts of deposits from the Treasury and started to pay
interest on reserves.
The second group of measures, prominent during the first two crisis
stages, centred on reducing term interbank market spreads, seen as an
indicator of tensions in that key market segment. This was tackled both directly,
by providing more term funding so as to offset some of the shortfall in market
supply, and indirectly, by addressing impediments to the smooth distribution of
reserves in the system and ensuring access to funding from the central bank.
To this end, conditions for the provision of reserves were eased by relaxing
eligible collateral and counterparty coverage, lengthening the maturity of
refinancing operations, and establishing inter-central bank swap lines to
alleviate mostly dollar funding pressures in offshore markets (as well as offshore
funding pressures in a few other currencies; see Box VI.A and Chapter II). The
use of the swap lines was a significant driver of balance sheet expansions for

major central banks during this period (Graph VI.4).2 In addition, many central
banks introduced or eased conditions for lending out highly liquid securities –
typically sovereign bonds – against less liquid market securities in order to
improve funding conditions in the money market.
The third category of policy responses, which received more emphasis as
the turmoil in financial markets deepened (stages three to five of the crisis),
focused on directly alleviating tightening credit conditions in the non-bank
sector and easing broader financial conditions. Prominent measures included
the provision of funds to non-banks to improve liquidity and reduce risk spreads
in specific markets – such as commercial paper, asset-backed securities and
corporate bonds – as well as the direct purchase of public sector securities to
influence benchmark yields more generally. In a notable step, the Swiss
National Bank intervened in the foreign exchange market to contain upward
pressure on the Swiss franc as part of its efforts to reduce deflationary risks
and loosen monetary conditions more generally.
As a by-product of these actions, central bank balance sheets expanded
substantially and their composition changed significantly (Graph VI.4). An
important difference across countries is the relative emphasis given to private
versus public sector securities and bank versus non-bank markets. The Federal
Reserve focused heavily on non-bank credit markets as well as on operations
involving private sector securities, as exemplified by measures such as the
Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility (part of “Lending” in Graph VI.4, top left-hand panel). The Bank
of England, on the other hand, initially concentrated its Asset Purchase
Facility primarily on purchases of government bonds (part of “Other assets”
in Graph VI.4, bottom left-hand panel), while the ECB emphasised banking
system liquidity by conducting fixed rate full-allotment refinancing operations
with maturities of up to 12 months (part of “Lending” in Graph VI.4, top
right-hand panel) and by purchasing covered bonds. In the case of the Bank
of Japan, substantial efforts were directed at improving funding conditions for
firms through various measures pertaining to commercial paper and corporate
bonds. The varying emphasis reflects, in part, differences in financial structures.
More direct intervention in non-bank credit markets in the United States, for
example, is consistent with that country’s predominantly market-based
system, while the greater focus accorded in the euro area to supporting banks
reflects a larger reliance on bank-based intermediation in the region.
Greater reliance on balance sheet policy has entailed an increasingly
pervasive role for central banks in the intermediation process and a more
significant influence on the relative supplies of claims on the public sector.
This heightens the need for close cooperation with the fiscal authority for
two key reasons. First, large purchases of government securities and the
accompanying rapid expansion of central bank liabilities affect the overall
profile of public sector debt. Their effect could potentially be undermined by
debt management operations, not least given their typically larger size, unless
Amounts drawn under the swap lines appear on the assets side of the central banks’ balance sheets,
and on the liabilities side as domestic currency liabilities to foreign central banks (as long as the foreign
central bank does not make use of the foreign currency obtained through the swap).

the objectives of the two types of operations are consistent. Second, central
banks are taking on greater credit and market risk, as evidenced by the higher
proportion of private sector securities in the collateral accepted in monetary
operations (Graph VI.5). As a result, close coordination between the central
bank and the government is necessary to put in place mechanisms to ensure
that potential losses do not impair the operational independence of central
banks.

Repairing the financial system
Central bank actions addressed banks’ immediate funding needs through the
first two stages of the crisis, but the severe market dislocation following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September called into question the solvency
of a number of systemically important financial institutions (see Chapters II
and III for details). Given their importance to the functioning of the real
economy, governments took action to prevent their collapse and to restore
confidence in the financial system. Government support was ultimately

designed to restart the flow of credit to households and businesses and to
maintain growth in the real economy.
The policy response did succeed in averting the collapse of the financial
system and in calming the markets. It was less successful, however, in
convincingly addressing the impaired assets on banks’ balance sheets. That
problem could delay the adjustments required to ensure that the financial
system can operate efficiently on a sustainable basis and may have exposed
taxpayers to potentially larger losses. By May 2009, doubts about the long-term
health of major global banks remained, with uncertainty about the potential
losses from loan books and other credit exposures making it difficult for banks
to raise private capital.
This section describes the main characteristics of the government rescue
packages and the market reaction to them. It then assesses the government
response in the light of the lessons from the 1990s Nordic crises (see
Box VI.B) and concludes with some longer-term concerns raised by the policy
interventions.

Ad hoc actions in late September to rescue specific banks were followed in
October by announcements of comprehensive rescue packages by governments
of most leading economies. The announcements were accompanied by
statements that no systemically important institution would be allowed to fail.
Rescue packages consisted of actions targeting the liquidity and solvency
of specific institutions and the functioning of financial markets (Table VI.2).
Whereas central banks had provided short-term funding to eligible institutions
during the earlier stages of the crisis, governments facilitated access to
more permanent sources of funding from stage three onwards by providing
deposit and debt guarantees. Governments addressed solvency concerns by
recapitalising the banks. In an effort to address impaired assets, governments
either purchased assets or provided insurance against unusually large losses
on specified portfolios of key institutions. As a last resort, governments

Box VI.B: Resolving the financial crisis: a message from the Nordic countries
The way that Finland, Norway and Sweden dealt with their banking crises in the late 1980s and early 1990s
is widely regarded as “best practice”. A comparison of that episode with the current crisis suggests that
while the underlying nature of the problems is quite similar, differences in their manifestation have deeply
influenced the timing and shape of policy interventions. This box highlights two basic principles for the
resolution of banking crises that emerged from the Nordic events and considers how differences in
circumstances have influenced to what extent they have been followed.
The main objective of crisis management and resolution is to minimise the costs of financial distress
in terms of lost output. There is now a broad consensus around two basic principles that are seen as best
practice for crisis resolution. First, the nature and size of the banking problems should be recognised early
and intervention should follow quickly. The aim is to avoid a hidden deterioration in underlying asset
quality, which could magnify the costs of the resolution. Second, intervention should be in-depth and
broad-ranging – that is, after taking the measures needed to stabilise the situation, the authorities should
ensure that losses are booked, bad assets are disposed of, the system is recapitalised and any excess
capacity is removed. By cleaning up the balance sheets and encouraging adjustment, these policies
should restore the ability of the financial system to operate effectively and underpin its long-term
profitability, thereby setting the basis for a self-sustained economic recovery.
The specific measures will vary depending on circumstances. Inevitably, they will require the political
will to commit public money and the means to exert sufficient control over financial intermediaries through
either strict conditionality or public ownership. Those conditions hold management and shareholders
responsible, avoid giving supported institutions an unfair competitive advantage, limit the risk of “gambling
for resurrection” and contain the costs to the taxpayers. The incentives of incumbent management and
shareholders will be to delay recognition and to hold out for the most advantageous terms.
The Nordic crises and today’s crisis resemble one another in a fundamental respect: they can be
regarded as the result of the reversal of an outsize credit and asset price (“financial”) cycle (Graph VI.B).
The crises were preceded by an unusually rapid and prolonged increase in the ratio of private sector credit
to GDP alongside equally sharp increases in asset prices, especially real estate prices. Indeed, recent work
has found that real-time leading indicators based on credit and asset price booms help predict these
banking crises well ahead of time.
Although their underlying conditions are similar, the two episodes differ strikingly in the timing of the
first systemic events and policy interventions within the financial cycle (Graph VI.B). In the Nordic crises,
comprehensive interventions came well after property prices had begun falling. In the current episode, in
contrast, the crisis erupted earlier in the down leg of the financial cycle, as illustrated by the experience
of the United States and the United Kingdom. Similarly, Nordic banks were closer to book insolvency; in
fact, the authorities’ intervention was designed partly to raise capital above Basel I minima. In the current
crisis, most institutions had capital well above those minima. As a result, in terms of the timeliness of the
intervention – the first principle above – the management of the current crisis compares favourably with
the Nordic experience.
Arguably, a key reason for the difference in timing reflects accounting practices. The current crisis
started as a mark to market crisis: losses were first incurred on securitised claims recorded on a fair value
accounting basis; indeed, a large proportion of the losses have been of that kind (Table III.2). The losses in
the Nordic crises were recorded on a historical (accrual) accounting basis, following the impairment of
loans. Mark to market accounting recognises losses much earlier than accrual accounting: it does not
require a clear credit event to trigger recognition. As soon as market participants anticipate a future default,
the price of the security falls. Moreover, its decline is typically amplified by rising risk aversion and may be
compounded by distressed sales.
Paradoxically, the earlier recognition of losses and timelier intervention have actually complicated
crisis management with respect to the second principle of best practice: they have made it harder for
policymakers to exert the degree of control necessary to clean up balance sheets. For the most part,
marked to market losses have wounded institutions but have not made them objectively insolvent (see
Chapters III and VI). This has narrowed the options available to the authorities. For example, it is more
difficult to apply strict conditions or enforce writedowns in such circumstances, and the risk of infringing
the property rights of shareholders is higher. More importantly, the funding disruptions caused by marked

to market losses may have clouded the interpretation of the underlying problems. For a considerable time,
what was fundamentally a looming solvency crisis tended to be regarded as a pure liquidity crisis (see
Chapter II). It was widely believed that the sharp asset price declines would be temporary and that market
functioning and effective intermediation could be restored through central bank liquidity support.
However, if the credit cycle follows a pattern similar to previous ones associated with severe banking
distress, an overt deterioration in loan books will follow the marked to market losses.
In the interim, there is a risk that the authorities’ efforts could focus too much on sustaining credit,
asset prices and aggregate demand rather than on encouraging the necessary adjustment in bank balance
sheets. The Nordic resolutions required full recognition of losses, the writedown of equity, and a
contraction in the balance sheets and branch networks of those banks receiving targeted support. Strict
conditionality and public ownership were used to that end. The only exception was a general capital
injection in Finland, which was designed partly to restore fair competitive conditions between the
resolved institutions and others as well as to support lending capacity. By contrast, the conditions
attached to recent packages have generally not sought to encourage adjustment and have even involved
increased lending targets to support domestic credit. The risk is that the basis for a self-sustained
recovery could be delayed.

nationalised insolvent financial institutions to protect depositors and avoid
contagion, or they acquired majority equity stakes.
By offering greater protection to depositors and bank creditors through
guarantees, governments protected key sources of bank financing and
facilitated the refinancing of maturing debt (Table VI.2). More than 20 countries
introduced or increased guarantees on retail and commercial deposits,
reducing the likelihood of bank runs. Government debt guarantees allowed
eligible banks to issue new bonds backed by explicit government support in
return for an annual fee paid by the issuer. Issuance under these schemes was
the primary source of bank bond issuance in the last quarter of 2008 and the
first quarter of 2009.
The take-up under government debt guarantee programmes was slower
than expected as issuers were deterred by the terms and the costs. The
maturities available varied by country, typically from three to five years, with
most banks issuing at the longest maturity available. European banks faced
higher costs for debt guarantees than did US banks. While the United States
charged a flat rate to all borrowers regardless of rating, the cost of European
guarantees was linked to past credit default swap (CDS) spreads, making them
more expensive for riskier borrowers. In some cases, the cost made guarantees
less attractive than shorter-term funding through central bank facilities.
The complexity of these guarantee programmes and the varying
treatment across jurisdictions deterred some investors. The risk weighting on
government-guaranteed bonds varies across countries, with some regulators
treating them as riskless from a capital perspective and others assigning a
20% capital charge. Not all markets accepted guaranteed debt as collateral.
Some investors also faced legal or operational restrictions that prevented
them from buying this new asset class.
Governments recapitalised the banks to reduce their financial leverage
and increase their solvency. While the UK Treasury used common shares,
most governments bought hybrid securities – such as preferred shares or
mandatory convertible notes – that combine the stable income stream of
bonds with the potential appreciation of common shares.3 Hybrid securities
may qualify as equity when a bank’s regulatory capital ratio is being calculated,
but they are not viewed with much confidence by market participants due to
their limited ability to absorb losses.
Governments bought mostly preferred shares, as these limit the risk of
loss to the taxpayer while providing a more attractive dividend stream than
common shares. These benefits come at a cost because preferred
shareholders typically cannot vote at shareholder meetings, which constrains
their ability to influence management. The preferred shares purchased by the
United States had the potential for capital appreciation: they included 10-year
warrants that provided the government with the option to purchase common
stock at a specified price. Comparing the costs and terms of capital injections
across countries was difficult, as no two plans looked alike.
Preferred shares are typically non-voting, have a prior claim on dividends over common shares, and
take priority over common shares in case of bankruptcy. Convertible notes are a form of bond that can
be exchanged for a specified number of common shares in the future at the option of the investor.

Government capital injections came with strings attached. Many countries
followed France’s example and required banks receiving government support
to extend new domestic loans with an associated reporting requirement. While
initial US and German capital injections mentioned limits on the payment of
common dividends, only the United Kingdom explicitly prohibited common
dividends as long as the government’s preferred shares remained outstanding.
Some conditions proved difficult to enforce due to a lack of precision and an
unwillingness or inability to interfere in the management of the banks. For
example, many rescue packages outlined general restrictions on executive
pay, but governments lacked the votes, the support of the banks’ boards and
the legal basis to block payments.
A few governments supported key financial institutions by purchasing
impaired assets or providing insurance against losses on designated portfolios.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) bought mortgage-related assets from UBS
and placed them in a special investment vehicle. The sale reduced UBS’s riskweighted assets, lowering the amount of regulatory capital it must hold against
potential losses. While the SNB bears the risk of losses, it also shares in the
profits if the assets recover. The United States and Germany announced asset
purchase plans, but by May they had not taken any action.
The Dutch, UK and US governments offered asset insurance to a handful
of banks:  RBS, Lloyds TSB, Bank of America and Citigroup. Under this
scheme, the government assumes a share of the potential losses on a specified
portfolio (typically 80–90%) after a first loss amount (or deductible) is absorbed
by the bank. In return, the bank pays the government an insurance premium
based on the riskiness of the portfolio. By limiting the bank’s potential losses,
asset insurance reduces the capital it must hold. The government, however, is
left with a large potential liability if the assets fall substantially in value.
Ultimately, governments in Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom and
the United States took control of a number of insolvent financial institutions
to protect depositors and to prevent contagion to other financial institutions
(see Chapter II). This transfer of control was accomplished directly by regulators
(in the case of the US government-sponsored enterprises and Icelandic banks)
or through a court injunction (in the case of Bradford & Bingley in the United
Kingdom and the Belgo-Dutch firm Fortis). In some cases, it was accomplished
indirectly by acquiring the majority or entirety of the voting shares (eg AIG
and RBS). The legal basis for regulatory takeovers existed in the United
States, but new laws had to be passed in Germany and the United Kingdom
to facilitate these actions, which otherwise might have been blocked by
shareholders. Uncertain solvency and the risk of consequent nationalisation
made it virtually impossible for some financial institutions to raise capital
because equity investors and creditors feared that their capital might be
written down.

comfort from the government support, as seen in a narrowing of credit spreads
over government bonds and spreads on CDS contracts, most banks still found
it difficult or impossible to raise new capital from private investors (see also
Chapter II). As a result, some governments provided multiple capital injections
to selected banks between November 2008 and May 2009.
The initial positive reaction in October to the announcement of rescue
packages manifested itself in a rise in the price of bank stocks – followed by
a drop over subsequent months, suggesting that common shareholders
expected more losses. By design, the rescue packages did not protect equity
holders, with a moderate decline in bank stock prices expected due to the
dilution of existing shareholdings (Graph VI.6, left-hand panel). In all of the six
countries covered, bank stock prices underperformed the market following
capital injections. The drop in bank stock prices was larger in the United
Kingdom than elsewhere due to the prohibition on paying common dividends.
Banks receiving government capital injections also underperformed banks
that did not receive government support.
Creditors viewed the government actions more positively, as seen in the
narrowing of CDS spreads across banks headquartered in different countries
(Graph VI.6, right-hand panel). By increasing a bank’s capital ratio and providing
a means to refinance existing debt, government rescue packages reduced the
probability of default, pushing down CDS premia on average. Credit spreads
on senior and subordinated bank debt also narrowed relative to underlying
government benchmarks. Despite these positive signs, some banks continued
to show signs of distress and credit spreads remained elevated. The relatively
high credit spreads on bank bonds issued under different government
guarantees suggest that creditors harboured doubts about the financial
condition of banks and the credibility of public statements that no systemically
important institutions would be allowed to fail.

As the crisis
continues, loan
losses and credit
defaults are rising

Overall, governments may not have acted quickly enough to remove problem
assets from the balance sheets of key banks. The 1990s experience of the
Nordic countries indicates that addressing problem assets is necessary to
reduce uncertainties, re-establish confidence in a lasting way and lay the
basis for an efficient financial system (see Box VI.B). Despite acknowledging
these lessons, the steps taken so far have focused largely on providing
guarantees and subsidised capital. At the same time, government guarantees
and asset insurance have exposed taxpayers to potentially large losses.
Progress on problem assets has been slowed by the complexity of the
securities affected, legal constraints and, above all, the limited political will to
commit public funds to the clean-up effort. The lack of progress threatens to
prolong the crisis and delay the recovery because a dysfunctional financial
system reduces the ability of monetary and fiscal actions to stimulate the
economy.
The lack of progress on removing troubled assets from the banks’
balance sheets and recognising the associated losses is illustrated by the US
experience. Rather than buy impaired assets directly, the US Treasury outlined
a plan in March, the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), to value these
assets and to remove them through an auction mechanism. Under the PPIP,
eligible private sector investors are invited to bid on troubled real estate
assets held by banks. Winning bids receive matching government capital and
non-recourse funding on attractive terms, with the US government assuming
any losses beyond the equity invested. The generous terms were designed
partly to boost the value of the underlying securities, to provide sufficient
incentives for private capital inflows and to attract expertise to value and
manage these assets. Despite the favourable terms, as of May 2009 the
outlook for the PPIP was uncertain.
To increase confidence in the banks, US regulators conducted stress
tests on 19 bank holding companies in April 2009 to ensure that they were
sufficiently capitalised given a set of assumptions about losses on various bank
assets over the next two years. Following the release of the results in early May,
US regulators directed 10 of the banks examined to increase their level of
capital or to improve the quality by including more common shares. Several
banks took advantage of the reduced uncertainty and the increased risk
appetite of investors that accompanied the publication of the stress test results
to raise equity and issue debt. While the United Kingdom conducted a similar
exercise, other European countries were still debating the merits of an EU-wide
stress test.
What seems clear is that the deterioration in credit quality will generate
more losses on banks’ loan books and other credit exposures (see Chapter III).
Banks may therefore have an incentive to delay recognising losses, aided
by accounting rules that provide management more discretion over when to
write down assets. Taxpayers will not want to be exposed to greater potential
losses, but key financial institutions are likely to require more government
support in order to facilitate the required adjustments, to restore confidence
in the financial system and to restart lending on a sustainable basis.

BIS 79th Annual Report

109

Longer-term considerations
Government actions to support banks raise a number of longer-term concerns.
First, policymakers need to consider the trade-off between short- and
medium-term objectives. Short-term actions that delay adjustment and prop
up aggregate demand may not be compatible with the medium-term need for
banks to deleverage their balance sheets so as to lay the basis for a healthy
financial system and a self-sustaining recovery.
Second, rescue packages for banks deemed too big or too interconnected
to fail raise questions of moral hazard. Given the perceived need to avoid the
bankruptcy of major financial institutions post-Lehman, moral hazard concerns
were viewed as a necessary risk. But by protecting creditors and limiting the
losses of equity holders, government interventions risk reducing the incentive
for capital providers to monitor banks in the future. At the same time, senior
bank executives and traders who reaped the rewards from risk-taking may not
be held sufficiently accountable for the losses.
Third, rescue packages and government-assisted sales of failed banks
may unwittingly increase systemic risk by creating larger financial institutions. In
the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve’s loan to JPMorgan Chase
facilitated the takeover of Bear Stearns in March 2008. Then, in September
2008, the FDIC arranged for the sale of Washington Mutual’s banking
subsidiaries to JPMorgan Chase. In the United Kingdom, the government sold
the retail operations of Bradford & Bingley to Banco Santander, one of the
largest euro area banks in terms of assets. More examples of such actions
can be seen in other countries. As discussed in Chapter VII, large financial
institutions pose disproportionate systemic risks.
Finally, the uncoordinated response across countries has raised concerns
about distortions to competition. In particular, national rescue packages have
featured different conditions, coverage and cost, with some banks receiving
support on more attractive terms than their competitors. The European
Commission reviewed the rescue measures of EU member states to avoid
undue distortions of competition, but other national plans did not undergo the
same scrutiny. This lack of global coordination risks creating an uneven playing
field for global banks. In addition, government support that has been explicitly
tied to domestic lending may inadvertently contribute to the retreat of global
banks from foreign markets (see Chapters III and V).

Fiscal policy plans to stimulate aggregate demand
By late 2008, with the crisis moving into its fourth stage, concerns were arising
that monetary policy might not be sufficient to avert a sharp contraction in
output. Similarly, while bank recapitalisation packages and government
guarantees arguably prevented the collapse of the financial system, they were
seen as insufficient to lift economic activity in the short term. Against this
backdrop, authorities in all major economies turned to fiscal measures to
stimulate aggregate demand and thus soften the downturn. By May 2009,
almost all OECD economies, and many non-OECD emerging market
economies, had announced fiscal stimulus packages.

The size of announced fiscal packages varied greatly across countries.
Among OECD economies, the United States announced the largest package,
with estimated fiscal costs of well over 2% of GDP in both 2009 and 2010
(Graph VI.7, top panel).4 The relative size of the packages is not positively
correlated with differences in the severity of the downturn across countries
(Graph VI.8, left-hand panel). A much bigger role is played by the relative
importance of automatic stabilisers, which explains about one fifth of the
variation in the size of fiscal packages across OECD members (Graph VI.8,
centre panel).
The importance of automatic stabilisers in many economies suggests
that discretionary packages should not be viewed in isolation. A better
measure of the overall stimulus is the change in the government’s expected
near-term budget balance in response to the crisis, which also captures
Some of the fiscal stimulus packages announced in non-OECD economies were even larger relative
to GDP than that in the United States. However, the actual “new” stimulus is often substantially smaller
than the headline figures suggest, as these may include expenditure that has already been committed
or contingent liabilities. Such items are excluded from the OECD figures.

expenditures (and revenues) related to the financial rescue packages as well
as the revenue deterioration resulting from the drop in asset prices. The fiscal
impulse is determined by the sum of the various components, not by a single
component.
Budget deficits are expected to reach levels far beyond those anticipated
prior to the intensification of the crisis in September. Both the structural and the
cyclical balance are forecast to widen markedly (Graph VI.1, bottom panel). In
its March 2009 projection, the OECD predicted a US deficit in 2009 of 10% of
GDP compared with about 5% in its mid-2008 projection. Fiscal policy in
France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom also expanded strongly. In
Italy, the structural balance remained more or less unchanged in the absence
of a sizeable discretionary package, while the automatic stabilisers increased
the cyclical deficit.
The capacity for fiscal stimulus varies considerably across countries.
Countries with a high degree of public indebtedness, sizeable budget deficits
even in the absence of discretionary stimulus, or a high level of unfunded
liabilities have less room for manoeuvre than those with healthier public
finances. So far, however, such constraints do not appear to have affected the
decision of the major economies to provide fiscal stimulus: there is no
significant relationship between the size of the packages and the level of
outstanding government debt among OECD countries (Graph VI.8, right-hand
panel). Moreover, financing costs have generally declined despite the sharp
widening in budget deficits (Graph VI.9, bottom panel). The exceptions include
some smaller economies with very large budget deficits or crisis-related
expenditure, such as Hungary, Iceland and Ireland, that experienced significant
problems in placing public debt and were forced to tighten fiscal policy in
stages three and four of the crisis.

The composition of
stimulus packages

about effectiveness

Uncertainty about
fiscal multipliers

Approaches to fiscal stimulus differ, although most packages include tax
cuts as well as increases in government spending (Graph VI.7, bottom panel).
Tax cuts tend to have a lower impact on output than measures targeted
at low-income (and thus presumably low-saving) households. Nonetheless,
several factors led fiscal authorities to include such instruments in their recent
stimulus packages. Some were political: it is easier to mobilise large amounts
of funds if spending benefits a broad range of taxpayers. Others were
economic: tax cuts can be enacted relatively quickly, whereas increasing
government spending often involves significant delays. In addition, cuts in
personal taxes may support the deleveraging of the household sector, and
thus speed up the recovery further down the road, even if the short-term
impact on GDP is small.
While fiscal packages have undoubtedly been large by historical
standards, will they also be effective? Estimates vary. For example, based on
previous average experiences, the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
expects the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) – the bill
carrying most of the fiscal stimulus measures – to lift GDP growth by 1.4 to
3.8 percentage points in 2009 and by a somewhat lower amount in 2010. The
lack of precision in these estimates reflects the wide range of fiscal multipliers

in the literature.5 However, it is unclear whether econometric estimates based
on samples with functioning financial systems provide any useful information at
the current juncture on the impact of fiscal stimulus. On the one hand, financial
stress is likely to increase the proportion of households and firms without
access to credit, and as a result they may spend a higher proportion of
the additional income. On the other hand, high uncertainty might induce
households and firms to reduce their debts or save more, thus depressing the
multiplier.

Risks
An open question as of this writing is whether the expansionary set of policies
enacted in response to the sharp contraction in economic activity in late
2008 and early 2009 will succeed in stabilising the economy. A major cause
for concern is the limited progress in addressing the underlying problems in
the financial sector. The experience of the Nordic countries in the 1990s (see
Box VI.B) and other historical episodes suggest that a precondition for a
sustainable recovery is to force the banking system to take losses, dispose of
non-performing assets, eliminate excess capacity and rebuild its capital base.
These conditions are not being met. A significant risk is therefore that the
current stimulus will lead only to a temporary pickup in growth, followed by
protracted stagnation. Moreover, a temporary respite may make it more
difficult for authorities to take the actions that are necessary, if unpopular, to
restore the health of the financial system, and may thus ultimately prolong the
period of slow growth.
Perhaps the largest short-term risk associated with the expansionary
policies is the possibility of a forced exit. Monetary and fiscal authorities of the
major economies have so far been relatively unconstrained in their ability to
follow expansionary policies. This need not last. An extended period of
stagnating economic activity could undermine the credibility of the policies in
place. Governments may find it hard to place debt if market participants
expect the underlying balance to remain negative for years to come. Under
such circumstances, funding costs could rise suddenly, forcing them to cut
spending or raise taxes significantly. External constraints could also bind for
some countries. Particularly in smaller and more open economies, pressure
on the currency could force central banks to follow a tighter policy than would
be warranted by domestic economic conditions.
Another set of risks concerns the medium term. While the immediate
objective of policymakers was to cushion the steep downturn in the economy,
the expansionary policies undertaken in late 2008 and early 2009 will also
affect the transition towards a more sustainable economic structure with less
leverage and thus a smaller financial sector. Some smoothing of this adjustment
is clearly welcome, but correction of the imbalances identified in Chapter I
Structural macroeconomic models with backward-looking expectations generally give multipliers
larger than 1, which means that one dollar of fiscal outlays leads to an increase in GDP of more than
one dollar. By contrast, more forward-looking models and event studies suggest multipliers that are
generally smaller than 1, as higher fiscal outlays are offset by lower spending elsewhere in the economy.

cannot be delayed indefinitely. To be credible, policymakers must recognise
this fact.
At some point the economy will recover and monetary and fiscal easing will
have to be reversed. From a technical point of view, this is straightforward.
Selling the large asset holdings accumulated by central banks since the
Lehman bankruptcy will take time, but this does not compromise central banks’
ability to reduce monetary stimulus. Even if central banks are not able to shrink
their balance sheets, they can withdraw liquidity through repurchase operations
or the issuance of central bank bills or by making it more attractive for banks
to hold reserves. As discussed above, several of these measures have already
been used during the crisis to offset at least some part of the expansion in
central bank balance sheets. Reversing the fiscal stimulus should also be
relatively straightforward. Some of the measures have been designed to be
temporary and will expire eventually unless extended. Other measures do not
have set expiry dates but could be reversed in the course of the normal
budgeting process.
The absence of major technical problems in withdrawing monetary and
fiscal stimulus does not mean that tightening policy will be easy. First, there
is a timing problem. Tightening too early could thwart the recovery, whereas
tightening too late may result in inflationary pressures from the stimulus in place
or contribute to yet another cycle of increasing leverage and bubbling asset
prices. Identifying when to tighten is difficult even at the best of times, but
even more so at the current stage. Standard measures of the output gap are
probably of limited use in this regard, since it is not clear to what extent the
problems in the financial sector will reduce future potential output. The second
major problem is political. Both central banks and treasuries are likely to face
strong political pressures to delay any tightening.
While their effectiveness remains in doubt, the expansionary policies put
in place in 2008 and 2009 will nonetheless have long-term consequences, the
most important stemming from the large amount of public debt they will
generate. Even if stimulus measures are reversed quickly, the commitments
from financial rescue packages could affect the public purse for years to come,
while lower asset prices are likely to depress revenues. Higher public debt in
turn may push up real interest rates and thus crowd out private investment.
To return to the case of the US stimulus package, the CBO estimates that the
package will lower future growth by 0.2% of GDP per year in the long term.
Getting public finances in order will therefore be the main task of policymakers
for years to come.

VII. Risks and opportunities: towards a fail-safe
financial system

In the fourth quarter of 2008, despite more than a year of bold efforts by
policymakers, the financial crisis intensified to the point where it overwhelmed
the real economy. Central banks had been supplying short-term funding to
smooth needed adjustments in the banking system, but that alone cannot stem
bank losses. And what had been addressed as a liquidity crisis was confirmed
to be a solvency crisis. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on 15 September
triggered a run in the interbank lending market, a dramatic spike in corporate
bond rates and a global loss of consumer and business confidence. The
resulting collapse of consumer durables spending in the industrial economies
was quickly felt in the emerging world through both a sharp drop in trade
volumes and a reversal of capital flows. The global spread of the recession fed
back into financial markets, driving down both equity and bond prices, sparing
only the highest-quality sovereign debt.
The dramatic developments of the last three and a half months of 2008
forced monetary, fiscal and regulatory authorities to open a second front in their
battle – countering the threats to the real economy – and expand their fight to
restore the health of the financial system. In much of the industrial world, central
banks cut policy interest rates to record lows and then moved to ease financial
conditions even further by using their balance sheets in unconventional ways.
Meanwhile, fiscal authorities worked to implement unprecedented stimulus
programmes while, together with regulators and supervisors, they provided
resources to repair financial institutions’ balance sheets.
The result has been an inevitably messy mixture of urgent treatment
designed to stem the decline combined with an emerging agenda for
comprehensive reform to set the foundations for sustainable growth. But two
enormous risks to long-term recovery lurk amid the massive short-term efforts.
First, policy actions taken so far may be insufficient to restore the health of the
banking system. Second, a lack of well articulated exit strategies for the
monetary, fiscal and financial repair programmes threatens to hinder rather
than support necessary macroeconomic adjustments.
A healthy financial system is not only essential for stable long-run real
growth, but is also a precondition for the effectiveness of the expansionary
policies intended to return the economy to that path. Until the intermediation
system is working again – smoothly channelling resources from savers to
investors and transferring risk to those willing and able to bear it – large-scale
fiscal stimulus could easily come to naught, as it did in Japan a decade ago.
The result would be a massive build-up of public debt without a return to
robust growth. It is, therefore, of paramount importance that governments
persevere in repairing the financial system. Stopping prematurely will be
tempting. At some point, possibly soon, the real economy will show signs of

116

BIS 79th Annual Report

returning to normal. This will create the hope that renewed economic growth
will finish the job of repairing bank balance sheets. But as long as the financial
intermediaries remain weak, any improvement in the real economy is destined
to be temporary.
To address the threat to growth posed by the constellation of fiscal,
monetary and regulatory interventions, officials must find convincing ways
to unwind the policies they have put in place, including reducing the now
vast involvement of the government in the financial system. Where central
banks have stepped in for private sector intermediaries, they need to exit.
And the increased government spending that may have been necessary to
limit the decline in employment and production in the short term will, if
overdone, do more harm than good. It is essential that fiscal policymakers
demonstrate now that the paths of their budgets are consistent with long-term
sustainability.1
Beyond the near-term challenges – nursing financial institutions and
markets back to health, ending the recession and restoring balance to the
government’s role in the economy – lies the daunting task of modifying both
the broader policy framework and the architecture of the financial system.
Addressing the multitude of causes of the crisis described in Chapter I clearly
requires a comprehensive set of solutions. Macroeconomic policies that led to
sustained current account imbalances and low interest rates will need to adjust.
And asset prices and credit growth must be more directly integrated into
monetary policy frameworks. Addressing the wide-ranging microeconomic
factors that contributed to the crisis – poorly structured incentives and
inadequate corporate governance, flawed risk management and weaknesses
in regulatory systems – requires correspondingly broad changes to the set of
rules within which markets operate.
For all their enduring virtues, markets have failed in some very important
ways. It is now apparent that as the financial system has grown and become
more complex, it has come to need a more comprehensive set of rules to
ensure that it functions smoothly.2 Ensuring that the decentralised financial
system operates safely and efficiently does not simply mean more regulation
or more centralisation; rather, it means better regulation and better supervision
that induce the private sector to improve incentives, risk management and
governance. Moreover, the crisis revealed system-wide, or systemic, risks
associated with the principal components of the financial system – instruments,
markets and institutions. By identifying, measuring and mitigating the systemic
risks inherent in all three components of the financial system, we will be able
to establish a robust regulatory perimeter with multiple layers of protection
against future crises.

at the 44th SEACEN Governors’ Conference, Kuala Lumpur, 7 February 2009.

As John McMillan notes, individual incentives and self-regulation go only so far. The existence of an
underground economy proves that markets can self-organise but only when transactions remain small and
simple. Moving beyond the black market requires rules and a rule-maker. That is where the government
steps in to protect property rights and ensure that people live up to their promises. See J McMillan,

Near-term risks and exit strategies: financial repair, fiscal policy and
monetary policy
The fiscal and monetary policies put in place to address the crisis worldwide are
unprecedented in both scale and scope. Fiscal stimulus is expanding at high
speed as the G20 countries implement new spending of 2% of GDP on average
this year, adding to the effects of automatic stabilisers already in place. In the
lead is the United States, whose federal deficit is expected to widen by more
than 8% of GDP from 2008 to 2009.
Meanwhile, monetary authorities in the euro area, Japan, the United
Kingdom and the United States are employing both conventional and
unconventional policy tools, lowering policy interest rates to zero (or close to
it) while rapidly expanding their balance sheets. As described in Chapter VI,
the Eurosystem’s consolidated balance sheet has increased from €1.2 trillion
to €1.8 trillion over the past two years; the Bank of England has more than
doubled its balance sheet, to more than £200 billion, with further large
increases planned over the coming months; and the Federal Reserve, whose
balance sheet stood at $900 billion in mid-2008, may expand it to more than
$3 trillion during 2009.
Fiscal authorities, regulators and central banks have joined forces in the
difficult task of repairing the financial system. While there has been some
progress, as discussed in Chapter VI, the job is not finished. Further delay in
repairing the financial sector runs the risk of weakening the efforts on other
policy fronts. Fiscal and monetary policies are surely less effective when
financial intermediation is impaired. And as long as global financial institutions
are hesitant to finance economic activity in emerging market economies, the
prospects for growth and development in what has been the primary engine
of worldwide expansion over the past decade is at risk.
The unprecedented rescue efforts carry substantial risks. Enumerating
them will serve as a reminder of the pitfalls that policymakers face in the
coming months and years as they work to restore stability to the global
economic and financial system.

The risks of financial repair: rescues
The financial rescue programmes – the guarantees, transfers of assets,
recapitalisations and outright government ownership – present challenges for
both effectiveness and exit.
Past banking crises have taught us that early recognition of losses
combined with quick, comprehensive intervention and restructuring is the key
to a speedy recovery (see Box VI.B). Before normal lending can resume, bad
assets must be disposed of and banks recapitalised, all in a transparent fashion.
In contrast, during this crisis, resolution has proceeded slowly, with the result
that market participants have been unsure about the size and distribution of
losses as well as about the timing of loss recognition. This uncertainty has
served only to prolong doubts and frustrate government efforts to restore
confidence in the financial system.
Besides the need for more forceful government efforts to clean up insolvent
banks, intermediaries themselves will need to adjust their funding models as

118

BIS 79th Annual Report

off-balance sheet entities are consolidated onto bank balance sheets, securitisation
becomes more difficult, and wholesale funding becomes more costly. In the
end, institutions are likely to be smaller, with less leverage, and their owners
will almost certainly have to learn to live with lower rates of return.
In failing to come to grips with the basic process of cleaning up the banks,
government subsidies and control of banks have placed a burden on the public
treasury at the same time that they have created an uneven playing field both
within and across countries. The distortions have caused previously well
managed, healthy banks and other creditworthy borrowers to be penalised
because they now look risky relative to institutions that are governmentsubsidised or controlled. Ultimately, the reluctance of officials to quickly clean
up the banks, many of which are now owned in large part by governments,
may well delay recovery.
The banks must resume lending, but they must also adjust by becoming
smaller, simpler and safer. Again, even where they have been essential, the
government rescue packages implemented so far appear to be hindering rather
than aiding this needed adjustment. By helping banks obtain debt financing
and capital, rescue packages allow managers to avoid the hard choices
needed to reduce both the size of their balance sheets (lowering leverage) and
the amount of risk that they take (shifting the composition of the assets they
hold). And by aiding the sale of distressed banks to other banks, as has
been typical of many past crisis responses, government actions are creating
financial institutions so big and complex that even their own management
may not understand their risk exposures. Despite the nearly universal concern
over the mere existence of institutions that are too big to fail, short-run
government actions are increasing financial sector concentration and adding
to systemic risk.
Appropriate exit from the various national rescue programmes clearly
depends on the form of support offered in the first place. Sunset clauses
on increased deposit insurance and bond guarantees can ensure that they
eventually disappear; and since the terms of government capital injections are
often punitive, banks have an incentive to repay quickly. The most difficult case
involves nationalised or quasi-nationalised banks. Even if such institutions are
cleaned up and sold quickly, governments may be left holding bad assets for
some time.
Summing up, it is essential that authorities act quickly and decisively to
repair the financial system. The determination to finish the job, as well as the
conditions and timing for exit, must be clear. In the same way that central banks
must allow financial markets to recover their role, government officials need
to take decisive steps to restore institutions to private ownership and control.
And all of this has to be done with an eye towards returning to a system with
healthy competition.
But while government exit is essential, there is the risk that officials will
fail to finish their repair task. Even in the face of what might appear to be the
first signs of recovery in the real economy, officials must persevere until the
job is done. In reviving the financial system, the risk is not one of doing too
much but of stopping too soon.

BIS 79th Annual Report

119

The risks of financial repair: bank regulation
In pursuing the medium-term goals of reforming the regulation of banks,
officials are seeking to enhance the management of regulatory capital and
liquidity, introduce simpler measures of leverage, and improve the assessments
of more complex risk. Beyond all of that, they are confronting a crisis-born
threat to cross-border banking.
Investors have become extremely risk-averse in their assessments of
financial institutions and are demanding more capital and higher levels of
common equity (in relation to both total assets and risk-weighted assets) than
the regulatory minimum.
As discussed in Chapter VI, the pursuit of short-term stability has raised
some difficult questions about moral hazard. By limiting the losses of large
banks’ equity and liability holders as well as the rewards of managers and
traders, rescue packages are reducing the incentive for both insiders and
outsiders to monitor risk-taking in the future.
In the area of risk assessment, officials might be adding to the problem
at the same time that they are trying to solve it. That is, as just noted, rescue
packages are building up financial sector concentration and systemic risk even
as reforms in regulatory policy seek to make those risks more manageable.
Fortunately, officials in many countries understand all of this and are looking
for solutions. The truth is that as financial institutions grow more complex, the
demands on risk management grow much more quickly. A large, integrated
financial institution today has hundreds of subsidiaries, all operating quasiindependently; it is impossible for any individual to understand what all the
parts of such an organisation are doing, much less how they will interact in
response to a major event. Enterprise-wide risk management would seem to be
an impossibility in such cases. Moreover, some banks are not only too big to fail
but, in having important relationships with a large number of other institutions,
are also too interconnected to fail. Officials must insist that institutions be
comprehensible both to those who run them and to those who regulate
and supervise them. And, in the future, a financial firm that is too big or too
interconnected to fail must be too big to exist.
Related to complexity is nationality. Global banks have operations in
dozens of countries – on its website, Citigroup lists locations in exactly 100.
The existence of global intermediaries enhances the efficiency of the financial
system. By reducing the need to have lenders located physically near
borrowers, international banks facilitate trade in goods and services as well as
the cross-border movement of capital. But after seeing foreign-owned banks
pare back activity during the crisis, host country governments may become
less sanguine about allowing outsiders to operate on their soil. The result
could very well be a greater role for host country supervisors in protecting
their financial systems from the possibility of hasty exits by foreign banks.
And, by reducing the ease with which capital moves across borders, financial
protectionism would shrink trade in goods and services and thus moderate
growth and development.
In summary, as officials look forward they need to balance stability with
efficiency. Reducing moral hazard, keeping institutions simple and small, and

120

BIS 79th Annual Report

reducing their international reach will all come at the expense of economies
of scale and scope. In the end, a safer and more stable financial system may
very well be a less efficient one. Hence it is critical that policymakers work to
build a system that is as efficient as possible for the maximum tolerable level
of risk they choose.

Fiscal policy risks
Turning to fiscal policy, the short-term efficacy of stimulus plans is hampered,
not only because of the impaired financial system, but also because the
need for expansionary programmes and the capacity for them vary by country.
Moreover, longer-term risks associated with exit and sustainability arise from
the sheer size of the spending packages.
A country’s need for fiscal expansion is conditioned, in part, by how much
actual stimulus can be derived from a given level of expansion. Effectiveness
– the growth and employment effects from a fiscal expansion of, say, 1% of a
country’s GDP – differs across countries for at least two reasons: variations in
economic structures and variations in the composition of packages’ taxes,
expenditures and subsidies.
A country’s capacity for fiscal expansion can be measured by its preexisting level of debt relative to GDP. In most large industrial economies, the
ratio going into the crisis stood at 60 to 70% (France, Germany, the United
Kingdom and the United States). In others, such as Italy and Japan, debt
exceeded GDP, so such countries would seem to have much less room for
fiscal manoeuvre. As discussed in Chapter VI, for most countries these
differences do not appear to have affected the ability to borrow so far. But, as
they proceed, the fiscal expansions could quickly start to increase borrowing
costs.
Fiscal policy is at serious risk of overshooting even in the economies with
the most room for debt expansion. A fundamental reason is that, while
the programmes most likely to be highly effective and low-risk are timely,
targeted and temporary, those attributes of fiscal action are notoriously rare
in representative democracies. The legislative process and the logistical
challenge of disbursing enormous sums of money work against timeliness.
Targeted programmes are the most likely to increase aggregate spending but
are politically less attractive than those that simply benefit the most people. And
it is much easier to lower taxes and increase spending than to do the reverse,
so fiscal expansion tends towards permanency and a rise in long-term deficits.
The large stimulus packages also pose a variety of medium-term risks that
policymakers must worry about now. On the one hand, there is the danger that
fiscal policymakers will exhaust their debt capacity before finishing the costly
job of repairing the financial system. On the other hand, there is the definite
possibility that stimulus programmes will drive up real interest rates and
inflation expectations. Those risks may appear small today – the crisis is
boosting private saving and suppressing private investment, and there is
substantial excess productive capacity – but once conditions normalise, they
will intensify. The consequences could be sudden increases in interest rates
combined with large moves in exchange rates.

BIS 79th Annual Report

121

Fiscal deficits can drive up real interest rates in a manner related to the
classic process of crowding-out, whereby higher government purchases of
goods and services result in lower private investment. The experience of the
past few decades suggests that a permanent 10 percentage point increase in
the worldwide ratio of government debt to GDP would raise the real interest
rate nearly 0.4 percentage points in the long run.3
Fiscal deficits can drive up inflation expectations as well. Although
governments rarely refuse to pay their debts,4 they can lower the burden by
altering repayment terms or, as occurred in the aftermath of the Second World
War, by engineering previously unexpected inflation.5 Since bondholders
know all of this, even a hint of improvement in the real economy could cause
nominal interest rates to increase, steepening the yield curve dramatically and
smothering the nascent recovery. And adjustments of international investment
portfolios that increase exchange rate volatility could accompany the sudden
rise in long-term nominal interest rates.
There is another route through which fiscal stimulus programmes could
raise long-term nominal interest rates. As noted in Chapter VI, extended real
stagnation could undermine the credibility of fiscal policies to facilitate
recovery. Persistent low growth could lead to a consensus that government
deficits will remain large for years to come. If that were to happen, investors
and institutions could sour on the prospects of holding long-term sovereign
debt. Interest rates would then rise, driving up funding costs. Returning policy
to a sustainable long-run path would require swift reductions in spending and
increases in taxes. The rise in sovereign spreads seen already and the recent
threats of credit rating downgrades for industrial economies are signs that a
rapid increase in long-term nominal interest rates is a significant risk.
So, although expansionary fiscal programmes are essential to cushion the
impact of the global recession and provide a bridge to recovery, it is vital that
governments design stimulus in a manner consistent with long-run sustainability.
That means that, as officials try to revive real activity and credit flows, they
must (1) build in credible provisions for self-liquidation of the programmes and
(2) engineer an economic adjustment to more saving and less overall debt.
Regarding self-liquidation, it is straightforward to design a programme
that winds down automatically as employment returns to trend. But credibility
is a problem – what are inherently political promises that are made now can
easily be broken later. Nevertheless, where possible, programmes put into
place need to be sustainable, and, if they are not, the commitments to liquidate
them need to be structured so that they are difficult to escape.
As for adjustment, recall that the accumulation of debt on household and
financial institution balance sheets played a central role in the crisis. For the
economy to return to a stable growth path, the amount of borrowing must fall,

Fiscal policies designed to encourage consumption and borrowing clearly risk
hindering this necessary, but difficult, adjustment.

Monetary policy risks
It is fair to say that central bankers are operating well outside their comfort zone.
Their unprecedented rate cutting and balance sheet expansion (see Chapter VI
for details) pose a myriad of economic risks. On the one hand, their actions
may be insufficient to put the economy on the path to recovery; and on the
other, central banks may find it difficult to unwind their actions in time to
prevent inflation from rising as growth and employment recover.
The consensus view is that, with banks and markets seriously damaged,
central banks have had no choice but to take over much of wholesale financial
intermediation in the short run. But their balance sheets, which technically
could expand without bound, may reach practical and desirable limits before
the needs of the economy are met.
And once the recovery materialises, how can central banks begin to
tighten policy interest rates and unwind their vast monetary interventions?
The technical issues are much less challenging than the political ones. As an
operational matter, central banks’ now swollen balance sheets need not get in
the way of the transition to growth. When the time comes, central banks can
tighten financial conditions by raising the policy interest rate or by issuing their
own bonds in order to drain excess reserves while retaining assets that cannot
be easily sold.6 So, while holdings of some illiquid assets could easily cause
balance sheets to remain large for some time, financial conditions can be
tightened in a manner that allows monetary policymakers to retreat gracefully
from unconventional policy easing.
But the timing and politics of unwinding are likely to be difficult. History
shows that in moving to steady an expansion, monetary policymakers – always
under close political scrutiny – have a tendency to be late, tightening financial
conditions slowly for fear of doing it prematurely or too severely. Because their
current expansionary actions were prompted by a nearly catastrophic crisis,
central bankers’ fears of reversing too quickly are likely to be particularly
intense, increasing the risk that they will tighten too late. The big and justifiable
worry is that, before it can be reversed, the dramatic easing in monetary policy
will translate into growth in the broader monetary and credit aggregates. That
growth will, in turn, lead to inflation that feeds inflation expectations or it may
fuel yet another asset price bubble, sowing the seeds of the next financial
boom-bust cycle.
Finally, it is essential that central banks end their role as intermediary of
last resort. By taking over large swathes of intermediation from moribund
markets and institutions, central banks created the risk that the private sector
Regarding the first option, the existence of standing facilities in which commercial banks receive
interest on excess reserves facilitates a quick increase in rates. Regarding the second option, an equivalent
approach is for the finance ministry or treasury to agree to issue sovereign debt and deposit the
proceeds in the central bank. Coordination between the two authorities is essential to accomplish that
move because it forces recognition of the link between the central bank’s balance sheet policies and
fiscal debt management.

will be unable to return to these activities either quickly or smoothly, or to
restart them in a new form. Not only must commercial paper and simple forms
of securitisation return, but market-makers and arbitrageurs must as well. Any
actions officials take to temporarily replace private sector agents must always
have the return of those agents as the ultimate objective.
On the political front, central banks perceived the need to quickly move far
outside their traditional sphere of influence and so were unable to thoroughly
work out the governance implications of their actions. As a consequence, their
moves carry important long-term political risks.
One such risk comes from the fact that monetary policymakers have
supported selected industries and borrowers at the expense of others, creating
an uneven playing field in some areas. Traditionally, central banks have
operated in deep markets in an effort to remain impartial and avoid creating
price distortions. But in the current environment, what is commonly known as
“asset neutrality” is simply not possible.
Another long-term risk is that the extraordinary loan and asset purchase
facilities created by central banks have blurred the traditional distinction
between monetary and fiscal policy and thus between the actions of central
banks and those of governments. Some of the riskier unconventional monetary
policy actions may, in the end, generate large losses that will have to be borne
by the public. Such losses could unleash a dangerous reaction against the
structure of central banking in which appointed officials operate at arm’s length
from the elected government.

The bottom line: perseverance and sustainability
In summary, financial regulators, fiscal authorities and central bankers face
enormous risks. To avoid deepening and prolonging the crisis, they need to act
quickly and guard against policies that hinder adjustment or create additional
distortions in financial flows. Governments will be tempted to subsidise
industries that need to contract – but losers need to be allowed to lose. They
will be tempted to encourage banks to lend to those who should borrow less –
but it is not possible to deleverage by borrowing. And they will be tempted to
turn a blind eye to insolvent institutions, allowing them to continue operating
– but as hard experience teaches, zombie banks must be closed or returned to
health as quickly as possible. In all of these cases, governments must realise
that, by insisting on speedy resolutions despite political controversy, they are
acting in the best interests of the public.

Building a more stable financial system
While emergency room doctors focus on saving the patient’s life, others work
on the patient’s longer-term health. The same is true for the financial system
now under emergency care: as officials are working to resolve the crisis, they
are also striving to build a more stable financial system that will make the next
crisis both less likely and less damaging.
Building a perfect, fail-safe financial system – one capable of maintaining
its normal state of operation in the event of a failure – is impossible. Standing

124

in the way are both innovation, necessary for progress, and the limits of
human understanding, especially regarding the complexity of the decentralised
financial world. Even so, better macroeconomic policies, regulation and
enforcement, combined with improved private sector governance and risk
management, should be able to produce a more resilient structure. A sound
framework for financial stability incorporates both macroeconomic policies
designed to lean against asset price booms and credit cycles, and
macroprudential policies in which regulators and supervisors adopt a systemwide perspective.
The key to building a framework that makes the financial system more
stable and less prone to collapse is to identify its sources of systemic weakness
– the aspects that, if damaged, will bring the entire system down. If the reform
process can identify and mitigate these systemic risks while giving private
agents the incentive to behave responsibly, the system overall will be less
prone to failure and more resilient even if major problems occur.

A framework for addressing systemic risk in the financial system
The starting point for building a comprehensive framework that safeguards
financial stability is to identify the sources of systemic risk in each of the
financial system’s three essential elements: instruments, including loans, bonds,
equities and derivative instruments; markets, ranging from bilateral over-thecounter (OTC) trading to organised exchanges; and institutions, comprising
banks, securities dealers, insurance companies and pension funds among
others. All three elements – instruments, markets and institutions – can generate
systemic risks that require mitigation if the financial system is to be safe from
collapse. And, importantly, addressing risk in only one area will not ensure the
safety of the others. Furthermore, making all three parts of the financial
system more stable and more resilient to systemic events diminishes the
problem of a porous regulatory perimeter. No part of the financial system
should be allowed to escape appropriate regulation.
Ensuring financial stability means addressing externalities – costs that,
through its actions, an institution imposes on others but does not bear itself.
Two externalities are central to systemic risk: the first is joint failures of
institutions resulting from their common exposures at a single point in time –
common exposures because of shocks that come from outside the financial
system or because of linkages among intermediaries. The shocks may take a
variety of forms, including both credit and liquidity shocks and their interaction,
while the linkages arise from the complex web of daily transactions. The second
externality is what has come to be known as procyclicality, the fact that, over
time, the dynamics of the financial system and of the real economy reinforce
each other, increasing the amplitude of booms and busts and undermining
stability in both the financial sector and the real economy. Properly designed,
each component of the framework – focusing on instruments, markets and
institutions – can mitigate these sources of instability.
Having identified the sources of systemic risk, the next step is to create
institutional mechanisms that enhance safety. These policy interventions must
combine outright bans, which should be rare, with regulations that increase the

BIS 79th Annual Report

125

cost of activities based on the systemic risks they create. The discussion that
follows suggests various actions aimed at moderating the systemic risks arising
from instruments, markets and institutions, but these three basic elements
of the financial system are inextricably linked together (see Chapter III). For
example, there is no clear dichotomy between bank-based and market-based
intermediation systems; and financial instruments appear in markets as well
as on (and off) institutions’ balance sheets. So the actions suggested here
should be thought of as interrelated.

Improving the safety of financial instruments
The opacity, complexity and sheer quantity of some instruments can lead to
systemic problems. The most recent examples of such instruments were the
various structured products, including securitised subprime mortgages that
were difficult to comprehend, value and sell. The existence of complex and
opaque instruments clearly creates systemic risks. First, they present the
obvious problem that evaluations of their riskiness are not likely to be reliable.
And when valuation is imprecise, it not only complicates risk management
inside individual institutions, but also makes the already difficult task of
evaluating common exposures even harder. How can officials (or anyone else)
know if a concentrated position or a series of counterparty relationships poses
the systemic risk of joint failures if they can’t even understand the financial
instruments themselves?
The second systemic risk posed by such instruments is their capacity to
exacerbate procyclicality. Typically, booms are periods of financial innovation.
When things are going well, firms and individuals feel confident in
experimenting. They create new, untested instruments that are difficult to
understand and value. But buyers of these newly minted financial products can
be fooled into thinking that innovation and originality imply safety. And sellers
have little incentive to convince them otherwise. The result is that, during a
boom, flourishing financial innovation will tend to create hidden, underpriced
risks. But as strains develop and the boom begins to wane, the previously
unseen risks materialise, deepening the retrenchment that is already under way.
Financial innovation, although an undeniable source of progress, in this way
itself becomes a source of procyclicality and systemic risk.
Balancing innovation and safety in financial instruments requires providing
scope for progress while limiting the capacity of any new instrument to weaken
the system as a whole. Balance can be achieved by requiring some form of
product registration that limits investor access to instruments according to
their degree of safety. In a scheme analogous to the hierarchy controlling the
availability of pharmaceuticals, the safest securities would, like non-prescription
medicines, be available for purchase by everyone; next would be financial
instruments available only to those with an authorisation, like prescription
drugs; another level down would be securities available in only limited amounts
to pre-screened individuals and institutions, like drugs in experimental trials;
and, finally, at the lowest level would be securities that are deemed illegal. A
new instrument would be rated or an existing one moved to a higher category
of safety only after successful tests – the analogue of clinical trials. These

126

BIS 79th Annual Report

would combine issuance in limited quantities in the real world with simulations
of how the instrument would behave under severe stress.
Such a registration and certification system creates transparency and
enhances safety. But, as in the case of pharmaceutical manufacturers, there
must be a mechanism for holding securities issuers accountable for the quality
of what they sell. This will mean that issuers bear increased responsibility for
the risk assessment of their products.

Improving the safety of financial markets
The crisis has shown that markets can fail to self-correct, putting the entire
financial system at risk. The principal systemic hazard of a financial market is
illiquidity – the collapse of a market that comes with the sudden appearance
of a large number of sellers and the disappearance of buyers. Beyond having
generated illiquidity, the crisis demonstrated once again the lessons of the
1998 experience with Long-Term Capital Management: (1) the ability to buy
and sell risk is surely efficiency-enhancing, but when one institution holds a
sufficiently large position, it can create common exposures that put the system
at risk; and (2) when transactions occur bilaterally, as they do in OTC markets,
the failure of one individual or institution can, through linkages across firms
and markets, generate joint failures.
Financial markets can also contribute to the procyclicality of the system
as a whole. Parties to OTC derivatives transactions generally require collateral
to mitigate the counterparty risks they face. But a lack of transparency about
exposures can magnify general concerns and amplify cyclical activity in two
ways. First, during periods of stress, collateral requirements are likely to make
it more difficult to fund existing positions since increases in risk naturally lead
to increases in margin requirements. And second, crisis-induced increases in
uncertainty will put pressure on markets for the securities used as collateral in
OTC transactions, creating the potential for contagion to those markets. The
result is procyclicality in which downturns lead to higher margin requirements
and reduced market liquidity, forcing a general financial retrenchment with
obvious implications for real economic activity.
One way to address at least some of the systemic risks created by OTC
financial markets is to replace bilateral arrangements with central counterparties
(CCPs). A CCP is an entity that interposes itself between the two sides of a
transaction, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.
While the CCP appears to be perfectly hedged – has bought exactly what it has
sold – it still faces the risk that someone will default when a payment is due. The
CCP addresses that risk by requiring each participant to hold a margin account
in which the balance is determined by the value of the participant’s outstanding
contracts; the more volatile the market, the larger the required margin balance
and the more expensive it becomes to hold large positions. And by forcing
all transactions to occur on the same platform or set of platforms, it will be
straightforward to collect and disseminate information that market participants
and authorities can use to monitor the concentration of individual exposures
and the linkages that they create. In these ways, the CCP can both reduce risks
of common exposures and dampen market volatility.

BIS 79th Annual Report

127

Furthermore, CCPs are in a position to mitigate the procyclicality that arises
from the tendency of individual counterparties to demand increased margin
during times of financial stress. As the financial crisis revealed, increased price
volatility, combined with uncertainty about counterparty creditworthiness, leads
to demands for higher margin. Meeting the request means raising funds,
which can prompt forced selling at the worst possible time. With a CCP, margin
requirements would be set centrally, not by the counterparties themselves, so
margin need not rise during periods of market stress. This feature creates at
least the possibility of moderating the increases in margin in a way designed
to reduce procyclicality.7
For an instrument to be accepted by a CCP, it must have a certain degree
of standardisation and documentation, and reliable prices must be available
to allow regular marking to market of participants’ margin accounts. Because
many of the derivatives currently traded over the counter meet these criteria,
or could meet them with only slight changes, these requirements do not seem
much of an impediment.
The next step in market organisation is to combine the CCP with an
organised central exchange as the trading platform. The primary advantage of
taking this step is that it ensures price transparency with less reliance on
market-makers. As such, the market will be more stable – something suggested
by the fact that exchanges are among the markets most likely to continue
operating in a crisis. But they do have their limitations. Price transparency
reduces the incentives for individuals or institutions to devote capital to making
markets, which potentially increases the difficulty of transacting in large
quantities. That problem has led the market to create securities exchanges or
trading platforms for large transactions with a reduced level of transparency.
In summary, reducing both the common exposures and the procyclicality
that put financial stability at risk requires that the trading of financial
instruments move significantly away from OTC arrangements, which have
dominated some markets for a number of years. Determining where any
individual security should land in the spectrum of alternative arrangements
will depend on the systemic risks that it poses, and in the end it will be up
to individuals to decide how to transact. But by suggesting that certain
institutional structures are safer than others, officials will be providing a set
of warnings; and by raising the costs of operating in markets that have
shown themselves to foster the build-up systemic risk, they will be helping to
enhance financial stability.

Improving the safety of financial institutions: a macroprudential framework
By construction, microprudential supervision focuses on the risks within
individual institutions and so it does not address the externalities of common
exposures and procyclicality. For a number of years, work at the BIS has

It is important to note that a CCP is like an insurance company and that it can fail. As a result, it is
ultimately going to rely on public authorities should there be a systemic event. Therefore, prudence
means that the CCP must be subject to some form of supervision that might place limits on its size as
well as on the concentration of individual exposures within it. And, as discussed below, it means that
institutions with derivative exposures be required to hold capital to support those exposures.

7

128

BIS 79th Annual Report

emphasised the need for regulators and supervisors to adopt macroprudential
policies, which are attuned to the control of system-wide risks. This means
calibrating prudential tools – capital requirements, provisioning, leverage
ratios and the like – to address common exposures and joint failures on the
one hand, and procyclicality on the other.8

Common exposures
The current crisis has shown how common exposures create the potential for a
broad cross section of institutions to fail simultaneously. The interdependence
of financial institutions can come either from similar portfolios or from
interconnecting counterparty exposures (for example, because institutions
trade with each other). As a result, the risk of the financial system as a whole
is based not only on the sum of the risks arising inside individual institutions
but also on the degree of correlation among the institutions’ balance sheets:
the higher the correlation, the higher one would expect systemic risk to be. Put
another way, a financial sector with only a few large institutions may be no
more risky than one comprising many small institutions whose balance sheets
all look the same. The problem in either case is that, because it will reflect
only the risks to themselves and not the risks they impose on the system as a
whole, the level of capital held by individual institutions will probably be too
low.9 Proposals to mitigate the risks arising from common exposures focus on
implementing a systemic capital charge (SCC). An SCC would be designed to
create a distribution of capital in the system that better reflects the systemic
risk posed by individual failures.10
Implementing such a scheme requires a measure of systemic risk and an
understanding of the marginal contribution of each institution to the total. With
those in hand, an individual institution’s baseline capital requirement can be set
to reflect its systemic importance. The statistical tools needed to calculate the
size of an SCC are in their infancy. Work at the BIS has developed a process for
assessing marginal, institution-specific contributions to systemic risk essential
for implementation of an SCC. One unsurprising conclusion of this work is
that large banks contribute more than proportionally to systemic risks, as do
banks that are more exposed to system-wide shocks. That result suggests that
one may want to require bigger or more interconnected players to hold more
capital and have lower leverage, in effect taxing size to create a level playing
field from a system-wide perspective (see Box VII.A).11
The discussion here largely blurs the distinction between provisions and capital, as both are designed
to absorb losses. Provisions are held against expected losses, capital is held against unexpected losses.

See, for example, S Morris and H Shin, “Financial regulation in a system context”, Brookings Papers
on Economic Activity, no 2, 2008, pp 229–61, for a detailed recent discussion of this point.

A systemic capital charge would complement a minimum leverage ratio – that is, a minimum value
for the ratio of capital to assets. The latter can be viewed both as creating a floor below which conventional
risk-based capital cannot fall and as a way of containing the systemic risks created by the expansion of
an individual institution’s balance sheet.

Box VII.A: Measuring systemic risk and allocating it across individual institutions
Ensuring financial stability calls for an assessment of risk in the financial system as a whole. Achieving
that means, first, measuring the likelihood of a systemic event, defined as a failure of one or more
institutions that puts the entire system at risk. That measure would then be used in calibrating regulatory
and supervisory tools such as insurance premiums or capital requirements. Implementing this calibration
involves estimating the marginal contribution of each institution to overall systemic risk – a process
discussed here with illustrative examples.
The likelihood of systemic events is determined by the likelihood of failure at individual institutions
and by the extent to which institutions are likely to fail simultaneously. In turn, the likelihood of the latter
outcome, ie joint failure, rises with the degree of institutions’ exposure to common risks. Those risks
could originate outside the financial system, or they could arise from counterparty relationships or other
linkages inside the financial system.
One way to measure the likelihood of a systemic event is to treat the financial system as a portfolio
of institutions and employ numerical techniques that have previously been applied to portfolios of
securities. The inputs required for such a calculation are the size of each institution, its probability of
default, the loss-given-default in each case, and an estimate of the correlation of defaults across
institutions. That information can be collected from supervisory assessments, from prices of bank equity
and debt, or from a combination of the two.
The properties of the resulting measure of systemic risk closely parallel those of risk measures for
portfolios of securities. In particular, the overall level of systemic risk increases with institutions’ exposure
to common risk factors (Graph III.1); and with the total size of the system held constant, the level of
systemic risk increases with the disparity in the relative size of institutions.
Calculations of systemic risk for groups of institutions have been made for some time. But
allocating that risk to individual institutions in a way that reflects their contribution to it has proved
difficult. Recent work at the BIS has developed just such an allocation procedure. The technique relies
on game theory and can be applied quite generally to any measure of systemic risk that adopts a
portfolio approach. The final result is an intuitive measure that is transparent and delivers additive
allotments of systemic risk.
Performing the allocation exercise for a hypothetical banking system yields a number of important
insights. For example, keeping the riskiness of each institution and the size of the system constant, an
individual institution’s contribution to systemic risk increases with its exposure to common risk factors.
Importantly, the increase is greater for riskier or larger institutions. In addition, an institution’s relative
contribution to risk in the system as a whole increases more than in proportion to its relative size (Table VII.A),
a result reflecting the fact that larger institutions play a disproportionate role in systemic events.

Table VII.A

The system-wide perspective shown here provides guidance on the construction of macroprudential
tools. If such tools are to incorporate institutions’ contribution to systemic risk, they will need to reflect
factors that go well beyond the likelihood of individual failures. This means that an institution’s deposit
insurance premium, capital requirement and the like will have to reflect both the likelihood of its own
failure and its exposure (and contribution) to system-wide risk.

130

BIS 79th Annual Report

Likewise, insurance and capital charges faced by large institutions will need to reflect the
disproportionate impact of their size on the likelihood of a systemic event. And although portfolio
diversification might reduce the risk of an individual failure, it could make institutions more similar to
one another and, as a result, increase the likelihood of joint failure. Nonetheless, it seems clear that
policymakers need to collect the appropriate data and build the appropriate analytical models to allow
them to incorporate system-wide considerations into their evaluations of individual institutions.
 For a technical description of the procedure, see C Borio, N Tarashev and K Tsatsaronis, “Allocating system-wide tail risk to
individual institutions”, BIS Working Papers, forthcoming.

Institutions that are too big to fail – those that create intolerable systemic
risk by themselves because many others are exposed to them – pose a
significant challenge in this context. And the mergers and acquisitions that
have formed a part of the crisis response in the past two years may have
increased the number of such institutions; although this is understandable as
a transitional phenomenon, officials realise that it creates an unsustainable
structure. Addressing the problem has become a high priority for many national
authorities, which are working to set up resolution procedures for every
financial institution in their respective jurisdictions.

Procyclicality
The second externality highlighted by the current crisis is the procyclicality
created by the tendency of institutions to become less prudent during cyclical
upturns and more prudent during downturns. At a conceptual level, proposals
to reduce, neutralise or even reverse the procyclicality of the financial system
must either provide insurance against systemic downturns when they come,
or introduce countercyclical mechanisms to forestall or mitigate them. The
following discussion addresses the potential for the latter.
Policymakers have shown a clear desire to create new policy instruments
to ensure that financial institutions adjust their capital (and other safeguards,
such as loan provisioning and liquidity standards) countercyclically. Such a
countercyclical capital charge (CCC) would require institutions to build up
defensive buffers in good times that could be drawn down in bad times.12 One
possibility for implementing a CCC is a purely rule-based approach that builds
automatic stabilisers into the regulatory framework. While they may be
difficult to implement in a robust way, rules would commit policymakers to
act, creating an important degree of predictability for financial institutions.
An alternative to a purely rule-based approach would be to administer
adjustments to capital buffers in a manner that is analogous to adjusting the
policy interest rate, albeit at a much lower frequency and in a much more
predictable, and therefore mechanical, way. Many years of experience have led
monetary authorities to their current practice, basing their conventional interest
rate decisions on the outlook for inflation and economic activity, often with
substantial input from quantitative models. Is it possible to formulate a similarly

simple procedure that could guide the authorities in setting a CCC? Success
requires overcoming a series of obstacles similar to those that were overcome
through decades of experience in the monetary policy arena.
One obstacle to calculating a countercyclical capital charge is knowing
when buffers have to be built up (increasing the CCC) to make lending more
costly in a boom, and when they can be reduced or released (lowering the
CCC) to promote lending during a bust. In essence, it would be necessary to
quantify the risks to stability (risks that would play a role similar to that played
by inflation and output gaps in monetary policy decisions). Work done at the
BIS suggests that, while it may be possible to identify macroeconomic
indicators that correctly signal when the buffers should be built up, identifying
when they should be released is more difficult. As a result, the management
of countercyclical capital buffers is likely to require some degree of discretion
combined with a rule to create predictability (see Box VII.B).
Yet another problem with implementing a CCC is that it is not “one size
fits all”. Instead, capital buffers (or countercyclical provisioning) will need to
vary with the nature of individual institutions’ businesses. For example, because
cycles differ across countries, a CCC must be adjusted separately for each
geographical portfolio held by an institution operating across national boundaries.
While the countercyclical capital charge tells us the amount by which
capital buffers are to be built up and drawn down through the credit cycle,
it is largely silent about the average level of capital that needs to be held in
the system. The current baseline level of capital held by financial institutions
is by broad agreement too low, but by how much?13 Answering the question
involves ascertaining the long-run equilibrium level of capital (the analogue to
the long-term equilibrium interest rate that serves as the benchmark in the case
of traditional monetary policy). This, in turn, influences the distribution of risks
between the private owners and the public sector. The higher the level of
capital that financial institutions are required to hold, the lower the risk borne
by the public. But higher capital levels raise the costs of doing business and
thus raise the price of loans.
It is important to note that one of the most pressing tasks for everyone is
the proper consolidation of financial institutions’ balance sheets. The crisis
very clearly exposed the risks created by a shadow banking system that had
been spun off by regulated institutions. Therefore, the first order of business
in improving the management of capital is to bring all of these entities,
including structured investment vehicles and the like, within the regulatory
perimeter to ensure that appropriate capital is held against all financial
institution obligations. This will give managers, investors and supervisors a
more accurate picture of an institution’s exposures at the same time that it
raises the total amount of capital in the financial system.14
See, for example, Financial Services Authority, The Turner Review: a regulatory response to the global
banking crisis, March 2009, www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/other/turner_review.pdf.

13

Regulatory capital in the financial system is likely to increase as a consequence of several

and markets; a significant amount of off-balance sheet assets coming back onto the balance sheet of
financial institutions; provisioning that better reflects the build-up of risk; changes in the composition of

Box VII.B: Alternative rules for countercyclical capital buffers – an illustration
The crisis has focused attention on mechanisms for ensuring that banks adjust their capital (or loan
provisioning) countercyclically, building it up in good times and then drawing it down as stress
materialises. Researchers are examining a number of approaches, many of them still in the early stages
of development. Here we examine the feasibility of devising a rule that induces countercyclical
adjustments in minimum capital requirements.
Any rule for minimum capital must be designed in three steps: (1) choosing the indicator that
signals the time to build up and release the capital buffer; (2) choosing a formula that determines how
the indicator will modify the minimum capital requirement; and (3) choosing the minimum capital
requirement, which itself might vary cyclically. We illustrate the first two steps here.
For the first step, the following discussion covers three macroeconomic indicators on which
preliminary research has been reported in the literature (Graph VII.B.1): credit spreads (left-hand panel),
the change in real credit (centre panel) and a composite indicator that combines the credit/GDP ratio and
real asset prices (right-hand panel)., The ideal macroeconomic indicator would reliably identify both
the expansion and stress phases of the banking cycle. With that in mind, we present the variables as
deviations from their respective neutral levels, measured here by a trend or long-term average; and
the phases of the banking cycle are measured by deviations of the charge-off rate from its long-term
average.
Narrowed credit spreads could be a signal of good times, and a significant widening may indicate
the onset of a deterioration. However, the credit spread, measured here with BBB corporate bond
spreads, is not a reliable indicator of banking system stress. For example, in contrast to the historical
realities of banking stress, this indicator points to more serious financial strains after the collapse of the
dotcom bubble than in the early 1990s.
The second candidate indicator is the change in credit, a choice based on the idea that banks tend
to overextend credit before crises emerge and deleverage once strains materialise. However, credit
growth exhibits considerable inertia, and it remains well above the neutral level even as banking strains
begin to emerge. Hence, an indicator based on credit alone is likely to be late in signalling a release of
the buffer.
The third potential indicator draws on previous BIS research, which has found that when the
credit/GDP ratio and real asset prices simultaneously deviate by large amounts from their respective
trends, they provide a fairly reliable signal of impending banking crises with a considerable lead time.
Because the composite indicator requires that a real asset price and the ratio of credit to GDP exceed
thresholds at the same time, it avoids the late release of the buffer induced by the credit variable, but it
may trigger it too early.
In the second step – choosing the formula that determines how the indicator will modify the
minimum capital requirement – we examine the case in which the adjustment factor simply scales the

minimum capital requirement multiplicatively. When the indicator is at its neutral level, the multiple is
set to 1 so that the formula will make no adjustment to the buffer at that point. For illustrative purposes,
we consider three formulas that differ in how they treat the uncertainty that inevitably surrounds the
neutral level of the indicator and in their degree of symmetry with respect to adjustments to the
minimum requirement.
In its treatment of uncertainty around the neutral level, formula 1, unlike the other two formulas,
produces changes in the buffer that are steepest precisely around that level (Graph VII.B.2, left-hand
panel). In that way, formula 1 actually magnifies any errors in measuring the neutral level. Only formula 3
takes the uncertainty fully into account by not triggering an adjustment within a range around the neutral
value.
Regarding symmetry, formula 2 is unique in never being smaller than 1. Hence, regardless of the
state of the financial system, the buffer determined by formula 2 can never fall below the requirement
associated with the neutral level of the indicator. Whether that is desirable will depend on how the
minimum capital requirement is defined and how it is allowed to vary (step 3 of the procedure for
creating a rule). For example, if the minimum is highly procyclical and thus rises strongly in bad times,
this characteristic would effectively prevent any release of actual capital.
Finally, to illustrate how the formulas adjust the minimum requirement under actual historical
circumstances, an indicator is chosen for each formula: for formula 1, credit spreads (called here
adjustment 1); for formula 2, the change in real credit (adjustment 2); and for formula 3, the composite
indicator (adjustment 3). The results (Graph VII.B.2, centre and right-hand panels) support, on balance,
the tentative conclusions that came from the performance of the indicators.
Adjustment 1 performs well in the current crisis, for both the build-up and the release phases.
However, such a rule would have called for a large release of capital during and after the dotcom bust,
but nearly no release in the early 1990s when the banking system experienced strains in the United States.
Adjustment 2 presents an accurate signal for the build-up phase but is late in calling for the release,
both for the current crisis and for the previous period of stress in the early 1990s. The adjustment thus
reflects the lag with which credit growth falls after stress emerges.
Adjustment 3 provides a good signal for the build-up of the capital buffer but in some instances
implies premature release. In particular, for the current crisis, the signal would have called for release
starting at the end of 2006 for the United States, ahead of the first obvious signs of strain, owing to
property prices falling below the time-varying trend. Adjustments below 1, however, tend to occur too
late, indicating that combining formula 2 with this indicator would be more desirable.
This analysis, though merely illustrative, points to difficulties in developing robust rules to govern
countercyclical capital buffers. Finding macroeconomic variables that would reliably signal the
appropriate time for a release of the buffers appears to be especially challenging. Ultimately, the use of
some form of discretion to manage countercyclical buffers may prove to be inevitable.

Credit spreads taken from CDS have been suggested by M Gordy, and formula 1 has been constructed in the spirit of his
work: M Gordy, “First, do no harm – a hippocratic approach to procyclicality in Basel II”, paper presented at the conference
Procyclicality in the financial system, jointly organised by the Netherlands Bank and the Bretton Woods Committee,
9–10 February 2009. Credit growth and a formula similar to formula 2 have been suggested by C Goodhart and A Persaud,
“A party pooper’s guide to financial stability”, Financial Times, 4 June 2008. The composite indicator builds on C Borio and
M Drehmann, “Assessing the risk of banking crises – revisited”, BIS Quarterly Review, March 2009, pp 29–46.  While not
shown, indicators based on GDP alone were also assessed and were found to have a lower correlation with the measure of
financial strain than any of the variables considered here.  Borio and Drehmann also use equity price gaps for the asset
price portion of the composite indicator; equity prices have not played a crucial role in the current crisis and are therefore not
shown in Graph VII.B.1. However, both equity and property price gaps are included in adjustment 3, shown in Graph VII.B.2.
 If the formula is applied to Basel II rather than to some other minimum that is complementary to Basel II (such as a leverage
ratio), the multiplicative approach would have the desirable property of cross-sectional risk sensitivity – that is, it would
preserve risk differentiation across borrowers at any given time.

To conclude, determining the level and cyclical sensitivities of capital
requirements is a difficult task. But, then, so is setting the stance of either
monetary or fiscal policy. And as with conventional macroeconomic stabilisation
policy at the turn of the 20th century, it has become all too apparent today
that establishing a macroprudential orientation cannot be avoided and that
countercyclical capital charges are one of a number of tools that will be needed
for success.

Macroeconomic policies to enhance financial stability
The crisis has confirmed that the monetary and fiscal policy framework that
delivered the Great Moderation cannot be relied upon to stabilise prices and
real growth forever. The consensus today is that policymakers must be given
an explicit financial stability mandate and that they will need additional tools
to carry it out. The macroprudential approach to regulation and supervision
will form a part of that, but it is not likely to be enough. Macroeconomic
policies can and should have a role in meeting the goal of financial stability;
at the very least, they should not hinder it.
Fiscal and monetary policy already help short-circuit the reinforcing
feedback between the real economy and the financial system. Through automatic
stabilisers and discretionary stimulus, countercyclical fiscal policy sustains
income and employment, lowering the probability that borrowers will default (as
well as increasing the value of what is recovered if they do) and raising the value
of assets on financial institutions’ balance sheets. Monetary policy, too, acts
countercyclically. Seeking to head off a cyclical downturn, policymakers lower
policy rates and, in so doing, improve the state of financial institutions’ balance
sheets. Similarly, central bankers increase policy rates to moderate an upturn,
slowing credit growth and leaning against asset price booms. And ultimately,
central banks provide emergency lending facilities to prevent runs on individual
institutions from turning into system-wide panics – thus moderating a significant
source of systemic risk. Put another way, by reducing cyclical fluctuations in
the real economy, countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies naturally (and
intentionally) reduce the procyclicality of financial institutions’ capital.15
The ability of fiscal authorities to recapitalise banks during bad times can also be viewed as a tool
for addressing systemic risk. To institutionalise that ability to counter the procyclicality of the financial
system, however, government officials would have to create a fiscal reserve. Like the countercyclical capital
buffers for institutions, this reserve would rise during booms so that it can be drawn down during busts.

But monetary policy must go further. Stabilising the financial system
requires that central banks adopt a more activist stance, responding to booms
in both credit and asset prices. Past critiques of this approach remain valid. It
will be no easier in the future to identify bubbles and calibrate policies to
neutralise them than it was in the past. But the financial crisis has shown that
it is ultimately too costly for central bankers to focus narrowly on inflation over
relatively short horizons, with a view towards cleaning up the mess caused by
bursting bubbles and collapsing credit after the fact. The debate has moved on.
The issue is how monetary policymakers should expand their frameworks to
make room for property prices, equity prices and amounts of debt outstanding.
When they do make those adjustments, they will be in a position to implement
policies that lean against the wind, tightening interest rates when they see bubbles
and balance sheet overextensions that raise systemic, macroeconomic risks.
The expansion of the policy framework does not mean forsaking central
banks’ price stability objectives, as it is not aimed at changing long-term targets
or goals. Instead, it is aimed at adjusting the horizon over which policymakers
achieve their goals. When asset price and credit booms start to develop, they
are unlikely to threaten the short-run stability of prices or real growth. In fact,
they may go hand in hand with a combination of low consumer price inflation
(especially if the measure does not include house prices) and high growth. That
is, a boom in asset prices or credit can easily be mistaken for an increase in the
growth rate of productivity. It is important for policymakers to understand that
higher growth and lower inflation today can create instability tomorrow, and
policy frameworks must take this into account. When they see a boom in an
asset price or in credit, policymakers need to lengthen their policy horizon.
Such an approach would help to better achieve the goals of fiscal and monetary
policy: after all, macroeconomic stability is built on the foundations of a stable
financial system.

Summing up
We have no choice but to take up the challenge of first repairing and then
reforming the international financial system, all the while cushioning the
impact of the crisis on individuals’ ability to live productive lives. Efforts so far
have fully engaged fiscal, monetary and prudential and regulatory authorities
for nearly two years. The public resources devoted to economic stimulus and
financial rescue have been staggering, approaching 5% of world GDP – more
than anyone would have imagined even a year ago.
Recovery will come at some point, but there are major risks. First and
foremost, policies must aid adjustment, not hinder it. That means moving away
from leverage-led growth in industrial economies and export-led growth in
emerging market economies. It means repairing the financial system quickly,
persevering until the job of restructuring is complete. It means putting policy on
a sustainable path by reducing spending and raising taxes as soon as stable
growth returns. And it means the exit of central banks from the intermediation
business as soon as financial institutions settle on their new business models
and financial markets resume normal operations.

In the long term, addressing the broad failures revealed by the crisis and
building a more resilient financial system require that we identify and mitigate
systemic risk in all its guises. That, in turn, means organising financial
instruments, markets and institutions into a robust system that will be closer to
fail-safe than the one we have now: for instruments, a system that rates their
safety, limits their availability and provides warnings about their suitability and
risks; for markets, encouraging trading through central counterparties (CCPs)
and exchanges, making clear the dangers of transacting elsewhere; and for
institutions, the comprehensive application of enhanced prudential standards
combined with a system-wide perspective, beginning with the application of
something like a systemic capital charge (SCC) and a countercyclical capital
charge (CCC).
Successfully promoting financial stability requires that everyone
contribute. Monetary policymakers must take better account of asset price and
credit booms. Fiscal policymakers must ensure that their own actions are
consistent with medium-term fiscal discipline and long-term sustainability. And
regulators and supervisors must adopt a macroprudential perspective, worrying
at least as much about the stability of the system as a whole as they do about
the viability of an individual institution. An encompassing policy framework
with observable objectives and implementable tools is at an unfortunately
early stage of development. But the suggestions made here and elsewhere are
a start. The work will have to be coordinated internationally. In particular,
institutions with expertise in the field – including the Basel-based standardsetting committees and the Financial Stability Board – will need to play a leading
role in making such a framework operational. This is going to be a long and
complex task, but we have no choice. It has to be done.

BIS 79th Annual Report

Organisation, activities and financial results

This chapter reviews the organisation of the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS), summarises its activities for the financial year 2008/09 and presents its
financial results.

Organisation
The mission of the BIS is to serve central banks and financial authorities in
their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international
cooperation on such matters and to serve as a bank for central banks. The BIS
pursues this mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating decision-making among central
banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that have responsibility for
promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial system supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial
operations.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland, and representative
offices in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China and in Mexico City. At the end of the financial year, the BIS
employed 570 staff from 53 countries.

Departments and committees
The BIS has three main departments: the Monetary and Economic Department,
the Banking Department and the General Secretariat. These are supplemented
by: the Legal Service; the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit, Internal
Audit and Risk Control; and the Financial Stability Institute, which fosters the
dissemination of standards and best practices to financial system supervisors
worldwide.
The BIS hosts the secretariats of a number of groups that seek to promote
financial stability. Four committees, which enjoy a significant degree of
autonomy in setting their agendas and structuring their activities, were
established over the past 40 years:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems; and
•
the Markets Committee.

BIS 79th Annual Report

141

Three groups whose secretariats are hosted by the BIS do not report
directly to the BIS or its member central banks:
•
the Financial Stability Board (formerly the Financial Stability Forum);
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers; and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.
In addition, the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics, which
is governed by the international central banking community, operates under
the Bank’s auspices. The BIS also supports the work of the Central Bank
Counterfeit Deterrence Group.

Governance and management
There are three main decision-making levels in the governance and
management of the Bank:
•
the General Meeting of member central banks;
•
the Board of Directors; and
•
the General Manager.
The General Meeting. Fifty-five central banks or monetary authorities are
currently members of the BIS. These 55 member banks have rights of voting
and representation at General Meetings. The Annual General Meeting (AGM)
is held within four months from 31 March, the end of the BIS financial year.
The Board of Directors. The Board of Directors comprises 19 members.
Its main responsibilities are determining the strategic and policy direction of
the BIS and supervising the Bank’s Management. The Board is assisted by
four subcommittees of Board members: the Administrative Committee, the
Audit Committee, the Banking and Risk Management Committee and the
Nomination Committee.
The General Manager. The General Manager of the BIS is responsible to
the Board of Directors for the conduct of all important matters affecting the
BIS. The General Manager is advised by the Executive Committee of the BIS,
which consists of the General Manager as chair, the Deputy General Manager,
the Heads of Department and other officers of similar rank appointed by the
Board.

In accordance with Article 15 of its Statutes, the Bank’s capital is held by central banks only. The legal
status of the Yugoslav issue of the capital of the BIS is currently under review following the constitutional
changes in February 2003 which transformed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the State Union of
Serbia and Montenegro, establishing two separate central banks, and the Republic of Montenegro’s
subsequent declaration of independence from the State Union in May 2006.

146

BIS 79th Annual Report

The Board noted with deep regret the death of Lord George of St Tudy on
18 April 2009 at the age of 70. Lord George had served as an ex officio
Director of the Board while Governor of the Bank of England between 1993

It was with deep regret that the Bank learned of the death of Baron Jean
Godeaux, Honorary Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, on 27 April
2009 at the age of 86. Baron Godeaux had served on the Board as a Director
from 1982 to 1990, during which time he had served as President of the Bank
and Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1985 to 1987.
The Board also noted with deep sadness the death of Masaru Hayami,
former Governor of the Bank of Japan, on 16 May 2009 at the age of 84. Mr
Hayami had served on the Board as a Director from 1998 to 2003.
As regards the senior officials of the Bank, upon the resignation of
Malcolm D Knight on 30 September 2008, Hervé Hannoun exercised the
responsibilities of General Manager under the title of Acting General Manager
until the date upon which a new General Manager took up his duties. Jaime
Caruana was appointed as the Bank’s new General Manager for a period of
five years from 1 April 2009.
At its meeting in March 2009, the Board reappointed Peter Dittus as the
Bank’s Secretary General for a period of five years beginning on 1 January 2010.
Daniel Lefort, the Bank’s present General Counsel, will retire from the BIS
with effect from 30 September 2009. At its meeting in May 2009, the Board

years beginning on 1 October 2009.
At the same meeting, the Board reappointed Günter Pleines as Head of
the Banking Department for a period of three years and one month from 1 April
2010.

Institutional and administrative matters

The Bank’s administration
Budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next financial
year starts about six months in advance with the setting by Management of a
broad business orientation and financial framework. Within this context, business
areas specify their plans and the corresponding resource requirements. The
process of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and overall resource
availability culminates in the determination of a draft financial budget. This
must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
In drawing up the budget, a distinction is made between administrative
and capital expenditures. In common with other organisations of a similar

BIS 79th Annual Report

147

nature to the BIS, Management and staff expense, including remuneration,
pensions and health and accident insurance, amounts to around 70% of
administrative costs. Other major categories, each accounting for around 10%
of administrative spending, are expenditure on information technology (IT) and
telecommunications, and on buildings and equipment. Capital spending mainly
relates to building and IT investment expenditure, and can vary significantly
from year to year. Most of the Bank’s administrative and capital expenditure is
incurred in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenses before depreciation for the financial year 2008/09
amounted to 237.9 million Swiss francs, 4.6% below the budget of 247.9 million
Swiss francs,3 while capital expenditure, at 22.1 million Swiss francs, was
2.9 million under budget. The main contributor to the underspending in
administrative expenses was the impact of the lower than budgeted headcount,
which arose from delays in recruitment for open staff positions. Spending on
the Bank’s data centre and on other IT and telecommunications items was also
below budget.
Administrative and capital expenditure in 2008/09 reflected the priorities
set in the budget, chief among them the further strengthening of the resilience
of the BIS and its capacity to deal with unforeseen developments. This involved
the following measures:
•
Against the background of the market turbulence which began in August
2007, budget provisions were created for additional staff positions in
the Banking Department, the Financial Stability Forum (now the Financial
Stability Board) and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The required
reallocation of resources was achieved by reducing staff positions in the
General Secretariat, in particular by outsourcing certain IT activities.
•
The Bank’s second data centre was relocated to a remote site to give
greater assurance of business continuity and service to customers in the
event of a major disruption in Basel.
The work of the Bank during the financial year was dominated by the
need to deal with the challenges posed by the intensifying global financial
crisis, and the Bank’s resources were reoriented to cope with the resulting
workload. This was achieved within the budget ceiling, and involved the
following initiatives:
•
The Monetary and Economic Department changed the focus of its work
programmes and redirected its staff to concentrate on financial stability
issues that came to the fore in the crisis, both in its support for the
committees hosted at the BIS and in its research activities.
•
The Banking Department and the Risk Control and Finance units took a
series of measures to reduce the Bank’s financial risks, which involved
reducing credit risk through increased investment in sovereign and quasisovereign assets, shortening the duration of the financial instruments on
both sides of the balance sheet, and taking a number of steps to protect
The Bank’s budgetary accounting is cash-based and excludes certain financial accounting adjustments,
principally relating to retirement benefit obligations, which take into account financial market and
actuarial developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” disclosed in
the profit and loss account (see “Financial results and profit distribution”).

the Bank’s liabilities. These measures, together with the volatility that
arose from dislocated financial markets, increased the operational
workload of the banking activity and additional staff resources were
allocated to deal with the extra work.
Work also continued on the following initiatives to meet the needs of the
Bank’s shareholders:
•
the expansion of BIS services to deepen relations with shareholders
in the Asia-Pacific region through continuation of the Asian research
programme;
•
the creation of a Consultative Council for the Americas; and
•
the completion of multi-year projects to enhance meeting facilities and
safety in Basel.
In March 2009, the Board approved an increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2009/10 of 4.0% to 259.2 million Swiss francs. The
capital budget foresees a decrease of 3.1 million Swiss francs to 21.9 million.
The main priority in framing the budgets for 2009/10 is to reinforce the Bank’s
response to the global financial crisis as follows:
•
Resources devoted to financial stability issues will be increased by the
creation of additional staff positions to support the work of the Financial
Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the
Committee on the Global Financial System in handling their increased
responsibilities and workload.
•
Dealing with the impact of the financial crisis on the BIS banking
business will continue to be the main priority of the Banking Department
and the Risk Control, Finance and Compliance units. Work in the banking
business will be oriented towards controlling the size and enhancing the
management of the banking operations through initiatives to implement
integrated risk management and enhance management accounting.
In addition, the budget for 2009/10 provides for the further development
of the Bank’s global outreach through support for the Consultative Council
for the Americas and through the creation of a permanent economics research
unit at the Asian Office following the completion of the Asian research
programme in September 2009. The visitors’ restaurant facilities in the Tower
building in Basel will also be upgraded after over 30 years of use.

Remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a
number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades
are associated with a structure of salary ranges. Every three years, a
comprehensive salary survey is conducted in which BIS salaries are
benchmarked against compensation in comparable institutions and market
segments. When benchmarking BIS salaries against comparators, the Bank
focuses on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly
qualified staff. The analysis takes into account differences in the taxation of
compensation for the staff of the surveyed institutions. The most recent such
survey took place in the second half of 2007, with the benchmark data

BIS 79th Annual Report

149

collected reflecting the comparator market as of 1 July 2007. As of 1 July 2008,
the midpoints of the Bank’s salary ranges were aligned with those observed
market benchmarks and the estimated change in external market salaries in
the intervening period. The latter adjustment, based on the rate of inflation
in Switzerland and the weighted average real wage increase in industrial
countries, amounted to 2.0%. Movements of salaries of individual staff
members within the ranges of the salary structure are based on performance.
BIS staff members have access through the Bank to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-locally
hired, non-Swiss staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters, including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation
allowance. In proportion to annual salary, it currently amounts to 14% for
unmarried staff members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education
allowance for their children subject to certain conditions.4 With regard to
employment in the Representative Offices, a distinction is made between staff
members transferred from the headquarters and staff members recruited
directly for a position in a Representative Office. The employment conditions
of transferred staff are determined in accordance with the Bank’s international
assignment policy. For staff recruited directly, employment conditions are
aligned with those in the market in which the Office is located. Those staff
members have access to the same health insurance and pension plans as staff
engaged at the Bank’s headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As with the
survey for other staff, the most recent executive compensation survey took
place in the second half of 2007. The results confirmed the appropriateness of
the current practice of annually adjusting the salaries of senior officials for the
rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2008, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before
expatriation allowances, is based on the following salary structure:
739,400 Swiss francs
•
General Manager5
•
Deputy General Manager
625,650 Swiss francs
•
Heads of Department
568,770 Swiss francs
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of
the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years. The
overall fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors amounts to a
total of 1,049,520 Swiss francs as at 1 April 2009. In addition, Board members
receive an attendance fee for each Board meeting in which they participate.
Assuming the full Board is represented in all Board meetings, the annual total
of these attendance fees amounts to 973,788 Swiss francs.

Certain staff members who joined the Bank before 1997 receive an expatriation allowance of 25%,
but are not entitled to receive an education allowance.

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

Regular consultations on monetary and financial matters
Every two months, the Governors and other senior officials of the BIS member
central banks convene for a series of meetings to discuss current
developments and the outlook for the world economy and financial markets.
They also exchange views and experiences on issues of special and topical
interest to central banks. These bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel,
are one of the most important ways in which the Bank promotes cooperation
within the central banking community. The November 2008 BIS bimonthly
meetings took place in São Paulo and were hosted by the Central Bank of
Brazil.
The bimonthly meetings comprise, in particular, the Global Economy
Meeting and the All Governors’ Meeting. The Global Economy Meeting, which
brings together more than 30 Governors of key advanced and emerging market
economies, monitors economic and financial developments and assesses the
risks and opportunities in the world economy and financial markets.
The All Governors’ Meeting, in which all shareholding member central
bank Governors participate, discusses selected topics that are of general interest
to all BIS member central banks. In 2008/09, the topics discussed were:
•
the procyclicality of the financial system;
•
the lessons of the global banking crisis;
•
foreign currency liquidity pressures, dislocation in foreign exchange
swap markets and central bank responses;
•
money market interest rates and operational monetary policy targets; and
•
central bank liquidity operations: lessons from the current turmoil.
Because not all central banks are directly involved in the work of the
Basel-based committees and other organisations hosted by the Bank, the All
Governors’ Meetings also represent an opportunity to review the activities of
these specialised groupings. In 2008/09, Governors discussed, for instance,
the Basel Committee initiatives to respond to the financial crisis.
Other regular meetings that take place during the bimonthly gatherings are
those of Governors of the G10 countries and of Governors of major emerging
market economies, which explore themes that are of special relevance to the
respective groups of economies. Governors who are members of the Central
Bank Governance Group also meet on a regular basis.
In analysing issues related to financial stability, Governors meet with
heads of supervisory agencies, other financial authorities and senior
executives from the private financial sector. In particular, the Bank hosts
regular joint meetings of Governors and heads of supervision; in 2008/09 this
grouping discussed, among other topics, the enhancements to the Basel II
Framework and specific areas in which the resiliency of the financial system
could be strengthened.

BIS 79th Annual Report

The Bank regularly organises informal discussions among public and
private sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting
a sound and well functioning international financial system. In addition, the
Bank organises various other meetings for senior central bank officials on a
regular or ad hoc basis. In a number of these meetings, other financial
authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community are
invited to contribute to the dialogue.
Other meetings organised for senior central bankers on a less frequent
basis include:
•
the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted on a regional basis by a number of central banks
in Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America; and
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies, for
which this year’s theme was “Monetary policy and the measurement of
inflation: prices, wages and expectations”.

Representative Offices
The Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (Asian Office) and that for
the Americas (Americas Office) aim to strengthen relations between the BIS
and central banks and financial supervisory authorities in the respective
regions, and to promote cooperation within each region. The Offices organise
meetings, foster the exchange of information and data, and contribute to the
Bank’s financial and economic research. The Offices also help to deliver BIS
banking services through regular visits to reserve managers in central banks
and meetings at both technical and managerial levels.

Asia-Pacific
During the past year, the BIS responded to the needs of its Asian regional
shareholders by organising high-level meetings and pursuing research on
issues related to the ongoing financial turmoil. Drawing on the resources of
the Asian research programme, the Asian Office held eight events, each
organised jointly with a shareholding central bank or a regional central bank
organisation:
•
the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP)–BIS
Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets, organised with the Bank of Japan,
in Yokohama in July 2008;
•
the Central Bank Workshop on the Microstructure of Financial Markets,
organised with the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, in Hong
Kong SAR in September 2008;
•
the Reserve Bank of India–BIS High-Level Seminar on Lessons from the
Financial Crisis, in Hyderabad in December 2008;
•
the EMEAP–BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets, organised with the
Bank of Japan, in Tokyo in December 2008;
•
the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN)–BIS Executive Seminar on
Global Shocks and Economic Stability, organised with Bank Indonesia, in
Yogyakarta in January 2009;

152

BIS 79th Annual Report

•

the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research–BIS Conference on
Property Markets and Finance, in Hong Kong SAR in January 2009; and
•
the Bank of Korea–BIS High-Level Seminar on Currency Internationalisation:
Lessons from the Financial Crisis, in Seoul in March 2009.
In November 2008, the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) and the EMEAP
Working Group on Banking Supervision convened their annual high-level
meeting in Asia. Hosted by the People’s Bank of China in Beijing, the meeting
focused on the role of banking and banking supervision in financial stability.
In addition, the FSI organised 10 seminars for financial sector supervisors in
the Asian region that in most cases focused on topics and issues highlighted
by the current financial crisis.

Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
The dealing room of the Asian Office continued to focus on meeting
customers’ needs as the financial crisis unfolded. Central banks in the region
have maintained a cautious stance in their reserve portfolio management in
the current strained environment.
As fund administrator, the BIS continued to provide support for public
offerings of the bond funds under EMEAP’s second Asian Bond Fund (ABF2)
initiative. Eleven central banks provided seed money from their international
reserves for funds invested in sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds from
eight EMEAP economies. The total size of the fund was $2.86 billion at the end
of March 2009, down from $3.3 billion at the end of March 2008. Private sector
investment decreased further to $427 million at the end of March 2009 from
$765 million at the end of March 2008; central bank holdings, which stood at
$2.43 billion, were down from $2.5 billion at the end of March 2008.
The fourth annual rebalancing of ABF2 was carried out in the final two
months of 2008.
Negotiations are progressing to resolve the major outstanding issues on
the China fund, one of the eight single-country funds which make up ABF2,
with a view to launching an open-ended fund in China in the next few months.
The BIS provided assistance to the fund manager at the suggestion of the
EMEAP working group.

Asian Consultative Council and the BIS Special Governors’ Meeting in Asia
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC), currently chaired by Zeti Akhtar Aziz,
Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, provides Governors of shareholding
central banks in Asia and the Pacific with a formal means of communicating
with the BIS Board and Management. At the Council’s two meetings this year,
Governors focused their discussions on meetings to be organised and research
to be carried out under the three-year Asian research programme (see below).
The Governors reported their views on these matters to the BIS Board and
Management, attaching priority to work related to policy issues raised by the
global financial turmoil.
In February, the BIS once again organised a Special Governors’ Meeting,
this time hosted by the Central Bank of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, bringing
together Governors from Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. Governors discussed

BIS 79th Annual Report

153

recent economic and financial developments and the lessons of the global
financial crisis for financial stability in Asia and the Pacific.

Asian research programme
The three-year Asian research programme entered its final phase, with
completion scheduled for August 2009. Developments in the region dictated
that the programme devote considerable attention to the implications of the
international financial crisis for Asia and the Pacific. Progress continues on a
series of research projects that are intended to help regional authorities
improve monetary policy and operations, develop financial markets, maintain
financial stability and strengthen prudential policy.
By the end of the programme, collaborative research on topics of interest
to central banks and supervisors in the region will have been organised with
almost every shareholding central bank in Asia and the Pacific, as well as with
regional organisations of central banks. This research has not only fed into the
numerous meetings organised with regional central banks, but has also led to
the publication of several articles in refereed journals and the Bank’s Quarterly
Review. Economists in the Asian research programme also wrote notes on
special policy issues at the request of the ACC Governors. Two Asian research
networks organised under the research programme held their second annual
workshops in January. The success of the three-year programme has led to a
decision to establish a stepped-up research presence in the region on a more
permanent basis.

The Americas
Given the financial turmoil in major developed countries, the work of the
Americas Office centred on closely monitoring developments that would
indicate vulnerabilities in the region – in particular, spillovers to the economies
of Latin America and the Caribbean.
BIS efforts in the region, as in recent years, were devoted not only to BIS
member central banks but also to contacts and events with non-shareholding
central banks, regulatory authorities and the academic community, which
resulted in several publications. Noteworthy activities included the organisation
of a panel discussion with regional central bank Governors as well as several
parallel sessions at the annual meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean
Economic Association (LACEA) in Brazil. The Office also co-organised the
second regional BIS meeting of heads of internal audit, held in cooperation
with the Central Bank of Chile, hosted a regional meeting of central bank
general counsels in Mexico City and contributed to BIS meetings hosted by
regional central banks, such as the Working Party on Monetary Policy in Latin
America, convened at the Colombian central bank.
The Americas Office also supported FSI regional events and a BIS
seminar on “Financial stability analysis and reports”, organised with the Centre
for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA). The Office contributed research
and speakers to events organised by the Central Bank of Brazil, Bank of
Canada and Central Reserve Bank of Peru as well as the Caribbean Centre for
Money and Finance, the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas,

154

BIS 79th Annual Report

the Fondo Latinoamericano de Reservas, the International Association of
Deposit Insurers, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations.

Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA)
In May 2008, the Bank established the Consultative Council for the Americas
(CCA) as an advisory committee to the Board. The CCA, which is currently
chaired by Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina,
comprises the Governors of the BIS member central banks in the Americas.
Its purpose is to provide a vehicle for direct communication between the BIS
member central banks in the Americas and the BIS Board and Management
on matters of interest to the central bank community in the region. The
Americas Office provides secretariat support to the CCA.
The CCA met for the first time on the occasion of the BIS Annual General
Meeting in June 2008 and has held two subsequent meetings. CCA members
are regularly informed of the work of the BIS and the Americas Office in the
region and are invited to comment on ongoing work.

Financial Stability Institute
The mandate of the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) is to assist financial sector
supervisory authorities worldwide in strengthening oversight of their financial
systems, thereby fostering financial stability globally. The FSI conducts a
programme designed to disseminate standards and sound practices primarily
to the banking and insurance supervision sectors. The work of the FSI benefits
from the fact that the BIS hosts the standard-setting bodies for banking and
insurance supervision. The synergies and consultations that arise from this
close proximity have come to be referred to as the Basel Process, described
in the next section.

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The first component of the FSI programme is the long-standing series of
high-level meetings, seminars and conferences held both in Basel and at
venues in various regions of the world. In 2008, the FSI organised a total of
50 events. While these continued to cover a broad range of financial sector
topics, emphasis was placed on issues related directly to financial stability.
More than 1,850 representatives of central banks and banking and insurance
supervisory authorities participated. The FSI also continued its series of
high-level meetings for Deputy Governors and heads of supervisory
authorities, with such meetings taking place in Africa, Asia, Latin America and
the Middle East. These meetings focused on the financial crisis as well as
Basel II implementation and other key supervisory issues.

FSI Connect
The second component of the FSI programme is FSI Connect, an online
information resource and learning tool for financial sector supervisors. FSI
Connect includes more than 160 tutorials covering a wide range of topics for
supervisors at all levels of experience and expertise. More than 170 central

BIS 79th Annual Report

155

banks and supervisory authorities subscribe to FSI Connect, representing
approximately 8,000 users. In 2008, with the endorsement of the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors, BIS Management approved a second
phase of development to specifically address insurance sector supervision.
Approximately 25 tutorials will be developed over the next few years, dealing
with insurance risks and related supervisory issues and techniques. Moreover,
with the support of the International Association of Deposit Insurers, several
tutorials related to deposit insurance will be added to FSI Connect over the
course of 2009. These two initiatives will further enhance the BIS’s contribution
to financial sector stability.

Other major initiatives
In 2008, the FSI updated its 2004 and 2006 surveys on Basel II implementation
efforts in non-Basel Committee member countries. Consistent with the results of
the previous surveys, the 2008 survey indicates that Basel II will be implemented
by the overwhelming majority of the 101 respondents to the most recent
survey. Including Basel Committee countries, nearly 90 jurisdictions planned
to implement Basel II by the end of 2008. One difference from the preceding
two surveys is the increased number of countries permitting their banks to
implement the more advanced approaches for credit and operational risk.

Promotion of international financial and monetary cooperation: the
Basel Process
One of the main ways in which the BIS contributes to promoting international
financial and monetary stability is through cooperation of the committees and
standard-setting bodies hosted by the BIS and located in Basel. This approach
is increasingly referred to as “the Basel Process” for the promotion of
international financial and monetary cooperation.
The Basel Process is based on four key ingredients:
•
First, the BIS hosts, and provides staff and financial resources for, a
number of committees that address the key elements of financial stability.
These include the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is
concerned with supervision at the level of individual institutions; the
Committee on the Global Financial System, which monitors macrofinancial
stability issues; the Markets Committee, which examines the functioning
of financial markets; and the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems, which examines the payments infrastructure. In addition, the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the International
Association of Deposit Insurers are hosted by the BIS. Furthermore, most
of the Basel-based committees contribute to the work of the Financial
Stability Board, also hosted by the BIS. The synergies created by physical
proximity and the resulting exchange of ideas among these groups have
been considerable.
•
Second, the flexibility of these groups and the openness in the exchange
of information among policymakers enhance the coordination of their

156

BIS 79th Annual Report

work on financial stability issues and help avoid overlaps and gaps in
their work programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger
than their size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise
of the international community of central bankers, financial regulators
and supervisors.
•
Third, the work of the Basel-based committees is informed by the
analytical and statistical inputs of the BIS’s economic research and its
banking activities, in particular through the Banking Department’s working
relationships with market participants and the implementation of regulatory
standards and financial controls for the conduct of banking operations.
•
Finally, dissemination of the standard-setting bodies’ work is facilitated
by the FSI.
The activities of each of the committees and standard-setting bodies
during the past year are reported below.

The permanent committees hosted by the BIS

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, chaired by Nout Wellink,
President of the Netherlands Bank, seeks to improve supervisory
understanding and the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It provides a
forum for dialogue among supervisors by exchanging information on national
supervisory arrangements, by improving the effectiveness of techniques
for supervising international banking business, and by setting minimum
supervisory standards in areas where they are considered desirable.

Responses to the financial crisis
Based on its assessment of the supervisory, regulatory and risk management
weaknesses revealed by the crisis, the Basel Committee established a
comprehensive strategy to address the lessons in these areas. The Committee
initiated and in some cases accelerated work related to a variety of supervisory
and risk management topics, including liquidity risk, stress testing and bank
valuation practices. The market turmoil also provided important lessons that
have helped guide the Basel Committee in further strengthening the Basel II
Framework and other elements of capital adequacy regulation. Taken together,
these initiatives are a core element of global efforts to strengthen the resilience
of the banking and broader financial system.

Strengthening capital adequacy
The crisis has underscored the importance of a strong capital base for a
robust banking sector. In its work on capital adequacy, the Committee’s goal
is to raise the level and quality of capital in the banking system so as to
increase banks’ resilience to future episodes of economic and financial stress
and enhance confidence in the global banking system. This work includes
developing ways to mitigate procyclicality, for example by promoting capital
buffers above the regulatory minimum that can be drawn upon during periods

BIS 79th Annual Report

157

of stress. These efforts also support the initiatives and recommendations of
the Financial Stability Board and the G20 leaders.

The Basel II Framework
In response to market events, the Basel Committee undertook a review of the
Basel II Framework in 2008 to identify areas that could be strengthened. Based
on this review, the Committee issued a package of consultative documents in
January 2009.
The proposed enhancements, which the Committee expects to finalise in
the course of 2009, will help ensure that the risks inherent in banks’ portfolios
related to trading activities, securitisations and exposures to off-balance
sheet vehicles are better reflected in minimum capital requirements, risk
management practices and accompanying disclosures to the public. The
Committee intends to coordinate and implement this work programme in a
manner that strengthens financial confidence and avoids aggravating current
market conditions. It will not recommend increasing required global minimum
capital ratios during periods of economic and financial stress.
The January 2009 consultative package set out enhancements to
minimum capital requirements (Pillar 1) that focus on strengthening the risk
coverage of the Framework, including the regulatory capital treatment for
trading book exposures. Most of the build-up of leverage prior to the financial
crisis, and the majority of losses since the crisis began, occurred in banks’
trading books. An important contributing factor was that the current capital
framework for market risk, based on the 1996 amendments to Basel I, does not
capture some key risks. In response, the Committee proposed supplementing
the current value-at-risk trading book framework with an incremental risk
charge (IRC), which includes default risk as well as migration risk. Once
implemented, the IRC will reduce the incentive for regulatory arbitrage
between the banking and trading books.
An additional proposed response is the introduction of a stressed valueat-risk requirement, which will help reduce the procyclicality of the minimum
capital requirements for market risk. The Committee announced that it will
conduct a longer-term, fundamental review of the capital framework for
trading activities.
The crisis has clearly shown that collateralised debt obligations consisting
of asset-backed securities (CDOs of ABS – so-called “resecuritisations”) are
more highly correlated with systematic risk than traditional securitisations.
Resecuritisations therefore warrant a higher capital charge as proposed in the
January 2009 consultative package.
Prior to the onset of the financial crisis, banks had built up significant
exposures to off-balance sheet conduits, which were not adequately
reflected in the capital regime. In response, the Committee proposed an
increase in capital requirements for liquidity lines extended to support
asset-backed commercial paper conduits by eliminating the distinction
between short-term and long-term liquidity facilities. The Committee also
proposed a requirement that banks obtain comprehensive information about
the underlying exposure characteristics of their externally rated securitisation

158

BIS 79th Annual Report

positions. Failure to obtain such information would result in higher capital
requirements.
Through the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) of the Basel II
Framework, the Committee also introduced standards to promote more
rigorous supervision and risk management of risk concentrations, off-balance
sheet exposures, securitisations and related reputational risks. It further
proposed improvements to valuations of financial instruments, the
management of funding liquidity risks and firm-wide stress testing practices.
Moreover, the Committee introduced enhanced disclosure requirements
to promote better market discipline. These Pillar 3 requirements relate to
securitisations and sponsorship of off-balance sheet vehicles and should
provide market participants with a better understanding of an institution’s
overall risk profile.

Procyclicality
An additional dimension of the Committee’s capital-related work concerns
procyclicality. In 2008, the Committee initiated a comprehensive, top-down
review of the capital levels and cyclicality implied by the Basel II Framework,
taking into account the interaction with broader macroprudential objectives.
The aim is to promote adequate capital buffers over the credit cycle and to
mitigate the risk that excessive cyclicality of the minimum capital requirement
amplifies the procyclicality of the financial system.
The Committee has put in place a comprehensive capital monitoring
framework to track the impact of Basel II on the minimum required and total
capital levels and the procyclicality of those levels.
With a particular focus on the composition of Tier 1 capital, the Committee
is evaluating ways to build additional buffers above the regulatory minimum
that can be drawn upon in stress conditions. It also initiated a review of the
treatment of loan loss provisions under Basel II and ways to strengthen
incentives to raise such provisions in good times.
In 2008/09, the Committee also began an evaluation of concrete ways to
supplement the Basel II risk-based capital framework with a simple, transparent
measure of gross exposure, such as a leverage ratio. Such a measure could
provide an independent measure of risk and capital, help contain leverage and
put a simple floor under the risk-based measure.

Liquidity risk management and supervision
The market turmoil re-emphasised the importance of liquidity to the
functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. In response, the
Basel Committee in September 2008 issued enhanced global Principles for
sound liquidity risk management and supervision, which were endorsed by
bank supervisors meeting at the biennial International Conference of Banking
Supervisors.
The sound liquidity principles support one of the key recommendations
for strengthening prudential oversight set out in the April 2008 Report of the
Financial Stability Forum on enhancing market and institutional resilience. The
principles were designed to strengthen banks’ liquidity risk management.

BIS 79th Annual Report

159

They focus on the governance, measurement and management of banks’
liquidity risk and require that banks maintain a strong liquidity buffer. A formal
assessment of implementation will take place in 2009.
The Basel Committee is also working to promote greater consistency in
liquidity risk supervision. This includes the potential for harmonised supervisory
benchmarks and metrics, and increased information sharing between
supervisors of cross-border banks.

Stress testing
The financial crisis has demonstrated the importance of stress testing as an
integral part of any bank’s risk management, liquidity and capital planning
process. This tool plays a critical role in strengthening not only bank corporate
governance but also the resilience of individual banks and the financial
system. To address weaknesses in stress testing, the Basel Committee issued
a consultative paper entitled Principles for sound stress testing practices and
supervision in January 2009.
The paper presents principles for the governance, design and
implementation of stress testing programmes at banks. It defines expectations
for the role and responsibilities of supervisors in reviewing firms’ stress testing
practices, and emphasises that a sound stress testing programme should,
among other things, be directed by the board and senior management, provide
forward-looking assessments of risk, and be an integral part of capital and
liquidity planning.

Bank valuation practices
The Basel Committee concluded that, while current valuation practices and
processes were not the underlying cause of the market turmoil, they
contributed to it and amplified its effects. In April 2009, the Committee issued
Supervisory guidance for assessing banks’ financial instrument fair value
practices. The guidance strengthens banks’ valuation processes for financial
instruments. It will help supervisors assess the rigour of banks’ valuation
processes and promote improvements in risk management and control
practices.

Implementation of standards
The financial crisis has highlighted the importance of prudent, informed
standards and supervisory guidance. In response, the Basel Committee
announced in January 2009 that it was broadening the mandate of its Accord
Implementation Group (AIG), which had focused on implementation of the
Basel II Framework. The AIG was renamed the Standards Implementation
Group (SIG), and its focus is on promoting the implementation of Basel
Committee guidance and standards more generally, in an internationally
coordinated and consistent manner.

Supervisory cooperation for cross-border banks
In 2008, the Committee evaluated the various issues associated with the
resolution of complex global banking organisations. Further examination and

160

BIS 79th Annual Report

a detailed consideration of individual bank failures and rescues are necessary.
The Committee’s final report in September 2009 will draw the lessons of the
current crisis for bank resolution mechanisms and their application across
borders.

Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems
In March 2009, the Basel Committee and the International Association of Deposit
Insurers issued a consultative document on Core Principles for Effective
Deposit Insurance Systems. The Core Principles respond to one of the lessons
of the financial crisis: the need for effective systems of deposit insurance to help
maintain public confidence. They set an important benchmark for countries to
use in establishing or reforming deposit insurance systems and address a
range of issues, including deposit insurance coverage, funding and prompt
reimbursement. They also address issues related to public awareness, resolution
of failed institutions and cooperation with other safety net participants.

Expanded membership and outreach
In 2009, the Basel Committee and its governance body – central bank Governors
and heads of supervision – agreed to expand the Committee’s membership
and invite representatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong
SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South
Africa and Turkey to join. The Committee believes that this expansion in
membership will enhance its ability to carry out its core mission.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), chaired by
Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, monitors financial market developments and analyses their
implications for financial stability.
The deepening financial crisis shaped the Committee’s work in the period
under review. The CGFS discussed in particular:
•
the condition of international banks and their responses to growing
pressure on funding and capital;
•
the consequences of dysfunctional credit markets and the broader
economic impact of disruption in credit supply;
•
changes in the supply of cross-border bank financing in response to the
crisis; and
•
government and central bank support measures and their impact on
financial market conditions.
In addition, the Committee established various groups to review specific
aspects of the financial crisis. A joint CGFS–Financial Stability Forum working
group investigated the role of valuation and leverage in the procyclicality of
the financial system. This topic was also discussed at a roundtable with
private sector participants and accounting standard setters in Paris. A second
group has been asked to examine, jointly with the Markets Committee, central

BIS 79th Annual Report

161

bank credit policies. The CGFS also established a group to review possible
enhancements to credit risk transfer statistics collected under its auspices.
In mid-2008, the CGFS published three reports that analyse issues
pertinent to the financial crisis: developments in private equity and leveraged
finance markets; central bank operations in response to the financial turmoil;
and the role of ratings in structured finance. A January 2009 report, Capital
flows and emerging market economies, includes a preliminary assessment of the
impact of the financial crisis on major emerging market economies.
CGFS: www.bis.org/cgfs

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), chaired by
William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, contributes to the strengthening of financial market
infrastructure by promoting safe and efficient payment and settlement systems.
During the year, the Committee published two reports:
•
The interdependencies of payment and settlement systems, which
identifies the various interconnections that exist among systems, analyses
the risk implications of the resulting interdependencies, and assesses
the associated risk management challenges. The report concludes that
tighter interdependencies among systems have helped to strengthen the
global infrastructure by reducing several sources of settlement costs and
risks but have also increased the potential for disruptions to spread quickly
and widely. The report therefore suggests a number of actions that industry
participants, as well as central banks and other authorities, could take to
adapt their policies to the increasingly interconnected nature of systems.
•
Progress in reducing foreign exchange settlement risk, which concludes
that, while much progress has been made, potentially significant risk
remains. It therefore recommends actions to be taken by individual
institutions, industry groups and central banks. These actions include
working with banking supervisors and other regulators to explore options
that could ensure that banks apply appropriate risk management
procedures to their foreign exchange settlement exposures.
The CPSS also:
•
identified potential actions that central banks could take, on an individual
or coordinated basis, to strengthen their operational readiness to provide
cross-border liquidity in emergencies;
•
cooperated with the Basel Committee to identify sound practices for
banks’ management of intraday liquidity risks, as described in the Basel
Committee’s Principles for sound liquidity risk management and
supervision; and
•
monitored the impact of the financial crisis on the functioning of payment
and settlement systems and continued to share information on the
clearing of over-the-counter derivatives transactions.
The Committee continued to enhance cooperation among central banks,
including those of emerging market economies. It also provided support and

162

BIS 79th Annual Report

expertise to workshops and seminars on payment system issues organised by
the BIS in cooperation with regional central banking organisations.
CPSS: www.bis.org/cpss

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Executive Director of the
Bank of Japan, serves as a forum for major central banks to jointly monitor
developments in financial markets and discuss the specifics of their market
operations. It brings together senior officials responsible for market operations.
Dislocations in money, credit and foreign exchange markets, and central
bank initiatives to alleviate them, remained at the centre of the Committee’s
discussions in the past year. Steps were taken to further enhance the technical
cooperation among its members, including: more frequent and detailed
discussions about market developments; timely exchanges of information in
periods of tension; discussions of measures to address market dislocations;
and sharing of documentation to deepen the common understanding of central
banks’ operational frameworks. Furthermore, the Compendium on monetary
policy frameworks and central bank market operations was updated. The
Committee was also involved in the preparation of the CGFS report on Central
bank operations in response to the financial turmoil, published in July 2008.
Recently, a Markets Committee study group was asked to examine central
bank credit policies, together with the CGFS.
In addition to its bimonthly meetings, the Committee held special
meetings, sometimes with the private sector, to address topics of a more
structural nature, such as changes in commodity markets or the spillover of
the financial crisis to emerging markets. The Committee organised its second
Working Party on Markets in Latin America with central banks and market
participants from the region in November 2008.
Markets Committee: www.bis.org/markets

Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group
The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) is mandated to
investigate threats to the security of banknotes and to propose common
solutions for implementation by note-issuing authorities. The CBCDG has
developed anti-counterfeiting features to prevent banknote images from being
replicated by colour copiers and digital technology (personal computers,
printers and scanners). The BIS supports the work of the CBCDG by hosting
its Secretariat and by acting as its agent in contractual arrangements.

BIS contributions to broader international financial cooperation

Group of Ten
The Bank continued to contribute to the work of the G10 Finance Ministers and
central bank Governors by participating as an observer institution and providing

BIS 79th Annual Report

163

secretariat support. During the year under review, the Group operated under
the Chairmanship of the Dutch Minister of Finance. As no meetings were held
during the year, written procedures were used to address questions relating to
performance-related compensation and financial stability.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which was established in April 2009 as
the successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), promotes international
financial stability through enhanced information exchange and cooperation
in financial supervision and surveillance. Specifically, the mandate of the FSB
is to:
•
assess vulnerabilities affecting the financial system, and identify and
oversee action needed to address them;
•
promote coordination and information exchange among authorities
responsible for financial stability;
•
monitor and advise on market developments and their implications for
regulatory policy;
•
advise on and monitor best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
•
undertake joint strategic reviews of the policy development work of the
international standard-setting bodies to ensure that their work is timely,
coordinated and focused on priorities and is addressing gaps;
•
set guidelines for supervisory colleges, support their establishment and
functioning, and encourage participation in them, including through ongoing
identification of the most systemically important cross-border firms;
•
support contingency planning for cross-border crisis management,
particularly with respect to systemically important firms; and
•
collaborate with the IMF to conduct early warning exercises.
The FSB is chaired by Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy. Its
Secretariat is located in Basel and hosted by the BIS.
In accordance with the FSF’s decision in March 2009 to expand its
national membership, the FSB comprises senior officials from finance
ministries, central banks and financial regulators in 24 countries and territories
as well as from the ECB and the European Commission. It also includes
representatives of international financial institutions (the BIS, IMF, OECD and
World Bank), international supervisory, regulatory and standard-setting bodies
(the Basel Committee, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
(IAIS), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)) and central
bank expert groupings (CGFS and CPSS).
At the FSF’s plenary meetings – in September 2008 in Amsterdam,
December 2008 in Hong Kong SAR and March 2009 in London – members
discussed the current challenges and vulnerabilities in financial markets, the
steps that are being taken to address them and policy options. The September
2008 meeting also featured an exchange of views with private sector
representatives on current financial system risks and response measures.
In addition to its plenary meetings, the Board holds occasional regional

164

BIS 79th Annual Report

meetings to foster wider exchanges of views on financial vulnerabilities
and relevant policy work under way. A meeting bringing together members
and authorities from the Asia-Pacific region was held in Hong Kong SAR
in December 2008. An outreach meeting with authorities from selected
emerging economies, organised jointly with the IMF, was held in Washington
in October 2008.
The FSF’s April 2008 Report on enhancing market and institutional
resilience called for international action to mitigate the procyclicality of the
financial system. In June 2008, the FSF initiated three workstreams on
procyclicality issues, focusing on: (i) the capital regime (jointly with the Basel
Committee); (ii) bank provisioning practices; and (iii) the interaction between
leverage and valuation (jointly with the CGFS). The Action Plan adopted by
the G20 leaders at their November 2008 summit also called for the FSF to
develop recommendations to mitigate procyclicality. The recommendations
arising from these workstreams were published, together with supporting
commentary and analysis, in April 2009. Among other things, the FSF
recommended that:
•
the Basel Committee strengthen the capital framework so that the level
as well as the quality of capital rise in good times and can be drawn on
in downturns;
•
risk-based capital requirements be supplemented with a simple,
transparent measure to contain leverage in the financial system;
•
accounting standard setters reconsider the incurred loss model for
provisioning by analysing alternative approaches for recognising and
measuring loan losses and examine the feasibility of valuation reserves
or adjustments for fair value financial instruments under certain
circumstances; and
•
the Basel Committee and the CGFS launch a joint research programme to
measure funding and liquidity risk attached to maturity transformation.
Also following upon recommendations in its April 2008 report, the FSF
developed principles to guide compensation practices at financial institutions,
high-level principles for cross-border crisis management, protocols for
establishing international colleges of supervisors for large cross-border banks,
and an enhanced early warning process for identifying and mitigating global
systemic risks (the last in collaboration with the IMF). These initiatives were
also called for in the G20 Action Plan released on 2 April 2009. The principles
for compensation and cross-border crisis management were published in
April 2009. Supervisory colleges for most large cross-border financial
institutions had been set up by the end of 2008, with the remainder expected
to be established in the first half of 2009. The conclusions of the IMF-FSF
inaugural early warning exercise were presented to the IMF’s International
Monetary and Financial Committee at its April 2009 meeting.
In addition to these initiatives, the FSF oversaw the implementation of
the other recommendations in its April 2008 report by national authorities,
international bodies and standard setters, and the private sector. The FSF
reported on progress in implementing the recommendations to the G7
Finance Ministers and Governors in October 2008, and a second progress

BIS 79th Annual Report

165

report was issued in April 2009. Both reports concluded that, while most of the
recommendations were being successfully implemented in a timely manner,
further work remains to be done in some areas and continued monitoring will
be essential.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), hosted by the
BIS since 1998, is the international standard-setting body for prudential
supervision of the insurance industry. The IAIS aims to contribute to global
financial stability through improved supervision of the insurance industry, the
development of standards for supervision, international cooperation based on
exchange of information, and mutual assistance. Over recent years, the IAIS
has grown significantly.
The IAIS has been actively involved in assessing the impact of the
financial crisis on the insurance sector and responding to the FSB and G20
recommendations for regulatory reforms. With a view to further improving
the effectiveness and efficiency of insurance supervision on a global basis, the
IAIS has mapped weaknesses revealed by the crisis.
The Basel Committee, IOSCO and the IAIS, through the Joint Forum, their
joint working group, have put in place a framework and process to carry out
a stocktake of the issues pertaining to regulatory gaps and differences that
build on existing work and processes in each sector.

Accounting
The IAIS has a strong interest in ensuring high-quality financial reporting that
offers a meaningful, economically sound portrayal of insurers’ financial health.
It closely monitors the international financial reporting developments which
will most influence the overall accounting model for regulated insurance
enterprises. In 2008, the IAIS provided input to the IASB’s discussion papers
on reducing complexity in reporting financial instruments and on amendments
to IAS 19 employee benefits. The IAIS also provided comments on the
International Federation of Accountants’ exposure draft on using the work of an
“auditor’s expert” and on international auditing standards of most relevance
to the insurance sector.

Capital adequacy and solvency
In October 2008, the IAIS adopted six supervisory papers on solvency
assessment. Aimed at facilitating greater comparability and convergence in
the international assessment of insurer solvency, these papers consist of
standards and guidance on:
•
the structure of regulatory capital requirements for a solvency regime;
•
the establishment and ongoing operation of an enterprise risk
management framework; and
•
the use of internal models as a method to assess risk, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, and manage capital.

166

BIS 79th Annual Report

Group supervision
Recognising the growing internationalisation of the insurance market and the
reality that much insurance business is undertaken within a group structure,
the IAIS has made progress in developing a comprehensive framework for
streamlining group supervision. The main goal is to achieve efficient group
supervision which preserves the level of policyholders’ protection while
avoiding unnecessary supervisory burden. In October 2008, the IAIS adopted
papers on:
•
principles of group-wide supervision, focusing on its aims and the
mechanisms to achieve them; and
•
guidance on the role and responsibilities of a group-wide supervisor,
including the factors to consider in identifying one, as well as the range
of cooperation mechanisms.

Reinsurance
Reinsurers play an important role in the functioning of efficient insurance
markets through their shock-absorbing capacity. In October 2008, the IAIS
adopted a guidance paper on mutual recognition of reinsurance supervision.
In December 2008, the IAIS published the fifth edition of its Global
reinsurance market report, based on global reinsurance statistics submitted by
the world’s largest reinsurers. Over the years, the report has evolved from
facilitating reinsurance market transparency on an ongoing basis to providing a
foundation on which up-to-date coverage of market trends and developments
can be analysed and reported. It shows that the reinsurance industry has a
solid financial base to face the challenges of the continuing financial crisis.
However, if the impact of the crisis spreads, reinsurers may be confronted
with difficult market and credit conditions.

Information sharing
Following the adoption of a Multilateral memorandum of understanding
(MMOU) in February 2007, which defines a set of principles and procedures
for sharing information, views and assessments, the IAIS commenced
validation of applications from interested jurisdictions.

Training
Each year, the IAIS organises some 15 regional seminars and workshops to
assist insurance supervisors in implementing its principles and standards, in
collaboration with the FSI, national insurance supervisory authorities and
other bodies.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) contributes to the
stability of financial systems by promoting international cooperation and
encouraging wide international contact among deposit insurers and other
interested parties. In particular, IADI:

BIS 79th Annual Report

167

•

enhances the understanding of common interests and issues related to
deposit insurance;
•
sets out guidance to enhance the effectiveness of deposit insurance
systems;
•
facilitates the sharing of expertise on deposit insurance issues through
training, outreach and educational programmes; and
•
provides guidance on the establishment or enhancement of effective
deposit insurance systems.
Currently, 72 organisations (of which 52 are members) from around the
world are involved in IADI’s activities, including a number of central banks that
have an interest in promoting the adoption or operation of effective deposit
insurance systems.
One of the Association’s main objectives is to improve the
effectiveness of deposit insurance systems through the development of
principles and practices. In its April 2008 Report on enhancing market
and institutional resilience, the FSF called on authorities to agree on an
international set of core principles for effective deposit insurance systems.
Subsequently, the Basel Committee and IADI issued a consultative document
on Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems for public
consultation.
In response to a request from the G20 leaders for information on areas
where progress on convergence in deposit insurance is being made or is in
need of acceleration, IADI briefed the FSF on regulatory practices related to
deposit insurance and transitioning to an explicit, limited-coverage deposit
insurance system.
During its seventh year of operation, IADI continued to provide many
forums for deposit insurers and other safety net participants. Activities
included:
•
the Seventh Annual Conference, themed “The role of deposit insurance in
promoting financial stability and economic inclusion” and attended by over
250 deposit insurers and policymakers from 60 countries. The conference
focused on: current financial market challenges and implications for
financial institutions; the role of deposit insurers in financial crises; past,
present and future research and guidance; and the building of inclusive
financial sectors to ensure that low-income individuals have access to
financial services;
•
an IADI Executive Training Program, held in the United States and Asia,
on major issues in bank resolution. The Program covered the least cost
test for determining a bank resolution alternative, large and small bank
resolutions, and the use of bridge banks and conservatorships during the
resolution process;
•
an agreement with the FSI to provide online tutorials on deposit insurance;
•
collaboration with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers on training
and other areas of mutual interest to support deposit insurance schemes
in Europe;
•
establishment of an Advisory Forum of 17 deposit insurance experts to
comment on research and guidance papers before publication; and

publication of guidance papers on governance, public awareness and
funding.

Other areas of central bank cooperation promoted by the BIS

Central bank governance
The Central Bank Governance Group comprises Governors from a broadly
based and representative group of central banks. It is assisted by the Central
Bank Governance Network, which encompasses nearly 50 central banks and
monetary authorities that cooperate via the BIS to share information on
governance and organisational matters.
Through the BIS, the Group worked on understanding issues in the
governance of central banks as public policy institutions. In May 2009, it
released a report on Issues in the governance of central banks that is intended
to serve as a point of reference when decisions are made on governance
arrangements for central banks. The report notes a number of governance
implications that may flow from changes in the role of the central bank with
respect to achieving and maintaining financial stability. These questions
include the range and nature of central banks’ responsibilities for promoting
financial stability and the design of mechanisms for decision-making on
financial stability matters.
Work on the dynamics of monetary policy committees was also completed
during the year. The purpose of this workstream was to understand how
structural features and committee procedures shape the decision-making
process. In addition, various requests for comparative information on a range
of central bank governance issues were met, and multilateral and bilateral
consultations were held with a number of central banks.

Research activities
In addition to providing background material for meetings of senior central
bankers and secretariat and analytical services to committees, the BIS
contributes to international monetary and financial cooperation by carrying
out its own research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks and,
increasingly, financial supervisory authorities. This work finds its way into
the Bank’s regular publications, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly
Review and the BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as external
professional publications. Most of the Bank’s research is published on its
website (www.bis.org).
In line with the Bank’s mission, the long-term focus of the research is on
monetary and financial stability issues. A core theme of the work during
the period under review was the global financial crisis. The research explored
the various dimensions of the crisis, including its causes, dynamics and
policy implications. In particular, this work analysed the behaviour of financial
markets under stress and the transmission of strains through international

BIS 79th Annual Report

169

banking markets. Special attention was also paid to advancing the
macroprudential approach to financial regulation and supervision, which
addresses the financial system as a whole rather than individual institutions.
The work included the development of early warning indicators of banking
system distress and an analysis of ways to dampen the procyclicality of the
financial system. Some of this work was channelled into the FSF report on
procyclicality published in April 2009.
As part of its research activities, the BIS also organises conferences
and workshops, typically bringing together senior policymakers, leading
academics and market participants. In June 2008, the Seventh BIS Annual
Conference addressed the challenges to monetary policy in the decade ahead.
The BIS and the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) organised a
conference in Basel in September 2008 on the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy.

Cooperation in the statistical area
The monitoring and analysis of the financial crisis require timely, reliable and
internationally comparable economic, monetary and financial statistics. The BIS
benefits significantly from the various international statistical activities it has
been involved in for some time with respect to data collection, methodological
issues and technical solutions.

International financial statistics
The various unique datasets compiled and disseminated by the BIS in
cooperation with central banks are of particular interest in the current financial
turmoil. The quarterly banking statistics permit a detailed examination of
developments in the international banking markets, including the dollar funding
needs of banks outside the United States and cross-border bank lending among
major financial centres and to emerging markets. The semiannual overthe-counter (OTC) derivatives statistics, which also cover outstanding credit
default swaps (CDS), provide a key source for understanding the major trading
patterns and potential exposures in this systemically important market. The
securities statistics, covering both international and domestic markets, indicate
the impact of the credit market turmoil on issuance activities in these markets.
The banking and securities statistics feed the Joint External Debt Hub
established by the BIS in cooperation with the IMF, OECD and World Bank; the
Hub now includes new trade credit data from the International Union of Credit
and Investment Insurers (the Berne Union).
Efforts were made last year to clarify the guidelines for reporting central
banks with the aim of further improving consistency within and across
BIS datasets. The BIS also contributed to the discussion about how its
OTC derivatives statistics, in particular those related to credit risk transfers
through CDS, could be adapted to enable better monitoring of market
developments. Moreover, the Bank made a major contribution to the
drafting of the Handbook on securities statistics, sponsored by the Working
Group on Securities Databases, whose members are the BIS, ECB, IMF and

170

BIS 79th Annual Report

OECD.6 Finally, the Bank strengthened its cooperation with these and
other international institutions on statistical methodological and data
compilation issues: in particular, it joined the new Inter-Agency Group on
Economic and Financial Statistics, which aims to improve the availability of
key national and international data in response to the ongoing financial and
economic crisis.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The BIS hosts the Secretariat of the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank
Statistics (IFC). The Committee is a forum for users and compilers of statistics,
both within and outside central banks, to discuss statistical issues relating to
economic, monetary and financial stability. It currently has 64 full institutional
members, including all BIS shareholding central banks, and is chaired by
Manuel Marfán, Board Member of the Central Bank of Chile.
The IFC’s fourth biennial conference, held in Basel in August 2008,
addressed the topic “Measuring financial innovation and its impact”. About 150
economists and statisticians from central banks around the world participated.
The conference included a discussion on data issues revealed by the recent
financial turmoil. It concluded that the lack of anticipation of the crisis was
not caused by insufficient data on, for instance, economic and financial
imbalances. A number of gaps could nonetheless be singled out. These gaps
would take time to fill, and innovative approaches might have to be adopted
to address the information needs of policymakers and market participants in
the meanwhile. Proceedings of IFC meetings are published in the IFC Bulletin
and posted on the BIS website.

BIS Data Bank
The BIS Data Bank is now used by 53 BIS shareholding central banks to
exchange national data with each other (12 additional central banks joined
during the year). Data Bank coverage was expanded to include high-frequency
data on central bank money market operations, which are being closely
monitored and discussed by various Basel-based groups during the financial
crisis; data on food and energy prices were also added. Furthermore, steps
were taken to facilitate the reporting of available data on national debt
securities following the release of a conceptual framework in the Handbook on
securities statistics.
In May 2008, 38 central banks were represented at the regular Data Bank
Experts meeting. Issues on the agenda included improving the timeliness of
data submissions and the need to save the original as well as all subsequent
revisions of monetary and economic data in order to permit a proper historical
analysis of the background against which market reactions occur and policy
decisions are made.

The first part of the Handbook was posted on the IMF website in May 2009. It provides a conceptual
framework, anchored in existing international statistical standards, for position and flow statistics on
debt securities issues. Eventually this document will be expanded to cover debt securities holdings and
other types of securities.

Statistical information technology
Last year, the BIS finalised the implementation of a new database for its
international financial statistics and prepared a new search and download
facility for its data on the web. In doing so, the BIS continued to work very
closely with central banks to make the exchange, processing and
dissemination of statistical data and metadata more efficient. A major initiative
in this regard is the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX), a joint
effort of the BIS, ECB, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, United Nations and World Bank.7
More than 240 experts from 65 countries and nearly 20 international
organisations came together at the SDMX Global Conference held in Paris in
January 2009. The conference illustrated the broad acceptance of SDMX and
the need for an electronic community for SDMX on the internet. Many national
and international statistical organisations are keen to implement SDMX in
order to improve the dissemination of their statistical data.
The SDMX website (www.sdmx.org) provides the family of SDMX
products, including technical standards approved by the International
Organization for Standardization, content-oriented guidelines for exchange of
data and metadata, and implementation tools. The site also provides
information about SDMX-related developments in a growing number of
statistical subject areas, such as the balance of payments and external debt.

Group of Computer Experts
The Group of Computer Experts (GCE) provides a twice-yearly forum for
central banks to share technical and organisational experiences in the IT area.
Additionally, the Working Party on Security Issues (WPSI) meets twice a year
on issues related to IT security.
At the May 2008 GCE meeting, payment systems issues predominated.
The main presentation was on the business and technical aspects of the recent
round of TARGET2 implementations. At the November meeting, the major
topic was the impact of the market turmoil on IT, with discussions highlighting
the need to respond very quickly to demand for the development and
implementation of new financial instruments and reports.
Infrastructural issues addressed by the WPSI included virtual machine
technology, network segmentation and the sharing of IT infrastructures by IT
systems and facility management systems. Two-factor authentication, identity
management and access control were discussed in relation to secure access
to systems and data, mobile computing, portable storage devices, remote
access and support by vendors.

Cooperation with regional central bank groupings
Occasional meetings with regional central banking groups allow BIS research,
policy analysis and statistics to be disseminated to those central banks that do

community that participates in its statistical initiatives such as the Data Bank and international financial
statistics.

not normally participate in the Bank’s regular activities. During the past year,
these meetings were focused on issues related to the current financial crisis.
Activities included:
•
seminars on “Financial stability analysis and reports”, organised with
CEMLA for Latin American and Caribbean central banks and with the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) for eastern and
southern African central banks;
•
a seminar on “Increased capital flows and the implications for central
banks”, organised with SEACEN for Asia-Pacific central banks; and
•
lectures conducted as part of the Masters in Banking and Finance
programme of the Centre Africain d’Études Supérieures en Gestion
(CESAG), located in Dakar.
The Coordinators of Technical Cooperation and Training held their
annual meeting in Basel in July 2008. Thirty-six central banks and
international institutions attended the meeting to discuss establishing robust
networks and information sharing between those involved in technical
cooperation.

Internal Audit
Internal auditors of central banks meet regularly to share experience and
knowledge. In June 2008, the 22nd Annual Plenary Conference of G10 Heads
of Internal Audit was hosted by the National Bank of Belgium. It covered topics
such as changes and trends in internal controls, outsourcing issues, talent
management practices in internal audit, audit approaches to analytical areas,
and enterprise risk management. In addition, twice a year, the BIS hosts the
meetings of the G10 Working Party on IT Audit Methodologies.
BIS Internal Audit has established information sharing networks for
internal audit heads from central banks and monetary authorities in the
Asia-Pacific region, and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In October 2008,
the second meeting of heads of internal audit from central banks in Latin
America and the Caribbean was hosted by the Central Bank of Chile in
Santiago de Chile. Discussions focused on risk management in financial
institutions, internal control failures, and the role of internal audit during
stressful periods.

Financial services of the Bank

The scope of financial services
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services designed specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 135 such institutions, as well as a number of
international institutions, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of these credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit

BIS 79th Annual Report

173

reporting directly to the Deputy General Manager monitors the Bank’s credit,
liquidity and market risks. Similarly, a compliance and operational risk unit
monitors the Bank’s operational risks.
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central banks,
the BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of currency
denomination, liquidity and maturity. In addition to traditional money market
placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the Bank
offers two instruments that can be traded (bought and sold back): the FixedRate Investment at the BIS (FIXBIS), available in maturities from one week to
one year; and the BIS Medium-Term Instrument (MTI), with maturities from one
year to 10 years. A series of callable MTI structures, as well as other instruments
with embedded optionality, are also part of the standard product range. From
time to time, the BIS extends short-term credits to central banks, usually on a
collateralised basis. The Bank also acts as trustee and collateral agent (see below).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example,
regular rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocation. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as well as
swaps, outright forwards, options and Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs). In
addition, the Bank provides gold services such as sight accounts, fixed-term
deposits, earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining, and transport.
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities or
high-grade assets. These may take the form of either a specific portfolio
mandate negotiated between the BIS and a central bank or an open-end fund
structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing customers to invest in
a common pool of assets. The two Asian Bond Funds (ABF1 and ABF2) are
administered by the BIS under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the
BIS and ABF2 by a group of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one at
the Bank’s head office in Basel and one at its Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR.

Financial operations in 2008/09
Since the summer of 2007, financial markets have been in a constant state of
distress. The turmoil confronted the Bank with sustained demand to accept
deposits at a time when the conditions induced by the turmoil made it difficult
to place funds profitably in the private financial markets at an acceptable level
of risk. As a result of actions taken by the BIS in its banking and risk
management practices to address these challenges, combined with the
evolution of financial market variables, the Bank’s currency deposit base
decreased by SDR 38.9 billion in 2008/09, after an average annual increase of
SDR 25.1 billion in the preceding two years. The currency deposit base stood
at SDR 197.2 billion at 31 March 2009.
The total balance sheet decreased by SDR 55.8 billion in 2008/09, after
recording growth of SDR 40.2 billion in 2007/08. As a result, the balance sheet
total amounted to SDR 255.4 billion at 31 March 2009.

174

BIS 79th Annual Report

Liabilities
The size of the BIS balance sheet is mainly driven by placements from
customers, which constitute the lion’s share of total liabilities (see graph). On
31 March 2009, customer placements (excluding repurchase agreements)
amounted to SDR 220.3 billion, compared with SDR 265.2 billion at the end of
the previous financial year.
Around 90% of customer placements are denominated in currencies, with
the remainder in gold. Currency deposits decreased from SDR 236.1 billion a
year ago to SDR 197.2 billion at end-March 2009 – representing some 4%8
of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves of nearly SDR 4.5 trillion, up
from SDR 4.2 trillion at end-March 2008. The share of currency placements
denominated in US dollars was 68%, whereas euro-denominated funds
accounted for 21%. Gold deposits amounted to SDR 23.1 billion at end-March
2009, a decrease of SDR 6 billion over the financial year.
The contraction of customer currency placements was mainly attributable
to a 13%, 26% and 22% decrease in investments in MTIs, FIXBIS and
sight/notice accounts, respectively.
A breakdown of placements with the BIS by geographical region shows a
relatively stable pattern, with Asian customers accounting for the highest share.

Assets
Most of the assets held by the BIS consist of government and quasigovernment securities, including reverse repurchase agreements and, to a
lesser extent than in the previous financial year, investments with highly
rated commercial banks of international standing. In addition, the Bank owned
120 tonnes of fine gold at 31 March 2009. The credit exposure is managed in
a very prudent manner, with almost all of the Bank’s credit exposure rated

A– or higher as at 31 March 2009 (see subsection 3, “Credit risk” in the “Risk
management” section of the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 208.9 billion on
31 March 2009, down from SDR 265.7 billion at the end of the previous
financial year. The decrease in customer placements was mainly accommodated
by a reduction of investments with commercial banks, partially offset by an
increase in treasury bills.
The Bank uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and
liabilities efficiently (see note 7 to the financial statements).

Agent and trustee functions
Trustee for international government loans
The Bank continued to perform its functions as trustee for the funding bonds
1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young Loans (for details, see the 63rd Annual
Report of June 1993). The Deutsche Bundesbank, as paying agent, notified
the Bank that in 2008 the Bundesamt für zentrale Dienste und offene
Vermögensfragen (BADV – Federal Office for Central Services and Unresolved
Property Issues) had arranged for payment of approximately €4.6 million for
redemption of funding bonds and interest. Redemption values and other
details were published by the BADV in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette ).
The Bank maintained its reservations regarding the application by the
BADV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan (stated in detail
in its 50th Annual Report of June 1980), which also extend to the funding
bonds 1990–2010.

Collateral agent functions
Under a number of agreements, the BIS acts as collateral agent to hold and
invest collateral for the benefit of the holders of certain foreign currency
denominated bonds issued by countries under external debt restructuring
arrangements. During 2008/09, collateral pledge agreements included those
for Peruvian bonds (see the 67th Annual Report of June 1997) and Côte
d’Ivoire bonds (see the 68th Annual Report of June 1998).

Financial results and profit distribution

Financial results
Background
The Bank’s financial results for the 79th financial year, 2008/09, were achieved
against a background of the continuing turmoil in the global financial markets
in which the BIS operates. This turmoil, which began in July 2007, reached a
new level of intensity in September 2008, when a number of important
financial institutions failed or were threatened with failure. Banks and other
institutions became reluctant to lend to each other except on a very short-term

176

BIS 79th Annual Report

basis. Credit markets also became severely dislocated, with activity in some
areas virtually ceasing as a flight to safety developed.
This deterioration in interbank markets was stemmed by measures taken
by central banks and governments in subsequent months to support the global
banking system. However, concerns then started to focus beyond the financial
sector and towards developments in the global economy, which led in the
credit markets to a widening of spreads for non-bank debt issues. Monetary
authorities acted to support economic activity by reducing interest rates to
exceptionally low levels. In these conditions, the market values of government
securities and the price of gold rose markedly.
In these exceptionally turbulent market conditions, the Bank’s
Management took successive actions to improve the Bank’s resilience to
events. On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, total currency deposits
declined as the interest rates quoted for short-term BIS instruments were
lowered and the issuance of certain BIS products was successively reduced
and, when necessary, suspended. On the assets side, Management lowered
exposures to, and the duration of, placements with commercial banks, while
increasing investments in sovereign and quasi-sovereign assets. These
actions reduced the balance sheet total and preserved the Bank’s underlying
profitability, while protecting it from realising significant losses from defaults by
counterparties and debt issuers. In addition to these measures, Management
restricted disposals of gold during 2008/09 to five tonnes, compared with
25 tonnes sold in the previous financial year, and reduced the duration
benchmark for its investment securities portfolios from four years to three.

Highlights
As a result of these developments:
•
Interest margins on an accruals basis in the Bank’s borrowed funds book
widened markedly from their already elevated levels in 2007/08.
•
Further unrealised valuation losses were incurred on the bonds in the
Bank’s credit portfolios in the borrowed funds book as credit spreads
widened against Libor.
•
Additional realised and unrealised gains on the Bank’s own funds
investments occurred as the price of gold and the market values of
government securities appreciated.
These factors led to:
•
an operating profit of SDR 245.3 million, SDR 11.2 million lower than in
2007/08;
•
a net profit of SDR 446.1 million, 18.1% lower than in 2007/08;
•
a further increase in the Bank’s equity (of SDR 612.8 million) following the
increase of SDR 1,010.7 million in 2007/08; and
•
a 5.8% return on equity in 2008/09, compared to 9.1% in 2007/08.

Detailed review (see profit and loss account)
Net interest income accrued was SDR 1,601.9 million in the financial year
2008/09, 64.5% higher than the equivalent figure of SDR 973.4 million in 2007/08.

BIS 79th Annual Report

177

This increase was primarily attributable to the higher interest accruals margin
arising from the much wider spreads above Libor received on the Bank’s riskweighted assets, as well as the lower interest rates paid on the Bank’s liabilities.
Net valuation movements resulted in a loss of SDR 1,181.7 million
compared to a loss of SDR 553.7 million in 2007/08.9 Around SDR 1,100 million
of the loss in 2008/09 was attributable to the widening of credit spreads from
Libor, which reduced the fair values of the bonds in the Bank’s credit portfolios.
This unrealised loss amounted to almost 3% of the value of these portfolios
(SDR 35 billion), which are invested in top-quality financial instruments.
Operating expense (see note 25 to the financial statements) amounted to
SDR 166.5 million, 7.8% above the preceding year’s figure (SDR 154.5 million).
Administrative expenses before depreciation amounted to SDR 154.4 million, 8.4%
above the previous year’s figure (SDR 141.9 million). In terms of Swiss francs,
the currency in which most of the Bank’s administrative expenses are incurred,
operating expense rose by 3.2%. The depreciation charge of SDR 12.1 million
was SDR 0.5 million below the equivalent figure for 2007/08 (SDR 12.6 million).
After taking into account the above factors, the Bank’s operating
profit amounted to SDR 245.3 million, 4.4% below the equivalent figure of
SDR 256.5 million recorded in 2007/08.
A net gain of SDR 123.8 million was realised on the sale of investment
securities during the financial year. This reflected the sale of securities
acquired when interest rates were lower and included gains on sales of
securities that were realised when the portfolio duration benchmark was
reduced as described above. In 2007/08, a net loss of SDR 5.1 million was
recorded for the sale of investment securities.
The realised gain of SDR 77.0 million on sales of gold investment assets
during 2008/09 arose from the sale of five tonnes from the Bank’s total holdings
of 125 tonnes at 31 March 2008. In 2007/08, a higher gain (SDR 293.3 million)
was recorded on the sale of 25 tonnes of the Bank’s own gold.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for the 79th financial year,
2008/09, amounted to SDR 446.1 million, 18.1% lower than the equivalent
figure of SDR 544.7 million in the preceding year.
In addition to the items reflected in the Bank’s profit and loss account,
unrealised gains and losses on the Bank’s own gold investments and
investment securities are recorded in the gold revaluation account and
securities revaluation account, which form part of the Bank’s equity.
The securities revaluation account increased by SDR 159.1 million as a
result of unrealised gains on investment securities (+SDR 282.8 million), less
a transfer to the profit and loss account of realised gains (–SDR 123.8 million)
on sales of securities.
Under the Bank’s accounting policies, which have been in force since 2003, all financial instruments
in its borrowed funds book are valued at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are
taken to the profit and loss account. The Bank acts as market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities, and as a result incurs realised profits and losses on these liabilities. The market risk inherent
in these activities is managed on an overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities
and derivatives in the borrowed funds banking portfolios. In normal market conditions, where credit
spreads are relatively stable, the realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities
are offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits on the related assets or derivatives, or on other
currency deposit liabilities.

178

BIS 79th Annual Report

The gold revaluation account also increased, by SDR 152.4 million, as a
result of unrealised gains (+SDR 229.4 million) resulting from the impact of the
appreciating gold price in 2008/09 on the Bank’s own gold holdings, less a
transfer to the profit and loss account of realised gains (–SDR 77.0 million) on
the sale of five tonnes of gold referred to above.
After taking these gains into account, the Bank’s total return for 2008/09
was SDR 757.6 million. This represented a return of 5.8% on average equity
(SDR 13,149 million). In 2007/08, the total return had been SDR 1,150.0 million,
and the return on average equity (SDR 12,586 million) had been 9.1%. Taking
into account the payment of the dividend for 2007/08, the Bank’s equity
increased by SDR 612.8 million during the year ended 31 March 2009. This
compares with an equivalent increase of SDR 1,010.7 million in 2007/08.

Proposed dividend
The Board reviewed the dividend policy of the BIS during the financial year
2005/06. The review took into consideration the Bank’s capital needs and the
interests of BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair and sustainable return on their
investments in BIS shares. The Board concluded that the approach of
increasing the dividend by SDR 10 each year continued to be broadly
consistent with these considerations. This approach resulted in an increase in
the dividend from SDR 235 per share in 2004/05 to SDR 265 in 2007/08. The
Board also decided to review the dividend policy every two to three years,
taking into account changing circumstances where necessary.
As foreseen last year, the Board reviewed the level of the dividend once
again during 2008/09 and concluded that the prevailing market turbulence and
resulting uncertainties did not provide an appropriate environment to develop a
medium-term dividend policy. Taking into account the financial developments
described above, the Board proposes that the dividend for 2008/09 be
unchanged from the previous financial year at SDR 265 per share.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends to
the Annual General Meeting that the net profit of SDR 446.1 million for the
financial year 2008/09 be applied by the General Meeting in the following manner:
1. SDR 144.7 million in payment of a dividend of SDR 265 per share;
2. SDR 30.1 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;10
3. SDR 271.3 million, representing the remainder of the available net profit,
to be transferred to the free reserve fund. This fund can be used by the
Board of Directors for any purpose that is in conformity with the Statutes.
No transfer to the special dividend reserve fund is proposed for 2008/09
as the recommended dividend is unchanged from the dividend for the previous
financial year.
Since the general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2009,
Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend shall be
paid into this fund, until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

10

BIS 79th Annual Report

179

If approved, the dividend will be paid on 2 July 2009 according to
each shareholder’s instructions in any constituent currency of the SDR, or
in Swiss francs, to the shareholders named in the Bank’s share register on
31 March 2009.
The full dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares. The number of issued
and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares, 1,000 were held in treasury at
31 March 2009, namely the suspended shares of the Albanian issue. No
dividend will be paid on these treasury shares.

Report of the auditors

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as
well as the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank
are not included in these financial statements. Information
on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in
note 32.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.
The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is
the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2005 and
effective 1 January 2006. As currently calculated, one SDR
is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410, JPY 18.4
and GBP 0.0903. The composition of this currency basket is
subject to review every five years by the IMF; the next
review is due to be undertaken in December 2010.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

3. Currency translation

Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold
on behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank takes
limited gold price, interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The
use of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is
described in Section 9 below.
All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated
as loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR
at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Other assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits
and losses are translated into SDR at an average rate.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of
monetary assets and liabilities and from the settlement of
transactions are included as net foreign exchange gains or
losses in the profit and loss account.

188

BIS 79th Annual Report

B. Investment portfolios

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
The relevant currency assets (other than cash and sight
and notice accounts with banks) are designated as available
for sale. Related securities sold under repurchase
agreements are designated as financial liabilities measured
at amortised cost.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively managed portfolios. The currency assets in these
portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost. They are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest is
included in interest expense on an accruals basis.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on the related currency assets
and derivatives, or on other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios
as held at fair value through profit and loss.

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets. They
typically have notice periods of three days or less and are
included under the balance sheet heading “Loans and
advances”.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

10. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with the
exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities,
are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums received and discounts paid are included in
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are

movements in fair value included under the profit and loss
account heading “Net valuation movement”.

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively managed investment portfolios.
The currency assets in these portfolios are trading assets
and as such are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent
accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income” on an
effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net valuation movement”.

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at
market value on a trade date basis.

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bars held in custody and sight
accounts. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a financial
instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for
on a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of
gold are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 17 below.

12. Currency assets available for sale

15. Gold loans

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.

Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans to commercial
banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a financial
instrument.

As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively managed investment portfolios.

Gold loans are included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.

These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent
accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income” on an
effective interest rate basis.

Interest on gold loans is included in interest income on
an effective interest rate basis. The treatment of realised
and unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in
Section 17 below.

After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. Realised
profits on disposal are included under the profit and loss
heading “Net gain / (loss) on sales of securities available
for sale”.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise sight and fixed-term deposits of
gold from central banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to
be a financial instrument.
Gold deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.
Interest on gold deposits is included in interest expense on
an effective interest rate basis. The treatment of realised
and unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in
Section 17 below.

190

BIS 79th Annual Report

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets
The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios
as loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives
included in the portfolios are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net foreign
exchange gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange gain /
(loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.
After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included under the
profit and loss account heading “Net valuation movement”.

19. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with
all realised and unrealised movements in value included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host
contract which is not accounted for as held at fair value
through profit and loss, it is separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though it
were a standalone derivative as described above.

Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

18. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value
through profit and loss, they are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Where these liabilities are associated with currency
assets available for sale, they are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

BIS 79th Annual Report

191

20. Valuation policy

21. Impairment of financial assets

The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the
Board of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how
financial instruments are designated, which determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. This policy
is supplemented with detailed valuation procedures.

Financial assets, other than those designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss, are assessed for indications
of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets
are impaired when there is objective evidence that the
estimated future cash flows of the asset have been reduced
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the
initial recognition of the asset. Evidence of impairment
could include significant financial difficulty, default, or
probable bankruptcy / financial reorganisation of the
counterparty or issuer.

The majority of the financial instruments on the balance
sheet are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair
value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting
to the Board and shareholders reflects the way in which the
banking business is managed and is consistent with the
risk management economic performance figures reported
to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active
markets as the best evidence of fair value. Where no
published price quotations exist, the Bank determines fair
values using a valuation technique appropriate to the
particular financial instrument. Such valuation techniques
may involve using market prices of recent arm’s length
market transactions in similar instruments or may make
use of financial models. Where financial models are used,
the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs (eg interest rates and volatilities) as
appropriate, and relies as little as possible on own
estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair
values, the valuation models are subject to initial approval
and periodic review in line with the requirements of the
Bank’s model validation policy.
The Bank has an independent valuation control function
which periodically reviews financial instrument valuations.
Other valuation controls include the review and analysis of
daily profit and loss.
The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its liabilities
at the offer price. Financial assets and liabilities that are
not valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet
at amortised cost.

Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss
account if a decline in fair value below amortised cost is
considered other than temporary. If the amount of the
impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying
amount of the investment does not exceed that which it
would have been had the impairment not been recognised.

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are initially recognised at fair
value and subsequently included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:
Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years
The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

192

BIS 79th Annual Report

24. Provisions

B. Directors’ pensions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,
provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Best estimates and assumptions
are used when determining the amount to be recognised
as a provision.

The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of the Directors’ pension arrangement
are calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff
pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits

25. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions and
health and accident insurance for current and former staff
members. An independent actuarial valuation is performed
annually for each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the
estimated future cash outflows. The rate used to discount
the cash flows is determined by the Bank based on the
market yield of highly rated corporate debt securities in
Swiss francs which have terms to maturity approximating
the terms of the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “Corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included
under the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

BIS 79th Annual Report

The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

D. Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside
the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

26. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts, which
are very short-term financial assets that typically have
notice periods of three days or less.

193

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is
an international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930,
the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The
headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002
Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).

There is no active secondary market for certain of the
Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets
and liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which
require judgment to determine appropriate valuation
parameters. Changes in assumptions about these
parameters could materially affect the reported fair
values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point change in
spread assumptions is shown in the table below:

The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its
Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks,
to provide additional facilities for international financial
operations and to act as trustee or agent for international
financial settlements. Fifty-five central banks are currently
members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting
at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the
number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries.
The Board of Directors of the Bank is composed of the
Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s founder
central banks, being those of Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of
America, as well as the Governors of the central banks of
Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland, and the President of the European Central
Bank.

For the financial year ended 31 March

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving
at the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive
at these estimates, Management uses available
information, exercises judgment and makes assumptions.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the
Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the
designation and valuation of financial instruments are key
elements in the preparation of these financial statements.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for
example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities,
the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations
and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

B. The valuation of corporate bonds
In the financial market environment at 31 March 2009 the
degree of judgment involved in valuing financial
instruments has increased significantly from previous
years. With few actual market trades in certain financial
assets held by the Bank, a high degree of judgment has
been necessary to select valuation parameters from within
a wide range of potential alternative assumptions. This is
particularly relevant for the Bank’s holdings of corporate
bonds (included under the balance sheet heading
“Government and other securities”), for which the potential
range of alternative spread assumptions was of the order
of tens of basis points. Management believes that all of the
valuation parameters used by the Bank reflect market
conditions at the balance sheet date in a fair and prudent
manner.

C. Impairment charge on financial assets
Gold loans include a charge of SDR 18.3 million following
an impairment review as at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008:
nil). The impairment review was conducted at an individual
counterparty level, identifying those counterparties which
were experiencing significant financial difficulties at the
balance sheet date. The impairment charge is included in
the profit and loss account under the heading “Net interest
income”.

BIS 79th Annual Report

D. Actuarial assumptions and medical cost inflation

B. Gold investment assets

The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care
arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions and
expectations of inflation and interest rates. Changes to
these assumptions will have an impact on the valuation
of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.

The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the
balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed
cost value is included in the gold revaluation account
(reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”), and realised gains or losses on the disposal of
gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and
loss account.
Note 18 provides further analysis of the gold revaluation
account. Note 27 provides further analysis of the net gain
on sales of gold investment assets.

3. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash
balances with central banks and commercial banks that
are available to the Bank on demand.

31 March 2009 amounted to 120 tonnes of fine gold.

5. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans,
and government and other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
comprise those currency banking assets that represent the
reinvestment of customer deposits and those currency
investment assets that are part of more actively managed
portfolios. Currency assets available for sale comprise the
remainder of the Bank’s currency investment assets and
represent, for the most part, the investment of the Bank’s
equity.

BIS 79th Annual Report

195

Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by
governments on a discount basis.

Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with
commercial banks. Also included in this category are
investments made with central banks, international
institutions and other public sector organisations. This
includes advances made as part of committed and
uncommitted standby facilities. The balance sheet total
“Loans and advances” also includes notice accounts (see
note 6).

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are transactions under which
the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
loan is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there
is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent
securities subject to the repayment of the loan. During the
term of the agreement the fair value of collateral is
monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit exposure.

Government and other securities are debt securities issued
by governments, international institutions, other public
institutions, commercial banks and corporates. They
include fixed and floating rate bonds and asset-backed
securities.

Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans and notice
accounts.
Fixed-term loans are designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as
loans and receivables and are included as cash and cash
equivalents. These are very short-term financial assets,
typically having a notice period of three days or less. These
are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

is SDR (50.0) million (2008: SDR 88.8 million).

7. Derivative financial instruments
The Bank uses the following types of derivative
instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.

Interest rate and bond futures are contractual obligations
to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest
rates or bond prices on a future date at a specified price
established in an organised market. Futures contracts are
settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin
payments are settled by cash or marketable securities.

198

Currency and gold options are contractual agreements
under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but
not the obligation, to either buy (call option) or sell (put
option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency
or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration, the
seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps are commitments to
exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result in
an economic exchange of currencies, gold or interest rates
(for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination
of interest rates and currencies (cross-currency interest
rate swaps). Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of
principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards represent commitments to
purchase foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement
at a future date for the difference between a contracted rate
of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are options under which the seller grants the
purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by
or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a
premium from the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers
which contain embedded derivatives (see notes 10 and 11).
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though
they are regular derivatives where the host contract is not

There is no active secondary market for certain of the Bank’s derivatives. These derivative assets and liabilities are valued using
valuation techniques which require judgment to determine appropriate valuation parameters. A 1 basis point change in spread
assumptions would have had an impact on the valuation of SDR 8.9 million (2008: SDR 16.0 million).

10. Currency deposits

A. Valuation of currency deposits

Currency deposits are book entry claims on the Bank. The
currency deposit instruments are analysed in the table
below:

Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit
accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
This value differs from the amount that the Bank is
contractually required to pay at maturity to the holder of
the deposit. For total currency deposits the amount that
the Bank is contractually required to pay at maturity to the
holder of the deposit, plus accrued interest to 31 March 2009,
is SDR 193,629.2 million (2008: SDR 234,822.0 million).

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate
investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10
years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of
the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates
between June 2009 and December 2009 (2008: June 2008
and December 2009).
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the BIS for any
maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the BIS with
maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate
is reset in line with prevailing market conditions.

The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair
value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques
comprise discounted cash flow models and option pricing
models. The discounted cash flow models value the
expected cash flows of financial instruments using discount
factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates
(eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based on assumptions
about spreads at which each product is offered to and
repurchased from customers.
The spread assumptions are based on recent market
transactions in each product. Where the product series has
been closed to new investors (and thus there are no recent
market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted
spread for the series as the basis for determining the
appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about
volatilities that are derived from market quotes.
A change of 1 basis point in spread assumptions used
for valuing currency deposits at the balance sheet date
would have had an impact on the Bank’s valuation of
SDR 18.5 million (2008: SDR 24.0 million).

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected
by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s
creditworthiness deteriorated, the value of its liabilities
would decrease, and the change in value would be
reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss
account. The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness
as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s
assessment of its creditworthiness did not indicate a
change which could have had an impact on the fair value
of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS,
typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits
that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original
currency or at a fixed amount in a different currency at the
option of the Bank. These deposits all matured between
2 April 2009 and 15 May 2009 (2008: in April 2008).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term
financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three
days or less. They are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.
The Bank acts as a sole market-maker in certain of its
currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay at
fair value some of these financial instruments, in whole or
in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

11. Gold deposits

14. Other liabilities

Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from
central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.

As at 31 March

The Bank also takes gold deposits that are repayable on the
maturity date either in gold or at a fixed amount of currency
at the option of the Bank (gold dual currency deposits). The
embedded gold currency option is included in the balance
sheet as a derivative financial instrument and is accounted
for at fair value. There were no gold dual currency deposits
at 31 March 2009 (2008: SDR 54.1 million).

12. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repo”
liabilities) are transactions under which the Bank receives a
fixed-term deposit from a counterparty to which it provides
collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the deposit
is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there is an
irrevocable commitment to repay the deposit subject to
the return of equivalent securities. Securities sold under
repurchase agreements originate entirely from commercial
banks.
There were no securities sold under repurchase
agreements at 31 March 2009. As at 31 March 2008 all of
the securities sold under repurchase agreements were
associated with the management of currency assets
available for sale. They were therefore all designated as
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s
annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the
proposal of the Board of Directors to three specific reserve
funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and
the special dividend reserve fund; the remainder of the net
profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated
to the free reserve fund.

Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at
10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.

The shares held in treasury consist of 1,000 shares of the
Albanian issue which were suspended in 1977.

General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 10%
of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently
must be allocated to the general reserve fund. When the
balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up
capital, such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the
remainder of the annual net profit.

18. Other equity accounts

Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder
of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special
dividend reserve fund, which shall be available, in case of
need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared
dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the Bank’s net
profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been
made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally
transferred to the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of BIS shares are allocated
to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully
funded, with the remainder being credited to the general
reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal
reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses
incurred by the Bank. In the event of liquidation of the Bank,
the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the
liabilities of the Bank and the costs of liquidation) would be
divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

(when the Bank changed its functional and presentation
currency from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost
is approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 in accordance
with a decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated
at the 31 March 2003 exchange rate.

The Bank’s own assessment of its capital adequacy is
performed on the basis of its economic capital frameworks
for market risk, credit risk, operational risk and other risks.
These are designed to determine the amount of equity
needed to absorb losses arising from its exposures to a
statistical level of confidence consistent with the objective
to maintain superior credit quality. The Bank’s economic
capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995%

The following table summarises the Bank’s economic

risk as at 31 March 2009. Furthermore, since 1 April 2008,
an additional amount of economic capital has been set
aside for other risks based on Management’s assessment
of risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in the Bank’s
economic capital calculations.

As at 31 March

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The
assessment is supported by an annual capital and business
planning process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is
consistent with the revised International Convergence
of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II
Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in June 2006. The implementation includes all
three pillars of the Framework, and takes the particular
scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into account.
Since the Bank is not subject to national banking
supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited
to the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy. This
assessment is based primarily on an economic capital
methodology which is more comprehensive and geared to
a substantially higher solvency level than the minimum
Pillar 1 capital level required by the Basel II Framework.

Total

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal
ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.
Under this approach, the risk weighting for a transaction is
determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function
using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. For certain
exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised
approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped
to exposure types.

More details on the assumptions underlying the
calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk,
market risk and operational risk.

Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following
an internal models approach. For operational risk, the
advanced measurement approach is used. Both these
approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The
minimum capital requirements are derived from the VaR
figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking
into account the 8% minimum capital requirement.

4. Tier 1 capital ratio
The capital ratio measures capital adequacy by comparing
the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its risk-weighted assets. The
table below shows the Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, consistent
with the Basel II Framework.

As required by the Basel II Framework, expected loss is
calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced
internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is
calculated at the balance sheet date taking into account the
impairment charge which is reflected in the Bank’s profit
and loss account. Note 4 provides details of the impairment
charge. The expected loss is deducted from the Bank’s
Tier 1 capital in accordance with the requirements of the
Basel II Framework.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and
performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering
its specific characteristics. As such, it maintains a capital
position substantially in excess of the minimum
requirement.
The Bank’s Tier 1 ratio under the 1988 Basel Capital Accord
was 50.8% as at 31 March 2009 (2008: 34.6%). The material
difference between the Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio under the
Basel II Framework and the 1988 Accord is attributable
mainly to the higher risk sensitivity of the Basel II
approaches.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central
banks, monetary authorities and international financial
institutions, in the management of their reserves and
related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the
Bank’s objectives and as such ensure its financial strength
and independence. The BIS engages in banking activities
that are customer-related as well as activities that are
related to the investment of its equity, each of which may
give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk
and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational
risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of
Directors, the Management of the Bank has established
risk management policies designed to ensure that risks are
identified, appropriately measured and limited as well as
monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
General approach
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a
prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•
•

seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;

•

investing its assets predominantly in high credit
quality financial instruments;

adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market
risk-taking and carefully managing market risk
associated with the Bank’s strategic positions, which
include its gold holdings; and
maintaining a high level of liquidity.

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General
Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of
the Bank, and is assisted by the Deputy General Manager.
The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s
independent risk control and compliance functions. The
General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are
supported by senior management advisory committees.

BIS 79th Annual Report

The key advisory committees are the Executive
Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance
and Operational Risk Committee. The first two committees
are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the
Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive
Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the
Bank’s strategic planning and the allocation of resources,
as well as on decisions related to the broad financial
objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General
Manager on the financial management and policy issues
related to the banking business, including the allocation of
economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and
Operational Risk Committee acts as an advisory committee
to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk
management throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is
performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent
operational risk control function is shared between Risk
Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification,
and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. Both units
report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of
this function is to provide reasonable assurance that the
activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable
laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s Code of
Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant
standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and
assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff
on compliance issues. The Head of the Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the
Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee to the
Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the
Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an
independent valuation control function, produces the
Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s
expenditure through setting and monitoring the annual
budget. The objective of the independent valuation control
function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with
its valuation policy and procedures, and that the processes
and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations
conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance unit has a
direct reporting line to the Secretary General.

219

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support
covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s
activities. The Legal Service has a direct reporting line to
the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control
procedures and reports on how they comply with internal
standards and industry best practices. The scope of
internal audit work includes the review of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct
reporting line to the Audit Committee and is responsible to
the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position
and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the
relevant units. Financial risk and compliance reports aimed
at various management levels are regularly provided to
enable Management to adequately assess the Bank’s risk
profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the
Board of Directors on a bimonthly basis. Furthermore, the
Audit Committee receives regular reports from Internal
Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the
Finance unit. The Banking and Risk Management
Committee, another advisory committee to the Board,
receives an annual report from the Risk Control unit. The
preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies
and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank uses a comprehensive range of quantitative
methodologies for valuing financial instruments and for
measuring risk to the Bank’s net profit and its equity. The
Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light
of its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles
and responsibilities and processes related to the
implementation of new or materially changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and
manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based
on value-at-risk (VaR) techniques. VaR expresses the
statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the
current positions of the Bank measured to a specified level
of confidence and a specified time horizon.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to
measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses
arising from its exposures to a statistical level of
confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the
highest creditworthiness.

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of
economic capital frameworks for market risk, credit risk,
operational risk and other risks, supplemented by
sensitivity and risk factor analyses. The Bank’s economic
capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk
categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set
aside based on Management’s assessment of risks which
are not or not fully reflected in the economic capital
calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements
the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic
capital calculations for financial risk. The Bank’s key market
risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The
stress testing includes the analysis of severe historical and
adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as
sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements
of the key risk factors identified. The Bank also performs
stress tests related to liquidity risk.

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet
its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual
terms and conditions.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and
policies set by the Board of Directors and Management.
These are complemented by more detailed guidelines and
procedures at the level of the independent risk control
function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty
and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk
control function, individual counterparty credit assessments
are performed subject to a well defined internal rating
process, involving 18 rating grades. As part of this process,
counterparty financial statements and market information
are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating
and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series
of credit limits covering individual counterparties
and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all
counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits
are reviewed at least annually. The main assessment
criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties
to meet interest and principal repayment obligations in a
timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by
the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by
the Board of Directors.

220

BIS 79th Annual Report

On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and
country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and limited
based on the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit
risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank
uses a portfolio VaR model. Management limits the Bank’s
overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of
economic capital to credit risk.

The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established
clearing centres and by settling transactions where
possible through a delivery versus payment settlement
mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on
a continuous basis.

C. Default risk
B. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and
legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The
corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the
balance sheet.
The Bank obtains collateral, under reverse repurchase
agreements, some derivative financial instrument contracts
and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate
counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective
policies and procedures. The collateral value is monitored
on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, additional
collateral is requested.

BIS 79th Annual Report

The exposures set out in the table below are based on the
carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as
categorised by sector, geographical region and credit
quality. Gold and gold loans exclude gold held in custody,
and accounts receivable do not include unsettled liability
issues, because these items do not represent credit
exposures of the Bank. The carrying value is the fair value of
the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in
the case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and
notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised
cost net of any impairment charge. Commitments are
shown at their notional amounts.

The ratings shown reflect the Bank’s internal ratings
expressed as equivalent external ratings. The vast majority
of the Bank’s exposure is rated equivalent to A– or above.
A financial asset is considered past due when a
counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual
due date. The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial
assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its
valuations monthly, taking into account necessary
adjustments for impairment. As at 31 March 2009 the
Bank recorded an impairment charge of SDR 18.3 million
on gold loans (2008: nil). No financial assets were
considered past due at the balance sheet date.

Total collateral provided

The above table shows the collateral obtained and provided by the Bank. It excludes transactions which have yet to settle (on
which neither cash nor collateral have been exchanged). The Bank obtains collateral as part of reverse repurchase agreements
and collateral agreements for certain derivatives. The Bank is allowed to sell or repledge this collateral, but must deliver equivalent
financial instruments upon the expiry of the contract. Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements comprises sovereign
and supranational debt as well as US agency securities. Eligible collateral for derivatives comprises sovereign securities. Due to
the default of a counterparty SDR 735.5 million of US Treasury bills held as collateral was seized and sold during the financial year
ended 31 March 2009.
The Bank grants facilities to customers which are secured against either deposits made with the Bank or units held by customers
in funds managed by the Bank. As at 31 March 2009 the total amount of undrawn facilities which could be drawn down subject to
collateralisation by the customer was SDR 8,412.3 million (2008: SDR 6,463.1 million).
The Bank provides collateral for securities sold under repurchase agreements. This collateral consists of government or agency
securities.

E. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a
one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence interval. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to credit
risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

F. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposures to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach
that is consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk
weights derived from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for
key inputs are also relevant to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD
as the notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivatives. The EAD for derivatives is calculated
using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II Framework. In line with this
methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
Framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated
loss-given-default (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank
is not in a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD estimates
through a mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly,
LGD estimates are derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effect
of collateral obtained giving consideration to market price volatility, remargining and revaluation frequency.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral
benefits into account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2009 includes SDR 7,024.8 million
(2008: SDR 5,998.3 million) for interest rate contracts and SDR 5,108.0 million (2008: SDR 2,823.1 million) for FX and gold contracts.

G. Securitisation exposures
The Bank only invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures.
Risk-weighted assets for these exposures are determined using the standardised approach.
Given the scope of the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the
standardised approach for securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine
the relevant risk weights. External credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the exposures and
the associated risk weights.
The following table shows the Bank’s investments in securitisation analysed by type of securitised assets:

4. Market risk

A. Gold price risk

The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse
movements in market prices. The main components of the
Bank’s market risk are gold price risk, interest rate risk and
foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and
calculates economic capital based on a VaR methodology
using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor
volatilities and correlations are estimated using a one-year
observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes
sensitivities to certain market risk factors.

Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.

In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain its superior
credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic
capital usage within a framework set by the Board of
Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the
quality of available market data and, while forward-looking,
they extrapolate from past events.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of
potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank
has established a comprehensive regular backtesting
framework,
comparing
daily
performance
with
corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed
and reported to Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement
based on VaR modelling and related economic capital
calculations with a series of stress tests. These include
severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical
macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold
price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

230

The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through
its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to
120 tonnes (2008: 125 tonnes). These gold investment
assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with
commercial banks. At 31 March 2009 the Bank’s gold position
was SDR 2,358.0 million (2008: SDR 2,247.0 million),
approximately 17% of its equity (2008: 17%). The Bank
sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk
emerging from its banking activities with central and
commercial banks. Gold price risk is measured within the
Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital
framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in interest rates including
credit spreads.
The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk through the
interest bearing assets relating to the management of its
equity held in its investment portfolios and investments
relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios
are managed with a fixed duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a
VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into
account movements in relevant money market rates,
government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite
currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and
GBP. Currency risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The
Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily through
the assets relating to the management of its equity. The
Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through
managing its customer deposits and through acting as an
intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between
central and commercial banks. The Bank reduces its
foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant
assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular
basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from
customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction
intermediation.

BIS 79th Annual Report

–
(175.1)

Foreign exchange risk is measured and monitored based
on the Bank’s VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses
considering movements in key foreign exchange rates.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities
by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange
and gold position in these tables therefore includes the
Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net
foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need to be
removed. The SDR neutral position is then deducted
from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold
to arrive at the net currency exposure of the Bank on an
SDR neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations
between risk factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the
99.995% confidence interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes
in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the
SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a banking
book approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are
determined for gold price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is
derived using the VaR-based internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR
methodology, assuming a 99% confidence interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily
VaR measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three
plus a potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers
observed remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development
relevant to the calculation of minimum capital requirements over the reporting period and shows the Bank’s minimum capital
requirement for market risk and the related risk-weighted assets as at 31 March 2009.

5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet
expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and
collateral needs without affecting its daily operations or its
financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits
from central banks, international organisations and other
public institutions are the key drivers of the size of the
Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to
repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit
instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank
is managed to preserve a high degree of liquidity so that it
can meet the requirements of its customers at all times.
The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model underpinned by
conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and
the liquidity of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board
of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio
which requires liquid assets to be at least 100% of the
potential liquidity requirement. In addition, liquidity stress
tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios are
performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity
requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The
Bank’s liquidity has consistently been materially above its
minimum liquidity ratio and the requirements of its stress
tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from
central banks and international institutions, comprise 91%
(2008: 89%) of its total liabilities. At 31 March 2009
currency and gold deposits originated from 131 depositors
(2008: 152). Within these deposits, there are significant
individual customer concentrations, with seven customers
each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a
settlement date basis (2008: four customers).
The following table shows the maturity profile of cash flows
for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the
undiscounted cash flows to which the Bank is committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of
financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both,
resulting from one or more risk causes, as outlined below:

•

human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite
knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training
and development, inadequate supervision, loss of key
personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of
integrity or ethical standards;

•

failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly
designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented,
understood, implemented, followed or enforced;

•

failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly
designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not
operate as intended; and

•

external events: the occurrence of an event having an
adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

The Bank has established a procedure of immediate
reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit develops action
plans with the respective units and follows up on their
implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital
and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has
adopted a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation
technique that is consistent with the advanced
measurement approach proposed under the Basel II
Framework. In line with the assumptions of the Basel II
Framework, the quantification of operational risk does not
take reputational risk into account. Internal and external
loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments
to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. The Bank
does not incorporate potential protection it may obtain
from insurance in the measurement of operational risk.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic
risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework,
policies and procedures comprise the management
and measurement of operational risk, including the
determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs,
business continuity planning and the monitoring of key
risk indicators.

Report of the auditors

to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements.
These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet as at 31 March 2009, the profit and loss
account for the year then ended as required by the Bank’s Statutes, and the statement of cash
flows and notes thereto. The financial statements have been prepared by the Management of the
Bank in accordance with the Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under
significant accounting policies in the notes. The Management of the Bank is responsible for
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates
that are reasonable in the circumstances. Our responsibility under the Statutes of the Bank is to
form an independent opinion on the balance sheet and profit and loss account based on our audit
and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We have received all the information and explanations which we have required
to obtain assurance that the balance sheet and profit and loss account are free of material
misstatement, and believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements, including the notes thereto, have been properly drawn up
and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements at
31 March 2009 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in conformity with the
accounting principles described in the notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
