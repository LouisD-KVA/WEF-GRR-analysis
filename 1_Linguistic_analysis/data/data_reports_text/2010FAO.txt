The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Addressing food insecurity in protracted crises

Following more than a decade of seemingly inexorable increases in the number of
undernourished people, estimates for 2010 presented in this edition of The State
of Food Insecurity in the World show a slight glimmer of hope, with the first fall
since 1995. But that still leaves nearly a billion people going hungry, and it is too
early to know if this is the beginning of a downward trend or merely a momentary
dip in the number of undernourished.
This year, The State of Food Insecurity in the World focuses on a particular
group of countries, countries in protracted crisis, where levels of undernourishment
are estimated to be at almost 40 percent. It examines the difficulties faced in trying
to turn around the situation in such countries, not least the difficulty of moving
beyond the mindset of humanitarian intervention towards a broader-based
development agenda.
The report highlights actions that can be taken to rationalize the way
protracted crises are handled. These include more holistic assessment of the crisis
itself, including a deeper understanding of the drivers of crises; building on local
community responses and institutions; introducing or supporting social protection
mechanisms such as food-based safety nets; and moving from food aid to a
broader-based food assistance approach.
The final section of the report provides recommendations on ways to improve
engagement with countries in protracted crisis. These focus on improving the
analysis and understanding of protracted crises; supporting the protection,
promotion and rebuilding of livelihoods and the institutions that support and
enable livelihoods; and changing the architecture of external intervention in
protracted crises to match the reality on the ground.
As this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World shows, there are
many challenges facing countries in protracted crisis. But they are not insurmountable
– there is hope. Through improved understanding of the nature of protracted crisis
comes the ability to respond more effectively. Lessons from the experience of

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World

many countries show that with careful attention to livelihoods, strengthening
longer-term assistance to existing local institutions, investing in social protection
mechanisms and transitioning from food aid to food assistance are all powerful
and fundamental tools for addressing the root causes of protracted crises. This
report illustrates that there are many positive experiences to learn from through
which to better address the multiplicity of issues, including that of extremely high
undernourishment, in countries in protracted crisis.

Addressing food insecurity in protracted crises

Key messages
NOTES for Table - 1
The number and the proportion of undernourished
people have declined, but they remain unacceptably
high. After increasing from 2006 to 2009 due to high food
prices and the global economic crisis, both the number and
proportion of hungry people have declined in 2010 as the
global economy recovers and food prices remain below their
peak levels. But hunger remains higher than before the crises,
making it ever more difficult to achieve the hunger-reduction
targets of the World Food Summit and Millennium
Development Goal 1.
Countries in protracted crisis require special attention.
They are characterized by long-lasting or recurring crises and
often limited or little capacity to respond, exacerbating food
insecurity problems in those countries. Appropriate responses
thus differ from those required in short-term crises or in
non-crisis development contexts.
Improving food security in protracted crises requires
going beyond short-term responses in order to protect
and promote people’s livelihoods over the longer term.
People living in protracted crises are often forced to make
radical adjustments in their way of life that require longer-term
responses. This disruption to traditional livelihoods and coping
mechanisms also has very different implications for men and
for women.
Supporting institutions is key to addressing protracted
crises. Protracted crises, whether human-induced or the result
of repeated natural disasters, often undermine the institutions
that are necessary to contain and recover from crises. Local
institutions often remain or emerge to fill crucial gaps when
national institutions have failed, and these have the potential
to play a key role in addressing protracted crises, but they are
often ignored by external actors.

Agriculture and the rural economy are key sectors for
supporting livelihoods in protracted crises, but they are
not properly reflected in aid flows. Agricultural and
rural-based livelihoods are critical to the groups most affected
by protracted crises. Agriculture accounts for a third of
protracted crisis countries’ gross domestic product and twothirds of their employment. Yet agriculture accounts for only
4 percent of humanitarian ODA received by countries in
protracted crisis and 3 percent of development ODA.
The current aid architecture needs to be modified to
better address both immediate needs and the structural
causes of protracted crises. The current system uses
humanitarian assistance to support short-term efforts to
address the immediate effects of a crisis, and development
assistance for long-term interventions to address underlying
causes. Areas of intervention that are important in protracted
crises (including social protection and risk reduction) are often
underfunded. In general, weak governance structures in
protracted crisis situations condition aid allocations.
Food assistance helps build the basis for long-term food
security, and is particularly important in countries in
protracted crisis. Humanitarian food assistance not only saves
lives, but is also an investment in a country's future, because it
preserves and strengthens the human assets and livelihoods
that are the foundation of future stability and development.
The use of a varied set of food assistance tools (such as food,
cash or vouchers), complemented by innovations in how food
is procured (including local purchase), helps to ensure that
appropriate assistance is provided and to maximize the chance
that humanitarian food assistance will serve as a strong basis
for food security in the longer term.
Broader social protection measures help countries cope
with protracted crises and lay the foundation for
long-term recovery. Key interventions include providing
safety nets, insurance when appropriate, and services such as
health and education, which build bridges to longer-term
development. In countries in protracted crisis, however,
financial, institutional and implementation capacity are limited,
so social protection programmes are generally short-term,
relief-oriented and externally funded.

Recommendations
Recommendation 1. Support further
analysis and deeper understanding
of people’s livelihoods and coping
mechanisms in protracted crises in
order to strengthen their resilience
and enhance the effectiveness of
assistance programmes.

Recommendation 2. Support the
protection, promotion and rebuilding
of livelihoods, and the institutions that
support and enable livelihoods, in
countries in protracted crisis.

Recommendation 3. Revisit the
architecture of external assistance in
protracted crises to match the needs,
challenges and institutional constraints
on the ground. This could entail the
organization of a High-Level Forum on
protracted crises followed by the
development of a new “Agenda for
Action” for countries in protracted crisis.

The Human Development Index (HDI) generated by UNDP is a summary
composite index that measures a country's average achievements in
three basic areas of human development: health, knowledge, and a
decent standard of living. Health is measured by life expectancy at
birth; knowledge by a combination of the adult literacy rate and
combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrolment ratio; and
standard of living by GDP per capita (PPP US$). Each component is
given a score, which is then averaged to create the overall index which
ranges from 0 to 1.

he number of undernourished people in the world remains unacceptably high at near the one
billion mark despite an expected decline in 2010 for the first time since 1995. This decline is
largely attributable to increased economic growth foreseen in 2010 – particularly in developing
countries – and the fall in international food prices since 2008. The recent increase in food prices, if it
persists, will create additional obstacles in the fight to further reduce hunger.
However, a total of 925 million people are still estimated to be undernourished in 2010,
representing almost 16 percent of the population of developing countries. The fact that nearly a billion
people remain hungry even after the recent food and financial crises have largely passed indicates a
deeper structural problem that gravely threatens the ability to achieve internationally agreed goals on
hunger reduction: the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and the 1996 World Food Summit
goal. It is also evident that economic growth, while essential, will not be sufficient in itself to eliminate
hunger within an acceptable period of time.
This edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World focuses on people living in a group of
countries in which the incidence of hunger is particularly high and persistent, and which face particular
challenges in meeting the MDG targets – namely countries in protracted crisis. These countries are
characterized by long-lasting or recurring crises, both natural and human-induced, and limited capacity
to respond. In the 22 countries identified by this report as being in protracted crisis (or containing
areas in protracted crisis), the most recent data show that more than 166 million people are
undernourished, representing nearly 40 percent of the population of these countries and nearly
20 percent of all undernourished people in the world.
This unacceptably high degree of hunger results from many factors, including armed conflict and
natural disasters, often in combination with weak governance or public administration, scarce
resources, unsustainable livelihoods systems and breakdown of local institutions. Faced with so many
obstacles, it is little wonder that protracted crises can become a self-perpetuating vicious cycle.
Protracted crises are not a series of one-off, short-lived phenomena, and they are not temporary
interruptions from which countries easily return to a path towards longer-term development. Rather,
they represent ongoing and fundamental threats to both lives and livelihoods, from which recovery
may become progressively more difficult over time.
Protracted crises call for specially designed and targeted assistance. Assistance focused on the
immediate need to save lives is critical in protracted crises – as it is in shorter-duration emergencies –
but in protracted crises it is also essential to direct assistance towards underlying drivers and longerterm impacts. These may include conflict, disintegration of institutions, depletion of resources, loss of
livelihoods and displacement of populations. There is thus an urgent need for assistance in protracted
crises to protect livelihoods as well as lives, because this will help put the country on a constructive
path to recovery.
Despite these additional needs, trends in development assistance give cause for concern: nearly
two-thirds of countries in protracted crisis receive less development assistance per person than the
average for least-developed countries. More importantly, agriculture receives only 3 to 4 percent
of development and humanitarian assistance funds in countries in protracted crisis, despite
accounting for 32 percent of their gross domestic product and supporting the livelihoods of
62 percent of their populations.
There are a number of things that we can do to improve the way we handle protracted crises, and
provide more effective and lasting help for people living in these situations. Lessons from the
experience of many countries show that building longer-term assistance activities on the framework
of existing or revitalized local institutions offers the best hope of long-term sustainability and real
improvement of food security. Social protection mechanisms, such as school meals, cash and foodfor-work activities and vouchers, can make a vital difference in the long term. Food assistance
contributes to building these social protection mechanisms – providing food as part of safety net
programmes, stimulating markets through purchase of food aid supplies on local markets or through
cash-based schemes – and helps to bridge the gap between traditional humanitarian assistance and
longer-term development assistance. Efforts should also aim at achieving sustained, long-term
improvements in the productive capacity of vulnerable countries and at the same time strengthening
their resilience to shocks. Underlying all of these improved responses, a proper understanding of the
nature of protracted crises themselves constitutes an essential step towards addressing their specific
problems. These messages are developed further in the report, and provide the basis for specific

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

recommendations to support improved understanding and, most importantly, stronger and more
effective response to help people in protracted crisis situations break the downward cycle.
The 2010 edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World is again the product of close
collaboration between our two organizations and other partners. Drawing on the expertise and
knowledge of staff from both organizations has brought a fresh perspective to the issues of food
insecurity in countries in protracted crisis and has provided a platform for a new vision on combining
the strengths of humanitarian assistance with longer-term development assistance. We hope that this
report will shape the response by decision-makers at local, national, regional and international levels to
improve food security in protracted crises, and ultimately, to save lives, strengthen communities and
help build a more hopeful, prosperous and self-sufficient future.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

Undernourishment around the world in 2010
The number of undernourished people has
declined but remains unacceptably high
Key message
The number and proportion of hungry people in the
world are declining as the global economy recovers
and food prices remain below their peak levels, but
hunger remains higher than before the food price and
economic crises, making it more difficult to meet the
internationally agreed hunger-reduction targets.

A

fter increasing sharply from 2006 to 2009, owing
to high food prices and the global economic
crisis, the number of undernourished people in
the world is estimated to have declined in 2010 as the global
economy recovers (Figure 1). But the number of
undernourished people remains unacceptably high – higher
than it was before the recent crises, higher than it was 40
years ago, and higher than the level that existed when the
hunger-reduction target was agreed at the World Food
Summit in 1996 (see Box 1).

Based on the latest available data, the total number of
undernourished people in the world is estimated to have
reached 1 023 million in 2009 and is expected to decline by
9.6 percent to 925 million in 2010. Developing countries
account for 98 percent of the world’s undernourished people
and have a prevalence of undernourishment of 16 percent
(Figure 2) – down from 18 percent in 2009 but still well above
the target set by the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1.
Global cereal harvests have been strong for the past
several years – even as the number of undernourished
people was rising – but the overall improvement in food
security in 2010 reflects improved access to food through
the expected resumption of economic growth, particularly
in developing countries, combined with food prices that
remain below the peaks of 2008. The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world economic
output will increase by 4.2 percent in 2010, faster than
previously expected, following a contraction of 0.6 percent
in 2009.1 In general, gross domestic product (GDP) is
growing faster in emerging economies and developing

BOX 1

What is food security and what are the hunger reduction targets?

■■ Food security exists when all people, at all times, have
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe
and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and
food preferences for an active and healthy life.
Household food security is the application of this
concept to the family level, with individuals within
households as the focus of concern.
■■ Food insecurity exists when people do not have
adequate physical, social or economic access to food as
defined above.
■■ Undernourishment exists when caloric intake is below
the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER).

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

The MDER is the amount of energy needed for light
activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight
for attained height. It varies by country and from year
to year depending on the gender and age structure of
the population. Throughout this report, the words
“hunger” and “undernourishment” are used
interchangeably.
■■ The World Food Summit goal is to reduce, between
1990–92 and 2015, the number of undernourished
people by half. Millennium Development Goal 1,
target 1C, is to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the
proportion of people who suffer from hunger.

countries than it is in developed countries (Figure 3). The
World Bank estimates that private capital inflows to
developing countries are also increasing faster than
originally expected.2 In parallel, international cereal prices
have declined in recent months and are below their recent
peaks, reflecting ample global cereal supplies in 2009/10
and prospects for large crops in 2010 (Figure 4), but food
prices in most low-income food-deficit countries remain
above the pre-crisis level of early 2008, negatively affecting
access to food by vulnerable populations.3
The analysis of hunger during crisis and recovery brings
to the fore the vulnerability to economic shocks of many
poor countries. Lack of appropriate mechanisms to deal
with the shocks or to protect the most vulnerable
populations from their effects result in large swings in
hunger following crises. Moreover, it should not be
assumed that all the effects of crises on hunger disappear
when the crisis is over. Vulnerable households deal with
shocks by selling assets, which are very difficult to rebuild,
by reducing food consumption in terms of quantity and
variety and by cutting down on health and education
expenditures – coping mechanisms that all have long-term
negative effects on quality of life and livelihoods.

Undernourishment by region
The majority of the world’s undernourished people live in
developing countries. Two-thirds live in just seven countries
(Bangladesh, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Pakistan) and over 40 percent
live in China and India alone.
Projections for 2010 indicate that the number of
undernourished people will decline in all developing regions,
although with a different pace. The region with most
undernourished people continues to be Asia and the Pacific
(Figure 5), but with a 12 percent decline from 658 million in
2009 to 578 million, this region also accounts for most of
the global improvement expected in 2010 (Figure 6).4
While the World Food Summit goal is to reduce by half the
number of people who are undernourished, MDG 1 seeks to
reduce by half the proportion of these people. Because the
world’s population is still increasing (albeit more slowly than in
recent decades), a given number of hungry people represents a
declining proportion of people who are hungry. In fact, developing
countries as a group have seen an overall setback in terms of
the World Food Summit goal (from 827 million in 1990–92
to 906 million in 2010), while some progress has been made
towards MDG 1 (with the prevalence of hunger declining from
20 percent undernourished in 1990–92 to 16 percent in 2010).

The proportion of undernourished people remains
highest in sub-Saharan Africa, at 30 percent in 2010
(Figure 7), but progress varies widely at the country level.
As of 2005–07 (the most recent period for which
complete data are available), the Congo, Ghana, Mali and
Nigeria had already achieved MDG 1 and Ethiopia and
others were close to achieving it; in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, however, the proportion of

undernourishment had risen to 69 percent (from
26 percent in 1990–92). In Asia, Armenia, Myanmar and
Viet Nam had achieved MDG 1 and China and others
were close to doing so, while in Latin America and the
Caribbean, Guyana, Jamaica and Nicaragua had achieved
MDG 1 and Brazil and others were approaching the target
reduction. (Table 1 in the Technical annex provides more
details on country-level statistics.)

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they
and why do they deserve special attention?
Common features of countries in protracted crisis
Key message
Twenty-two countries are currently considered to be in
protracted crisis. Protracted crisis situations are
characterized by recurrent natural disasters and/or
conflict, longevity of food crises, breakdown of
livelihoods and insufficient institutional capacity to
react to the crises. Countries in protracted crisis thus
need to be considered as aspecial category with
special requirements in terms of interventions by the
development community.

T

here is no simple definition of a country in protracted
crisis. Protracted crises have been defined as “those
environments in which a significant proportion of the
population is acutely vulnerable to death, disease and
disruption of livelihoods over a prolonged period of time. The
governance of these environments is usually very weak, with
the state having a limited capacity to respond to, and
mitigate, the threats to the population, or provide adequate
levels of protection.”5 Food insecurity is the most common
manifestation of protracted crises.6
Protracted crisis situations are not all alike, but they may
share some (not necessarily all) of the following characteristics.7
• Duration or longevity. Afghanistan, Somalia and the
Sudan, for example, have all been in one sort of crisis or
another since the 1980s – nearly three decades.
• Conflict. Conflict is a common characteristic, but conflict
alone does not make for a protracted crisis, and there are
some countries in protracted crisis where overt, militarized
conflict is not a significant factor or is a factor in only part
of the country (e.g. Ethiopia or Uganda).
• Weak governance or public administration. This may
simply be a lack of capacity in the face of overwhelming
constraints, but may also reflect lack of political will to
accord rights to all citizens.
• Unsustainable livelihood systems and poor foodsecurity outcomes. These contribute to malnutrition and

12

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

increased mortality rates. Both transitory and chronic
food insecurity tend to increase in protracted crisis
situations. However, unsustainable livelihood systems are
not just a symptom of protracted crises; deterioration in
the sustainability of livelihood systems can be a
contributing factor to conflict, which may in turn trigger
a protracted crisis.
• Breakdown of local institutions. This is often
exacerbated by state fragility. Relatively sustainable
customary institutional systems often break down under
conditions of protracted crisis, but state-managed
alternatives are rarely available to fill the gap.

■■ Defining countries in protracted crisis
It is obvious from the above that the definition of a
protracted crisis is somewhat fluid: no single characteristic
identifies a protracted crisis and the absence of one or more
of the characteristics outlined does not necessarily mean that
a country or region is not in a protracted crisis. This report
uses three measurable criteria to determine whether or not a
country is in a protracted crisis: the longevity of the crisis, the
composition of external aid flows, and the inclusion of the
country on FAO’s list of low-income food-deficit countries
(LIFDCs).
• Longevity of crisis. The criterion for longevity of the
crisis is based on the number of years a country has
reported a crisis (whether a natural disaster, a humaninduced crisis or disaster, or a combination of the two)
that required external assistance. This information is
collated annually for all UN member states by the FAO
Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS).
A country is considered to be in protracted crisis if it
appears on the GIEWS list for eight years or more
between 2001 and 2010 (to capture more recent
crises) or 12 years or more between 1996 and 2010.
• Aid flows. The second defining criterion is the proportion
of humanitarian assistance received by the country as a
share of total assistance. Countries are defined as being in

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

considered as being in protracted crisis and is among the
case studies presented in this report.
There are other cases of countries that appear to have
been in protracted crisis but are not included in this list.
Sri Lanka, for example, is just emerging from a long civil
conflict that devastated much of the northern part of the
island and displaced a large proportion of the population.
However, it appears on the GIEWS list of countries in crisis
for only seven of the past ten years, thus narrowly missing
the inclusion criterion.
There is thus a considerable degree of heterogeneity
among countries in protracted crisis, including the capacity
to handle crises, with some countries having a functioning
government and others being currently considered as fragile
or failed states.9
In terms of aid flows, countries in protracted crisis are
characterized by a relatively high share of total aid received
in the form of humanitarian assistance rather than
development assistance. Globally, about 10 percent of total
ODA is in the form of humanitarian assistance, but in
countries in protracted crisis the share is generally much
higher – as high as two-thirds in countries such as Somalia

protracted crisis if they have received 10 percent or more
of their official development assistance (ODA) as
humanitarian aid since 2000.8
• Economic and food security status. The final defining
criterion is that countries in protracted crisis appear on the
list of LIFDCs.
A total of 22 countries currently meet all three of these
criteria (Table 1).
All the countries in Table 1 have suffered some kind of
human-induced emergency – a conflict or political crisis of
some kind. Sixteen of them have also experienced some kind
of natural disaster at some point– either as a stand-alone
crisis or combined with a human-induced emergency, while
15 have experienced at least one occurrence of combined
natural and human-induced emergency.
Some protracted crisis situations are limited to a particular
geographic area of a country and may not affect the entire
population. For example, Uganda appears on the protracted
crisis list, but the protracted crisis in Uganda is limited to the
northern and northeastern parts of the country. A territory,
such as the West Bank and Gaza Strip, could also be

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

BOX 2

Protracted crisis: the case of Somalia

Somalia has been without a central government since
1991, and was in a state of civil war for several years prior
to that. Since 2004, a Transitional Federal Government
has attempted to exercise some authority but has been
unable to extend its control over much of the country.
Quasi-independent regional governments have exercised
some autonomy and administration in Somaliland and
Puntland in the north. In recent years, the conflict has
taken on elements of regional rivalry.
The conflict led to a major famine in south–central
Somalia in 1992–93. Since 2000, there have been
localized food-security crises in various parts of the
country. Fierce fighting in Mogadishu in 2006 led

some half a million residents of the city to flee to the
relative safety of the Afgooye corridor, to the northwest
of the city.
In 2009, some 3.2 million people in Somalia required
immediate food assistance. Over half of these were
internally displaced people; the remainder were affected
either by the conflict, by drought and an underlying
livelihoods crisis, or both. As of early 2010 and despite a
good harvest in 2009, the food security situation for
much of the population of south–central and central
Somalia appeared increasingly worrying, while the security
situation has forced almost all international agencies to
withdraw from these areas.

BOX 3

Protracted crisis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

Since the onset of the Israeli occupation in 1967, the
economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has been largely
dependent on the provision of labour to Israel and other
countries. This has made the territory extremely vulnerable
to changes in the Israeli labour and goods markets.
Economic conditions have deteriorated since late September
2000. High population growth rates have outpaced GDP
growth, leading to a steady decline in per capita GDP. The
overall deterioration of the economy has worsened since
the beginning of 2006. The impact on the socio-economic
situation is particularly acute in the Gaza Strip.
The movement of goods and people into and out of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip has been severely restricted,
and this has negatively impacted the lives of the
Palestinian population. Unemployment reached

and the Sudan. The amount of humanitarian assistance
received per capita is also higher in all 22 countries in
protracted crisis than the average for developing countries.
Levels and allocation of aid flows will be discussed in greater
detail later in the report (see pages 27–31).

31 percent in mid-2002. It has since declined, but remains
above 24 percent. The loss of jobs, earnings, assets and
incomes has sharply reduced economic access to food, as
real per capita income has halved since 1999. In mid2006, six out of ten people had incomes below the
US$2.10 per day poverty line, while 34 percent of all
people living in the territory were considered to be foodinsecure with a further 12 percent considered to be
particularly vulnerable to becoming food-insecure. In the
Gaza Strip, four out of every five families had to reduce
expenditures, including on food.

■■ Food insecurity: are countries in protracted
crisis a different case?
Countries in protracted crisis show generally high levels of
food insecurity (Table 2). In 2005–07 the proportion of
undernourished people in countries in protracted crisis ranged
from a low of 14 percent in Côte d’Ivoire to a high of 69 percent
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Global Hunger
Index, made up of a composite of undernourishment data,
the prevalence of underweight and the under-five mortality
rate, varied from a low of 14.5 (“serious hunger problem”) in
Côte d’Ivoire to a high of 39.1 (“extremely alarming hunger
problem”) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

FIGURE 8

Table 2 shows that, on average, the proportion of
people who are undernourished is almost three times as
high in countries in protracted crisis as in other developing
countries (if countries in protracted crisis and China and
India are excluded) (Figure 8). Nonetheless, not all
countries in protracted crisis present very high levels of
undernourishment as in some of these countries crises are
localized to certain areas or regions. There are approximately
166 million undernourished people in countries in
protracted crisis – roughly 20 percent of the world’s
undernourished people, or more than a third of the global
total if China and India are excluded from the calculation.
Food security is significantly worse in the group of
countries in protracted crisis than in the rest of developing
countries in four out the of six key food security indicators:
proportion undernourished (FAO); proportion stunted;
mortality rate of children under five years old; and the Global
Hunger Index (International Food Policy Research Institute
[IFPRI]) (Table 3).

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

A deeper analysis of the relationship between
protracted crisis and food security outcomes shows that
changes in income, government effectiveness, control of
corruption and the number of years in crisis are
significantly related to the proportion of the population
who are undernourished (Table 4).10 These factors, plus
education, are also all significantly related to a country’s
Global Hunger Index. More importantly, it is not just the
presence or absence of protracted crisis that is significant –
the number of years a country has been in crisis also
makes a difference. An increase in the number of years a
country has been in crisis significantly increases the
prevalence of undernourishment.

■■ Engagement in protracted crises: constraints
and opportunities
The characteristics of countries in protracted crisis make them
some of the most difficult contexts for the international

community to engage with. These difficulties are linked to
two key issues: (a) the way in which the development
community perceives protracted crises and its relationship to
the development process and (b) the way in which aid is used
to respond to protracted crises (aid architecture).
With regard to the first issue, “development” is
sometimes viewed as a gradual improvement in quality of
life. Disasters or acute emergencies (briefly) interrupt this
trend, but the expectation is that a situation will return to
the “normal” upward trend once the crisis is over (Figure 9)
– hence the terminology of “disaster,” “recovery” and
“sustainable development” and the principles and
interventions associated with each. However, in protracted
crises the trend line is likely to be unpredictable for an
extended period; not necessarily sharply downwards as in
an acute emergency but not upwards either – at least not
for a long time.
The second issue, closely related to the first, is that
the architecture of intervention in a protracted crisis is

typically similar to that designed for short crises
followed by a return to some degree of long-term
improvement. Yet this clearly does not fit the
characteristics of most protracted crisis situations. Even
some of the recent Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles for
working in fragile state contexts do not seem
appropriate for engaging in protracted crises (see Box 4).
As a result, engagement, especially international
engagement, in protracted crises is not well matched to
the problems encountered, and the approach used is not
sufficiently flexible to adjust to changing realities. In
many cases, the state apparatus of the affected country
is undermined by a protracted crisis, leaving both an
institutional vacuum and a lingering question about the
priorities for engagement: is the priority to strengthen
or, in some cases, rebuild state institutions, or to
strengthen or rebuild livelihoods and the local
institutions that support livelihoods?

Principles for engagement in protracted crises?

Humanitarian principles have long been well articulated,
though increasingly difficult to adhere to in protracted crisis
situations. The principles underlying development efforts
have never been as explicitly articulated, but are broadly as
outlined in the second column of the table below. While
both sets of principles may be applicable in protracted
crises, there is little clarity about what principles apply
when. To address this lack of clarity, the OECD issued a set
of principles for “engagement in fragile states” – not
precisely the same as countries in protracted crisis, but

similar in many ways. These appear in the third column of
the table. However, some of these principles would clearly
clash in situations with ongoing conflict – particularly
internal conflict or counter-insurgency where the state is
one party to the conflict. With many of the same donors
and the same external agencies involved in both
humanitarian response and development programmes in
protracted crises (or in fragile states or both), there remains
a lack of clarity about what operating principles govern
what kind of interventions, and when and where.

How livelihoods adapt in protracted crises
Key message
Improving food security in protracted crises requires
going beyond short-term responses and protecting
and promoting people’s livelihoods. People living in
protracted crises are often forced to make radical
adjustments to their livelihoods, including relocation
from rural areas for the relative safety of population
centres. This can disrupt traditional livelihoods and
coping mechanisms, either temporarily or
permanently, but can also present new livelihood
opportunities if properly supported.

Humanitarian assistance programmes have aimed at
protecting livelihoods11 since the mid-1980s, when it was
realized that early efforts to do so would be more effective
than those delayed until people were destitute or at risk of
dying. In reality, however, humanitarian aid has
predominantly focused on saving lives; it has not always
been designed to support longer-term livelihood-protection
goals and food security. Until recently, interventions other
than food aid have been limited to activities such as adding
the distribution of seeds and tools to regular food aid
distributions. Programmes have been more likely to introduce
interventions to support livelihoods as a crisis persists.
But protecting and promoting livelihoods requires a
more holistic approach that addresses the causes of
vulnerability to food insecurity as well as the
consequences. In doing so, it needs to pay attention to
what people are doing for themselves and to how their
efforts can best be supported.
This section explores what happens to rural livelihoods
in protracted crises, what this means for how livelihoods
can be supported and what is needed to strengthen
livelihoods programming in order to improve food security.
It draws heavily on experience from the Sudan, where
many parts of the country have suffered for decades from
frequent periods of acute food insecurity as well as
chronic food insecurity, caused by factors ranging from
conflict(s) to socio-economic marginalization,
environmental degradation and natural disasters. It also
draws on case studies from other countries such as the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, where
the longevity of the crises experienced has had similar
impacts on rural livelihoods.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

■■ What happens to livelihoods during
protracted crises?
Livelihoods are often severely disrupted in protracted
crises. The impact of the Darfur crisis in the Sudan – now
in its eighth year – is a concrete demonstration of that.
In Darfur, the first couple of years of the conflict were
marked by the rapid devastation of livelihoods. Millions
of people became displaced. Many lost everything –
livestock, agricultural tools, access to land, their homes
and even relatives. Those who remained in their area of
origin also suffered heavy losses. Pastoralists in North
Darfur lost over half of their livestock in the first three
years of the conflict – around a quarter of their herd was
looted while an even larger proportion died because poor
security limited their access to feed and water supplies.12
As the crisis became protracted, assets continued to be
lost through a gradual process of attrition. As the
economy shrank and freedom of movement declined,
livelihood options inevitably became fewer. Many people
became dependent on marginal subsistence activities.
Rural people could not migrate for work or send
remittances home, which had a serious impact on their
livelihoods in the initial stages of the conflict.
The conflict in the Nuba Mountains, in central Sudan,
which started in 1985 and escalated in the 1990s, also led to
widespread destruction of traditional sources of livelihoods
and large-scale internal displacement, with few Nuba
retaining access to their traditional farmland. This was a key
factor in triggering recurrent food insecurity. Insecurity on
the plains drove many Nuba to flee to the rocky hilltops,
abandoning the productive clay soils found in the plains.
Harvest yields dropped to approximately one-tenth of
previous levels in several areas.13 Livestock productivity also
fell significantly because of lack of access to pasture and
water points on the plains. Many cattle were looted in the
areas most affected by conflict, and lack of access to
veterinary drugs in areas where fighting was most intense
caused further declines in livestock holdings.14
Similarly, in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo,
agriculture-based livelihoods were yet another victim of
the war. As a result of insecurity and the repeated
displacement of households, local productivity fell to
minimal levels (in North Kivu during the peak of the war,
bean productivity fell 72 percent, that of manioc by
53 percent and bananas by 45 percent).15 In Kismayo district

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

in Somalia, the average livestock holding – a key factor in
determining households’ resilience – decreased dramatically
during the period 1988–2004 as a result of the protracted
crisis. The average holding of households in the middle
poverty quartiles fell from 6 to 2.5 tropical livestock units –
TLU (1 TLU = 1 head of cattle equivalent).16

fuelled the conflict as they compete with farmers and
displaced people for this resource.21 In many cases it would
be more appropriate to call such strategies
“maladaptation”.22

■■ Short- to medium-term adaptations

As initial short-term responses to crises become longer-term
adaptations, protracted crises can prompt or accelerate
longer-term and permanent transitions.
The most common transition is the accelerated process
of rural–urban migration that accompanies many
protracted crises. This occurred throughout most of the
Sudan. Khartoum grew rapidly as more than 4 million
people were displaced during two decades of civil war in
the south of the country. Around half of the displaced
people have remained in urban areas, especially Khartoum,
even after the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed
in early 2005. The town of Nyala, the commercial centre of
Darfur, has grown to approximately three times the size it
was when the conflict began, and is now home to well over
a million people. Similar trends have been recorded
elsewhere: it is estimated, for instance, that the urban
population grew by a factor of eight in Luanda in Angola,
five in Kabul in Afghanistan and seven in Juba in southern
Sudan. These phenomena are largely attributed to the
conflicts and post-conflict–related dynamics.23 Such
changes in settlement patterns bring with them a
significant change in livelihoods, with an increase in the
number of people dependent on the urban labour market.
As noted above, this may exceed the capacity of urban
labour markets to support the influx, and may adversely
affect the surrounding environment. Such migration may
also jeopardize migrants’ rights to the land they have left
behind in rural areas.
Another common feature of protracted crises is
increasing competition among different livelihood groups
that may have coexisted peacefully before the crisis. As the
economy contracts (and freedom of movement may also
contract during a conflict), livelihoods have come under
increasing pressure. There is strong evidence of this in
Darfur, where competition between pastoralists and farmers
over the natural resource base has intensified as both
groups have become increasingly dependent on strategies
such as grass and firewood collection to replace pre-conflict
livelihood strategies that are no longer possible. In Jubba
Region in Somalia, increased competition over irrigated
land, resulting from the conflict, led to a further
marginalization of the Bantu groups whose livelihoods
depend on agriculture.24 Similarly, in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo, farmers moved from central Lubero
to the forests of west Lubero to regain access to the land
lost because of the conflict and institutional breakdown.
Tensions with local communities and customary landlords
led to marginalization of newcomers.25

Livelihood systems adapt over time in a variety of ways when
crises are prolonged.
On the positive side, there are remarkable examples of
human resilience and flexibility. Livestock traders in Darfur,
for example, altered their trade routes to avoid areas of
insecurity, in one case resorting to air-freighting sheep from
the far west of Darfur to Khartoum.17 The way in which
remittances are sent has also changed, often creatively so, to
avoid obstacles associated with the conflict (see Box 5 on
page 20). Similarly, in the Jubba region in Somalia,
pastoralists partially moved to agriculture to cope with
increased crop prices as a result of the conflict.18 In the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lake Edward was once
the fishing reserve of the entire province of North Kivu, but
its fish output declined significantly, from over 11 000 tonnes
per year in 1954 to 3 000 tonnes in 1989. The reasons for
this decline include the institutional disintegration
surrounding the exploitation of local resources related to the
progressive breakdown of formal government institutions
aggravated by the conflict(s). Confronted with this decline in
local production, the population (mainly fisherfolk) began
cultivating rice, maize, soya, bananas and manioc in the
northern part of Virunga National Park. The favourable
location of the park offered an attractive alternative for the
production of subsistence and commercial crops.
Paradoxically, the absence of formal institutions and
regulatory functions in eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo favoured the movement of people from Lake Edward
to the Virunga National Park. This offered fisherfolk who had
become food-insecure because of the depletion of fisheries
resources the opportunity to create an agriculture-based
livelihood for themselves.19
On the negative side, many adaptations are harmful or
unsustainable. For example, in Darfur, as the economy
contracted and large numbers of people moved from rural
areas to urban areas, increasing competition for work in a
saturated labour market forced more and more people to
become dependent on the collection and sale of natural
resources, especially firewood, and on brick-making. This led
to devastating environmental degradation in ever-widening
rings around Darfur’s main towns.20 Out of desperation,
poor households (especially internally displaced people
[IDPs]) have been engaging in high-risk livelihood strategies
such as the collection of firewood from insecure areas.
Pastoral populations have also increasingly turned to
collecting firewood as a source of income, and this has

BOX 5

Remittances in protracted crises

Populations who suffer in situations of protracted crises
are often dependent on remittances from family members
and relatives elsewhere. The significance of remittances is
often underestimated, and yet they represent a livelihood
strategy that could be supported, building on local
people’s own creativity in maintaining remittance flows.
In Darfur, prior to the current conflict, remittances
comprised an important component of people’s
livelihoods, particularly in drought-prone areas.1 In
Somalia and Sri Lanka, also, remittances have been
essential to livelihoods for decades.
The impact and importance of remittances vary over time.
At the start of a conflict, remittances are frequently disrupted
by border closures, restrictions on movement and remittance
senders returning home. In Darfur, new ways to transfer
money were found, taking advantage of increased mobile
network coverage and the possibility of using mobile phones
for money transfers.2 The importance of remittances
increased during conflicts in Sri Lanka and Somalia.3 With a
million Somalis now living abroad, remittances have become
a substantial source of external revenue – estimated at
between US$700 million and US$1 billion in 2004.4 In Sri
Lanka, remittances may also have had a wider impact on the

■■ What can be done to support livelihoods and
food security in protracted crises?

to help them to buy food and essential basic assets, while at
the same time revitalizing markets and trade.

So what can be done to support livelihoods and food security?
There are three broad types of intervention: livelihood
provisioning, livelihood protection and livelihood promotion.26

Livelihood protection interventions aim to protect and
support people’s assets and to prevent negative outcomes,
such as divesting productive assets. Most examples of this in
Darfur relate to projects with IDPs or assistance to rural
populations aimed at discouraging migration to towns. In the
IDP camps, livelihood programming commonly aimed to
boost the incomes of IDPs so that they did not have to take
high personal risks by venturing into insecure areas, for
example to collect firewood. A number of NGOs provided lifesaving support to donkeys early in the conflict – donkeys were
often the only form of livestock owned by the IDPs and were
essential for fetching water and firewood and as a means of
transport. Fodder and veterinary care were provided and
space to keep the animals was organized in the camps.

Livelihood provisioning – the most common type of
intervention – aims to meet immediate basic needs and
protect people’s lives. Free food distribution is often carried
out for livelihood provisioning; as well as meeting immediate
food needs directly it frequently serves also as a form of
income support. This income support function was the
explicit intention of WFP when it increased food rations in
Darfur in 2005–06, allowing beneficiaries to sell more and
also helping to stabilize grain prices. Other examples of
livelihood provisioning include interventions such as voucher
systems, which people can use to buy essential goods and
services. In Darfur, fuel-efficient stoves have been widely
distributed, with the objective of reducing expenditure on
firewood and protecting the environment, and vouchers for
grain milling have been introduced. In the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the non-governmental organization
(NGO) German Agro Action provided cash-for-work to
people working on a road rehabilitation programme in order

war economy given that the receipt of remittances for
many Tamil populations was largely controlled and
sustained by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).5
Efforts to facilitate remittance flows could thus make a
significant difference to people’s livelihoods in crisis-affected
areas, yet they are rarely a component of humanitarian
response. Improved communication systems, open borders
and protection for remittance senders and receivers have
been recommended as ways of facilitating remittances.6

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

Livelihood promotion aims to improve livelihood strategies
and assets, and to support key policies and institutions that can
boost livelihoods. Projects that provide vocational training to
IDPs, for example, can enhance their skill levels and thus their
employability once the crisis is over. This has been done for IDPs
from the north–south civil war in the Sudan, and more recently
for displaced people currently living in camps in Darfur. In the

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

Democratic Republic of the Congo, the NGO Action contre la
Faim provided agricultural services such as seed multiplication
and crop protection as well as agricultural extension to improve
farming practices. Generally, however, humanitarian agencies do
not frequently engage with institutions and policies that could
boost livelihoods during the crisis, such as helping to negotiate
access to markets or engaging with issues over land rights and
land “occupation”. These are seen as “long-term” issues,
whereas short-term planning and funding drive much
humanitarian work. But there is growing demand for agencies
to engage with some of these contentious issues when the crisis
becomes protracted,27 and a number of positive examples can
be drawn upon. On the other hand, local institutions and civil
society organizations (CSOs) seem to be more flexible in dealing
with land-related issues. For instance in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the chambres de paix (local peace
councils – see page 25) were the only informal community
organization that played a role in local land disputes (see pages
24–26), while in Mozambique (see pages 43–44) customary
authorities were one of the pillars of the land reform process.

■■ What needs to be done to ensure more effective
livelihood interventions?
The capability of the international humanitarian aid
community to launch life-saving interventions has improved
substantially in the last decade, but the capability for all
types of livelihood programming has not kept pace.
Of particular concern is the time it takes for livelihood
programming to start when crises become protracted. The
chronology of the international humanitarian response in Darfur
illustrates this well. It was not until 2006/07 – at least three
years into the conflict – that agencies really engaged in
discussions about livelihoods and that significant funding for
livelihood programming became available. Even then, much of

this was short-term programming focused on livelihood
provisioning or, at best livelihood protection. Livelihood
promotion received much less attention. Yet the reality in Darfur
is that it has been undergoing a rapid process of urbanization
during the crisis years that will not be reversed. What is needed
is a vision for the urban economy for the future, and livelihood
programming that is aligned to that vision.
There are three priorities for strengthening livelihoods
programming in protracted crises in the future:
1. Livelihood assessments should be undertaken early in all
crises (not just protracted crises), incorporating not only
an assessment of basic life-saving needs but also an
assessment of the causes of longer-term vulnerability to
food insecurity for all groups. This should inform
strategies to protect and promote livelihoods that
should be implemented as soon as the emergency has
been contained. This kind of programming should be
seen as part of the first phase of response and should
not be delayed.
2. The analysis that precedes livelihoods programming
must pay attention to conflict and power dynamics, in
particular the interactions among different livelihood
groups. This is true not only for protracted crises caused
by conflict but also for natural disasters. In both, there is
a high probability that inequalities and exploitation by
the powerful will intensify in the chaos and weakened
governance that often prevails.
3. Humanitarian agencies must become aware of, and be
prepared to engage with, the longer-term transitions
that begin or are accelerated during prolonged crises,
the most common of which is urbanization. This
requirement challenges the short-term planning
horizons that characterize humanitarian programming,
yet will ensure more appropriate interventions that
prepare for the post-crisis era.

Gender issues in protracted crises
Key message
Protracted crises affect men and women differently.
Differences in gender roles and disparities in the way
men and women are treated play a major role in how
protracted crises emerge and are experienced. Better
understanding of these differences can improve
responses to protracted crises by the societies affected
as well as by providers of humanitarian assistance and
the international community as a whole.

Differences in gender roles and impacts result in part from
unequal access by men and women to assets, economic
opportunities, services, crisis aid and decision-making. For
example, in many societies women tend to be less educated,
less involved in the formal economy, less experienced in
dealing with authorities, endowed with fewer and poorerquality productive resources, and faced with more restrictions
on their mobility than men. Men and women are often
affected very differently in crisis situations. In armed conflicts,
for example, men may be drafted by force into military
groups or killed, while women are at high risk of sexual

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

violence and displacement. In other types of crisis, men may
migrate in search of alternative employment, while women
take on a higher proportion of work previously handled by
men. These differences influence what resources women and
men can draw upon in crisis situations, and thus their ability
to respond.
Surprisingly, debates on humanitarian emergencies and
protracted crises have largely ignored gender issues. In many
crises, little is known about gender dynamics prior to the
crisis, limiting the basis for analysing both the short- and
long-term impacts of a crisis. These knowledge gaps are
further compounded by a dearth of gender-disaggregated
data on poverty and vulnerability in protracted crisis
situations.28

■■ Men and women are affected differently by
protracted crises
Protracted crises affect men and women differently in three
key areas: sexual exploitation and gender-based violence,
access to social services such as health care and education,
and stress on livelihood strategies and survival or coping
mechanisms.

Sexual exploitation and gender-based violence
Vulnerable people trying to survive protracted crises are at
heightened risk of being forced into exploitative sexual
relationships. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable,
but young males may also be victims. The fear of sexual
exploitation may also force vulnerable women to form
alliances with soldiers and other men in power as a safety
measure. This frequently causes other problems, such as
more abuse and eventual abandonment, as well as potential
expulsion of affected women from their home communities.
Evidence from disparate countries such as Liberia, Myanmar,
Sierra Leone and Uganda shows that displaced children are
frequently targets of abduction and recruitment by armed
combatants.29 Boys are typically recruited for combat and
other military activities. While girls may also fight on the
front lines, they are more likely to be recruited for sexual
purposes and forced marriage. In many cases, physical injury
carries additional emotional, psychological, economic and
social disadvantages.30
Violence against women and girls represents one of the
most tragic gender-specific results of the collapse of
institutions that characterizes protracted crises. Genderbased violence not only violates human rights, but also
negatively affects human capital in terms of people’s
productive and reproductive abilities, access to health,
nutrition, education and other productive resources, and
ultimately undermines opportunities for economic growth.
Rape and domestic violence cause more death and
disability among girls and women aged 16–44 years than
do cancer, motor vehicle accidents, war and malaria
combined.31

22

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

Access to social services such as health care
and education
Poor governance and lack of resources and capacities affect
both the provision of public services and households’ abilities
to invest in education and health care. This has negative
implications for both mothers and children, most notably in
the form of high levels of maternal mortality.
Maternal mortality is high in countries that have been, or
still are, in protracted crisis and at the same time are faced
with chronic food insecurity (Figure 10). The average maternal
mortality ratio (number of maternal deaths per 100 000 live
births in a given year) in the 22 countries in protracted crisis is
almost four times as high as the global average, and the rate
increases significantly with the duration of the crisis.
Gender-based disparities are also evident in access to
education. In countries in protracted crisis, girls tend to have
much less access to education than boys do, particularly at
the secondary level.
Several factors contribute to these disparities. For
instance, when household resources are scarce, boys often
get first priority for schooling.32 Protracted crises can lead to
higher drop-out rates for girls as they are forced to assume
greater roles within their households.33 If schools close and
children have to travel further to get to school, parents
might opt against exposing their daughters to dangers
inherent in travel, such as sexual violence.34
Low levels of school attainment by girls are associated
with higher levels of malnutrition. For instance, the odds of
having a stunted child decrease by about 4 to 5 percent for
every additional year of formal education achieved by
mothers.35 Reduced livelihood opportunities can also increase
the vulnerability of girls and women over the longer term.
Yet public investment in the education sector in countries in
protracted crises is generally low, as is investment from aid
(see pages 27–31).

Stress on livelihood strategies and survival or
coping mechanisms
Protracted crises reduce household livelihood security, most
importantly by restricting access to economic opportunities,
reducing investment choices and reducing or destroying
household assets. Women are often over-represented in crisis
zones because men are more likely to migrate in search of work
elsewhere or to become fighters in military operations. The
outcome is often a heavily altered demographic structure in the
crisis-affected areas, with high proportions of female-headed
households. Such households are particularly vulnerable
because they commonly have a higher share of old people and
children, fewer assets and less access to resources.36 Liberia
provides a telling example. In 2005, 14 years after the armed
conflict began, over half of Liberian families were headed by a
single parent, most of whom were women. In addition, there
were many single mothers with children born outside of
marriage, often the result of rape. Such women are extremely
vulnerable to social isolation and discrimination.37

Relations among household members and gender roles
are also affected, but the extent to which crisis and conflict
change gender roles (and for how long) remains the subject
of debate. Crisis and conflict cause the breakdown of many
traditional roles and barriers, and may open new space for
women in terms of livelihoods, economic roles, and
community leadership. Women may take a more active role
in economic affairs and begin performing work that is
confined to men in “normal” times. For example, during the
civil war in Sri Lanka rural women took a larger role in
marketing activities because men were more liable to be
detained at army checkpoints or by the rebels.38
Yet in most cases gender roles may be modified only
temporarily, returning to pre-crisis patterns when the crisis
is over. For instance, urban insecurity in Zimbabwe in 2006
drove many men to return to their rural homes, resulting in
a sharp decline in household earnings. As a consequence,
the gender difference in incomes temporarily declined.
However, economic improvements in 2007 provided fewer
opportunities for women than for men, largely because
rigid social norms have stereotyped them as household
caretakers.39 Thus, sharp gender disparities have
re-emerged in rural Zimbabwe because of limited
recognition and value given to women’s domestic work,
combined with severe constraints on women’s mobility to
participate in non-domestic economic opportunities.
Similarly, the demographic impact of the Liberian crisis
undoubtedly contributed to the prominent role that women
now play in the production of food crops and in the
processing of agricultural produce. However, women’s
participation in cash crop production and other more
lucrative agricultural activities continues to be constrained by
an inflexible gender division of labour, reducing their

households’ food security as well as reducing the productivity
of the agriculture sector in general.40

■■ Incorporating a gender perspective into
responses to protracted crises
By definition, humanitarian and early recovery responses to
protracted crises are carried out in difficult situations. It is
therefore understandable that they often focus on the “big
picture”: saving lives, delivering essential supplies, protecting
basic human rights and trying to build the social and
economic foundations for long-term recovery. In the midst of
these urgent challenges, gender issues may seem irrelevant
or of little importance.
Yet, in most cases, a gender perspective in humanitarian
assistance can help address these more visible challenges. As
noted in a Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) report, “a gender perspective can assist in the
profiling and understanding of vulnerabilities and capacities,
assist humanitarian agencies channel resources to those
most in need, and also assist in the mobilization of a
significant proportion of the population whose capacities are
often underestimated”.41
The first step to incorporating gender into humanitarian
crisis policies and programmes is a sound analysis of differential
vulnerabilities and impact generated by the crises as well as
differential strengths and capabilities. This would allow planners
to target those who face particularly adverse conditions or at
least to ensure that their needs are not neglected. Evidence
shows that when gender analysis is neglected, humanitarian
programmes may cause more harm than good.42
Second, it is important to ensure that actual programmes
on the ground are gender-sensitive. Such programmes

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

23

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

should seek to redress not only existing inequalities but to
secure and build assets in ways that empower victims of
crises (e.g. through safe and secure access to land, cash and
other productive resources for women and the youth).
Evidence indicates that relief programmes that adopt a
gender perspective can avert widespread malnutrition and
lead to quick and more widespread recovery in food
production and other aspects of livelihoods.43
Third, humanitarian response must deliberately ensure
that institutions embrace a gender perspective in which the
needs and rights of both women and men are recognized
and addressed. As such, community groups and
professional networks (including women’s organizations),
civil society and other organizations must participate in

dialogue to reconstruct the lives and livelihoods of the
victims of protracted crises.
The fourth aspect in which gender issues could be
integrated into response to protracted crises is in the
provision of social services, including but not limited to
health and education. The foregoing analysis has shown
how the impact of protracted crises on health and
education is higher on women than men. Improving access
to health and education particularly for women would have
a long-term positive effect on social and economic
development in communities affected by protracted crises.

Learning from, and building on,
community responses
Key message
Local socio-economic and institutional arrangements
that existed prior to a protracted crisis – or were
developed in response to it – can provide a sustainable
basis for addressing drivers of the crisis and for
rebuilding livelihoods after the crisis is over.

The role of local organizations and institutions in
protracted crisis and post-crisis recovery situations is often
ignored by humanitarian aid and development
organizations. This section draws on case-study evidence
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Sierra
Leone and the Sudan to demonstrate how informal socioeconomic and institutional arrangements can provide a
sustainable basis for addressing drivers of the crisis,
rebuilding livelihoods and improving food security. The
case studies support the notion that situation assessments
should go beyond the identification of immediate
humanitarian needs and include an analysis of the local
socio-economic and institutional context and the roles to
be played by local people’s organizations and institutions.
All four countries reviewed in this section have been
affected by prolonged internal and external conflicts; of
these, two remain, at least in some areas, in a “no peace,
no war” situation. The drivers of the conflicts and of the
overall institutional breakdown that have characterized
these countries (or parts of these countries) are different

24

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

but with a number of common elements, such as
competition over access to land, conflicts over areas rich in
natural resources, social exclusion mechanisms, and overall
poor governance.
A major impact of these crises has been a dramatic
increase in the level of food insecurity in the countries or
regions affected. In Sierra Leone, for instance, two and a
half million people (46 percent of the population) were
undernourished in 2004–06, 600 000 more than when
the war started, while in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the prevalence of undernourishment rose from
26 percent in the period 1990–92 to the current level of
around 70 percent. In the Sudan, while national trends
indicate progress in the reduction of the level of
undernourishment, food insecurity worsened specifically
in the regions affected by conflicts such as southern
Sudan.44 Furthermore, crises commonly lead to the
displacement of large numbers of people and the
disruption of the livelihood systems that formerly
supported them.45 These consequences, in turn, lead to a
vicious cycle of political instability, breakdown of public
services and conflict among sections of the population as
they compete for access and control over the remaining
resources and services.
With the weakening or breakdown of public services,
people turn to local initiatives, often based on traditional
institutions, for the provision of basic services. These
institutions often prove effective and resilient in otherwise
chaotic situations.

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

■■ Local institutions and post-conflict recovery
Numerous studies on countries in protracted crisis have
identified local socio-economic and institutional changes that
have helped in addressing some of the structural drivers of
crises and that could provide a sustainable basis for postconflict recovery.
For example, in Sierra Leone, many communities
developed strong informal networks and local institutions,
partly as a reaction to the breakdown of national
structures.46 One study found that, three years after the end
of the civil war, measures of local community mobilization
and collective action – including the number of community
meetings and voter registration – were higher in areas that
had experienced more war-related violence against civilians
than in areas that had experienced less violence.47
A 2009 World Bank report on youth employment in Sierra
Leone noted an upsurge in self-organized social activism
among young people after the war, including the
establishment of business cooperatives, groups aiming at the
development of a chiefdom and section or district and
occupational groups, such as bike-riders and tape-sellers
associations. In the Kono District alone, one NGO study
counted 141 groups with membership of more than
17 000 young people.48
Fieldwork carried out in Sierra Leone in 2004 and 2008 in
Kayima, a village situated in Sandor Chiefdom that had
traditionally served as a pool of unskilled mining labour,
found that tensions between chiefs and youth over land
rights and mining revenues had decreased over the study
period as “wartime displacement had fostered a new sense
of self-reliance among people of all ages”. Youths also
showed a renewed interest in farming and family-oriented life
in the village as they turned away from poorly paid diamond
mining. Sixty-eight percent of interviewees in Kayima had
joined labour cooperatives or social clubs, and credited these
organizations with facilitating their successful return to
farming. With the return of former miners and others
displaced by the conflict, the pool of family labour had grown
and local residents could now cultivate larger farms.49
Similarly, in eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, local people relied on their own institutions to
deal with issues related to access to land that were fuelling
the conflict. They established so-called chambres de paix or
“peace councils”, composed of elders and tasked with
investigating land disputes and reaching a compromise
solution among the concerned farmers. Some local
associations also played a role beyond conflict resolution,
introducing collective fields, establishing microcredit systems,
informing farmers about their property rights, providing
information on the legal framework regulating access to land
and advocating at the national level for a modification of the
existing land laws. Despite their dynamism and development
potential, particularly in addressing the key drivers of food
insecurity, these local associations and the chambres de paix

lacked technical and financial capabilities and their potential
role as building blocks for addressing some of the underlying
drivers of food insecurity and conflict was seldom recognized
and integrated into the action plans of intervening agencies.50
In Liberia, informal institutions played a critical role in the
survival and food security of local people during the civil war
from the late 1980s to 2003, and indigenous “development
associations” were central to the reconstitution of postconflict governance arrangements, the provision of social
protection, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and promotion
of food and livelihood security. For example, clan-based
networks and membership organizations or “development
associations”, such as the Dugbe River Union in Sinoe
County and the Seletorwaa development association in
Yarwin-Mehnsonnoh District, emerged to cope with the
drivers of the conflict and its impact on livelihoods. These
organizations created safety nets for the vulnerable and
food-insecure, resolved conflicts and developed social and
physical infrastructure such as clinics, roads, market sheds
and community halls.51
These observations demonstrate first and foremost the
remarkable resilience of local people in the face of conflict.
They also illustrate that crises not only lead to devastation:
they can also result in important positive institutional and
social changes, including increased political awareness and
an upsurge in self-organized collective action. Provided they
are identified and well-managed, such changes can become
powerful drivers for sustainable post-conflict recovery and
entry points for more imaginative and empowering support
by agencies beyond aid distribution. However, there are risks
that local elites can exploit such developments for their own
self-interest and that indiscriminate funding of these
activities by development agencies can create aid
dependency among emerging local organizations. Engaging
with such mechanisms thus will require careful situation
analysis and monitoring to ensure that efforts to improve the
well-being of the broad population are not misdirected.

■■ Building and rebuilding local institutions
Experiences from several countries demonstrate how
investments by government, civil society and development
agencies can build on and amplify local social and
institutional changes.
The farmer field school initiative in Sierra Leone is a good
example of how such investments are helping to address
some of the food-security-related structural drivers and
impacts of the conflict. The Government and its
development partners launched the initiative immediately
after the end of the war in 2002. The core objectives of the
programme were to rebuild trust among members of rural
communities ravaged by the civil war and to train farmers,
many of whom were young and inexperienced, in basic
practices related to agricultural production, processing and
marketing. Part of the rationale was also to increase the

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

25

Countries in protracted crisis: what are they and why do they deserve special attention?

accountability of service providers, whether in government or
CSOs, to the farming community. This was seen as a way to
strengthen and decentralize government institutions that,
already weak before the war, had been further debilitated
during the war.52
Farmer field schools also provided a unique opportunity
to help young people who had never received any formal
training during the war years to become viable farmers.
Since the inception of the initiative approximately 75 000
farmers, from about 3 000 rural groups, have graduated
from such field schools run under either Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) or NGO
extension programmes. Youths accounted for 60 percent of
participants in field schools carried out by United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP)-funded programmes
between 2004 and 2007. Most graduates either returned to
work for existing organizations or went on to establish new
farmer-based organizations in their communities. In Sierra
Leone, independent impact assessments have shown that
they have increased the long-term sustainability of
community-led initiatives and helped to rebuild selfsustaining farmer-based organizations.
There has been a similar experience in southern Sudan,
where an innovative livestock health programme was able
to build on the capabilities of local organizations and
institutions to develop community-based services that
helped to control livestock rinderpest.53
Initial efforts by Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) in
1989–92 to control rinderpest in the area were “top down”,
bringing in formally trained animal health workers and
establishing a cold-chain to deliver vaccines. No local
institutions were involved because OLS wanted to be seen
to be independent of parties to the civil war. But this lack of
local buy-in proved to be the downfall of the initial effort.
In 1993, the OLS programme changed its strategy
towards the use of community-based approaches that built
on local institutions, such as informal pastoralist
associations. Traditional institutions, such as elders’ groups
and other kinship-based associations, were involved in the

26

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

planning process and herders were trained as vaccinators
and supplied with heat-stable rinderpest vaccine. These new
approaches quickly achieved positive results. The OLS
programme vaccinated over 1 million cattle in 1995,
compared with only 140 000 in 1993. Outbreaks of
rinderpest decreased from 11 in 1993 to only 1 in 1997.
There have been no confirmed outbreaks of rinderpest in
southern Sudan since 1998.
The experiences from both Sierra Leone and southern
Sudan indicate that livelihoods-based food-security
programming is possible in protracted crises. It requires
commitment to livelihoods approaches, a strong but flexible
coordination effort with control over resources, and support
for systematic assessment of the impact of interventions on
livelihoods. The involvement of local institutions and an
engagement with parties in conflict are fundamental to the
success of such programmes.
The Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan case studies indicate
that informal socio-economic and institutional arrangements
that existed prior to a protracted crisis or developed in
response to it can provide a sustainable basis for addressing
the drivers of the crisis and rebuilding livelihoods after the
crisis is over. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo case study illustrates how assessments carried out by
aid and development agencies are often narrowly focused
on identifying immediate needs, while the capabilities and
potential roles of local organizations in programme planning
and implementation are frequently ignored.
Experiences from Liberia and Sierra Leone also illustrate
the importance of addressing the social and economic
exclusion of youth. Although this issue is often ignored, it is
a major driver of conflict and needs to be addressed if postconflict recovery is to be sustainable and effective.
The lesson that can be learned from this is that
humanitarian and development agencies should base their
actions during and after a conflict on an assessment that
goes beyond immediate humanitarian needs and includes
an analysis of the evolving local socio-economic and
institutional contexts.

National and international responses
to protracted crises
Analysis of aid flows to countries in protracted crisis
Key message
Official development assistance (ODA) contributes to a
large share of public expenditure in most countries in
protracted crisis. Yet the level of ODA to these countries
remains low and unevenly distributed, with key sectors
such as agriculture seriously underfunded, and is not
adequately linked to development objectives.

A

id to countries in protracted crisis is a major tool
used in mitigating the effects of food insecurity
and in addressing the structural issues that cause
it. As noted earlier (see page 13), countries in protracted crisis
are characterized by a relatively high dependence on
humanitarian assistance. In most countries in protracted crisis,
a large part of the investment in the country’s capital – such
as schools, roads, railways, hospitals and land improvements
– is also financed by aid. For the 18 countries in protracted
crisis for which data were available, external funds accounted
for about 80 percent of gross capital formation in 2007,
indicating significant dependence on external aid.54 This
section examines trends and volumes of aid flows that went
to countries in protracted crisis between 2000 and 2008 and
related policy implications.55 Overall trends are contrasted
with data from other least-developed countries (LDCs).56
Afghanistan and Iraq are excluded because the dramatic
increase of development assistance to these two countries
risked distorting the overall analysis of aid flows to countries
in protracted crisis. Development ODA to Iraq, for example,
increased over 120-fold between 2000 and 2008, from
US$23 million in 2000 to US$2.8 billion in 2008; while in
Afghanistan, development ODA increased more than fiftyfold, from US$63 million in 2000 to US$3.5 billion in 2008.
These increases are associated with the conflicts and related
security and anti-terrorism concerns that have affected these
two countries and, to some degree, a number of other
countries in protracted crisis.

Recent trends have seen increased allocation and
targeting of development and humanitarian assistance
according to security criteria – a phenomenon often
labelled the “securitization of aid”. This trend is based on
the argument that security is a precondition for
emergence from crisis situations. However, some observers
are concerned that targeting assistance by security criteria
– rather than by poverty or humanitarian criteria –
allocates a disproportionate share of resources to the most
conflict-affected countries or areas at the expense of
other places with equally pressing needs and potentially
higher probability of developmental or humanitarian
impact from assistance.

■■ Development aid and humanitarian aid are
increasing but better balance is needed
Globally, both development ODA (excluding debt relief) and
humanitarian ODA grew by roughly 60 percent between
2000 and 2008 (Figure 11). Development aid rose from
US$59.2 billion in 2000 to US$95.2 billion in 2008, while
humanitarian aid increased from US$6.7 billion in 2000 to
US$10.7 billion in 2008 (2007 constant prices).

Development aid57
Development aid to countries in protracted crisis (excluding
Afghanistan and Iraq) grew slightly faster than the global
average over the period, rising from US$5.5 billion to
US$11.0 billion, representing a 100 percent increase
between 2000 and 2008. However, it started from very low
levels in 2000 (US$5.5 billion), representing 9 percent of all
development assistance, while by 2008, it accounted for only
12 percent of all development assistance. Considering the
average over the years 2000–02 the per capita rate was
equivalent to US$17.87, below the LDC average of
US$28.69. Accordingly, 14 of the countries in protracted
crisis still received less development aid per capita than the
LDC average in the most recent period analysed (2006–08;
Figure 12).

Humanitarian assistance to countries in protracted crisis
(excluding Afghanistan and Iraq) has risen steadily,
resulting in a five-fold increase between 2000 and 2008,
from US$978 million to US$4.8 billion. Humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq, overall, has also
climbed significantly. In the case of Afghanistan,
humanitarian assistance increased from US$155 million in
2000 to US$802 million in 2008. Iraq, in 2000, was
receiving US$141 million in humanitarian assistance. By
2008, this had more than doubled to US$359 million, with
a peak of US$1.2 billion in 2003. Over the same period,
humanitarian assistance has become increasingly
concentrated among countries in protracted crisis; the
proportion of total global humanitarian assistance going to
countries in protracted crisis tripled over the period,
increasing from 15 percent to 45 percent (56 percent if
Afghanistan and Iraq are included). The amount of
humanitarian assistance per capita varied widely among
countries in protracted crisis and across years, as would be
expected given the nature of the response to emergencies
(Figure 13). However, unlike development assistance, all
countries in protracted crisis received more humanitarian
aid per capita than the LDC average.

■■ Sectoral analysis of aid flows shows that key
sectors for food security are underfunded
This analysis of aid flows to different sectors focuses on
agriculture and education – two sectors that are
particularly crucial for food security. Regrettably, the way
ODA data are organized preclude a more detailed analysis

28

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

of the kinds of programming that appear to be most
relevant to protracted crises, such as assistance to
livelihood promotion or social protection.
Based on 2005–2008 ODA commitments, only 3.1 percent
of development ODA received by countries in protracted crisis
is dedicated to agriculture (Figure 14), compared with an
average of 5.8 percent for LDCs. Yet the agriculture sector
accounts for an average of 32 percent of protracted crisis
countries’ GDP and employs an average of 62 percent of their
populations (see Annex table 2), proportions similar to those
of the group of LDCs. The case studies presented in this
report (see, in particular, pages 18–21) illustrate the
importance of agricultural and rural-based livelihoods to the
groups most affected by protracted crises.
Similarly, the percentage of development ODA allocated
to education is very low in countries in protracted crisis
(3.8 percent, compared with an average of 9.6 percent for
LDCs), while basic (i.e. primary) education receives just
1.6 percent, compared with an average of 3.5 percent
for LDCs.
All but three (Angola, Eritrea and Guinea) of the
22 countries in protracted crisis receive a lower percentage
of development ODA targeted to basic education than the
average for LDCs (Figure 15). However, given the low level of
per capita ODA that these three countries receive, aid flows
to basic education remain very low even here.
Yet education is vital to achieving food security in the
long-run. There is ample evidence that investing in
education, particularly basic education, contributes to
reducing hunger and undernourishment by increasing the
productivity of smallholders and subsistence farmers. Low
levels of school attainment are associated with high levels of
undernourishment.58 A survey conducted for the World Bank
found that a farmer with four years of primary education is,
on average, almost 9 percent more productive than a farmer
with no education.59

■■ Food aid remains the best-supported
humanitarian response, especially in countries
in protracted crisis60
As with development ODA, agriculture received a small
proportion of total humanitarian assistance (3 percent of
total commitments globally in 2009, and 4 percent in
protracted crisis countries). Education received a mere
2 percent of humanitarian ODA.
The allocation of humanitarian assistance through the
Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP) illustrates the current
priority given to food aid over other forms of assistance –
globally and in countries in protracted crisis.61
Food aid is the best-funded sector of humanitarian aid,
receiving on average 96 percent of funding requested
globally through the CAP between 2000 and 2008.62
Countries in protracted crisis fared slightly less well,
receiving 84 percent of funding requested for food aid over

the same period (Figure 16). On average, the agriculture
sector fares less well than the food aid sector, receiving on
average just 44 percent of funds requested globally and
45 percent in countries in protracted crisis between 2000
and 2008. Education and other key sectors such as water
and sanitation also received less than 50 percent of
assessed needs.

■■ Aid flows: what does this mean for food
security in countries in protracted crisis?
The current low level of ODA to countries in protracted
crisis should be reconsidered given that most of them still
depend on external aid for a large part of their pro-poor
public investments. At the same time, humanitarian
assistance – which has increased rapidly and has been a
major source of aid over prolonged periods of time –
should be integrated with development assistance within a
long-term policy and planning framework. This will require
significant rethinking of the ways assistance is delivered to
these countries.

Regarding food security, it is difficult to track investments
aimed at reducing food insecurity using existing data sets,
and almost impossible to identify key initiatives such as
livelihoods promotion and protection and social protection.
This limits the ability to formulate policy decisions that would
contribute to reducing food insecurity.
Despite these limitations, a sectoral analysis of aid flows
provides a number of indications. Both development and
humanitarian assistance to agriculture in countries in
protracted crisis are below the LDC average, despite the fact
that such investments are crucial for rebuilding and
promoting livelihoods. Basic education is also underfunded
relative to the key role it has in promoting long-term food
security. Long-term gains in food security are therefore
compromised. At the same time, food aid receives support
close to actual needs Food aid is vital for preserving lives and
protecting livelihoods in countries in crisis, and must
continue to receive support from donors, but action is
needed to raise awareness of the shortfalls in funding for
other areas that can help these countries build the
foundations of long-term food security.

National and international responses to protracted crises

Humanitarian food assistance in protracted crises
Key message
Humanitarian food assistance not only saves lives in
protracted crises, but is also an investment in long-term
food security and future development.

Humanitarian food assistance is a significant feature of
protracted crisis environments. It saves lives and helps
address the scarcity or deprivation that underlies many
protracted crises. Humanitarian food assistance is also an
investment in a country’s future. Emergency food support
that safeguards nutrition and livelihoods and supports
education provides a strong basis for food security in the
longer term and represents a potentially crucial investment in
future development. The many operational and political
challenges of working in protracted crises, however, should
not be underestimated.

■■ From food aid to food assistance: a strategic shift
Year after year, the largest share of the commitments made
in response to UN appeals for emergencies worldwide goes
to food assistance, which includes in-kind food aid, cash
contributions for the local and regional purchase of food,
food vouchers and cash provided directly to the
beneficiaries.63 Forty-four percent of the original 2009
Humanitarian Appeal, for instance, was for food and foodassisted programmes (US$3.1 billion of US$7 billion sought).
Observers have long feared that humanitarian aid –
particularly prolonged food aid – can undermine local
economies and damage local agricultural production.
Recent years have seen a notable shift away from food aid
imports to more sustainable and developmental
procurement practices. Food assistance in crisis situations
no longer means just food aid; new tools are available to
WFP and other agencies working in protracted crisis
environments. In countries or areas where markets are
functioning poorly, food assistance might mean the
provision of food directly to families, as the most basic form
of safety net. Where markets are in place and distribution
infrastructure exists, it can mean the provision of cash or
vouchers, which enable recipients to purchase food items
directly at selected shops. The possibility of tailoring
interventions to specific contexts has made it possible to
provide more nuanced and context-specific interventions

32

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

and helped alleviate concerns about the possible
disincentive effects of prolonged assistance.
The largest food assistance agency, WFP, now buys more
food for distribution than it receives in kind. In 2009,
80 percent of WFP’s purchases were made in developing
countries, including in 12 of the 22 countries in protracted
crisis considered in this report. WFP has also realigned the
way it buys food to address more effectively the root causes
of hunger: “Purchase for Progress”, begun in 2008, is
designed to enhance smallholders’ and low-income farmers’
access to markets where they can sell their produce at
competitive prices. In Liberia, for instance, the initiative
involves 5 600 farmers and is expected to improve their
linkages to markets and build national capacity in production,
processing and marketing of agricultural produce. Eight
countries in protracted crisis are among the initiative’s pilot
countries, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Sierra Leone and the Sudan.

■■ Humanitarian food assistance as an investment
in a country’s future
During the acute phase of a crisis, food-assistance safety nets
– including blanket and targeted food or cash transfers,
mother and child nutrition and school meal programmes – are
life-saving interventions and are often funded from specifically
humanitarian resource pools. Yet these activities also help to
preserve the human assets that are a necessary foundation for
a country’s future stability, food security and growth.
Food assistance given to safeguard mothers’ and young
children’s nutrition, for example, is a powerful basis for
longer-term development – even a few months of
inadequate nutrition in young children can have irreversible,
life-long negative effects on health, education and
productivity (see Box 6). Estimates of GDP lost to
malnutrition range from 2–3 percent in many countries64 to
11 percent in some Central American countries.65
School meals have proved effective in protecting
vulnerable people while providing nutrition, education and
gender-equity benefits, along with a wide range of socioeconomic gains.66 In an emergency or protracted crisis
context, school feeding encourages children to enter and
remain in school by providing food to the household on
condition that children attend class. In a post-crisis or
transition context, school-feeding programmes can restore
the educational system and encourage the return of IDPs and

BOX 6

Nutrition in countries in protracted crisis

Adequate nutrition is essential for growth, good health
and physical and cognitive development, and requires a
diverse diet including staple foods, vegetables, fruits,
animal-source foods and fortified foods.1 Nutrition is
affected not only by food availability and access but also
by disease, sanitation – including access to safe drinking
water – and availability of preventive health services.
Countries in protracted crisis are characterized by high
or very high levels of undernutrition and recurrent high
levels of acute malnutrition (wasting, or low weight-forheight). These limit the development of individuals and
societies: undernutrition kills (contributing to a third of
the 8.8 million annual child deaths worldwide2) and
increases morbidity. Children who are stunted (short for
their age owing to inadequate nutrition) by the age of
two years are highly unlikely to reach their full educational
and productive potential. In 18 of the 22 countries in
protracted crisis, the prevalence of stunting is above the
developing-country average of 34 percent.3 This affects
both the individuals and their countries’ long-term
prospects for recovery and development.4
Preventing and treating undernutrition in protracted
crises requires a combination of actions. Emergency
actions are needed to meet immediate nutritional needs,
while interventions that restore food security are the basis
for improving nutrition in the long term. Action is also
required to stabilize and improve food consumption and
nutrient intake. This may best be achieved in the short
term by distributing foods formulated to meet the nutrient

refugees by signalling that basic services are operating and it
is thus safe to return home. Food-assistance safety nets also
include productive activities such as food- or cash-for-work
to rehabilitate community assets, preserve livelihoods and
increase households’ resilience. In Haiti, food- and cash-forwork are used to meet the immediate needs of food-insecure
populations while supporting the rebuilding of vital
economic and social community assets that will increase
households’ resilience to disasters (see Box 7).

■■ Humanitarian activities in the “gap” between
relief and development
The role of agencies providing humanitarian food assistance
is significant: crisis-affected populations need the basic
services and livelihood opportunities that they provide. And
the capacity – or, in some cases, willingness – of states to
meet these needs is often lacking.

needs of specific target groups, such as young children at
risk of undernutrition and households that cannot cook
because of displacement or lack of cooking fuel.5
Prevention of undernutrition (stunting) among children
between conception and two years of age is as important
as treatment of wasting. Thus, priority must be given not
only to treating acute malnutrition but also to preventing
undernutrition among young children by improving the
nutrient intake of the children themselves as well as their
pregnant and lactating mothers. In practical terms this
means targeting such food interventions to pregnant
women, lactating women, children aged 6–24 months,
and children suffering from moderate or severe wasting.

of moderately malnourished populations of children. Food and Nutrition
Bulletin, 30: S267–S343; and S. De Pee and M.W. Bloem. 2009. Current

Development initiatives for poverty reduction and
employment investments are often non-existent during
protracted crises, too slowly introduced or insufficiently
targeted to the poorest and the hungry. Humanitarian food
assistance can begin to facilitate a movement towards
development, helping to reduce underlying risk factors, build
resilience and provide a basis for eventual national social
protection. However, it is not a substitute for other forms of
effective international engagement in crises, including the
provision of alternatives to humanitarian assistance.
Moreover, no international engagement is a substitute for
effective and accountable national government and social
protection systems.
The fact that humanitarian food assistance can be a
basis for development does not mean that it alone should
be held accountable to development objectives and
principles. Acting according to humanitarian principles,
which stress independence and neutrality in order to meet

Using humanitarian food assistance to increase household resilience to disasters in Haiti

Haiti is in a situation of protracted complex crisis shaped
by urban violence, recurrent natural disasters and the
impact of the global economic crisis. Emergency food
assistance was provided following food-price-related riots
in April 2008, three consecutive hurricanes and a tropical
storm in August and September 2008, and an earthquake
in January 2010.
New thinking was required on how best to use the
extensive humanitarian effort to support longer-term
recovery and food security, which meant building

the acute needs of individuals in a timely and impartial
manner, is not always compatible with working through
and building the capacity of state or local institutions.
Because states in a protracted crisis usually have insufficient
capacity to meet people’s needs, and may even be
perpetrating the crisis that causes them, state structures
cannot be counted on to facilitate or channel life-saving
assistance and to reach people in need impartially.
Humanitarian investments may in some cases support state
institutions but may also not be optimal for longer-term
capacity-building. This is not necessarily counterproductive
for the state; on the contrary, maintaining all parties’
perception of humanitarian agencies’ neutrality is essential
if agencies are also to be able to work with states and
affected communities in the post-crisis phase as a credible
and trusted development interlocutor.
Humanitarian food assistance can also help to lay a
foundation for food security and future development by
improving disaster preparedness and risk reduction, as well
as by safeguarding nutrition, education and livelihoods.
Where a protracted crisis results from, or is compounded by,
recurrent natural disasters, humanitarian food assistance
represents an opportunity to begin such measures. The
development of Ethiopia’s well-known Productive Safety
Nets Programme (PSNP) – which reaches about 7.3 million
rural dwellers with transfers of food or cash to help bridge
food-deficit periods while generating community assets –
was based in part on decades of experience in responding
to individual disasters and famines through humanitarian
food assistance. The PSNP marries the humanitarian food
agencies’ understanding of vulnerability with, among other
components, the lessons learned from successful
community-based asset development schemes such as
MERET – a WFP-supported government programme
supporting sustainable land and water management and
increased productivity in food-insecure communities. The
PSNP is also an example of how countries emerging from

34

resilience to future disasters. The initial emphasis on
blanket food distributions shifted towards more targeted
transfers as acute needs subsided. Changes included
ramping up school meal and nutrition programmes in the
affected areas. Taking into account people’s exposure to
future rapid-onset shocks, agencies began emphasizing
work programmes, supported through food- and cashfor-work, to help vulnerable households recover and build
community and household assets that would reduce
future disaster risks and increase their resilience.

protracted crises can build long-term assistance programmes
for vulnerable groups on the basis of experience with
humanitarian food-assistance safety nets.
In contexts where state capacity is especially weak or
where violence and rights violations are perpetuating the
crisis, the possibility of handover to a responsible and
responsive state is more distant, but the assistance itself
still serves to protect human and community assets from
further harm and loss. This was for years the case in
southern Sudan, where conflict and associated human
rights abuses caused famines in which many civilians
perished. The limits of what humanitarian food assistance
could achieve were clear as long as the underlying causes
of hunger (e.g. the conflict and rights abuses that
provoked the 1988 famine in which 250 000 died) were
not stopped.67 The 2005 Consolidated Peace Agreement
represented the beginning of a period in which it was
possible to envisage a transition to humanitarian food
assistance that more meaningfully supported recovery. At
that stage, food distributions helped to meet immediate
basic needs while also contributing to building
communities’ confidence in the peace process. Returnees,
in particular, were targeted with food assistance to help
tide them over during the months until they could resettle
and harvest from their own farms. A recent study in the
Sudan concluded that returnees had the greatest food
assistance needs upon arrival, and that the provision of this
assistance had one of the most significant positive impacts
on reintegration and recovery for this group.68

■■ Challenges and risks for food assistance in
protracted crises
Protracted crises pose many challenges and risks that
agencies must manage effectively if humanitarian food
assistance is both to meet its life-saving objective and to
provide a strong basis for food security in the longer term.

National and international responses to protracted crises

Maintaining humanitarian space
Humanitarian actors in many of today’s protracted crisis
contexts confront tension between serving the humanitarian
imperative – meeting people’s immediate need for food –
and adhering to core humanitarian principles of neutrality,
impartiality and independence. Agencies may make
compromises on principle in order to gain and maintain
access to vulnerable populations. For example, WFP
coordinated its operations in northern Sri Lanka in 2006–09
with the Sri Lankan military, which was essential to facilitate
important food deliveries to the north of the country. This
may also, however, have compromised perceptions of WFP’s
humanitarian effort as fully neutral or independent, a
situation that may complicate future relations with
communities in the Tamil north.
The need to balance conflicting priorities in order to
establish and maintain “humanitarian space” is a constant
characteristic of food assistance operations in many of
today’s protracted crises. The stakes are high; as explained
above, maintaining perceptions of humanitarian agencies’
neutrality is essential for the agencies’ ability, during and
following a crisis, to work effectively in areas affected by
conflict. The perception that humanitarians’ neutrality and
independence from political agendas is compromised can
be dangerous or deadly for humanitarians and the
populations they are trying to assist. In Afghanistan, aid
agency staff members have been attacked by armed
insurgent groups because of their actual or perceived
association with the government or coalition forces. This
has had a negative impact not only on the safety of staff,
but also on their ability to reach people in need. With the
increased targeting of aid workers by insurgents, some
organizations have completely halted their assistance in
parts of Afghanistan. Arguably, in an increasing number of
today’s protracted crises, humanitarians must think beyond
their need to be perceived as neutral, independent and
impartial in a given country, to how they are associated
with global political actors, trends and events, and the likely
repercussions of those linkages on future operations.

Doing no harm
Humanitarian food assistance is sometimes the most
valuable resource in underserviced, remote and often
insecure protracted crisis environments. The way it is
targeted and delivered can affect local social and economic
relationships. In southern Sudan in the 1990s, Nuer people
from Ayod were recruited into militias to raid Dinka areas
in part because of a perceived neglect in relief operations
in Nuer areas.69 In Somalia, the targeting of a community
and not its neighbour, particularly when the status of both
seem the same to the excluded village, can lead to conflict
and raiding.70
Agencies work to limit unintended negative
consequences of their aid on the safety and security of
recipients. For example, given the history of violence in

Haiti, and Port-au-Prince in particular, the prevention of
violence during food distributions after the January 2010
earthquake was a key concern for WFP. Protection
measures were immediately integrated into WFP’s food
assistance activities, including clear messaging on targeting
and entitlements to prevent misunderstandings and
conflict; the provision of safe spaces and extra support for
pregnant women and elderly and disabled people at food
distribution sites; and dissemination of WFP’s zero tolerance
policy on sexual exploitation and abuse.

■■ What does this mean for food assistance in
protracted crises?
Innovative and principled approaches are required to
address the challenges of working in protracted crisis
environments. Work by humanitarian food-assistance
organizations in recent years to integrate a “protection
lens” into their assistance activities is promising in this
regard. Building on the work of Oxfam and the
International Rescue Committee (IRC), and working with
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Protection
Cluster, WFP over the past few years has introduced
research and training intended to improve the analysis of
beneficiary protection needs in complex environments,
advocate more effectively for humanitarian access, manage
perceptions of the agency’s neutrality and impartiality and
programme food assistance to “do no harm”.
Humanitarian food assistance not only saves lives, but is
also an investment in the future. The shift from standard
food aid to a varied set of food assistance tools,
complemented by innovations in how food is procured, helps
to ensure that appropriate assistance is provided and to
maximize the chance that humanitarian food assistance will
serve as a strong basis for food security in the longer term.
First and foremost, humanitarian food assistance is
about meeting acute individual needs. It is not a substitute
for other forms of effective international engagement with
crises or for required national structural or societal changes
and good governance. While food assistance in protracted
crises can be developmental in many respects, it should not
be oversold and expected to be accountable to
development objectives and principles; rather, it should be
seen as part of a package of essential interventions in
protracted crisis situations. Ultimate accountability for
humanitarian action is to individuals in need.

Towards social protection in protracted crises
Key message
Social protection systems lay an essential foundation on
which to rebuild societies in protracted crisis. However,
in contexts where financial, institutional and
implementation capacities are limited, social protection
programmes are generally short-term, relief-oriented or
externally funded.

One of the most challenging debates revolves around
social protection in protracted crises. In those contexts,
humanitarian and development issues overlap to a large
extent, and as a result debates on social protection involve a
complex blend of both sets of issues. While there is renewed
attention to the need to combine those domains,72 progress
in conceiving social protection systems in protracted crises
remains tenuous.

■■ Social protection in protracted crises
Beyond improvements in humanitarian food assistance,
interest in wider social protection measures in the
development sector is growing dramatically. Social
protection comprises safety nets, insurance and various
sectoral interventions for health, education, nutrition and
agriculture.71 New initiatives are emerging both at the
global level, such as the United Nations’ Social Protection
Floor Initiative, and at the regional level, such as the InterAmerican Social Protection Network. At the country level,
a host of experiences is blossoming, including, for
example, Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme
(PSNP) and the Hunger Safety Net Programme in Kenya.
Sometimes, those components are enshrined in legislation
governing specific domains, such as minimum wages in
labour markets, and thus set the stage for the so-called
“transformative” and rights-based engagement
approaches to social protection.
Social protection can be provided formally and
informally. The latter includes support and sharing
practices within and between communities, while the
former concerns arrangements provided publicly (by the
state) or privately (through contractual agreements). Public
measures can be funded domestically or externally (by
donors), while private mechanisms mostly include marketbased insurance products.
However, it is important to recognize a key difference
between a “system” and a collection of programmes.
Countries may well have components of social protection
(e.g. insurance and transfers), but if they are not
institutionalized in domestic budgets, structures, tax and
labour market policy and overall political processes – if they
are not part of a dynamic social contract between the state
and citizens – then they are not a real social protection
system. Many countries in protracted crisis have a collection
of social protection measures, but not a social protection
system as such.

36

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

In broad terms, social protection can be looked at from a
variety of perspectives, including the composition (e.g. mix of
safety nets and insurance), form (formal and informal),
source of funding (domestic or aid-supported) and level of
implementation capacities in the system. Based on those
general criteria, countries in protracted crisis show a number
of intertwined characteristics.
Overall, there is a paucity of national policy frameworks
that provide the foundations for social protection. Elements
of social protection are often diffused and not adequately
reflected in food security, poverty reduction or development
strategies.73
The combined effects of high poverty rates, binding
budgetary constraints and limited tax revenues stifle
countries’ redistribution capacity.74 As already noted,
countries in protracted crisis generally rely heavily on external
funding for key social and economic services and
investments. This reliance poses serious questions about the
domestic affordability and sustainability of social protection
in resource-constrained countries.
With this magnitude of external investment, decisions
relating to social protection clearly intersect with the aid
effectiveness agenda. As stated by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),75 “… our
actions [in social protection] must be aligned with national
policy, in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
and the Accra Agenda for Action”. Therefore, the large shares
of external investment in these countries may raise concerns
over national ownership of social protection agendas.
Institutional capacities to provide oversight and guidance
are often weak. Social protection functions are generally
spread across various line ministries, authorities and actors;
institutions that share responsibility for social protection may
not be among the most influential, compared with, for
example, finance ministries. Technical, administrative and

National and international responses to protracted crises

implementation capacities are generally limited, as recently
documented in West and Central Africa.76
Informal mechanisms often provide the bulk of social
protection. Only about 20 percent of the world’s population
has access to formal social protection.77
Social protection instruments and programmes have
limited scale, coverage, duration and level of benefits. The
largest safety net programme in Africa is the Ethiopian PSNP,
which targets about 7.3 million food-insecure households.
The average size of schemes in southern Africa is generally
well below 500 000 beneficiaries.78 Overall, countries like
Afghanistan, Haiti, the Sudan and Zimbabwe tend to score
poorly in terms of various social protection measures.79
Safety nets play a dominant role in terms of composition
of social protection, and sectoral interventions – including the
supply of services (e.g. access to schools or clinics) – remain a
key building block of social protection in complex situations.
Safety nets are provided primarily in the form of food-based
transfers, often as part of broader emergency interventions.
For example, in 2008 more than 2.5 million tonnes of food
were delivered to countries in protracted crisis, about
82 percent of which was in the form of relief assistance.80 For
safety nets in general, and emergency assistance in particular,
the use of cash-based assistance remains comparatively rare,
especially in post-conflict settings.81
Against this background, there are a number of
compelling issues that may arise when formulating social
protection plans in countries in protracted crisis, as well as a
series of innovations that may help inform social protection
policies and programmes.

■■ Trade-offs and innovations
In general, social protection is an integral part of three key
debates unfolding in contexts of protracted crises:82
The first involves changing from annual relief to
multiannual developmental approaches. New initiatives are

being explored to transform humanitarian assistance for
chronic needs into predictable, longer-term development
approaches (see Box 8).
In Ethiopia, for example, the adoption of an entitlementbased approach83 such as that adopted by the PSNP
followed various institutional evolutions. The PSNP draws
on lessons learned about enhancing the predictability of
the previous Employment Guarantee Scheme, a relieforiented public works programme (until 2002) and various
lessons learned in the first year of implementation (2005).
Second, it is essential to review the effectiveness and
efficiency of available programmes. This includes the
strategic and operational review of targeting, coverage and
performance of various social protection instruments. For
example, the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs is in the
process of producing a National Social Protection Sector
Strategy.84 This is one of the first efforts to appraise social
protection programmes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and to unify them under a coherent strategic framework.
Third, innovation is taking place in terms of fostering
empowerment and rights-based agendas. A number of
initiatives are emerging to enhance social inclusion of
marginalized populations and advocate for basic socialprotection commitments. For example, in 2006, several
African countries signed the “Livingstone Call for Action”,
which advocated for greater collaboration and
commitments on social protection. These materialized in a
new set of consultations led by the African Union in 2008,
including recommendations to “establish specific budget
lines for social protection that should not be less than
2 percent of GDP”.85
These examples show that a number of issues combine in
social protection – debates invariably include the
identification of an optimal mix of humanitarian and
development interventions that could support the transition
out of crisis. Although domestic funding of social protection
presents daunting challenges, at least in the short term, there

Predictable support for predictable needs: the Hunger Safety Net Programme in Kenya

The Hunger Safety Net Programme is a programme under
the Ministry of Development of Northern Kenya and
Other Arid Lands. It targets the four largest and poorest
districts in arid northern Kenya and uses cash transfers as
a means of meeting the consumption needs of foodinsecure households. The programme is supported
through a UKaid grant from the United Kingdom
Department for International Development (DFID). Phase I
of the programme will target 60 000 households by the
end of 2010. Phase II will scale up to target approximately

300 000 households. The programme is highly innovative,
testing approaches such as registration of households
using biometrics, real-time data capture and an effective
rural-outreach payment system using biometric
identification, point-of-sale devices and mobile phone
technology. This is a frontier of banking and other
financial services in the poorest areas of Kenya.

National and international responses to protracted crises

is new momentum for increasing the importance of social
protection on the political agenda (e.g. see Box 8), including
forging innovative alliances and sharing an array of successful
implementation practices.86 Future applied-research initiatives
should build upon the growing interest and demand for social
protection, while informing decision-making processes with
credible and context-specific evidence.
From another perspective, these considerations clearly
demonstrate the interrelated nature of social protection
and growth-oriented interventions: without growth, there
is little prospect of financing social protection through
domestic resources, but without social protection, future
growth patterns may be less inclusive and pro-poor than
they might have been. This dilemma involves a number of
choices around how interventions are implemented and
their possible sequencing (reducing inequality versus
promoting growth).

■■ Sequencing of interventions for food security
Social protection is chiefly about public measures, which
raises the issue of defining the scope and size of public
assistance for food security. Historically, formal social
protection measures in advanced economies were introduced
following sustained economic development,87 and this has
led to a lively discussion in developing countries on the
appropriateness and viability of a different sequence –
namely, about whether sweeping social protection measures
could be introduced before solid economic performance.
How should limited public budgets be allocated among
competing priorities? Should countries invest in enhancing
agricultural productivity or expand safety nets for the
elderly? Clearly, these issues are further magnified in
contexts of protracted crises.

A number of considerations may help inform some of
these choices. In situations of post-conflict countries, for
example, it is argued that social protection may reduce the
likelihood of future conflicts88 and hence should be enacted
before sectoral and macro policies.89 Moreover, new evidence
suggests that trade-offs between efficiency and equity may
be less pronounced than is often perceived.90 In particular,
social protection may promote growth in three ways, rather
than necessarily retard or jeopardize it.
The first way concerns investments in human capital. For
example, improving child nutrition can enhance cognitive
development, school attainments and future labour
productivity, and thereby enhance earning potentials
(see Box 9).91
A second stream of growth effects revolves around the
adoption of higher-risk but higher-income livelihood
options. This is an area where a number of linkages could
be established between the social protection and food
security agendas.92 Indeed, farmers may sometimes
underperform because of overly conservative practices.
Social protection could play an important role by
guaranteeing a floor over which more risky but rewarding
strategies could be pursued.
A third channel centres on alleviating some market
failures (see Box 10).
Taken together, these considerations have helped change
the perception of social protection from a mere cost to an
investment. However, there are also important limitations
and policy implications should be drawn cautiously. For
instance, realizing the sustainable growth effects of social
protection is likely to take a long time, even up to a
generation (e.g. education outcomes). This may clash against
shorter-term priorities that vulnerable households and
countries often face.

Food-for-education in protracted crises: experimental evidence from IDP camps

Food-for-education (FFE) programmes include two
modalities: on-site school feeding and take-home rations.
Recent research investigated the impacts of FFE in 31 IDP
camps in northern Uganda. Based on a sample survey of
about 1 000 households conducted in 2005 and 2007,
the evaluation found that on-site school feeding and
take-home rations reduced anaemia prevalence by
19.2 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively, among
children aged 10–13 years. Moreover, stunting of preschool-age children declined significantly in households

with children receiving on-site feeding, possibly as a result
of redistribution of food within the household. This gain
was primarily concentrated among the younger
preschoolers, aged 6–35 months, whose height is most
responsive to changes in nutrition. Thus, even in
protracted crises it is often possible to lay the foundations
for long-term development.

Cash-based food assistance: insights from Afghanistan and the West Bank and Gaza Strip

In 2009, WFP and partners implemented a number of
cash-based programmes that provided quality food
assistance while stimulating local business and the
farming sector. Two voucher programmes in protracted
crises are highlighted here.
In Afghanistan, WFP implemented a six-month
voucher pilot for 10 000 disabled, female-headed and
large vulnerable households as well as IDPs in a district
of Kabul. Each month, the beneficiaries received a
coupon worth US$30 that could be exchanged for food
commodities in selected shops. The voucher programme

■■ What does this mean for improving social
protection in protracted crises?
Social protection programmes in protracted crises are
generally relief-oriented, externally funded and of limited
scale. They resemble initiatives present in other contexts
but without the same level of domestic financial and
institutional commitments and capacities to make them a
national system. Progress in social protection in
protracted crises could potentially help bridge the divide
between humanitarian and developmental initiatives. A
range of promising policy and programming innovations
has emerged that deserves further attention and
application.
It has been shown that some considerations are specific
to social protection, such as what transfers to use or what
targeting methods to employ, while others, such as the role
of aid in sustaining social protection systems, raise issues of
broader relevance. Indeed, in order to start building

Afghanistan.
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, WFP launched an
urban voucher project targeting nearly 7 800 foodinsecure households. In collaboration with NGOs, each
month WFP distributed vouchers worth US$56. Vouchers
increased beneficiaries’ access to protein-rich food.

national social-protection systems a number of key choices
need to be fully recognized and tackled. These include
choices between short- and longer-run interventions,
domestic and external support, public measures and private
incentives, productivity and equity, supply and demand of
services, pursuing agendas and promoting ownership.
Some of these may be relatively simple choices, while
others may involve significant trade-offs and be more
difficult to reconcile.
While external support may help unbundle some
trade-offs in the short-to-medium term, there is a
growing recognition that the current aid system needs to
be improved, including fresh thinking on ways to enhance
accountability and feedback mechanisms from both aid
suppliers and recipients. Social protection platforms must
not be developed in isolation, as they tend to be in
countries in protracted crisis, but should be part of a
broader process to inform decision-making on investment
priorities alongside other social and economic sectors.

National and international responses to protracted crises

Using short-term responses to support longerterm recovery in agriculture and food security
Key message
Most responses to protracted crises take place in a
humanitarian context that often limits the ability to
address the real drivers of the crisis in a more
comprehensive way. However, experience in
Afghanistan, Haiti, Tajikistan and the West Bank and
Gaza Strip shows how linking short- and long-term
responses in protracted crises, and undertaking or
promoting responses that address the structural causes
of crises, can support longer-term recovery in
agricultural livelihoods and food security.

Events such as drought, floods, conflicts and other humaninduced disasters have tended to be the focus of
humanitarian food-security responses and the concepts and
tools used in addressing humanitarian crises. However, given
the characteristics that differentiate countries in protracted
crisis from other food-insecure countries – the breakdown or
absence of governance, the presence of conflict or complex
crises, types of aid flow, longevity of crisis – greater attention
is necessary to ensure the application of available tools,
coordination and conceptual frameworks in more holistic
and integrated ways that focus on understanding and
supporting community resilience and creating more
sustainable, diversified livelihoods.

■■ Lessons learned in food and agriculture by FAO
and partners in protracted crises
There are numerous examples of how FAO and its partners
either have sought or continue to seek creative ways to
address key challenges in the agriculture sector that may
include but go beyond short-term emergency responses.
These responses aim at building more sustainable and
durable food production and access in volatile and uncertain
environments. They range from seeking to increase food
availability and restore local markets through urban
gardening in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, to encouraging improved natural resource and land
management and increased availability of and access to food
through conservation agriculture in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe
and supplying agricultural inputs to strengthen private-sector

seed production in Afghanistan. This section briefly reviews
lessons learned by FAO and its partners from interventions

Tajikistan and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A final example
briefly reviews how lessons learned in hurricane
preparedness were used to guide the development of a new
type of project in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake.

Afghanistan: promoting sustainable livelihoods,
food security and nutrition
FAO’s work in Afghanistan provides important lessons in
terms of addressing short- and long-term needs in a
protracted crisis context. Decades of conflict, compounded
by drought, have left Afghanistan with degraded
infrastructure, high unemployment and widespread poverty.
In 2005, 44 percent of Afghan households perceived
themselves as food-insecure.93 Agriculture plays a prominent
role in the Afghan economy, generating an estimated
36 percent of GDP, excluding poppy cultivation and other
services related to agriculture, such as food processing.94
Two specific examples demonstrate the way that
livelihoods have been transformed or constraints addressed
through a more integrated approach in Afghanistan. These
interventions are supported by an active food-security
cluster,95 jointly coordinated by FAO and WFP, as well as an
Agricultural Task Force, supported by the members of the UN
country team, that is focused on ways of responding in the
immediate-, medium- and longer-term by addressing crosscutting issues (including food security, agriculture, irrigation,
social affairs and health).96
First, FAO has implemented programmes in Afghanistan
aimed at integrating emergency relief/recovery with nutrition,
biodiversity preservation, food security and livelihoods
objectives into relevant government policies and institutions,
notably in agriculture, rural development, health and
education. Strategies promoted to develop the agriculture
sector and, in turn, the national economy, have been aimed
at diversifying crop and animal production in ways that reach
many segments of society. For example, FAO and the Afghan
Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock worked
together to expand wheat seed production by supporting
private seed enterprises with loans to produce certified and
quality-declared seed for the 2008 and 2009 planting
seasons. At the end of both seasons, 99 percent of the loans

National and international responses to protracted crises

had been repaid, with interest, by the seed enterprises. The
proceeds (approximately US$5 million) have been used to
create a seed industry development fund, managed by the
Afghanistan National Seed Association, that will help
establish new private seed enterprises in other parts of the
country with FAO technical support. The proceeds will be also
be used to provide seasonal loans to seed enterprises as a
means of supporting increased production of certified seed.97
Second, nutrition programmes were also used as culturally
acceptable entry points to address gender issues in
Afghanistan. Strategies have aimed at strengthening women’s
technical skills by working in partnership with organizations
that assist women to form self-help groups to access credit
and markets and develop small, agriculture-based businesses.
Lessons learned: These interventions were implemented
during a period marked by substantial changes in
government structure. Such an evolving institutional context
required flexibility that allowed for effective real-time
adjustments without compromising longer-term goals, and
interventions focused at local levels or other types of entry
points – communities, households and small enterprise.
Nutrition was a culturally acceptable entry point to address
gender issues in Afghanistan, even when women remain
excluded from public life. Assisting line ministries and local
institutions in project planning and resource mobilization for
food security interventions helped fill identified gaps and
scale up successful interventions.

West Bank and Gaza Strip: improving understanding
of food security for better programming.
WFP and FAO have worked closely with the Palestinian
Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) to establish a socioeconomic and food-security monitoring system (SEFSec) in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 2008. At the time
SEFSec was conceived, no territory-wide, household-level
socio-economic survey or monitoring had been done for
almost ten years and the PCBS had stopped monitoring the
impact of border-crossing restrictions in 2002. The PCBS had
tried to establish a more traditional food-security information
system, but there was little uptake of the system; users
found that it did not focus sufficiently on access to food,
which is the most critical and relevant dimension of food
insecurity in the context of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
SEFSec was established to provide accurate and up-to-date
socio-economic and food-security information in order to be
able to: track trends over time and inform decisions about
programming and targeting assistance; provide disaggregated
information at governorate level and by type of person (for
example, refugee or non-refugee); make data more readily
available and more frequently monitored; and develop the
capacity of the PCBS to analyse food security. Recent SEFSec
reports confirmed that food insecurity in both results from
insufficient and unstable access to food but, more significantly,
that access and market-based indicators need to be selected

and systematically monitored over time. After a second year of
joint surveying (2010), the PCBS will conduct the 2011 survey,
with key indicators gathered twice per year or annually as part
of the Bureau’s regular programme of work.
The SEFSec approach has helped design new forms of
safety nets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. WFP and Oxfam
launched an urban food assistance voucher programme for
the Gaza Strip in late 2009 in response to high food prices
identified by SEFSec. Thus, WFP was able to use short-term
funding to identify needs requiring longer-term interventions
related to monitoring and gathering information on food
access. The longer-term impact of the programme is focused
on strengthening urban livelihoods by supporting market
development and identifying ways for small enterprises to
remain viable when challenged with closure policy and
income poverty. FAO’s work in the West Bank has a similar
focus on supporting rural livelihoods, in that the aim is to
protect access to land and help alleviate pressures on farmers
to abandon their land. Moreover, SEFSec has enabled
statistical profiling of food-insecure households (including
size, age/gender composition, education, employment,
dependency ratio), which has significantly improved
humanitarian targeting; for example, FAO has enhanced the
women and youth focus of its field programme.
Lessons learned: The strong shared history of collaboration
between FAO and WFP has provided the foundation for a
more unified approach to working with the PCBS on food
security monitoring, and this collaboration has helped facilitate
communication on food security among various departments
and ministries within the Palestinian Authority. Capacity
development in food security analysis and monitoring takes
time, and in the case of the PCBS has been largely driven by
strong collaboration between FAO and WFP over the past
eight years. A more holistic approach to the analysis of food
insecurity has helped illustrate its full extent in terms of
income poverty, closure policy and the undermining, and in
some cases destruction, of livelihoods. It has also provided the
basis for greater advocacy and messaging related to food
insecurity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Tajikistan: institutional and gender-sensitive
land reform
Tajikistan remains one of the poorest countries among the
former Soviet republics, with poverty concentrated in rural
areas. Civil conflict from 1992 to 1997 resulted in a large
number of IDPs, disabled people and widows. The collapse
of state social safety nets exacerbated poverty, particularly
for rural women. Women were, in many cases, the primary
source of financial support for their families and households,
and while 73 percent of all agricultural workers were
women, only 2 percent of private farms were owned by
women. There was a need for greater awareness of genderrelated issues in agriculture, particularly in the context of the
unfolding land reform process.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

41

National and international responses to protracted crises

Between 2006 and 2008, FAO and the United Nations
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) implemented a
project to improve land reform management and monitoring
systems, with a special focus on promoting gender equality
and consultative processes. One of the aims of the project
was to support women in securing their land-use rights and
livelihoods, and focused on campaigns to raise awareness of
impending land reform for ten state farms. More than
60 seminars were conducted on the state farms, reaching
3 784 participants, 55 percent of whom were women. To
enhance the gender responsiveness of key government
institutions, a network of national gender specialists was
formed in the Agency of Land Tenure, Ministry of Agriculture,
Ministry of Water Resources, Association of Dekhkan Farms,
Agroinvestbank and the Agency for Statistics. Throughout
this process, FAO and UNIFEM worked closely with the former
State Land Committee (now renamed the Agency for Land
Management, Geodesy and Cartography).
Lessons learned: Efforts at land reform were weakened by
the lack of capacity to undertake sustainable actions aimed
at achieving gender equality and a poor understanding of
gender analysis and a gender mainstreaming approach.
Interventions needed to be developed by specialists with a
holistic perspective. Traditional technical experts may not
necessarily adopt people-centred approaches in addressing
technical problems. Adoption of consultative processes and
participatory approaches helped reduce the disproportionate
emphasis on external support in rural areas, and helped
women secure their land-use rights and livelihoods.

Haiti: strengthening climate resilience and
reducing disaster risk in agriculture to improve
food security post-earthquake
The earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January 2010 left Portau-Prince and surrounding villages in ruins, displaced an
estimated 2 million people and injured or killed hundreds of
thousands. The situation in rural areas was made all the
more difficult given reports of as many as 600 000 people
who had to move back to rural areas, compounded by the
disruption of markets and livelihoods caused by the
earthquake. The agriculture sector has become increasingly
vulnerable over recent decades because of a combination of
population pressure, environmental degradation, inefficient
land-use systems, poverty, governance problems and high
exposure to recurrent natural hazards such as hurricanes,
drought, landslides, earthquakes and tidal waves.
FAO formulated a project, financed by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), World Bank, that for the first time
under this funding window explicitly integrated emergency
relief (agricultural inputs) with identified good practice in
disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. FAO
had previously undertaken a regional project in the
Caribbean that had identified good practice in adapting to
climate change and identified and multiplied seed of high-

42

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

quality, shorter-cycle crop varieties that were developed as
part of hurricane preparedness for Haiti. Lessons learned
from the previous work were used in planning the GEFfunded project interventions.
Interventions include promoting soil conservation and
agroforestry practices that have proved effective in reducing
risks associated with climate hazards; identifying, multiplying
and distributing seed of short-cycle, drought- and floodtolerant crops that had already been accepted by local
farmers and adapted to changes in local climatic conditions;
and promoting good agricultural practices that enhance risk
reduction and risk management.
Lessons learned: Actively seeking ways to link short-term
and long-term needs through one programming and funding
window may provide a good opportunity to ensure that
Haitians’ livelihoods are restored and transformed, and that
results are sustainable. Accessing good practice and lessons
learned from a wide variety of disciplines have provided ways
forward in terms of integrating multiple programming entry
points. One of the key challenges in integrating short- and
long-term needs has been resolving the tensions between the
more operational and relief-focused humanitarian actors and
the more systematic and longer-term focus of development
practitioners, particularly in terms of cost-benefits, coverage of
beneficiaries and concepts related to sustainability.

■■ Ways forward
For all the examples above, activities were developed
through a unified food-security strategy that integrated
short- and longer-term dimensions. However, they are still
far from a comprehensive approach for addressing shortand longer-term issues such as institutional weakness
affecting livelihoods. Most responses to protracted crises
take place in a humanitarian context that often limits the
possibility of addressing the different drivers of the crisis in a
more coordinated and holistic way. However, humanitarian
food-security clusters in protracted crises can provide
important platforms for strengthening linkages between
immediate humanitarian responses and longer-term
development assistance aimed at addressing underlying
structural factors limiting livelihoods. At a more global level,
a similar arrangement could further facilitate these efforts
(see Box 11). Clusters can develop transition strategies to
ensure a smooth handover to development structures and
processes and bring together the main national and
international partners active in the food security sector.
From a conceptual point of view, simultaneously
addressing short- and longer-term food-security issues in
protracted crisis situations is not a new idea. What has
perhaps changed in recent years is the extent to which such
thinking has been put into practice and, in a growing
number of instances, mainstreamed. Major donors have
highlighted the need to link humanitarian food assistance

National and international responses to protracted crises

BOX 11

Global Food Security Cluster

The “cluster approach” is a key element of the 2005
Humanitarian Response Review, commissioned by the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and
the subsequent Reform Initiative for improved efficiency,
increased predictability and higher accountability in
international responses to humanitarian emergencies.
FAO and WFP have been fully engaged in the process
since the onset; WFP as global lead of the logistics and
emergency telecommunications clusters and as lead for
food assistance at the country level, and FAO as global
lead of the agriculture cluster.
Country-level clusters or coordination arrangements for
food security have long existed between FAO and WFP –
for example, in late 2009, FAO and WFP were already

and efforts to promote sustainable, agriculture-led growth as
part of an integrated food-security approach. Donors have
increasingly recognized that this is necessary in order to
address comprehensively the underlying causes of hunger
and malnutrition while maintaining necessary support for
humanitarian food assistance.
The challenge is to identify those lessons that provide
common entry points in protracted crises even in the absence
of effective institutions or governance. For example, context-

co-leading food security-related clusters in 11 countries and
co-leading along with other partners in a further 5 countries.
The Phase 1 cluster evaluation by the UN Inter-Agency
Standing Committee, completed in late 2007, proposed
that WFP and FAO give consideration to the co-leadership
of a global cluster on food security, together with other
partners. The provisional report of the Phase 2 cluster
evaluation recommends that this now be implemented.
Similarly, the 2008 conference on Rethinking Food Security
in Humanitarian Response (see Box 13 on page 48)
encouraged FAO, WFP and key partners to move ahead in
establishing such a global cluster. Since February 2010 WFP
and FAO have embarked on a structured process to establish
the Global Food Security Cluster before the end of the year.

specific gender analysis or an increased understanding of
local concepts of risk and hazards and community-based risk
reduction measures, as well as the constraints related to
enhancing resilience and diversifying livelihoods, may broaden
the range and scope of response options available.
All of these elements are related and should be seen as
important parts of a more integrated approach in a renewed
overall aid architecture aimed at addressing short- and longerterm dimensions of food insecurity in protracted crises.

Success stories: the example of Mozambique
Key message
Countries can move out of protracted crisis situations.
This requires improved governance, understanding
structural drivers of the crisis and addressing them with
sound policy action. Involvement of local communities
and enhanced donor coordination are also essential.

After its independence in 1975 Mozambique descended into
three decades of armed conflict that left the country socially
and economically devastated. One million people died and
5 million were internally displaced or made refugees in
neighbouring countries. By the end of the conflict in 1992,
40 percent of first-level health posts and 60 percent of

primary schools had been closed or destroyed and GDP was
only half of what it could have been.98
Since the signing of the peace accords in 1992,
Mozambique has enjoyed a period of remarkable stability
and has become a success story in terms of economic
growth and poverty reduction. According to the World
Bank,99 economic growth averaged 8 percent a year between
1996 and 2008. Since 1992, agricultural output has grown
by 5.6 percent a year, mainly as a result of expansion of the
area cultivated but also in part because of growth in the
agricultural labour force and increases in productivity. The
country also saw a 15 percent fall in poverty between 1997
and 2003. There has been a substantial increase in human
development indicators such as education, child mortality
and access to safe water, although the country still ranks

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

43

National and international responses to protracted crises

172nd out of the 182 countries in the Human Development
Index. Finally, incidence of hunger in Mozambique is
continuing to decline steadily (Figure 17), but the country
has some way to go to achieve MDG 1.
The country’s successful post-conflict recovery has been
attributed to a variety of macro-level factors, including
macro-economic stability, policy reform, pro-poor
government expenditures and the massive inflow of aid in
support of economic and social development. In recent
years, increased decentralization, strong donor coordination
and harmonization in support of government-led
programmes and private-sector investment have also played
important roles. However, the foundation for post-conflict
recovery was laid in the immediate aftermath of the conflict
through the successful demobilization of fighters and
resettlement of displaced people, without which economic
and social development could not have taken hold. A
governance structure that focused on disaster prevention
and mitigation was also instrumental in this process.

■■ Social engagement in dealing with key issues:
the example of land access
Another key to the post-conflict recovery was the effort made
to deal with land access issues.100 Conflict over access to land,
a key driver of the civil war, re-emerged in the immediate
aftermath of the war as a potentially explosive source of
tension. When the millions of displaced people and former
fighters returned to the land they had abandoned, they often
found their land had been occupied by others. Private investors
were also rushing to the rural areas to bring apparently “free”
land into production. As a result, occupants, returnees and
private investors often clashed over who had the right to use
the land. Such disputes were often aggravated by a
dysfunctional state administration weakened by years of war.
The situation was also not helped by the 1979 land legislation
that was still in place. This land law was based on the postindependence socialist agrarian model and did not reflect
customary land-tenure systems, which were still alive and
respected despite the long conflict and official policy changes.
A key instrument in the process adopted for dealing with
the land issue was the creation of an Interministerial Land
Commission, with FAO support, which provided an open and
democratic forum for developing a new land policy. Great
efforts were made to involve many different groups,
including civil society, peasant organizations, the nascent
private sector, national academics and all those public sectors
with some stake in how land and other resources are
accessed and used.101 The policy review process began with
an extensive and inclusive consultation process that was
started in the immediate aftermath of the war and was
informed by a thorough analysis of the social and economic
realities of land tenure in Mozambique.
What was most evident was the continuing legitimacy and
role of customary authorities in the aftermath of the war, and

how they were effectively managing the vast majority of land
access and conflict issues in this critical period. This
experience led to the recognition of the usefulness of these
customary systems and the rights people had acquired
through them, and informed the integration of aspects of
customary and formal law into the development of the new
land legislation. This key policy move successfully dealt with a
range of emerging tensions and provided the bedrock for a
new land law, enacted in 1997, that also provided secure
tenure for new private investors, seen by the Government as
a key element for post-war recovery in a decapitalized and
still poor country. This was done by making “community
consultations” a mandatory part of the investment process,
promoting a negotiated and consensus-building approach to
the complex issue of giving land to new investors.
The result has been a policy and law with great social
legitimacy and a strong sense of national ownership, both critical
ingredients in any post-conflict settlement. The legislation was
designed to serve simultaneously the social and economic needs
and rights of local communities and broader national economic
development objectives, both of which are essential for the
consolidation of the post-conflict recovery process.
Today, over ten years later, the Land Policy is still in place
and the 1997 law has achieved its basic goal of maintaining
order and food security while also promoting new
investment. This policy and legal framework has done much
to promote a more equitable and sustainable path towards
economic growth and social development in a country with a
still predominantly rural population.
The way in which the land challenge was met in the mid
1990s has created a strong awareness in the wider society of
the value of a negotiated and participatory approach to
complex policy questions and has led to the expectation that
the Government will continue to build on past experience
and address the land issue – and indeed other pressing social
and economic issues – through a similar process of broadlybased social and political engagement.

Towards ensuring food security in
protracted crises: recommended actions

C

ountries in protracted crisis are characterized by
long-lasting or recurring crises and conflict,
extensive breakdown of livelihoods and very
little institutional capacity to respond. As a result, the
proportion of undernourished people in countries in
protracted crisis (excluding China and India) is three times
as high as it is in other developing countries. About onefifth of the world’s estimated 925 million undernourished
people live in the 22 countries currently considered to be
in protracted crisis. Because of the distinctive features of
protracted crises, appropriate responses differ from those
required in short-term crises or in non-crisis development
contexts. Countries in protracted crisis thus need to be
considered as a special category with special requirements
in terms of interventions by the development community.
The findings presented in The State of Food Insecurity
in the World 2010 lead to three main sets of
recommendations for addressing food insecurity in
protracted crises:
• improving analysis and understanding;
• improving support for livelihoods and food security;
and
• reforming the “architecture” of assistance.

■■ Improving analysis and understanding
While protracted crises have some general characteristics
in common, the case studies considered in this report
make it clear that each crisis has its own context-specific
characteristics. Each case is different and responses –
whether internal or external – must be tailored to the
specifics of each case. Identification of appropriate
responses is often hobbled by poor or non-existent data.
With the exception of a few high-profile crises, data are
often lacking or of poor quality, making it difficult to
understand the dynamics of protracted crises.
Current understanding of protracted crises remains
superficial and narrow. While humanitarian emergencies
clearly require rapid assessments of needs, protracted
crises require analysis that is both broader and deeper.

An in-depth understanding of livelihoods, gender dynamics,
the social context and local and national institutions is
required not only to address the critical constraints to
livelihoods at the household level but also to understand the
underlying causes of the crisis. And better analysis is needed
to understand the nuances of livelihood adaptations in
protracted crises, some of which can be built upon by
external actors (e.g. remittances and changes in local
institutions governing property rights in land and natural
resources), and some of which should be mitigated (e.g.
over-exploitation of natural resources).
The ability to compare the severity of crisis across
different contexts is important to reduce the risks of
uneven aid allocation and the related “forgotten-crisis”
syndrome. This is an area in which good progress has
been made, but this progress needs to be expanded –
particularly in countries in protracted crises. An emerging
approach to this is the Integrated Food Security Phase
Classification (IPC) (see Box 12). One distinguishing
feature of the IPC is that its development is the result of
collaboration between several agencies that does not
replace existing analytical tools or other food security
analysis efforts but complements them through a
transparent and partnership-based approach.
Progress has also been made in improving the match
between assessed needs, analysis of underlying causes
and proposed assistance, but much of this effort is still in
the pilot stage and too often responses still jump straight
to implementing “tried and true” interventions in a
protracted crisis. But these are often the wrong form of
assistance and have little impact.102
Similarly, assessment of the impact of both external
interventions and local responses to protracted crises has
improved, but many donors and agencies are still
reluctant to invest in impact assessment, as well as in
response analysis, to the required extent. Impact
assessment, monitoring and evaluation systems and
learning and accountability mechanisms all need to be
strengthened if we are to improve the way in which we
respond to food security in protracted crises.

BOX 12

Improving food security analysis and decision-making:
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is
a tool for improving the rigour, transparency, relevance
and comparability of food security analysis. It was
originally developed for use in 2004 in Somalia by FAO’s
Food Security Analysis Unit, but has since been applied
in a number of other food-security contexts through
joint efforts with WFP and other partners.
The IPC includes five protocols:
• Severity classification and early warning to enable
comparison of data from place to place and over time
• Evidence-based analysis to document key evidence in
support of the classification of the food security situation
• Linking to response to provide general guidance
on the appropriate response for various levels of food
insecurity
• Core communication to consolidate essential
conclusions for decision-makers in an accessible and
consistent format, and
• Technical consensus to ensure key stakeholders from
government, NGO, UN and academic agencies concur
with the technical findings of the analysis.
By following the IPC protocols, complex food-security
analysis is made more accessible and meaningful for
decision-makers at national, regional and global levels. It
informs decisions on resource prioritization, programme

■■ Improving support to livelihoods
for food security
Responses that save lives are indispensable, but in countries
in protracted crisis there is a need to move towards
improving support for livelihoods, social protection and risk
reduction while retaining the capacity and flexibility of
responding to acute crises.
Livelihoods assessments must take into account key
dynamics of local institutions (including power and
conflict dynamics) in order to better understand the
drivers of crisis and identify adequate forms of assistance
as well as trustworthy and sustainable partners to address
long-term needs. The examples drawn from Sierra Leone
and the Sudan demonstrate that external assistance can
either be helpful or harmful – depending on how
livelihoods dynamics are understood and must recognize
and support livelihood innovations on the ground while
deterring maladaptive practices relied on by populations
under extreme duress.

46

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

design and advocacy to mitigate acute and chronic food
insecurity. Implementing the IPC strengthens existing
institutions and provides a platform for sharing
information and enabling diverse national and
international stakeholders to work together and build
consensus over food security analysis.
In Somalia, for example, the IPC has been in use since
2004 and has helped ensure that the humanitarian
response is targeted to people most in need and, equally
importantly, that the protracted crisis is not “forgotten”
by the international community. In Kenya – a more
developmental context – the IPC has been in use since
2005 and provides a common platform for various line
ministries to share information and develop joint analysis
at national and district levels under the coordination of
the Office of the President. Currently, the IPC is at
varying stages of implementation (from initial
awareness-raising to official adoption) in over
20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The IPC Global Support Programme provides demanddriven technical support and normative development for
the IPC. It is managed by an interagency Steering
Committee with representatives from CARE, FAO, FEWS
NET, the Joint Research Centre of the European
Commission, Oxfam GB, Save the Children UK and USA,
and WFP. In 2010, regional governmental bodies and
other UN/NGO agencies will also be encouraged to join.

One critical means of promoting livelihoods over the
longer term is to support informal institutions that underpin
local livelihood security. Responses that directly protect lives
and livelihoods should thus take place in parallel with forms
of assistance that support local institutions dealing with
longer-term needs in sustainable agriculture, natural resource
management (e.g. land tenure, as illustrated in the case of
customary institutions in Mozambique) and the provision of
basic social services (e.g. rural infrastructure, education,
health and nutrition).This can also contribute to statebuilding processes, particularly in those extreme cases where
state capacity is very limited.

■■ Reforming the “architecture” of assistance
The experiences described in the preceding chapters of this
report show that there is a gap between the reality on the
ground in protracted crises and the architecture of
international assistance in place to address protracted crises.
Recognition of this gap is not new; indeed, a global forum of

Towards ensuring food security in protracted crises: recommended actions

Recommendation 1

Support further analysis and deeper understanding of people’s livelihoods
and coping mechanisms in protracted crises in order to strengthen their resilience
and enhance the effectiveness of assistance programmes
• Donors and agencies must invest more in analysis,
impact assessment and lessons learning in protracted
crisis situations. This includes both financial and human
resources.
• Information systems should be strengthened and
expanded. Assessment of humanitarian needs is critical,
but analysis must also be broadened to include
livelihoods and local and national institutions, which
can support livelihoods, but may also be at the heart of
the causes of protracted crises.

• Response analysis must be improved, building
capacities in both production and use of betterinformed analysis of options for assistance.
• The ability to compare needs across different and
varied contexts must continue to improve in order to
enhance aid allocation and prevent the “forgotten
crisis” syndrome.
• The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) should
regularly monitor and discuss the overall situation in
countries in protracted crisis.

Recommendation 2

Support the protection, promotion and rebuilding of livelihoods, and the institutions
that support and enable livelihoods, in countries in protracted crisis
• Governments, donors and agencies should better link
responses that address both short- and longer-term
needs through improved food assistance, social
protection and investments in agriculture as well as
non-agricultural livelihoods.
• Provisioning, protection and longer-term promotion of
livelihoods should be stepped up using a variety of
instruments that support people’s resilience and
address vulnerability (e.g. safety nets, nutritional

UN organizations, NGOs and the Red Cross movement
addressed many of these issues in 2008 (see Box 13).
The findings of the 2008 conference are even more
urgent today – particularly in protracted crises. Part of the
need to improve aid architecture is to better bridge the gap
between classic approaches to “relief” (or humanitarian
response) and “development”. The ways donors currently
classify humanitarian and development activities do not
match – or account for – the diversity of interventions
being undertaken or the array of local responses to
protracted crises. External forms of assistance are
inadequately described by either these labels or the timeframes presumed to correspond to them. Donors should
allocate – and account for – funding according to assessed
need and programming opportunities, with the requisite
resources for responding to conditions in protracted crises.
Progress has been made in some of these areas. WFP
and FAO are leading the process to establish a Global Food
Security Cluster to ensure a more coherent, predictable and
comprehensive response to food insecurity within a

support, and developing people’s capacity to produce
and acquire food). Gender differences should be duly
recognized.
• Support for livelihoods must build on existing capacity
and should strengthen positive livelihood adaptations
in specific contexts while preventing and/or mitigating
maladaptive strategies.
• Efforts should focus on helping to rebuild and/or
promote local institutions that support livelihoods.

humanitarian context (see pages 40–43). The cluster would
provide a forum at the international level to inform and
support the elaboration of emergency strategies and
implementation plans at the country level that integrate
urgent measures to address food availability, food
production, food access and food utilization concerns. It
would also provide a crucial improvement in the coherence
in the overall approach and in integrating saving lives and
protecting livelihoods in the humanitarian context.
However, the role of the Global Food Security Cluster in
protracted crises is yet to be defined.
Incremental improvements have been made in
strengthening evaluation and learning mechanisms and
analytical approaches, such as the IPC. But many of these
recommendations have yet to be fully implemented. A
major challenge relates to leading and coordinating
interventions in the absence of a capable and willing
national government. Part of an integrated approach to
reducing food insecurity has to be to support the
development of governmental capacity in technical

Recommendation 3

Revisit the architecture of external assistance in protracted crises to match the needs,
challenges and institutional constraints on the ground. This could entail the
organization of a High-Level Forum on protracted crises followed by the development
of a new “Agenda for Action” for countries in protracted crisis

• The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) should
support the organization of a High-Level Forum on
Protracted Crises no later than 2012 to discuss the
state of knowledge on protracted crises and suggest
the way forward.
• A new “Agenda for action in protracted crises” should
be developed in order to establish new principles and
parameters to address effectively and efficiently the
specific needs of these countries. It is proposed that the
process is launched and monitored by the CFS.
• Modalities of assistance should move beyond the
traditional categories of “relief” and “development” to
a more diversified approach that includes social
protection mechanisms, food security early warning

systems, disaster preparedness, environmental protection
and rehabilitation, and building livelihoods resilience.
• Donor planning should emphasize predictability for
prevention, early action and long-term solutions.
• Tracking systems for aid flows should be fine-tuned and
move beyond the traditional division between
humanitarian and development assistance to allow a
more transparent tracking of investments supporting
food security.
• Efforts must be made to help support all actors –
donors, host governments, non-state actors, national
and international NGOs and crisis-affected
communities – in the crafting of the principles that
should govern assistance in protracted crises.

BOX 13

Findings of the global conference on “Rethinking Food Security in Humanitarian Response”

In April 2008, organizations of the United Nations, NGOs
and the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement (RCRC) met to
discuss food security in humanitarian response. The threeday forum was convened by CARE and Oxfam at FAO
headquarters in Rome. Though aimed more broadly than
only countries in protracted crisis, the forum identified two
key areas of action underlying changes needed in how the
aid system should approach food security and how it can
substantially improve its effectiveness in addressing hunger:
• The need to bridge the relief-development divide:
–– Promoting long-term social protection as a key
approach
–– Incorporating disaster risk reduction into social
protection frameworks
–– Giving increased attention to sustainable agriculture
–– Promoting the funding of prevention and early action.
• The importance of a common, integrated approach to
understanding and responding to hunger and vulnerability:
–– Developing a common analytical and programmatic
framework for food security
–– Using more appropriate needs-based responses and
programme interventions.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

The Forum recommended that these two key areas of
action be supported by fundamental changes in the
architecture of international assistance in food security.
The changes needed include:
• Strengthening monitoring and evaluation, learning and
accountability mechanisms
• Improving capacity for analysis to inform policy,
programmes and responses
• Ensuring that aid agencies are fit for purpose by
reviewing their programme portfolios, funding
mechanisms, staffing and structure and making needed
changes according to identified gaps and in line with
the roles defined in the common framework
• Establishing food security coordination mechanisms to
bring together aid agencies across relief, transition and
development, and those that are involved in the
different elements of food and nutrition security.

Towards ensuring food security in protracted crises: recommended actions

ministries to lead and coordinate efforts, but this will be
difficult in civil conflict situations.
Responses in the same context by the same agencies are
now often simultaneously intended to address
humanitarian needs, livelihood protection and promotion,
institution-building and, in some cases, security objectives.
As a result, principles governing activities in the field are
increasingly unclear. Humanitarian agencies decry the
undermining of humanitarian principles, and the

undermining of these principles has led to increased
difficulty in access to populations in need in some crises as
well as contributing to declining security of aid workers (see
pages 32–35). The objectives of external assistance in
protracted crises, and the principles governing the
allocation, distribution and impact assessment of such
assistance must be clarified if food insecurity specifically,
and humanitarian and development objectives more
generally, are to be successfully addressed.

Of all the regions, Latin America and the
Caribbean have experienced the smallest
decline of just 1.1 percent. The fact that
there has only been a slight decrease in the
number of undernourished people can be
attributed to the region’s slower growth
during the period 2008–10; its vulnerability,
as a net exporter of food, to the decline in
food commodity prices following the
global food crisis and the slow recovery of
reduced remittance flows to the region as a
result of the United States recession.

The Crisis States Research Centre defines
a “failed state” as a state that can no
longer perform its basic security and
development functions and that has no
effective control over its territory and
borders (http://www.crisisstates.com).

10 The factors analysed include those that
make up measures of poverty found in
the Human Development Index (HDI) and
of governance found in the Worldwide
Governance Indicators (compiled by the
World Bank Institute).
11 Chambers and Conway (1991) provided
the following definition of livelihoods
that has been adopted by this report: “A
livelihood comprises the capabilities,
assets (including both material and social

54

resources) and activities required for a
means of living. A livelihood is
sustainable when it can cope with and
recover from stresses and shocks.” See R.

Financial Tracking System (FTS) managed
by the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA). The rationale for using two
different data sets is that while OECDDAC statistics are based on clear and
consolidated procedures they are limited
to OECD countries and offer only a
limited disaggregation of humanitarian
assistance. FTS data sets are still under
consolidation but are more
comprehensive and offer a more detailed
analysis of sector allocation of
humanitarian assistance.

56 Least-developed countries (LDCs) are
those countries that, according to the
United Nations, exhibit the lowest
indicators of socio-economic
development, with the lowest Human
Development Index ratings of all countries
in the world. The current list of LDCs
includes 49 countries: 33 in Africa, 15 in
Asia and the Pacific and one in Latin
America.
57 This includes all aid disbursements (not
including humanitarian assistance and
debt relief).

61 The CAP is an advocacy and planning tool
for humanitarian financing, in which
projects managed by the United Nations,
NGOs and other stakeholders come
together to approach the donor
community funding international
development activities on a yearly basis.
As of 2006, the CAP is divided into
“clusters” representing the various
groups of implementing agencies in
humanitarian aid. Humanitarian principles
drive the formulation of the CAP. The
humanitarian need on the ground is
assessed by the stakeholders, to ensure
that appeals’ funding requests are
grounded in solid evidence.
62 This estimate includes carry-over funds,
i.e. contributions made at the end of the
year in which they are registered but that
are actually for the requirements for the
following year. This may distort the
estimates. WFP estimates that the actual
level of funding of food aid is 82 percent
and not 96 percent as estimated by FTS.
63 The European Union’s recent definition of
food assistance also includes the transfer
or provision of relevant services, inputs,
skills and knowledge.

protection as the simple average of values

Scores for those domains are based on
questionnaires compiled by World Bank
offices in client countries. Such composite
index informs the calculation of the
broader IDA Resource Allocation Index,
which, in addition to social protection, is
the result of the average rating of another
15 social and economic dimensions

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2010

Key messages
NOTES for Table - 1
The number and the proportion of undernourished
people have declined, but they remain unacceptably
high. After increasing from 2006 to 2009 due to high food
prices and the global economic crisis, both the number and
proportion of hungry people have declined in 2010 as the
global economy recovers and food prices remain below their
peak levels. But hunger remains higher than before the crises,
making it ever more difficult to achieve the hunger-reduction
targets of the World Food Summit and Millennium
Development Goal 1.
Countries in protracted crisis require special attention.
They are characterized by long-lasting or recurring crises and
often limited or little capacity to respond, exacerbating food
insecurity problems in those countries. Appropriate responses
thus differ from those required in short-term crises or in
non-crisis development contexts.
Improving food security in protracted crises requires
going beyond short-term responses in order to protect
and promote people’s livelihoods over the longer term.
People living in protracted crises are often forced to make
radical adjustments in their way of life that require longer-term
responses. This disruption to traditional livelihoods and coping
mechanisms also has very different implications for men and
for women.
Supporting institutions is key to addressing protracted
crises. Protracted crises, whether human-induced or the result
of repeated natural disasters, often undermine the institutions
that are necessary to contain and recover from crises. Local
institutions often remain or emerge to fill crucial gaps when
national institutions have failed, and these have the potential
to play a key role in addressing protracted crises, but they are
often ignored by external actors.

Agriculture and the rural economy are key sectors for
supporting livelihoods in protracted crises, but they are
not properly reflected in aid flows. Agricultural and
rural-based livelihoods are critical to the groups most affected
by protracted crises. Agriculture accounts for a third of
protracted crisis countries’ gross domestic product and twothirds of their employment. Yet agriculture accounts for only
4 percent of humanitarian ODA received by countries in
protracted crisis and 3 percent of development ODA.
The current aid architecture needs to be modified to
better address both immediate needs and the structural
causes of protracted crises. The current system uses
humanitarian assistance to support short-term efforts to
address the immediate effects of a crisis, and development
assistance for long-term interventions to address underlying
causes. Areas of intervention that are important in protracted
crises (including social protection and risk reduction) are often
underfunded. In general, weak governance structures in
protracted crisis situations condition aid allocations.
Food assistance helps build the basis for long-term food
security, and is particularly important in countries in
protracted crisis. Humanitarian food assistance not only saves
lives, but is also an investment in a country's future, because it
preserves and strengthens the human assets and livelihoods
that are the foundation of future stability and development.
The use of a varied set of food assistance tools (such as food,
cash or vouchers), complemented by innovations in how food
is procured (including local purchase), helps to ensure that
appropriate assistance is provided and to maximize the chance
that humanitarian food assistance will serve as a strong basis
for food security in the longer term.
Broader social protection measures help countries cope
with protracted crises and lay the foundation for
long-term recovery. Key interventions include providing
safety nets, insurance when appropriate, and services such as
health and education, which build bridges to longer-term
development. In countries in protracted crisis, however,
financial, institutional and implementation capacity are limited,
so social protection programmes are generally short-term,
relief-oriented and externally funded.

Recommendations
Recommendation 1. Support further
analysis and deeper understanding
of people’s livelihoods and coping
mechanisms in protracted crises in
order to strengthen their resilience
and enhance the effectiveness of
assistance programmes.

Recommendation 2. Support the
protection, promotion and rebuilding
of livelihoods, and the institutions that
support and enable livelihoods, in
countries in protracted crisis.

Recommendation 3. Revisit the
architecture of external assistance in
protracted crises to match the needs,
challenges and institutional constraints
on the ground. This could entail the
organization of a High-Level Forum on
protracted crises followed by the
development of a new “Agenda for
Action” for countries in protracted crisis.

The Human Development Index (HDI) generated by UNDP is a summary
composite index that measures a country's average achievements in
three basic areas of human development: health, knowledge, and a
decent standard of living. Health is measured by life expectancy at
birth; knowledge by a combination of the adult literacy rate and
combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrolment ratio; and
standard of living by GDP per capita (PPP US$). Each component is
given a score, which is then averaged to create the overall index which
ranges from 0 to 1.

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Addressing food insecurity in protracted crises

Following more than a decade of seemingly inexorable increases in the number of
undernourished people, estimates for 2010 presented in this edition of The State
of Food Insecurity in the World show a slight glimmer of hope, with the first fall
since 1995. But that still leaves nearly a billion people going hungry, and it is too
early to know if this is the beginning of a downward trend or merely a momentary
dip in the number of undernourished.
This year, The State of Food Insecurity in the World focuses on a particular
group of countries, countries in protracted crisis, where levels of undernourishment
are estimated to be at almost 40 percent. It examines the difficulties faced in trying
to turn around the situation in such countries, not least the difficulty of moving
beyond the mindset of humanitarian intervention towards a broader-based
development agenda.
The report highlights actions that can be taken to rationalize the way
protracted crises are handled. These include more holistic assessment of the crisis
itself, including a deeper understanding of the drivers of crises; building on local
community responses and institutions; introducing or supporting social protection
mechanisms such as food-based safety nets; and moving from food aid to a
broader-based food assistance approach.
The final section of the report provides recommendations on ways to improve
engagement with countries in protracted crisis. These focus on improving the
analysis and understanding of protracted crises; supporting the protection,
promotion and rebuilding of livelihoods and the institutions that support and
enable livelihoods; and changing the architecture of external intervention in
protracted crises to match the reality on the ground.
As this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World shows, there are
many challenges facing countries in protracted crisis. But they are not insurmountable
– there is hope. Through improved understanding of the nature of protracted crisis
comes the ability to respond more effectively. Lessons from the experience of

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World

many countries show that with careful attention to livelihoods, strengthening
longer-term assistance to existing local institutions, investing in social protection
mechanisms and transitioning from food aid to food assistance are all powerful
and fundamental tools for addressing the root causes of protracted crises. This
report illustrates that there are many positive experiences to learn from through
which to better address the multiplicity of issues, including that of extremely high
undernourishment, in countries in protracted crisis.
