ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic
Outlook. It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates will remain constant at their average
levels during August 22–September 19, 2007, except for the currencies participating in the European
exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed to remain constant in nominal terms
relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific
assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies in industrial countries, see Box A1); that the average
price of oil will be $68.52 a barrel in 2007 and $75.00 a barrel in 2008, and remain unchanged in real
terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on U.S.
dollar deposits will average 5.2 percent in 2007 and 4.4 percent in 2008; that the three-month euro
deposits rate will average 4.0 percent in 2007 and 4.1 percent in 2008; and that the six-month Japanese
yen deposit rate will yield an average of 0.9 percent in 2007 and of 1.1 percent in 2008. These are, of
course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the
margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections
are based on statistical information available through end-September 2007.
The following conventions have been used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

—

to indicate that the figure is zero or negligible;

–

between years or months (for example, 2005–06 or January–June) to indicate the years or
months covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;

/

between years or months (for example, 2005/06) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent
to ¼ of 1 percent point).
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown are due to rounding.
As used in this report, the term “country” does not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is a
state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

FURTHER INFORMATION AND DATA

This report on the World Economic Outlook is available in full on the IMF’s Internet site, www.imf.org.
Accompanying it on the website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than in the
report itself, consisting of files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files
may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The following changes have been made to streamline the Statistical Appendix of the World Economic
Outlook. Starting with this issue, the printed version of the World Economic Outlook will carry only Part A
Tables in the Statistical Appendix section.
Part A contains Tables 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 20, 25, 26, 31, 35, 43, and 44 from the previous issues of
the World Economic Outlook; Tables 1.2 and 1.3, which used to be in the main text of the report; and a
new table on private capital flows. Tables in Part A present summary data for both advanced economies
and emerging market and developing countries in the categories of Output, Inflation, Financial Policies, Foreign Trade, Current Account Transactions, Balance of Payments and External Financing, Flow
of Funds, and Medium-Term Baseline Scenario.
Part B of the Statistical Appendix contains the remaining tables. The complete Statistical Appendix,
which includes both Part A and Part B Tables, will be available only via the Internet at www.imf.org/
external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/02/index.htm.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the
IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments
in international financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and
policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments,
which draws primarily on information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member
countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments together
with the Policy Development and Review Department, the Monetary and Capital Markets Department,
and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report has been coordinated in the Research Department under the general
direction of Simon Johnson, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project has been
directed by Charles Collyns, Deputy Director of the Research Department, and Tim Callen, Division
Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Roberto Cardarelli, Kevin Cheng, Selim Elekdag,
Florence Jaumotte, Ben Jones, Michael Keen, Ayhan Kose, Toh Kuan, Subir Lall, Valerie MercerBlackman, John Norregaard, Chris Papageorgiou, Hossein Samiei, Alasdair Scott, Martin Sommer,
Nikola Spatafora, Jon Strand, Natalia Tamirisa, and Petia Topalova. Sergei Antoshin, Gavin Asdorian,
To-Nhu Dao, Stephanie Denis, Nese Erbil, Angela Espiritu, Patrick Hettinger, Susana Mursula,
Murad Omoev, Allen Stack, Bennett Sutton, and Ercument Tulun provided research assistance.
Mahnaz Hemmati, Laurent Meister, and Emory Oakes managed the database and the computer
systems. Sylvia Brescia, Celia Burns, Jemille Colon, and Sheila Tomilloso Igcasenza were responsible
for word processing. Other contributors include Andrew Benito, Luis Catão, Gianni De Nicolò,
Hamid Faruqee, Thomas Helbling, Michael Kumhof, Tim Lane, Douglas Laxton, Gian-Maria Milesi-Fer
retti, Emil Stavrev, Thierry Tressel, and Johannes Wiegand. External consultants include Nancy Birdsall,
Menzie Chin, Gordon Hanson, Massimiliano Marcellino, and Carlos Végh. Archana Kumar of the
External Relations Department edited the manuscript and coordinated the production of the
publication.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as
well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 17 and 24, 2007.
However, both projections and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be
attributed to Executive Directors or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

Throughout a turbulent summer, the World Economic
Outlook team at the IMF has worked hard to stay
ahead of developments, to refine our analytical work,
and to keep our forecasts up to date. Led by Charles
Collyns and Tim Callen, the World Economic Studies
division has worked closely with other IMF staff to produce a WEO that is close to current developments while
providing some much-needed longer-term perspective.
We hope that it will help you both understand what has
happened in the past few months as well as reflect on
what might be in store for the next 15 months.

Emerging Markets Now the Major Engine of Global Growth

T

he world economy has entered an uncertain and potentially difficult period. The
financial turmoil of August and September threatens to derail what has been an excellent half-decade of global growth. The problems
in credit markets have been severe, and while
the first phase is now over, we are still waiting to
see exactly how the consequences will play out.
Still, the situation at present is one with
threats rather than actual major negative outcomes on macroeconomic aggregates. At this
point, we expect global growth to slow in 2008,
but remain at a buoyant pace. Growth in the
United States is expected to remain subdued.
Problems in the housing sector are more intense
than previously expected, and the disruption
of credit is likely to have further impact. We
expect some slowing in Japan, where the second
quarter was disappointing, and in Europe, where
banks were involved to a surprising degree with
instruments and vehicles exposed to the U.S.
subprime sector.
The good news is that emerging market and
developing countries weathered the recent
financial storm and are providing the basis
for strong global growth in 2008. For the first
time, China and India are making the largest
country-level contributions to world growth (in
purchasing-power-parity terms; see the figure).
China is also making the largest contribution at

FOREWORD

market prices. More generally, emerging market
and developing countries are reaping the benefits of careful macroeconomic management over
the past decade. While there are some potential
vulnerabilities, and there is no room for complacency going forward, emerging markets should
remain strong in the foreseeable future.
In terms of global risks, we see most of these
as being on the downside for growth, that is,
unexpected developments are more likely to
push growth down rather than push it up.
Our growth fan chart shows probabilities both
above and below our forecast, based on our
previous forecast errors, but the skewness of
the chart—based on our reading of what could
push the global economy away from our central
forecast—is almost entirely to the downside.
Some of these risks have received considerable attention, including those in housing
markets and financial sectors. But some are
more surprising, including the fact that oil
prices remain high and that sharp food price
increases are contributing to inflation concerns
in emerging market and developing countries.
A key unknown is what will happen in Europe.
Until the events of this summer, Europe was in
the upswing of its cycle, with Germany in particular emerging as a driver of growth, moving
beyond the long, difficult process of reunification. But the serious disruptions in the market
for interbank liquidity and the difficulties
experienced by some European banks in recent
months were largely unexpected. Quite how
these developments will affect the real economy
remains to be seen.
I would also stress that the implications for
global imbalances remain uncertain. It seems
likely that the U.S. current account deficit will
decline relative to GDP, in part because the dollar has depreciated further since the summer—
its value is down more than 20 percent from
its recent peak in 2002. Fortunately, we have in
place a framework for cooperative actions by
the key countries involved with imbalances; this
was a major outcome of the IMF’s Multilateral
Consultation this year. Oil producers continue
to scale up their spending on infrastructure

xii

and investments. China remains determined to
rebalance its demand so as to lower its current
account surplus. Europe and Japan continue
with the process of structural reform, which
should help with restructuring and boost domestic demand. We expect that this framework will
facilitate the gradual decline of imbalances and
reduce risks of disruptive changes in exchange
rates, but this situation requires continued careful attention.
Turning to our analytical chapters, Chapter 3
highlights a major challenge for many emerging
market and developing countries—how to manage large capital inflows. These inflows slowed
this summer, but recent indications are that they
are again picking up. The chapter assesses what
we can learn from recent episodes of capital
inflows around the world, and it looks at what
kinds of macroeconomic policies help to ensure
that growth post-inflows remains strong. It turns
out that intervening in exchange markets, either
with or without sterilization, has not been successful in limiting real exchange rate appreciation or avoiding a deceleration in post-inflow
growth. What really helps is being careful with
fiscal spending. The lesson here is not that a
country needs to cut spending when there are
inflows, but rather that it needs to exercise fiscal
restraint. The greater caution of some leading
emerging markets in this regard since the late
1990s is commendable and has definitely contributed in part to their resilience today. I hope
other countries will learn the same lesson.
Chapter 4 takes a longer-term perspective
and looks at what has happened to inequality around the world, particularly during the
recent surge in various forms of globalization.
While we have written extensively, including in
the April 2007 World Economic Outlook, about
the benefits of globalization, the findings in
this chapter should be seen as more cautionary. In almost all countries, inequality has
increased in recent years. The authors find that
increased trade is not the culprit. Rather, it
seems likely that the spread of new technology
around the world, both in general and through
foreign direct investment, has disproportion-

FOREWORD

ately benefited people who are better educated.
The implication, of course, is not to try to
prevent the adoption of new technology—such
an approach would be sure to derail growth.
Rather the policy objective should be to provide
the education and other social services (such as
affordable health care, a reasonable-cost pension system, and so on) to ensure that as many
people as possible can find and keep highproductivity jobs. It would be unwise to ignore
the issue of growing inequality; globalization is
a key source of rising world prosperity, but more
effective policy actions are needed to make sure
that these benefits are well shared.
Chapter 5 offers hope but also some caution regarding the longer-term prospects of the
global economy. Looking back as far as possible
with comparable data (which takes us to around
1960), it is clear that the past half-decade has
seen the strongest and most broadly based run
of global growth since the 1960s. This was not a
fluke, but rather the result of improved frameworks for both monetary and fiscal policies, as
well as serious institutional improvements in
many middle- and lower-income countries. At
the same time, there was some luck involved—
inflation has been low, globally, in part because
of low-cost manufactured goods (part of the
globalization process) and because private capital flows have been relatively stable. It would be
unwise to expect that there will not be shocks

going forward, and the chapter makes recommendations that should help ensure that these
shocks do not have major repercussions.
In sum, the main message of this World
Economic Outlook is that, as long as policy fundamentals remain strong and institutions are
not undermined, the global economy should
grow rapidly, with the continued involvement
of almost all countries. Events of the past few
months have been a major test of global financial stability, and some unexpected weaknesses
have emerged. As long as those remain contained within a few industrial countries and are
addressed in a timely fashion, the impact on
world growth should be small.
The key, in the years ahead, is to make sure
that emerging market and developing countries can continue to grow rapidly and without
major disruptions. Macroeconomic stability
is necessary but not sufficient for economic
growth. We have to continue the process of
trade liberalization, allow capital to flow to
more productive opportunities in poorer countries, and—most important—make sure that
the benefits of growth are widely shared across
all countries and by as many people as possible
within countries. We would do well to anticipate further serious shocks, both downside and
upside, and to work harder to make sure that
the policies and institutions in place can withstand these shocks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global economy grew strongly in the first half
of 2007, although turbulence in financial markets has
clouded prospects. While the 2007 forecast has been
little affected, the baseline projection for 2008 global
growth has been reduced by almost ½ percentage point
relative to the July 2007 World Economic Outlook
Update. This would still leave global growth at a
solid 4¾ percent, supported by generally sound fundamentals and strong momentum in emerging market
economies. Risks to the outlook, however, are firmly on
the downside, centered around the concern that financial market strains could deepen and trigger a more
pronounced global slowdown. Thus, the immediate
focus of policymakers is to restore more normal financial market conditions and safeguard the expansion.
Additional risks to the outlook include potential inflation pressures, volatile oil markets, and the impact on
emerging markets of strong foreign exchange inflows.
At the same time, longer-term issues such as population aging, increasing resistance to globalization, and
global warming are a source of concern.

Global Economic Environment
The global economy continued to expand
vigorously in the first half of 2007, with growth
running above 5 percent (Chapter 1). China’s
economy gained further momentum, growing
by 11½ percent, while India and Russia continued to grow very strongly. These three countries
alone have accounted for one-half of global
growth over the past year. Robust expansions
also continued in other emerging market and
developing countries, including low-income
countries in Africa. Among the advanced economies, growth in the euro area and Japan slowed
in the second quarter of 2007 after two quarters
of strong gains. In the United States, growth
averaged 2!/4 percent in the first half of 2007 as
the housing downturn continued to apply considerable drag.

xiv

Inflation has been contained in the advanced
economies, but it has risen in many emerging
market and developing countries, reflecting
higher energy and food prices. In the United
States, core inflation has gradually eased to
below 2 percent. In the euro area, inflation has
generally remained below 2 percent this year,
but energy and food price increases contributed to an uptick in September; while in Japan,
prices have essentially been flat. Some emerging market and developing countries have seen
more inflation pressures, reflecting strong
growth and the greater weight of rising food
prices in their consumer price indices. The
acceleration in food prices has reflected pressure from the rising use of corn and other food
items for biofuel production and poor weather
conditions in some countries (Appendix 1.1).
Strong demand has kept oil and other commodity prices high.
Financial market conditions have become
more volatile. As discussed in the October
2007 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR),
credit conditions have tightened as increasing concerns about the fallout from strains
in the U.S. subprime mortgage market led to
a spike in yields on securities collateralized
with such loans as well as other higher-risk
securities. Uncertainty about the distribution
of losses and rising concerns about counterparty risk saw liquidity dry up in segments of
the financial markets. Equity markets initially
retreated, led by falling valuations of financial
institutions, although prices have since recovered, and long-term government bond yields
declined as investors looked for safe havens.
Emerging markets have also been affected,
although by relatively less than in previous
episodes of global financial market turbulence,
and asset prices remain high by historical
standards.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Prior to the recent turbulence, central banks
around the world were generally tightening
monetary policy to head off nascent inflation
pressures. In August, however, faced by
mounting market disruptions, major central
banks injected liquidity into money markets to
stabilize short-term interest rates. In September,
the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate
by 50 basis points, and financial markets expect
further reductions in the coming months.
Expectations of policy tightening by the Bank of
England, Bank of Japan, and European Central
Bank have been rolled back since the onset of
the financial market turmoil. Among emerging
markets, some central banks also provided
liquidity to ease strains in interbank markets,
but for others the principal challenge remains
to address inflation concerns.
The major currencies have largely continued trends observed since early 2006. The
U.S. dollar has continued to weaken, although
its real effective value is still estimated to be
above its medium-term fundamental level. The
euro has appreciated but continues to trade in
a range broadly consistent with fundamentals.
The Japanese yen has rebounded strongly in
recent months but remains undervalued relative
to medium-term fundamentals. The renminbi
has continued to appreciate gradually against
the U.S. dollar and on a real effective basis, but
China’s current account surplus has widened
further and its international reserves have
soared.

Outlook and Risks
In the face of turbulent conditions in financial markets, the baseline projections for global
growth have been marked down moderately
since the July World Economic Outlook Update,
although growth is still expected to continue at
a solid pace. The global economy is projected to
grow by 5.2 percent in 2007 and 4.8 percent in
2008—the latter forecast is 0.4 percentage point
lower than previously expected. The largest
downward revisions to growth are in the United
States, which is now expected to grow at 1.9 per-

cent in 2008; in countries where spillovers from
the United States are likely to be largest; and in
countries where the impact of continuing financial market turmoil is likely to be more acute
(see Chapter 2).
The balance of risks to the baseline growth
outlook is clearly on the downside. While the
underlying fundamentals supporting growth are
sound and the strong momentum in increasingly
important emerging market economies is intact,
downside risks emanating from the financial
markets and domestic demand in the United
States and western Europe have increased.
While the recent repricing of risk and increased
discipline in credit markets could strengthen
the foundations for future expansion, it raises
the near-term risks to growth. The extent of the
impact on growth will depend on how quickly
more normal market liquidity returns and on
the extent of the retrenchment in credit markets. The IMF staff’s baseline forecast is based
on the assumption that market liquidity is gradually restored in the coming months and that
the interbank market reverts to more normal
conditions, although wider credit spreads are
expected to persist. Nonetheless, there remains
a distinct possibility that turbulent financial
market conditions could continue for some
time. An extended period of tight credit conditions could have a significant dampening impact
on growth, particularly through the effect on
housing markets in the United States and some
European countries. Countries in emerging
Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States region with large current account deficits
and substantial external financing inflows would
also be adversely affected if capital inflows were
to weaken.
Several other risks could also have an impact
on the global outlook. While downside risks
to the outlook from inflation concerns have
generally been somewhat reduced by recent
developments, oil prices have risen to new highs
and a further spike in prices cannot be ruled
out—reflecting limited spare production capacity. Risks related to persistent global imbalances
still remain a concern.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Policy Issues
Policymakers around the world continue to
face the immediate challenge of maintaining
strong noninflationary growth, a challenge
heightened by recent turbulent global financial
conditions. In the advanced economies, after a
period of tightening that has brought monetary
stances close to or above neutral, central banks
have addressed the recent drying up of market
liquidity and associated financial sector risks
while continuing to base monetary policy decisions on judgments about the economic fundamentals. In the United States, signs that growth
was likely to continue below trend would justify
further interest rate reductions, provided that
inflation risks remain contained. In the euro
area, monetary policy can stay on hold over
the near term, reflecting the downside risks
to growth and inflation from financial market turmoil. However, as these risks dissipate,
further tightening eventually may be required.
In the event of a more protracted slowdown,
an easing of monetary policy would need to be
considered. In Japan, while interest rates will
eventually need to return to more normal levels, such increases should await clear signs that
prospective inflation is moving decisively higher
and that concerns over recent market volatility
have waned.
In due course, lessons will need to be drawn
from the current episode of turbulent global
financial market conditions. One set of issues
concerns the various approaches that central
banks have used to provide liquidity to relieve
financial strains and the linkage of this liquidity support with financial safety nets. A series of
regulatory issues will need to be addressed, as
discussed in the October 2007 GFSR. Greater
attention will need to be given to ensuring
adequate transparency and disclosure by systemically important institutions. It will also be
relevant to examine the regulatory approach
to treating liquidity risk, the relevant perimeter
around financial institutions for risk consolidation, the approach to rating complex financial
products, and whether the existing incentive
structure ensures adequate risk assessment

xvi

throughout the supply chain of structured
products.
Substantial progress has been made toward
fiscal consolidation during the present expansion in advanced economies, but more needs
to be done to ensure fiscal sustainability in the
face of population aging. Much of the recent
improvement in fiscal positions has reflected
rapid revenue growth driven by strong growth
in profits and high-end incomes, and it is not
clear to what extent these revenue gains will
be sustained. Further, current budgetary plans
envisage limited additional progress in reducing
debt ratios from current levels over the next few
years. Governments should adopt more ambitious medium-term consolidation plans, together
with reforms to tackle the rising pressures on
health and social security spending, although in
most countries there is scope to let the automatic fiscal stabilizers operate in the event of a
downturn.
A number of emerging markets still face overheating pressures and rising food prices, and
further monetary tightening may be required.
Moreover, notwithstanding recent financial
market developments, strong foreign exchange
inflows are likely to continue to complicate the
task of policymakers. As discussed in Chapter 3, there is no simple formula for dealing
with these foreign exchange inflows. Countries
need to take a pragmatic approach, finding an
appropriate blend of measures suited to their
particular circumstances and longer-term goals.
Fiscal policy is likely to play a key role. While fiscal positions have improved, this reflects strong
revenue growth generated by high commodity
prices that may not be sustained. At the same
time, government spending in many countries
has accelerated, which has added to the difficulties of managing strong foreign exchange
inflows. The avoidance of public spending
booms, particularly in emerging Europe but
also in Latin America, would help both in
managing inflows and in continuing to reduce
public debt levels. In fuel-exporting countries,
however, there is scope to further increase
spending, subject to absorptive capacities and

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

the cyclical position of the economy. A tightening of prudential standards in financial systems and steps to liberalize controls on capital
outflows can all play useful roles. In some cases,
greater exchange rate flexibility would provide
more room for better monetary control. Specifically for China, further upward flexibility of the
renminbi, along with measures to reform the
exchange rate regime and boost consumption,
would also contribute to a necessary rebalancing of demand and to an orderly unwinding of
global imbalances.
Across all countries, a common theme is
the need to take advantage of the opportunities created by globalization and technological advances, while doing more to ensure that
the benefits of these ongoing changes are well
distributed across the broad population. A
key part of this agenda is to make sure that
markets work well, with priorities being to
boost productivity in the financial and service
sectors in Europe and Japan; resist protectionist pressures in the United States and Europe;
and improve infrastructure, develop financial
systems, and strengthen the business environment in emerging market and developing
countries.
Globalization is often blamed for the rising inequality observed in most countries and
regions. Chapter 4 of this report finds that technological advances have contributed the most to
the recent rise in inequality, but increased financial globalization—and foreign direct investment
in particular—has also played a role. Contrary
to popular belief, increased trade globalization
is actually associated with a decline in inequality. It is important that policies help ensure that
the gains from globalization and technological change are more broadly shared across the
population. Reforms to strengthen education
and training would help to ensure that workers have the appropriate skills for the emerging
“knowledge-based” global economy. Policies that
increase the availability of finance to the poor
would also help, as would further trade liberalization that boosts agricultural exports from
developing countries.

Chapter 5 of this report examines the
current global expansion from a historical
perspective. It finds that not only has growth
been stronger than in other recent cycles, but
also the benefits are being more widely shared
across the world and economic volatility has
been lower. Indeed, better monetary and fiscal
policies, improved institutions, and increased
financial development mean that it is likely that
business cycles will be of longer duration and
lesser magnitude than in the past. Nevertheless, the prospects for future stability should
not be overstated, and recent increased financial market volatility has underlined concerns
that favorable conditions may not continue.
The abrupt end to the period of strong and
sustained growth in the 1960s and early 1970s
provides a useful cautionary lesson of what
can happen if policies do not adjust to tackle
emerging risks in a timely manner.
In some key areas, joint actions across countries will be crucial. The recent slow progress
with the Doha Trade Round is deeply disappointing, and major countries should demonstrate leadership to re-energize the process of
multilateral trade liberalization. Concerns about
climate change and energy security also clearly
require a multilateral approach. As discussed
in Appendix 1.2, global warming may be the
world’s largest collective action problem where
the negative consequences of individual activities are felt largely by others. It will be important that countries come together to develop
a market-based framework that balances the
long-term costs of carbon emissions against
the immediate economic costs of mitigation.
Energy policy should focus less on trying to
secure national sources of energy and more on
ensuring the smooth operation of oil and other
energy markets, encouraging diversification of
energy sources (for example, by reducing barriers to trade in biofuels), and paying greater
attention to price-based incentives to curb the
growth of energy consumption.
Welcome progress has been made toward
developing a joint approach toward tackling
global imbalances, and this now needs to

xvii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

be followed through. The IMF’s Multilateral
Consultation on Global Imbalances with key
countries represents the first use of an innovative approach to addressing systemic global
challenges. The Consultation provided a forum
to strengthen mutual understanding of the
issues, to reaffirm support for the International
Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC)
Strategy of sustaining global growth while reduc-

xviii

ing imbalances, and for each country to indicate
specific policies consistent with the Strategy. The
result of the Consultation was a set of policy
plans that, according to IMF staff analysis, will
make a significant contribution toward the goals
of the IMFC Strategy. With the agreement of the
participants in the Consultation, the implementation of the policy plans will be the subject of
regular IMF surveillance.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Although the global economy has sustained strong
growth in recent quarters, turbulence in financial
markets has clouded the prospects. The baseline projections for global growth in 2008 have been revised
down by almost ½ percentage point relative to the July
2007 World Economic Outlook Update, although
growth would remain a solid 4¾ percent, supported by
generally sound fundamentals and the strong momentum in the emerging market economies (Figure 1.1).
However, risks to the outlook lie firmly on the downside, centering around the concern that financial
market strains could continue and trigger a more pronounced global slowdown. Thus, the immediate task
for policymakers is to restore more normal financial
market conditions and safeguard the continued expansion of activity. Additional risks to the outlook include
potential inflation pressures, volatile oil markets, the
impact on emerging markets of strong capital inflows,
and continued large global imbalances. Key longerterm issues relate to addressing obstacles to sustained
growth from population aging and the increasing
resistance to globalization.

Figure 1.1. Global Indicators1
(Annual percent change unless otherwise noted)
The global economy has been experiencing its strongest sustained period of growth
since the early 1970s. The expansion is projected to remain above the long-term
trend, notwithstanding recent financial market turbulence, with emerging market and
developing countries leading the way. Inflation generally remains at low levels, while
trade volumes continue to increase robustly, albeit at a slower pace than in 2006.

Global growth remained above 5 percent in
the first half of 2007. China’s economy gained
momentum, growing 11½ percent and, for the
first time, making the largest contribution to
global growth evaluated at market as well as
purchasing-power-parity (PPP) exchange rates.
India continued to grow at more than 9 percent
and Russia at almost 8 percent. These three
countries alone accounted for one-half of global
growth over the past year, but other emerging market and developing countries have also
maintained robust expansions. Rapid growth
in these countries counterbalanced continued
moderate growth in the United States, which
grew at about 2¼ percent in the first half, as the

housing correction continued to apply considerable drag. Growth in the euro area and Japan
slowed in the second quarter, after two quarters
of strong gains.
Inflation has been contained in the advanced
economies in recent months, but rising food
prices have contributed to heightened pressures
elsewhere (Figure 1.2). In the United States,
core inflation has gradually subsided to below
2 percent in significant part because of slowing
shelter cost increases. In the euro area, inflation
has generally remained below 2 percent this
year, although energy and food price increases
contributed to an uptick in September; whereas
in Japan, prices have essentially been flat.
However, inflation has picked up in a number
of emerging market and developing countries,
reflecting strong growth of domestic demand
and the greater weight of rising food prices in
the consumer price index. The acceleration in
food prices has reflected pressure from increasing use of corn and other food items for biofuel
production as well as poor weather conditions
and supply disruptions in a number of countries
(Box 1.1). Meanwhile, oil prices have recently
rebounded to new highs, owing to stronger
growth of demand than initially projected in
the face of lower production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
a smaller-than-expected rise of non-OPEC
output, and continuing geopolitical concerns
(Appendix 1.1).
Global credit market conditions have deteriorated sharply since late July as a repricing
of credit risk sparked increased volatility and
a broad loss of market liquidity. Initially, rising
delinquencies on U.S. subprime mortgages led
to a spike in yields on securities collateralized
with such loans and to a sharp widening in
spreads on structured credits, particularly in
the United States and the euro area (Figure 1.3;
see also detailed discussion in the October
2007 Global Financial Stability Report, or GFSR).
From mid-August, rising uncertainty about the
amount and distribution of associated valuation
losses and concerns about the off-balance-sheet
exposures of financial institutions have added to

STRONG GLOBAL GROWTH IS BEING CONFRONTED BY TURBULENT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

market strains. The result has been a drying up
of high-yield corporate bond issues, a sharp contraction in the asset-backed commercial paper
market, a dramatic disruption of liquidity in
the interbank market, and stress on institutions
funded through short-term money markets.
Yields on government paper declined sharply as
investors looked for safe havens and as expectations about future monetary policy were revised.
Toward the end of September, some of these
strains started to ease, following a 50 basis point
cut in the federal funds rate, but credit market conditions still remain under stress with
wider spreads and low issuance of riskier assets.
Equity markets in the advanced economies also
retreated from highs in August, led by falling
valuations of financial institutions, although
prices have since recovered (Figure 1.4).
Emerging markets have also been affected
by these developments, with sovereign spreads
widening, stock markets falling, and capital flows
being scaled back (Figure 1.5). Overall, however, the impact has been less than in previous
episodes of global financial turbulence, and
emerging market equity prices are again reaching record highs. This resilience reflects two sets
of factors. First, the turbulence has been related
to setbacks in markets for innovative credit
instruments and in institutional structures that
are less prevalent in emerging markets. Second,
most emerging market countries have reduced
external vulnerabilities by strengthening their
public balance sheets and policy frameworks.
That said, certain countries that have received
heavy short-term capital inflows experienced
pressures in interbank markets as these flows
started to reverse.
Prior to the recent turbulence, central banks
around the world were generally pushing up
policy rates to head off nascent inflationary
pressures. However, in August, faced by mounting market disruptions, central banks in the
major advanced economies injected liquidity
through open market operations on a scale
not seen since the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)/Russian default crisis in 1998
to stabilize overnight interest rates. They also

Figure 1.3. Developments in Mature Credit Markets
(Interest rates in percent unless otherwise noted)
Credit market conditions have deteriorated sharply since late July as rising fallout
from problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector led to a spike in yields on
high-risk investments. In this context, interest rates on government securities have
declined, reflecting a flight to quality and changing expectations about the path of
monetary policy.

and in the United Kingdom, the authorities
extended deposit insurance coverage to reassure
depositors after a bank experienced difficulties.
In September, the Federal Reserve reacted to rising risks to growth by lowering the federal funds
rate by ½ percentage point, and market participants expect further reductions in the coming
months. Moreover, expectations of policy tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) and
the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have been rolled back.
Central banks in a number of emerging market
countries (e.g., Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Russia) also provided liquidity to relieve strains in
interbank markets, but for others the principal
challenge has continued to be addressing inflation concerns (Chile, China, and South Africa
have all raised interest rates since August).
The U.S. dollar temporarily regained some
ground in August in the context of recent
financial turbulence, but has since resumed a
weakening trend, against the background of
a wide current account deficit, a slow-growing
economy, and the cut in the federal funds rate
(Figure 1.6). In the IMF staff’s view, the dollar
remains overvalued relative to medium-term
fundamentals.1 Although the euro has strengthened in effective terms, it continues to trade in
a range broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals. The pound sterling and the Canadian dollar have also appreciated in real effective terms; the pound is viewed as overvalued
relative to fundamentals and the Canadian dollar to be broadly in line with fundamentals. The
yen depreciated somewhat more rapidly through
June, despite Japan’s rising current account surplus, as continued low interest rates and a waning home bias of Japanese investors encouraged
capital outflows. However, it has rebounded
since then, as heightened market volatility has
prompted some unwinding of yen carry trades,
although the yen still remains undervalued relative to medium-term fundamentals.

1Various approaches for assessing an exchange rate’s
valuation relative to medium-term fundamentals are
described in IMF (2006).

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

The renminbi has continued to appreciate
gradually against the U.S. dollar, and its real
effective exchange rate has risen modestly
in recent months (Figure 1.7). Nevertheless,
China’s current account surplus has widened
further, and its international reserves have
continued to soar, reaching $1.4 trillion at endAugust. Other emerging market countries have
also faced strong foreign exchange inflows from
both current and capital accounts, reflected
in significant exchange rate appreciations in a
number of countries and a rapid accumulation
of international reserves that has driven strong
domestic credit growth. Emerging market currencies generally weakened in July and August,
in the context of turbulent global financial markets, but have since regained ground.

Figure 1.5. Emerging Market Financial Conditions
Financial flows to emerging markets and private credit growth continued to be strong
in the first half of 2007. Since July, more turbulent global financial market conditions
have prompted some widening of bond yield spreads and a weakening of equity
prices, but, generally, emerging market asset valuations remain near historic highs.

In the face of turbulent financial conditions,
the baseline projections for the global economy
have been marked down moderately since the
July 2007 World Economic Outlook Update, but
growth nonetheless is expected to continue at
a solid pace. According to the latest IMF forecast, global growth would slow to 5.2 percent in
2007 and 4.8 percent in 2008, down from the 5.4
percent rate registered in 2006 (Table 1.1 and
Figure 1.8). The largest downward revisions to
growth are in the United States and countries
where financial and trade spillovers from the
United States are likely to be largest (particularly
Canada, Mexico, and parts of emerging Asia).
In the United States, growth is now projected
to remain at 1.9 percent in 2008, a mark-down
of almost 1 percentage point below the previous
projections. Ongoing difficulties in the mortgage market are expected to extend the decline
in residential investment, while higher energy
prices, sluggish job growth, and weaker house
prices are likely to dampen consumption spending. In the euro area, growth has been marked
down to 2.1 percent in 2008, 0.4 percentage
point lower than in July, reflecting lagged effects

The U.S. dollar has continued to depreciate, while the U.S. current account deficit has
come down moderately in recent quarters but remains close to 6 percent of GDP. The
yen rebounded in August as turbulent financial conditions led to some reversal of
carry trade flows. The euro has remained on an appreciating trend.

of euro appreciation, trade spillovers from the
United States, and more difficult financing
conditions. In Japan, the growth projection has
been reduced to 2 percent in 2007 and 1.7 percent in 2008 (0.6 and 0.3 percentage points
lower than in July), reflecting the weaker-thanexpected second quarter GDP outturn, slower
global growth, and a somewhat stronger yen.
Among emerging market and developing countries, growth is expected to remain very strong.
The Chinese economy is now expected to grow
by 10 percent in 2008, some 0.5 percentage
point lower than in the July update.
The baseline projections assume that market liquidity is gradually restored in coming
months and that the interbank market reverts
to more normal conditions, although wider
spreads would persist on riskier assets following
a prolonged period of exceptionally low spreads,
and lending standards would be tighter. These
assumptions are consistent with experience following previous episodes of financial turbulence
(Box 1.2). The baseline also assumes that the
Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a further
50 basis points by the end of the year, and the
ECB and BoJ refrain from further interest rate
increases through the end of the year.
On this basis, the IMF staff assessment is that
sound fundamentals would continue to support
solid global growth. In the advanced economies,
sources of resilience include the strong balance
sheets and capital positions of core financial
institutions at the beginning of the recent
episode, the high profitability and generally low
leverage of the corporate sector, and the healthy
situation in labor markets and household net
wealth. Moreover, strong domestic demand
growth in emerging market economies should
continue to be a key driver of global growth,
with more robust public balance sheets and
policy frameworks providing scope for most
countries to weather some weakening in external demand (Figure 1.9). Indeed, somewhat
slower capital inflows from the torrid pace of
the first half of 2007 may serve to ease concerns
about excessive currency appreciation or too
rapid credit growth.

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

However, the risks to the baseline forecast
are distinctly to the downside. As shown in the
fan chart in the upper panel of Figure 1.10, the
IMF staff envisages a 1 in 6 chance of global
growth falling to 3½ percent or less in 2008.
The main sources of the increase in the downside risk since the July 2007 update come from
deteriorating financial conditions and from the
uncertain prospects for domestic demand in the
United States and Europe, as shown in the lower
panel of Figure 1.10. Risks to domestic demand
in western Europe and Japan are now seen as
somewhat to the downside and risks in emerging
markets are seen as broadly balanced—previously the balance of risks in these economies
was viewed as positive. By contrast, risks to the
outlook from inflation concerns and oil market
volatility are now somewhat less negative, as supply constraints and commodity market pressures
would be reduced by some moderation in the
pace of global growth. Risks related to persistent
global imbalances remain a concern.

Figure 1.7. External Developments in Emerging
Market and Developing Countries
Exchange rates in emerging market and developing countries have tended to
appreciate, in the face of strong foreign exchange inflows and despite heavy
intervention that has pushed reserves up to record levels.

Financial Market Risks

ASEAN-42

-20

Previous issues of the World Economic Outlook
and the GFSR have expressed concern that
heightened volatility and a widening of risk
spreads from exceptionally low levels could
have a significant dampening impact on economic activity. The manifestation of such risks
in the recent period of financial turbulence is
now reflected in some lowering of the baseline
forecast. Nonetheless, financial market conditions remain a major source of downside risks to
the global outlook. While the baseline assumes a
return to more normal market conditions after
a repricing of risk, there remains the distinct
possibility that recent turbulent conditions could
continue for some time and generate a deeper
“credit crunch” than envisaged in the baseline
scenario, with considerably greater macroeconomic impact.
As discussed in more detail in the October
2007 GFSR, recent financial market developments represent an inevitable return to greater
market discipline after a period of very low

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

risk spreads and lax credit conditions, which
should ultimately strengthen the foundations of
global growth. However, the correction has been
extremely turbulent because of uncertainties
about the distribution of valuation losses and the
drying up of money market liquidity. As markets work their way through the repricing and
the uncertainties are reduced, the initial strong
capital and profitability of core financial institutions and the dispersion of losses across investors should limit systemic risks. Thus, the most
likely outcome built into the baseline scenario is
a gradual return to more normal market conditions after a repricing of credit risk and a tightening of credit standards. Some financial market
segments are likely to shrink very substantially—
notably the subprime mortgage market and
riskier forms of asset-backed securitization—while
risk spreads for nonprime corporate borrowing
are likely to be persistently higher. However, the
impact on interest rates for lower-risk borrowers
may be quite limited. It is noteworthy that amid
the turmoil, the effect on interest rates for conforming mortgage loans and high-grade corporate borrowers has been small, as some widening
in spreads has been at least partly offset by lower
benchmark government bond yields.
Nevertheless, at the time of writing, conditions in financial markets remain volatile, and
the stress in credit markets may continue despite
efforts by central banks to ensure adequate
market liquidity and calm market sentiment.
A key element of uncertainty is the extent to
which a drying up of demand for securitized
assets could drive the reintermediation of credit
into the banking system, limiting capacity for
new credit growth. Moreover, continued stress
in interbank and other short-term funding
markets could add to pressure on bank liquidity
and profitability. Such an outturn could imply
not only a sustained setback for riskier market
segments, but also tighter credit conditions for
even high-grade borrowers in the household
and corporate sectors. Although the impact
would likely be greatest in the United States and
western Europe—where the use of, and investor
exposure to, structured credits has been most

Figure 1.8. Global Outlook
(Real GDP; percent change from a year ago)
While projections have been marked down moderately to reflect the impact of recent
financial market turbulence, output growth is still expected to be well sustained over
2007–08. Emerging market countries in Asia continue to lead the way, but all regions
are expected to share in the strong performance.

extensive—the effects could be felt more widely,
given growing cross-border linkages across the
global financial system.
Moreover, other sources of financial risk could
be exposed by sustained volatile conditions. So
far, emerging markets have generally been less
affected by recent turbulence in the advanced
economies than in past episodes beyond a few
countries that were affected by a reversal of
short-term flows. However, a number of countries have become dependent on large external
financing inflows, including some emerging
European and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. In these countries,
promising growth prospects have generated
large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows,
but also bank flows and international bond issuance often denominated in foreign currencies,
which have been used to finance credit booms
and rapid growth in consumption. These flows
could be jeopardized by a fuller repricing of
risk and tightening of lending standards, and a
general increase in risk aversion in the context
of continued turbulent conditions.

Risk to Domestic Demand in the United States
In the baseline projections, the U.S. economy
is now expected to maintain only moderate
growth through the end of 2008. However, the
balance of risks to domestic demand has shifted
further to the downside, as recent financial
developments have raised the risk of more
protracted problems in the housing sector that
could start having a deeper impact on the rest
of the economy.
The correction in the U.S. housing sector,
which has now been under way for two years,
has been a major drag on activity as the drop
in residential investment alone has taken nearly
1 percentage point off GDP growth in the past
year. The baseline forecast for the U.S. economy
already envisages that the housing correction
will continue well into 2008. Inventory-to-sales
ratios remain exceptionally high; conditions for
mortgage financing have now tightened beyond
the subprime sector, including for Alt-A and

jumbo prime mortgages; and delinquency rates
are expected to continue rising as interest rates
on adjustable rate mortgages are reset upward.
However, although consumption will be slowed,
it is projected to remain resilient, provided that
key supports—low unemployment and high
household wealth—remain in place.
However, downside risks to U.S. domestic
demand have clearly risen. The concern is that
tightening credit availability would affect a
broader range of households and further curtail
effective demand for housing, while also adding
to the supply as foreclosures rise and sales fall
through. The baseline projections already build
in a further 5 percent decline in house prices,
but the decline could be sharper, adding to difficulties of refinancing and weakening household
balance sheets, with a dampening impact on
consumption as well as residential investment. A
more general deterioration in labor market conditions or a sustained drop in the stock market
would also make it more difficult for households
to absorb the impact of housing-related difficulties. Against this background, risks of a recession have risen, although the Federal Reserve
would be expected to respond quickly by easing
monetary policy further in the face of signs of
rising weakness, and the more likely outcome
would seem to be a more prolonged period of
subpotential growth.

Figure 1.10. Risks to the Global Outlook
Risks to the global outlook have moved squarely to the downside. The largest
adverse risks relate to global financial conditions and domestic demand in the United
States and western Europe.

Risk to Domestic Demand in Western Europe

Notwithstanding the downward revision to the
baseline forecast, risks to domestic demand in
western Europe and Japan have now shifted to
the downside, particularly in the event of continuing financial turbulence. Western Europe
has been impacted directly by contagion from
the turmoil in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, as a number of banks have been affected by
their involvement in the housing sector, including through off-balance-sheet vehicles supported
by backup lines of credit and difficulties in
funding markets. Although actions by the ECB
and the Bank of England have helped to address

forecast with 50, 70, and 90 percent probability intervals. As shown, the 70 percent
confidence interval includes the 50 percent interval, and the 90 percent confidence interval
includes the 50 and 70 percent intervals. See Box 1.3 in the April 2006 World Economic
Outlook for details.
2 The chart shows the contributions of each risk factor to the overall balance of risks to global
growth, as reflected by the extent of asymmetry in the probability density for global GDP growth
shown in the fan chart. The balance of risks is tilted to the downside if the expected probability
of outcomes below the central or modal forecast (the total “downside probability”) exceeds 50
percent (Box 1.3 in the April 2006 World Economic Outlook). The bars for each forecast vintage
sum up to the difference between the expected value of world growth implied by the distribution
of outcomes (the probability density) shown in the fan chart and the central forecast for global
GDP growth. This difference and the extent of asymmetry in the probability density in the fan
chart also depend on the standard deviation of past forecast errors—which, among other
factors, varies with the length of the forecasting horizon. To make the risk factors comparable
across forecast vintages, their contributions are rescaled to correct for differences in the
standard deviations.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.1. Who Is Harmed by the Surge in Food Prices?
Over the past year, prices of some food
products—notably corn, soybeans, and wheat—
have risen substantially. The boom in nonfuel
commodity prices, including food, was discussed in the September 2006 issue of the
World Economic Outlook. This box reexamines
the impact of the food price surge in light
of the increased use of some food items as a
source of fuel (see Box 1.6)—a development
that could substantially alter the structure of
demand for food products. These developments
are of particular significance for low-income
countries, given the large exposure of their
populations to fluctuations in food prices.1
Specifically, this box aims at
• identifying the factors behind the recent rise
in food prices,
• gauging the impact on net trade and inflation
across different regions, and
• providing some policy assessment.

Impact on Trade Balances
For many economies, food represents a
significant share of export receipts or import
payments. Thus, higher food prices can
have a significant impact on a country’s net
trade balances.2 A number of food-exporting
countries in the Western Hemisphere—such as
Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile—and in southern Africa—such as South Africa, Namibia,
and Swaziland—have benefited from higher
food prices since 2002. However, many of the
poorer regions of Africa—for example, Benin,
Cape Verde, Ghana, and Niger—and a number
of countries in Asia—including Bangladesh,
China, Nepal, and Sri Lanka—as well as in the
Middle East are net losers. Among advanced

Impact on Inflation
Higher international food prices put upward
pressure on the cost of living, both directly and
through their potential impact on nonfood
prices. Average domestic food price inflation
(defined as the purchasing-power-parityweighted aggregate of an individual country’s
domestic food price inflation) rose to about
4½ percent in the first four months of 2007 from
about 3 percent over the same period in 2006
(first figure). The figure is more than 9 percent
for developing countries (excluding Zimbabwe
and other countries with insufficient data).
To analyze the impact of food prices on headline inflation across regions, two methodologies
are followed: inflation accounting to calculate
the direct impact and econometric analysis to
estimate the indirect impact through spillovers
to nonfood prices.
Direct effect. For many developing countries,
food accounts for a significant share of total
consumer expenditure and the headline CPI.
Indeed, the share across countries tends to be
negatively correlated with income levels (second

figure). For example, the weight of food in the
consumption basket averages more than 60 percent in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas it is about
30 percent in China, and only 10 percent in the
United States.3
The direct first-round contribution of food
to inflation4 for the world as a whole has risen
from about ¼ in 2000–06 to more than !/3 in
the first four months of 2007 (table and map).
It has risen quite drastically in developing Asia,
with the contribution in China, at more than
¾, being among the largest. The contribution
has also risen in most other developing regions.
In Africa it has fallen, but remains high, in part
reflecting earlier price hikes associated with
adverse weather conditions—for example, in
East Africa in 2006.
Indirect effect. Food prices could also increase
headline CPI indirectly by raising nonfood
prices—for example, through a wage response
to higher food prices—especially in poorer
countries in which food accounts for a sizable
share of total household expenditure. A VAR
3These weights may overestimate the true consumption of food in some countries, owing to the time it
takes to revise them.
4The contribution is calculated as the share of food
in the CPI multiplied by food price inflation divided
by headline inflation. In calculating the contribution,
food price and headline inflation were first aggregated across regions. The direct contribution assumes
no change in consumption patterns in response to
changes in prices.

from different income groups: Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States

international food and energy annual price
inflation. The idea is to capture the impact of

• for the three advanced economies, based on
the generalized impulse response functions,
food price inflation does not appear to have
a discernible impact on nonfood inflation;
• for the four emerging market economies,
except for India, the results suggest a significant impact: a 1 percentage point temporary increase in food price inflation may
raise nonfood price inflation in the range of
0.1–0.6 percentage point, with the effect disappearing only after six months to a year; and
• similarly, for the three low-income economies,
food prices appear to be a significant determinant of nonfood inflation. A 1 percentage
point temporary increase in food price inflation may raise nonfood price inflation in the
range of 0.1–0.9 percentage point, with the
effect sustained up to a year.
These results illustrate the likely impact of
higher food prices on nonfood prices across different regions, but—given the small number of
countries in the sample and the simple model
used—further research is needed to provide
more solid global evidence.

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

Other Effects
Higher food prices could have other macroeconomic and distributional effects.
• An inflation-targeting central bank may have
to curb inflationary pressure from higher
food prices when the effect on nonfood
prices is significant. As noted above, this
is likely to be a more serious problem for
developing countries, where feed-through
to nonfood prices is more pronounced. For
example, interest rates have been raised
recently in China (in August), Mexico (in
May), and Chile (in July) in part to preempt
the potential impact of higher food prices. In
China, soaring domestic meat prices have further boosted food price inflation, pushing up
headline inflation to 6.5 percent in August.
• Higher food prices are also likely to adversely
affect income distribution within a net-foodimporting economy, because food tends to
absorb a greater share of expenditure for
poorer people. Indeed, the World Food Program recently warned that, as a result of the
increases in food prices, its purchasing costs
have risen by almost 50 percent in the past
five years, thereby making it difficult to afford
to feed the same number of people that it has
helped in the past.
Concluding Remarks and Policy Implications
The use of food as a source of fuel may have
serious implications for the demand for food
if the expansion of biofuels continues: income
elasticity of demand will likely increase; and
although supply will respond to the surge in

systemic concerns, credit spreads have widened,
uncertainty has increased, and the impact on
domestic demand could turn out to be substantially larger than already incorporated in the
revised baseline forecasts.
One particular area of downside risk relates
to the housing market in western Europe.
Housing markets have boomed in a number of
fast- growing economies, most notably Ireland,

demand, the catch-up period may be prolonged.6 Technological advances in both food
and biofuel production will mitigate the longterm effects on food supply-demand balances,
but the developments already warrant a reexamination of policy frameworks and may call for
coordination at the international level:
• One country’s policy to promote biofuels while
protecting its farmers could increase another
(likely poorer) country’s import bills for
food and pose additional risks to inflation or
growth. This impact would be mitigated if the
United States and the EU biofuel-producing
countries reduced barriers to biofuel imports
from developing countries (such as Brazil)
where production is cheaper, more efficient,
and environmentally less damaging (see
Box 1.6). Such a shift in policies could also
provide opportunities for other developing
countries with potential comparative advantage
in producing biofuels to enter the industry.
• In many countries, monetary policy decisions
focus on core inflation, because food price
movements are often erratic, supply driven,
and have transient effects on overall inflation.
However, central banks—particularly in
developing countries where food prices do
significantly affect nonfood prices—will need
to monitor food prices carefully and respond
quickly if food price movements are threatening achievement of inflation goals.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2. Macroeconomic Implications of Recent Financial Market Turmoil:
Patterns from Previous Episodes
How could the recent period of financial turmoil affect global growth? This box aims to shed
some light on this issue by comparing current
events with four previous episodes of financial market stress: the U.S. stock market crash
of 1987; the Russian debt default and collapse
of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)
in 1998; the “dotcom” crash of 2000; and the
aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks. The obvious similarity across all of these
episodes is a sudden and widespread increase
in uncertainty and difficulty of judging risks.
Also, often, but not always, these episodes were
accompanied by a drying up of liquidity. But the
fundamental causes of these episodes, the policy
reactions to them, and their impact on growth
and employment show significant differences.
Episodes of financial market turbulence can
be analyzed by tracing the evolution of key
variables around these events (first figure).1 At
first glance, the current episode appears similar
to previous episodes, with an increase in investor risk aversion, characterized by heightened
market volatility and a flight to safer assets. In
some ways, market movements have been more
limited in this episode. Despite an increase
in volatility in equity markets, the declines in
equity prices in the United States and the rest
of the world have, so far, been smaller than
in previous episodes. Spreads on high-yield
corporate paper and mortgage-backed securities have risen, but have remained at or below
historical averages. Spreads on emerging market
sovereign bonds have been less affected than
in other episodes, reflecting the origin of the
current distress and reduced external vulnerabilities of emerging market countries.
Note: The main author of this box is Alasdair Scott.
1In the figures in this box, the 1987 crash is
centered on October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones
Industrial average fell dramatically; the Russian
default/LTCM episode is centered on August 17,
1998, the day of the Russian default and devaluation;
the dotcom crash is centered on March 13, 2000, the
day after the peak of the NASDAQ index value; the
9/11 episode is centered on September 11, 2001; and
the current episode is centered on July 26, 2007, the
first major fall in stock markets worldwide.

16

It is more worrying, however, that the
disruption to money markets and interbank
operations seems more severe than in recent
episodes. This is displayed in the sharp rise in
the TED spread—the difference between the
eurodollar rate, the rate at which banks lend to
each other in the eurodollar market, and the
risk-free treasury bill rate, particularly at threemonth maturity. There has also been a large
rise in the spread between monetary policy rates
and interbank lending rates. This disruption,
which has persisted despite heavy liquidity injections by major central banks, seems to reflect a
combination of banks’ desire to hoard their own
liquidity in the face of possible calls on their
lending capacity and heightened perceptions of
counterparty risk in the context of continuing
uncertainty about the distribution of losses from
the financial turbulence.
A key question is how the turbulence in financial markets is likely to spill over into the wider
economy. Two channels appear to be at work
during crisis episodes: a first whereby households and firms face a higher cost of and/or
restrictions on financing activity, and a second
“confidence” channel, which may suppress
aggregate demand because of greater caution
about the future.
Evidence from previous episodes suggests
that increases in spreads and restrictions on
credit are likely to be persistent, and could have
a moderating influence on consumption and
investment. There are two particular factors in
this episode that could increase the macroeconomic impact. The first is the potential for a
rolling back of the rapid rise in securitization
seen in recent years as investors took on more
risk in a “search for yield.”2 Second, the banking system’s capacity to re-intermediate credit
2For example, between 2000 and 2006, assets under
management by hedge funds increased by over 250
percent. Issuances of credit derivatives, collateralized
debt obligations, and mortgage- and asset-backed
securities have experienced even greater growth in
this period, all consistent with a rise in leverage in
a quest for yield. See the April 2007 Global Financial
Stability Report, pp. 50–57.

flows onto its balance sheets may be limited by
constraints on bank capital and by losses already
incurred in the present turbulence. For both
of these reasons, the impact on economy-wide
credit availability may go considerably beyond
the repricing of risk.
Consumer and business confidence in the
United States has typically fallen following
previous episodes of financial turbulence, and
measures of foreign confidence often follow
U.S. measures. But previous episodes also show
that such indicators can recover quickly, such
as during the stock market crash of 1987 and
the Russian default/LTCM case. In most cases,
an important factor helping to bolster confidence was swift action by the central bank to
ease the monetary stance. The exception was in
2000 when the Fed continued to raise interest
rates for another six months after the NASDAQ
peaked, and only started to ease the rates nine
months later; confidence measures did not pick
up until approximately one year later. This time,
the Fed has cut interest rates by 50 basis points,
and financial markets expect interest rates to be
cut by a further 50 basis points by early next year.
What then were the effects of previous episodes of financial market turbulence on activity?
Output growth in the United States actually
picked up after the 1987 and 1998 episodes, and
was largely unaffected in 2001 (second figure).
In 1987, 1998, and 2001, the Fed cut interest
rates quickly. Moreover, the events of 1998 and
2001 were initiated by events outside the U.S.
financial system. By contrast, the bursting of
the information technology bubble in 2000
preceded a short recession and a long bear
market, perhaps because the financial turbulence was related to a fundamental reevaluation
of prospects for profitability; notwithstanding
the eventual application of strong monetary and
fiscal stimulus, it took some time for demand to
regain momentum and asset values to return to
more typical ratios to earnings.3
3Activity in the rest of the world has generally
followed that in the United States. The IMF staff
analysis in the April 2007 World Economic Outlook found

In summary, with the exception of disruption to money markets, recent financial market
turbulence has not been unusually large
compared with previous episodes. Moreover,
past periods of financial retrenchment have not
always presaged slower economic activity—in
three out of the four previous episodes considered here, growth accelerated, helped by
easier monetary policy. However, there are at
least three reasons why the macroeconomic
implications of recent events may yet be larger
than what these earlier experiences suggest.

significant spillovers from growth rates of U.S. output
to those in the rest of the world. Moreover, previous
work has noted that U.S. house price movements lead
world house prices—see the September 2004 World
Economic Outlook, p. 87. Recent work by IMF staff has
identified financial conditions as the major conduit
for the transmission of shocks from the United States
to the rest of the world. (See Bayoumi and Swiston,
2007, who argue that short-term interest rates are the
most important factor in the spillover mechanism,
but real equity prices and nominal government bond
yields are also important.)

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

First, recent financial developments have been
associated with, and may exacerbate, an ongoing correction in the U.S. housing market,
which could continue to exert substantial drag
on the economy. Second, continuing uncertainty and loss of confidence in structured

availability were to be tightened. Given that
rapid increases in some countries have raised
concerns about possible excesses, some cooling
seems desirable, if it does not go too far too
fast. But could a housing correction in western
Europe be as deep as in the United States? The
analysis in Box 2.1 suggests that the extent of
house price overvaluation may be considerably
larger in some national markets in Europe than
in the United States, and there would clearly be
a sizable impact on the housing markets in the
event of a widespread credit crunch. Nevertheless, there are moderating factors. First, housing markets in western Europe have generally
avoided subprime mortgage origination and the
deterioration of lending standards observed in
the United States. Second, a number of country-specific structural factors, including strong
immigration and supply constraints, are likely
to continue to support housing sectors in particular national markets.
In the case of Japan, the direct financial exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage sector is
much more limited. However, recent indicators
of activity suggest a weakening of momentum,
and consumption and investment could be
affected if the recent global financial turmoil
intensifies and undermines confidence.

Risks to Emerging Market Countries
Risks to domestic demand growth in emerging market countries are now viewed as being
modestly to the upside overall. China and India
maintained a strong growth momentum in the
first half of 2007, but further upside surprises
remain possible. In particular, it remains

credits could lead to a sustained retrenchment
in securitization. Third, the current turbulence
has placed strains on banking systems in the
United States and elsewhere, which could further exacerbate constraints on the availability
of credit.

unclear to what extent policy tightening in both
countries will prove effective in cooling robust
demand growth that has raised concerns about
overinvestment (particularly in China) and
overheating (particularly in India).
Nevertheless, there are considerable downside risks in some countries. The main one is
that continued turbulence in global financial
markets could disrupt financial flows to emerging
markets and trigger problems in domestic
markets. As already mentioned, countries in
emerging Europe and the CIS with substantial
current account deficits and reliance on bankrelated inflows for financing would seem to be
at particular risk, especially given concerns that
credit booms have fueled a deterioration in credit
quality and run-ups in house prices. Elsewhere,
emerging market countries in Asia and Latin
America would generally seem much less vulnerable than in the past to tighter conditions in international credit markets, given their high levels
of international reserves, stronger public sector
balance sheets, and improved macroeconomic
management. However, growth in these countries
would be vulnerable to spillover effects from
slower aggregate demand growth in the advanced
economies, including through the dampening
effect on prices of commodity exports. Other
downside risks relate to supply constraints in specific countries—such as emerging energy shortages in Argentina and production problems in a
number of oil exporters, such as Nigeria.

Inflation Pressures
Recent buoyant global activity and rising commodity prices raise the concern that tightening

19

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

resource constraints could put upward pressure on inflation and prompt central banks to
tighten monetary conditions more aggressively
than has been built into the projections. Such
concerns have taken a backseat in the advanced
economies since the recent bout of financial
market turbulence, but even under a somewhat
slower growth track than previously envisaged,
the assessment of the extent of inflationary risks
remains a key factor affecting central banks’
judgments in setting the policy stance. In the
emerging market and developing countries,
inflation risks are more immediate.
Commodity markets have been the most obvious source of recent upward pressure on prices.
Strong growth of demand has kept oil and metals prices at high levels since 2006, while food
prices have also spiked upward. Despite recent
financial turbulence, supplies remain tight, and
this area remains an important source of risk.
The concern is particularly acute in emerging
market and developing countries where food
often represents 35–40 percent of consumption
baskets and the credibility of monetary policy
regimes is less well established, increasing the
likelihood that rising food and energy costs
could affect inflation expectations and feed into
other prices and wages.
A second source of inflationary pressures
comes from closing output gaps more broadly.
Product markets for manufactured goods were
a disinflationary force until recently, as rapid
productivity growth, especially in East Asian
exporters, and spare capacity that opened
up after the global downturn in 2000–01
led to declining nonfuel import prices in
the advanced economies. However, over the
past three years, this tide has reversed, as
sustained growth has closed output gaps, not
only in the advanced economies but also in
emerging market countries (Figure 1.11).2 As
2Output gaps are notoriously difficult to measure,
except with the benefit of considerable hindsight. Figure 1.11 shows a simple aggregate measure of the output
gap, based on a Hodrick-Prescott times series technique
for estimating potential output. It also shows alternative
measures of the gap based on estimates of the nonaccel-

a result, a number of emerging market countries are facing overheating risks, which could
also affect inflation pressures in the advanced
economies coming from rising nonfuel import
prices. However, such risks would clearly be
alleviated in the event of a significant global
slowdown.
Another concern is that labor market pressures could intensify in the advanced economies
if a combination of sluggish productivity and
rising compensation led to an acceleration of
unit labor costs. So far in the present cycle,
such concerns have been focused on the United
States—which is further along the cycle and
where productivity growth has come down to its
slowest pace since the early 1990s (Figure 1.12).
While much of this slowdown is likely to be cyclical, part of the recent performance may reflect
some moderation in the burst of productivity
growth from the application of new information technologies from the 1990s onward. At the
same time, employee compensation has risen.
Thus, overall unit labor costs have accelerated,
although not yet to the point of posing a serious threat, given that U.S. growth is likely to
remain moderate and that high corporate profit
margins provide firms some leeway to limit
feed-through of rising costs to price increases. In
the euro area and Japan, meanwhile, unit labor
costs have been contained, because productivity
performance has been favorable, particularly in
the euro area, and compensation has shown few
signs of acceleration, despite declines in unemployment rates to cyclical lows. Thus, concerns
about labor cost pressures at this point are still
largely forward looking, related to the possibility of accelerating wage growth if labor markets
continue to tighten.

Tight Oil Markets
Global oil markets remain very tight, and
with spare capacity still limited, supply shocks
or heightened geopolitical concerns could

erating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and of
capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector.

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

lead to further price spikes that could quickly
translate into higher headline inflation (see
Appendix 1.1). The subsequent impact on
output may be more subdued than in the 1970s,
because economies are less energy intensive
and greater monetary policy credibility has
anchored inflation expectations more securely
(see discussion in Box 1.1 of the April 2007
World Economic Outlook). Thus far, the global
economy has been able to absorb the sustained
run-up in oil prices over the past five years without major impact. Nevertheless, while OPEC’s
capacity has expanded (in particular in Saudi
Arabia) and the Gulf states are embarking
on massive investments, the overall supply
response to the recent higher level of prices
has been sluggish so far, in part because rising
demand has pushed up the price of investment
in new capacity in the oil sector and because
of uncertainties about the investment climate
in certain oil producers. Moreover, demand for
oil products has continued to rise, especially in
fast-growing emerging market countries, and
shortages of refining capacity are an increasing constraint. Thus, the dip in oil prices in
the second half of 2006 proved temporary,
and prices rose to new highs by the summer
of 2007. At this point, markets are expecting
that prices will remain around their current
level through the end of 2008, but uncertainty
remains high, and options prices suggest a 1 in
6 chance of prices rising above $95 a barrel over
this period.

Figure 1.11. Measures of the Output Gap and
Capacity Pressures1
Various measures of the output gap suggest that the gap has been closing in both
advanced and emerging market economies. Another indicator of supply pressures
is that commodity prices have been sustained at high levels.

Persistent large global imbalances remain a
worrisome downside risk for the global economy. The U.S. current account deficit is projected to decline slightly to 5½ percent of GDP
this year and next, as it benefits from recent
real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar and
a more balanced pattern for global demand
growth. Nevertheless, assuming no further
changes in real effective exchange rates and
with current policies, the U.S. deficit would still
remain close to this level in 2012—equivalent

to 1.5 percent of global GDP (Figure 1.13). The
current account surpluses of the oil exporters
are projected to come down as these countries
ramp up spending. However, China’s current
account surplus has widened sharply in recent
quarters, and it is now projected at 12 percent
of GDP in 2008 and to remain at a high level
through the medium term. Accordingly, emerging Asia’s projected current account surplus
in 2012 has been marked up to 1¼ percent of
global GDP.
Persistent large imbalances raise two principal
concerns. First, the necessary financing flows for
the U.S. current account deficits may become
less easily obtained, triggering a disorderly
adjustment—a low-probability but high-cost
event. Second, sustained large trade imbalances
could prompt rising protectionist pressures.
One open question at this point is how recent
financial market developments have affected
risks of a disorderly adjustment. In recent years,
the U.S. economy has benefited from large capital inflows, attracted by the apparent sophistication and security offered by the U.S. financial
system, as well as the underlying strength of the
U.S. economy itself. Under an “orderly adjustment,” the U.S. current account deficit would
be lowered gradually through a combination of
demand rebalancing and further exchange rate
movements, and would be smoothly financed.
However, investors in the United States have
been earning lower returns on their assets than
elsewhere in recent years—as a result of both
dollar depreciation and slower rates of asset
price appreciation than in other markets. As a
consequence, the composition of inward flows to
the United States had shifted over time toward
higher-return, higher-risk vehicles.3 During
recent market turmoil, foreign investors presumably shifted away from collateralized debt obligations, and back toward more secure and more
liquid U.S. government bonds. What remains

-6

07:
Q2

3It is noteworthy that in recent quarters, a high share
of net capital flows to the United States have come from
official sources. Some official investors are also adopting
more aggressive investment strategies, such as shifting
reserves into sovereign wealth funds.

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

to be seen are the longer-term consequences of
recent events. One possibility is that disillusion
with asset-backed credit structures could prompt
a more sustained shift in investor preferences
away from U.S. assets, which would raise risks of
a disorderly unwinding of imbalances.
A separate concern is that persistently large
trade imbalances could be a source of protectionist pressures, particularly where domestic
industry does not adjust successfully in the face
of import competition, contributing to a sense
that the growth benefits of an open economy
are not being adequately shared among different social groups. Protectionist sentiment could
be exacerbated by perceptions of unfair use of
exchange rate policy for competitive advantage.
The recent lack of progress with negotiations
on the Doha Round and increasing recourse
to a proliferation of bilateral trade treaties
are an indication of an increased focus on
national interest on the trade front. Pressures
for increased trade restrictions or retaliatory
measures have so far been largely resisted, but
protectionist risks associated with large trade
imbalances would be substantially increased in
the context of a global slowdown with rising
levels of unemployment.
Against this background, some welcome
progress has been made toward developing a
joint approach toward global imbalances. The
Multilateral Consultation held by the IMF represents the first use of an innovative approach to
addressing systemic challenges. It has provided
a forum for discussion with key countries to
strengthen mutual understanding of the issues
and to reaffirm support for the International
Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC)
Strategy, and for each country to indicate specific policies consistent with the Strategy that
together should allow for a substantial reduction
in imbalances in the years ahead (see Box 1.3).

Figure 1.13. Current Account Balances
and Net Foreign Assets
(Percent of world GDP)
The U.S. current account deficit is projected to come down only slowly relative to
world output and still be close to 1.5 percent of global GDP in 2012. This trajectory
implies a continuing buildup in U.S. net foreign liabilities, with the main counterpart
being a steady rise in net assets of emerging Asia.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.3. Multilateral Consultation on Global Imbalances
What Was the Multilateral Consultation and Why
Was It Needed?
On June 5, 2006, the IMF initiated its firstever Multilateral Consultation (MC)—a new
tool of multilateral surveillance—with a focus
on addressing global current account imbalances in a manner supportive of global growth.
Five countries or regions agreed to participate—
China, the euro area, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and
the United States. This group of participants
was chosen either because they were a direct
party to the existing imbalances (through
their current account deficits or surpluses) or
because they represented a very large share of
global output and could contribute to sustaining world growth as demand and saving patterns
adjusted.
The central issue at hand was that, despite
widespread agreement on which policies were
needed to help support a global rebalancing process—as communicated in the IMF’s
International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Strategy,1 progress in implementing policies was relatively slow, and imbalances
remained wide. This suggested the need to
develop new avenues for achieving the goal.
Thus, a central objective of the first MC was to
facilitate a dialogue and, ultimately, foster policy
actions by participants that could make a significant contribution toward global rebalancing—

Note: The main authors of this box are Hamid
Faruqee and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti.
1Since April 2004, the IMFC has set out in each
Communiqué its views on the measures needed to
foster an orderly resolution of global imbalances—the
so-called IMFC Strategy. While the IMFC Strategy has
evolved somewhat over time, reflecting the changing
nature of the imbalances, in September 2006, the
Committee called for steps to boost national saving
in the United States, including fiscal consolidation;
further progress on growth-enhancing reforms in
Europe; further structural reforms, including fiscal
consolidation, in Japan; reforms to boost domestic
demand in emerging Asia, together with greater
exchange rate flexibility in a number of surplus
countries; and increased spending consistent with
absorptive capacity and macroeconomic stability in
oil-producing countries.

24

that is, sustaining global growth while reducing
imbalances—and reducing the associated risks
of a disorderly adjustment.
To this end, the Consultation began with
bilateral discussions with senior policymakers from each of the participant countries or
regions, followed by joint meetings of senior
officials from all participating countries or
regions with IMF staff. The open and constructive consultations contributed to an improved
understanding of the issues and of each other’s
positions. Participants reaffirmed that reducing
global imbalances was a multilateral challenge,
and that resolving them in a manner compatible
with sustained growth was a shared responsibility. They also stressed that an orderly unwinding
of imbalances was in the interest of the world
economy more generally, because, among other
reasons, sustained imbalances could add to
protectionist pressures.
What Did the MC Deliver?
During the Consultation, the participants
reiterated their support for the IMFC Strategy
to reduce imbalances through policies that were
in each individual country’s interest as well as
desirable from a multilateral perspective. The
Consultation culminated with the publication of
policy plans by each participant, which included
substantive steps in all key areas of the IMFC
Strategy.2 When implemented, these policy
plans could significantly reduce global risks.
The agreement to publish these plans also provided a clear roadmap to assess progress toward
policy implementation. In its April 2007 Communiqué,3 the IMFC welcomed the report from
the group, noting that the policy plans set out
by the participants represented further progress
in the implementation of the IMFC Strategy.

THE BASELINE OUTLOOK HAS BEEN MARKED DOWN MODERATELY—AND DOWNSIDE RISKS HAVE INTENSIFIED

The Executive Board’s review of the experience
with the process in July 2007 reached a similar
assessment.4
Will It Make a Difference?
While a precise quantification of the effects of
the proposed policy package on global imbalances is difficult, IMF staff estimates based on
simulations from the Global Economic Model5
and other empirical evidence suggest that, when
fully implemented, the package could reduce
the U.S. current account deficit by 1–1¾ percent of GDP over the medium term, and hence
limit the accumulation of U.S. external liabilities. Surpluses would decline correspondingly
elsewhere, and particularly in China and Saudi
Arabia. For the purpose of these calculations,
IMF staff assumed an increase in exchange rate
flexibility in China, with a real appreciation
consistent with current market expectations as
embedded in forward rates and Consensus Forecasts, as well as financial market reforms; the
implementation of growth-enhancing structural
reforms in the euro area and Japan; a substantial increase in investment in line with policy
plans in Saudi Arabia; and a fiscal adjustment of
about 2 percent of GDP (consistent with the target of a balanced federal budget) and measures
to stimulate private saving in the United States.
It should be stressed, however, that an orderly
adjustment in global imbalances accompanied
by sustained growth does not depend solely on
the participants’ policies. In particular,
• Other countries have an important part to play.
Higher expenditures by other oil exporters,
together with greater exchange rate flexibility and higher investment in other parts of
emerging Asia, could reduce the U.S. current
account deficit by a further ¼–½ percent of
4See IMF, “IMF Executive Board Discusses Multilateral Consultation on Global Imbalances,” Public
Information Notice No. 07/97, August 7, 2007.
5The Global Fiscal Model was used to calibrate
the effects of fiscal policy on the current account.

September 2005 World Economic Outlook; and Box 1.3
in the September 2006 World Economic Outlook.

GDP, matched by reduced surpluses in these
regions, assuming broadly comparable efforts
to those by MC participants.
• Changes in private sector balances can also be
expected to play a key role in reducing current
account imbalances, including through an
increase in household savings in the United
States and strengthened private domestic
demand in surplus countries. Although the
size of this adjustment could be significant,
its pace is uncertain, not least because it
depends on variables that are difficult to
forecast—such as house prices in the United
States. These uncertainties, as well as other
imponderables such as oil prices, reinforce
the case for early public policy adjustment,
especially since this is also consistent with the
domestic interests of the countries concerned.
Where Do We Go from Here?
The key now is implementation. Since the
consultation discussions and the report, each
participant has made some progress toward
implementing its policy intentions, but much
remains to be done. Specifically,
• In the United States, the federal deficit has
narrowed more rapidly than expected, and
Congress has adopted the administration’s
balanced budget objective by FY2012. But
consensus has not emerged on how to achieve
this objective while providing adequately for
war funding and the alternative minimum
tax relief, and there are political obstacles to
deeper entitlement reform.
• In China, the renminbi has appreciated in
real effective terms by about 6 percent over
the past year, and the currency band for
daily exchange rate fluctuations against the
dollar has been widened from 0.3 percent
to 0.5 percent. However, China’s current
account surplus has widened further, reflecting continued strong export performance.
More rapid appreciation of the renminbi
would help provide the right price signals for
investment and, together with additional steps
toward rebalancing domestic demand, help
to contain China’s current account surpluses

25

CHAPTER 1

Box 1.3 (concluded)
over time. At the same time, it would provide
greater scope for monetary policy to focus on
slowing lending and investment growth.
• In the euro area, some progress is being made
with respect to the structural reform agenda,
including improving the efficiency of clearing and settlements in EU financial markets. Looking forward, raising competition,
productivity, and growth will require further
reforms in product, labor, and financial
markets—such as, for example, an effective
implementation of the Services Directive in
all member states.
• In Japan, recent progress on the structural
reform agenda includes advances on job
placement and training and on liberalization of foreign direct investment inflows.
Looking forward, further action is needed
to strengthen competition and thereby raise
productivity, particularly in the nontradables
sectors.
• In Saudi Arabia, public spending in 2007 was
increased in three key areas—oil sector invest-

market conditions having important consequences for the range of other domestic and
external risk factors. In principle, financial disturbances—even large ones such as the recent
credit market turmoil—could be absorbed
without major consequences for global activity, provided markets stabilize, prices adjust
in an orderly way, and losses are recognized.
Indeed, some previous episodes of financial
market dislocation—prominently the stock
market drop in 1987 and the events in 1998
surrounding the collapse of LTCM and the
Russian default—have had only a limited and
temporary effect on global activity. Nevertheless, the interaction between a deterioration in
financial conditions with other vulnerabilities
in advanced and emerging market economies
could lead to a deeper and more prolonged
slowdown in global activity than envisaged in
the baseline projections. Such an episode would
have more in common with the lengthy global

26

ment, social projects, and infrastructure—as
planned. Massive public-private partnershipbased investment programs are also continuing, although there is still a long way to go to
meet the medium-term targets.
Thus, the Multilateral Consultation on
Global Imbalances represents the first use of
an innovative approach to addressing systemic
challenges. Working with the endorsement of
the IMF’s global membership, a relevant subset
of IMF members—with the participation of IMF
staff and management—conducted a series of
focused, constructive, and confidential discussions. The result was a set of mutually consistent
policy plans that have been welcomed by the
IMF. With the agreement of the participants in
the Consultation, the implementation of these
policy plans will be the subject of regular IMF
surveillance. According to IMF staff analysis,
these plans will—as implemented—make a
significant contribution toward the achievement
of the goals of the IMFC Strategy of sustaining
global growth while reducing imbalances.

slowdown following the 2000 equity market
crash, where a correction in equity market
valuations interacted with a reassessment of the
returns to high-tech investment not just in the
United States but also in Europe and Asia. In
present circumstances, the core vulnerability
would seem to be the possibility that a tightening of credit constraints could interact with the
housing market corrections in the United States
and other countries where house prices have
risen rapidly in recent years.
Figure 1.14 shows the results of a macroeconomic modeling exercise aimed at simulating the impact of a financial shock originating
in the United States on three key counterparts
of the global economy: the United States, other
advanced economies, and emerging market
countries. With a temporary shock—which starts
to be reversed after two quarters—the impact on
GDP would be relatively small, and largely confined to the United States itself. With a sustained

Figure 1.14. Simulated Effect of a Financial Disturbance on the Global Economy
(Deviation from baseline)
A persistent large financial disturbance centered on the United States (involving a 10 percent decline in house prices, a 10 percent
drop in equity prices, and a 50 basis point widening in the term premium, all relative to baseline) would have a substantial adverse
impact on global activity, with spillovers from the U.S. economy through trade and financial channels, including by inducing
corrections in housing markets, around the world. Monetary policy easing would help to cushion the downward impact. By contrast,
a disturbance of the same initial magnitude that was quickly reversed would have a much smaller macroeconomic impact.

Figure 1.15. Private Capital Flows to Emerging Markets
(Billions of U.S. dollars)
Gross private flows to emerging markets have risen rapidly in recent years, while net
flows have been sustained at historically high levels. Although foreign direct
investment has risen, portfolio flows and other investment flows have risen more
steeply, especially to emerging Asia, emerging Europe, and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).

shock—lasting eight quarters—the impact on
output in the United States would be much
greater, however, as wealth effects start to kick
in and depress consumption, and the Federal
Reserve would be prompted to cut interest rates
aggressively to stabilize output and inflation.
Moreover, the spillover effects on other countries are substantially larger—housing markets
around the world would weaken on top of the
impact of slower trade growth, weaker equity
prices, and higher risk premiums. This scenario
is consistent with the finding in the April 2007
World Economic Outlook that spillovers are more
than proportionately greater in the context of
a downturn than in a mild slowdown in activity. With this combination of events, the global
economy could slow sharply.

Living with Heavy Foreign
Exchange Inflows
Over the past year, many emerging market
and developing countries have experienced
historically high levels of net foreign exchange
inflows, through both current and capital
accounts. The recent rise in private capital flows
to emerging markets has been particularly dramatic. As shown in Figure 1.15, in dollar terms,
gross flows have risen sharply in the past few
years—to levels twice as high as at the previous
peak in 1996, just before the Asian crisis. In
part, the gross flow number reflects the continuing process of cross-border financial diversification. The rise in net flows to emerging markets
has been somewhat less steep, but nevertheless
capital has flown at record levels over 2005–06,
picked up further in the first half of 2007, and
is projected to be maintained at high levels in
the aggregate, notwithstanding recent financial
market turbulence.
An abundance of foreign exchange resources
provides an enormous opportunity for boosting long-term growth if used prudently. However, countries also face substantial short-term
macroeconomic challenges in managing heavy
foreign exchange inflows. If exchange rate
flexibility is limited, a surge in net foreign

LIVING WITH HEAVY FOREIGN EXCHANGE INFLOWS

exchange inflows can quickly generate rapid
credit growth, strong increases in domestic asset
prices, an overheated economy, and eventual
pressure on inflation. Allowing the exchange
rate to appreciate provides a greater degree of
monetary control, but also can lead to a loss of
competitiveness and limit export opportunities.
There is also the related challenge of avoiding a
buildup in vulnerabilities to a sudden reversal of
the inflows—a concern underlined by the recent
turbulence in global financial markets.
While these challenges are general ones,
different groups of countries are facing different external and domestic situations, affecting
policy trade-offs (Figure 1.16). Across a variety
of different situations, how have countries
responded and what lessons can be learned
from their experience? Chapter 3 of this report
investigates countries’ experiences with surges
in capital flows since the late 1980s. One
general finding in Chapter 3 is that in recent
years, countries have shifted to more flexible exchange rate regimes and allowed more
upward movement in exchange rates, although
resistance to appreciation through intervention remains generally high. Thus, significant
exchange rate appreciations have occurred both
in inflation targeters in Latin America (Brazil,
Chile, and Colombia) and in emerging Asian
countries (India, Korea, and Thailand are good
examples). Allowing more exchange rate flexibility has the advantages of increasing direct
control over the monetary base, and thus credit
growth, and helping reduce one-way bets and
thus incentives for carry trade capital inflows to
arbitrage interest rate differentials. However, in
the face of very strong capital inflows, countries
have also continued to intervene heavily, building up reserves in an attempt to limit the extent
of real exchange rate appreciation, although the
results obtained in Chapter 3 suggest that such
intervention has not generally been successful
over extended periods.
One strong conclusion from the experience
reviewed in Chapter 3 is that fiscal restraint in
the face of strong capital inflows helps reduce
pressures on the real exchange rate and the

Figure 1.16. Current and Capital Account Flows to
Selected Emerging Market and Developing Countries
(Percent of GDP)
The buildup in reserves in most Asian emerging markets and Middle East
oil-exporting countries has been driven mainly by large current account surpluses
(India being an exception). In emerging Europe, large net capital inflows have
financed substantial current account deficits.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

risk of a hard landing when the inflows slow
or reverse. There are well-known limits to the
use of discretionary fiscal policy for fine-tuning
purposes that apply particularly in this context, because capital flows are volatile, hard to
predict, and have an uncertain macroeconomic
impact, while frequent short-term modification to fiscal policy instruments would reduce
transparency and predictability. That said,
the evidence suggests that countries facing
overheating pressures in the context of strong
output growth and capital inflows would benefit
from greater fiscal restraint, by saving a larger
share of buoyant revenues, rather than allowing
public spending to soar or prematurely cutting taxes. This is a lesson that is particularly
relevant for countries in emerging Europe and
the CIS with large current account deficits,
where vulnerabilities are particularly salient,
and where government spending has grown
rapidly.
Moving beyond macroeconomic policy instruments, a number of countries have imposed
measures to restrict or discourage capital
inflows. Notably, Chile in the 1990s and, more
recently, Argentina (since 2005), Thailand
(since 2006), and Colombia (since May 2007)
have set unremunerated reserve requirements
on certain types of capital inflows, effectively
applying a tax on short-term inflows. Other
countries, such as Brazil, Kazakhstan, and
Korea, have recently introduced other specific
measures aimed at curbing short-term inflows
through the banking system, and India has
recently placed new restrictions on external
commercial borrowing. Experience suggests
that such measures tend to have a diminishing
impact over time, as ways are found to elude
the controls, and can, if sustained, also have
negative consequences for financial system
development.4 Consistent with this assessment,
4In Thailand, the controls were initially set very
broadly, including to apply to FDI-related inflows; had a
strong negative impact on equity and currency markets;
and were quickly narrowed in scope. In Argentina and
Colombia, the requirements were set more narrowly and
seem to have had a limited impact.

30

Chapter 3 finds that capital controls have not
had much impact on the macroeconomic outcomes from capital inflows.
Alternatively, liberalization of restrictions on
capital outflows can help ease foreign exchange
market pressures while also encouraging
greater cross-border portfolio diversification
for domestic investors and integration with
international markets. East Asian countries have
been most successful in following this approach,
as evidenced by the high and rising capital outflows from these countries, and similar reforms
have continued over the past year across a
wide spectrum of countries, including Brazil,
China, Colombia, India, Malaysia, Morocco,
Peru, and Thailand. However, the timing and
magnitude of the impact of such reforms is
hard to quantify with any precision, qualifying their value for short-term macroeconomic
management.
A final set of approaches seeks to offset
the domestic side effects of capital inflows.
First, countries have tightened regulatory and
supervisory guidelines related to bank lending, to limit the risk of increasing balance sheet
vulnerabilities. Second, countries have used
tax and other measures to cool down domestic
equity and property markets, such as China’s
recent increase in stamp duty on stock market
transactions and Singapore’s increased property
redevelopment charge. Third, countries have
used fiscal incentives to offset some of the implications of exchange rate appreciation, such as
Brazil’s introduction of import tariffs on certain
sectors. Care must be taken in using such fiscal
measures to make sure that they do not have
adverse microeconomic or political economy
consequences. A more productive approach
would be to advance initiatives to increase an
economy’s ability to adapt to exchange rate
movements, including, for example, labor market reforms and improvements in the business
environment.
Overall, recent experience and the findings of Chapter 3 are consistent with the view
that there is no single universal formula for
dealing with the short-term macroeconomic

SUSTAINING ROBUST GROWTH

consequences of heavy foreign exchange
inflows. Instead, countries need to take a
pragmatic approach, finding an appropriate
blend of measures suited to their particular
circumstances and longer-term goals. So far,
most countries have been largely successful in
averting exchange rate appreciations that leave
exchange rates substantially overvalued, but
overheating concerns are a continuing issue.
A number of countries would find monetary
control and inflation objectives easier to achieve
by allowing somewhat more flexible exchange
rates. There would also seem to be scope for
more restrained fiscal policy approaches, saving
rather than spending a larger portion of strong
revenue growth; for further steps toward liberalization of capital account outflows; and for
tighter regulatory and prudential frameworks to
limit possible balance sheet vulnerabilities from
too rapid growth of domestic credit.

The current global expansion has been the
period of strongest growth since the early 1970s
(Figure 1.17). The recent experience is also
remarkable in other ways. First, with the rapid
growth of world trade, openness has risen by
more than 10 percentage points since 2001, and
financial openness has also risen rapidly. Second, emerging market and developing countries
now account for a high share of growth: more
than /3 compared with about ½ in the 1990s.
Third, the success is not being enjoyed only by
a few dynamic countries; in fact, most countries
and regions are doing well by their own past
standards, as reflected in the decline in the
dispersion of growth rates relative to trend. And,
fourth, the volatility of growth has declined
substantially.
Chapter 5 of this report provides a longerterm perspective on the current expansion, asking how much of the changing dynamics of the
global business cycle reflects good policies and
how much is good luck. It presents evidence
that a number of structural changes—including
higher-quality monetary policy, reduced fiscal

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

policy volatility, improved institutions, and
greater financial development—imply that business cycles are likely to be of longer duration
and lesser magnitude than in the past.
However, the chapter warns that the business
cycle is by no means dead, and concludes on a
cautionary note that the present period shares
a number of characteristics with the 1960s
and early 1970s—a period of strong sustained
global growth but followed by a period of
greater turbulence punctuated by the collapse
of the prevailing monetary policy anchor (the
Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates),
large supply shocks, and inflationary surges.
Recent increased financial market volatility
has underlined concerns that benign conditions may not be sustained. But, going beyond
such considerations, there are also a number of deeper-rooted concerns, which, if not
adequately addressed, could pose serious challenges to the continued success of the current
expansion.
First, while most countries are doing well at
the aggregate level, there are rising concerns
about the distribution of the gains. Rapid technological progress and continuing globalization
of trade and finance have been enormously
growth enhancing and have helped reduce poverty, but they have also contributed to increasing concentrations of income and wealth, both
in the advanced economies and the emerging
market and developing countries. Owners of
capital and of scarce skills have been amply
rewarded, but less-skilled workers and those with
limited access to jobs or finance have seen more
limited gains. Rising inequality has already led
to resistance to globalization and contributed
to recent setbacks in the process of multilateral trade liberalization, but the protectionist
backlash could become yet more virulent. And
beyond welfare and political economy concerns,
inequality also has real economic costs, because
it implies that human resources are not being
productively used, as a high share of the world’s
population continues to have inadequate access
to education, health care, and economic and
financial opportunities.

32

Chapter 4 of this report looks in more detail
at the relationship between globalization and
income inequality. It finds that technological
progress is by far the largest factor behind rising
inequality, because of the associated income
gains to highly skilled workers. Globalization has
offsetting effects on income distribution: trade,
and particularly exports by developing countries,
has in fact tended to reduce inequality, whereas
financial globalization, including foreign direct
investment, has increased inequality, in part
because it is closely related to the diffusion of
new technologies. These results yield a number
of policy lessons, including the importance for
developing countries to achieve their export
potential, particularly in agriculture; the value
of extending access to education and financial
resources to ensure that lower-income groups
have the skills and resources needed to benefit
from opportunities created by new technologies
and globalization; and the need to ensure adequate safety nets for groups adversely affected by
the new environment.
A second possible trend that would affect
growth dynamics is that over time global savings
may well become more scarce, putting upward
pressure on real interest rates. In recent years,
the global expansion has been supported by the
ready availability of external financing at relatively low interest rates. In part, this reflected
very easy monetary policy in the advanced
economies after the 2000–01 downturn to
head off deflationary concerns, but this source
of liquidity has been progressively tightened
(Box 1.4). Abundant credit has also been
related to financial market innovations that have
improved liquidity and the distribution of risk,
which, notwithstanding recent market volatility,
should provide permanent gains. A third factor
is the pattern of global saving and investment,
which created what Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke has called a “savings glut” but is
perhaps more accurately characterized as low
rates of investment (outside China) and a very
high rate of saving in China.
However, the global pattern of saving and
investment is likely to shift over time. Surpluses

POLICY CHALLENGES

of the oil-exporting countries are projected
to decline quite rapidly as they increase their
absorption to match the earnings potential
implied by higher export price trajectories. In
the advanced economies and in some middleincome countries too, population aging will
tend to increase consumption rates as rising
shares of the population retire from the labor
force. In China, in particular, consumption
rates are likely to rise substantially from current low levels (only 35 percent of GDP), as
precautionary savings are reduced and the
financial system becomes better adapted to
providing credit to households, supported by
government policies to rebalance domestic
demand and in a context in which the population is aging fast.
Third, more resources may be required for
investment and for addressing climate change.
Current rapid growth has been achieved with
relatively low rates of global investment, driven
by productivity gains from trade and financial
globalization and application of new information technologies. However, the impetus
from globalization and new technology may
dwindle, especially if distributional issues
are not adequately addressed. Moreover, the
need to reduce the rate of global warming is
increasingly accepted, which will require new
investments to control carbon emissions, for
example, in power generation. Recent estimates
suggest that mitigation efforts could cost about
1 percent of GDP. Appendix 1.2 looks in more
detail at the macroeconomic consequences of
climate change and the policy challenges it
generates.
Overall, then, a number of medium-term
trends may contribute to slowing productivity, rising interest rates, and conditions less
conducive to rapid global growth. Financing
may become less readily available, and the
global economy may become more susceptible
to financial reversals and crises. One large
question mark in such a context would be the
continuing ability of the United States to fund
a large current account deficit at a reasonable
cost, particularly as surpluses come down in

other countries and as financial systems elsewhere develop and are better able to compete
in terms of scarcity, liquidity, and range of
products. Emerging market and developing
countries that have become reliant on external
savings—such as those in emerging Europe—
could also find themselves facing tighter external financial constraints.

Policy Challenges
Policymakers around the world face the
immediate challenge of safeguarding the
continued expansion of activity in the face of
risks posed by recent turbulent global financial
conditions, while remaining alert to inflation
pressures. At the same time, greater progress is
needed to tackle the deeper obstacles to continued global prosperity.
After a period of tightening that has brought
monetary stances to close to or above neutral in
most advanced economies, central banks have
had to address the recent dramatic drying up of
market liquidity and associated financial strains.
They have acted as needed to ensure the orderly
functioning of financial markets while continuing to base decisions on the monetary policy
stance on judgments about economic fundamentals. The concern is to avoid perceptions
that central banks would automatically respond
to financial distress by taking actions to curtail
losses, which could raise moral hazard, reduce
credit discipline, and impart an inflationary bias
to policy setting.
Looking forward, policy choices will be contingent on the consequences of recent volatility
becoming clearer. In the United States, signs
that growth was likely to continue below trend
would justify further interest rate reductions,
provided that inflation remains contained. In
the euro area, monetary policy can stay on hold
over the near term, reflecting the downside
risks to growth and inflation from financial
market turmoil. However, as these risks dissipate, further tightening eventually may be
required. In the event of a more protracted
slowdown, an easing of monetary policy would

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.4. What Is Global Liquidity?
In recent years, a great deal of attention has
been paid to the concept of liquidity. Declines
in risk premiums across various asset classes;
buoyant prices in equity, bond, and real estate
markets; low long-term real interest rates; and
rising cross-border flows of capital have been
interpreted as signs of “excess liquidity” in the
global economy. At the same time, however,
major central banks around the world have been
in a tightening mode for some time. And in midAugust, liquidity dried up suddenly in several
money markets and spreads on a number of
risky asset classes widened markedly, prompting
a significant injection of funds by central banks
to stabilize short-term interest rates. What definition of liquidity can reconcile these facts?
The term excess liquidity is rarely well defined.
In fact multiple definitions of liquidity, seldom
carefully distinguished, are often used. One definition associates excess liquidity with low interest
rates or easy borrowing conditions created by an
unusually accommodative monetary policy stance
across major central banks. Another focuses on
market liquidity, associated with structural trends
toward financial innovation, deepening, and integration. This box assesses recent trends in simple
indicators of global liquidity related to these
alternative notions of liquidity and considers
how far these are drivers of the global decline
in risk premium.

Measures of the Global Monetary Policy Stance
A simple proxy of the monetary policy stance
is given by the evolution of real policy rates. A
monetary policy stance can be termed strongly
accommodative if real policy rates are negative.
The first figure depicts the evolution of real
policy rates for the euro area, Japan, and the
United States. The U.S. monetary policy stance
was indeed strongly accommodative between
2003:Q1 and 2005:Q3, but rates are now close
to neutral. Moreover, even during the expansionary phase, the degree of accommodation
was less than that observed in the late 1970s and

early 1980s. A similar, albeit less pronounced,
pattern characterizes the monetary policy stance
of the European Central Bank (ECB) since
1999. In Japan, a strongly accommodative monetary policy stance shows up only in 1997–98.
Another proxy measure of monetary policy
stance, also shown in the first figure, is the deviation of a nominal short-term interest rate from
a “Taylor rate,” obtained by estimating a Taylor
rule, or monetary reaction function that relates
the policy interest rate to the inflation rate and
the economy’s cyclical position. A short-term
nominal interest rate that is lower than the
Taylor rate can be seen as reflecting aggressive monetary accommodation.1 Overall, this
measure provides very similar results to the real
policy rate, showing aggressive monetary accommodation between 2002 and end-2006 in the
United States and—to a lesser extent—Europe.
More recently, however, rates have moved back
in line with those implied by the Taylor rule as a
result of policy tightening.
An alternative to interest rate measures of the
global monetary policy stance is a quantitative
measure. A global monetary aggregate based on
the growth of base money in the major advanced
economies, shown in the bottom panel of the
first figure, generally confirms monetary accommodation in the early 2000s, which exceeded
in scope even that of the 1970s. The expansion
peaked in 2002–04, but it has since reversed. This
index is sometimes broadened by adding on the
global accumulation of international reserves,
the latter being a proxy for monetary expansion
by central banks of countries with external surpluses, many of them emerging markets. Using
this measure, “global liquidity” shows elevated
growth rates until very recently. However, this
measure mixes different sorts of indicators, and
it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on it.
1The Taylor rate depends positively on (1) the
neutral real rate of interest, which, in turn, is a
function of (time-varying) potential output growth,
(2) the deviation of consumer price inflation from the
inflation target, and (3) the output gap. For the exact
parameterization of the index, see Chapter 2 of the
September 2004 World Economic Outlook.

Notwithstanding the reversion to a neutral
monetary policy stance in the United States and
the euro area, real long-term interest rates on
government securities in advanced economies
have remained low compared with their historical average. One factor that is likely to have
affected long-term interest rates is the global
pattern of saving and investment. In particular, the abundance of global savings relative to
investment may have contributed to, among
other things, an increase in demand for longerterm securities. In this context, large current
account surpluses in oil-exporting and Asian
countries and the associated capital outflows
may have also contributed to the decline of
long-term interest rates.2
Financial Market Liquidity
The monetary policy measures discussed so
far do not capture the implications for market
liquidity of the rapid financial deepening and
innovation that has characterized global financial markets in the past decade.3
Standard monetary and finance theory
views liquidity as an attribute of an asset. The
degree of liquidity of an asset is higher the
lower the expected costs incurred in converting it into cash—by definition the most liquid
asset—at any point in time. Liquidation costs
can be reduced by borrowing to spread asset
sales over time, but the ability to borrow and
its cost will depend on the extent to which
other market participants are able and willing
to provide financing.4 This suggests that the

simple illustration of this is provided by a decomposition of changes in M2/GDP between changes
in the ratio of liquid assets to total assets in the
economy—the ratio of M2 to an economy’s total
financial assets—and the ratio of total financial assets to
GDP, as an indicator of financial deepening. Data over
the past decade show that the aggregate liquidity ratio
has decreased whereas financial deepening has increased.
4This ability can be temporarily enhanced by central
banks’ money injections. However, money injections
do not as such increase the liquidity of the market as
defined, but just increase the ability of market participants to obtain funding to carry out and settle certain
transactions.
3A

Box 1.4 (concluded)
degree of liquidity of an asset cannot be defined
independently from the liquidity of its market.
Moreover, market liquidity can dry up rapidly
as a result of market participants’ reassessment
of counterparty risk. This point is underscored
by recent events when major central banks have
temporarily injected large amounts of funds to
support liquidity in the interbank market.
One important point to stress is that the risk
premium of an asset incorporates a liquidity premium.
The degree of liquidity of a tradable asset has
value and therefore carries a price. Thus, higher
market liquidity can reduce the risk associated
with a given asset portfolio (Longstaff, 2001).
An important implication of this is that a larger
portion of investors’ wealth may be invested in
“risky” assets, even though risk tolerance has not
changed.
Three indicators of a financial-markets-based
concept of liquidity are illustrated in the second
figure.5 The first such indicator is the yield
differential between less frequently traded (offthe-run) and more frequently traded (on-therun) three-month U.S. treasury bonds, which
is a proxy measure of the liquidity premium in
the short-term U.S. government bond market.
The second indicator is based on a return-tovolume ratio6 introduced by Amihud (2002),
which captures two dimensions of market
liquidity—depth or the volume of trades (order
flows) that can be executed without significantly
affecting prices and resiliency or the speed at
which price fluctuations resulting from trading
dissipate. Specifically, it tracks the liquidity of
global equity markets—measured by a marketcapitalization-weighted average of the inverse of
the daily return-to-volume ratios of equity markets in advanced economies and emerging market countries. As constructed, an increase in this
indicator denotes improved liquidity. The third

5In its April 2007 Financial Stability Report, the Bank
of England constructs a similar indicator relevant to
the market in which U.K. banks are active.
6The return-to-volume ratio is given by the daily
absolute return on the equity market divided by the
ratio of traded volume over market capitalization.

indicator tracks the liquidity of global bond
markets—measured by a version of the so-called
market efficiency ratio (MEC) introduced by
Hasbrouck and Schwartz (1988), which equals
the ratio of volatility of bond market returns
for a five-day horizon divided by the volatility
of daily returns multiplied by the length of the
horizon (five days).7 This indicator should be
closer to 1 in more resilient markets, because
in such markets the short-term volatility due
to price discovery, measured in the denominator, dissipates quickly, making the volatility of
returns in a buy-and-hold strategy for a given
investment horizon comparable with the dailyreturn volatility multiplied by the length of the
horizon.
As shown in the second figure, liquidity in
the U.S. Treasury market has risen sharply
since the early 1980s. The liquidity of global
equity markets has also increased substantially
since the mid-1990s, with the rise in emerging
market economies being particularly impressive.
Likewise, liquidity in global bond markets has
also risen substantially, as seen by the increasing
closeness of the MEC indicator to unity both
from below and from above.
All three of these market liquidity indicators exhibit cycles, but the cycle is only weakly
related to movements in real policy rates and is
unrelated to quantitative measures of the global
monetary policy stance, suggesting that secular
factors underlie improvements in global market
liquidity.8 Overall, this evidence is strongly
7The MEC has been computed for a global bond
market return index, the JPMorgan Global (All
Maturities) Bond Index.
8An estimate of the cycle of the liquidity premium
in the short-term U.S. government bond market and
of global equity and bond market liquidity indicators
is obtained by filtering daily data at standard business
cycle frequencies using a Hodrick-Prescott filter.
Estimates of a vector autoregression (VAR) with global
equity and bond market liquidity indicators and
U.S. real policy rates yield a negative but statistically
insignificant relationship between current U.S. real
policy rates and future market liquidity, while there
is no such relationship when quantitative measures
of the monetary policy stance replace U.S. real policy

suggestive of an implied historical decrease in
liquidity premiums, likely contributing to the
overall decline in risk premium.
Against the backdrop of worsening subprime
woes in the United States, in mid-August, liquidity in money markets in several advanced countries became scarce. In this context, the global
equity and bond liquidity indicators recorded
a sharp decline, although market liquidity has
remained higher than the low levels recorded in
the late 1990s. Liquidity in bond markets, however, declined more sharply than in equity markets, reflecting the greater impact on the former
of the drying up of liquidity in money markets.
Conclusion
Notwithstanding recent market events, longterm interest rates and spreads across a broad
range of assets are still at low levels relative to
their long-term averages. This seems, however,
no longer associated with aggressive monetary
accommodation. In particular, measures of the
global monetary policy stance confirm a period
of generally accommodative policies in industrial
countries in the early 2000s, but this has ended.
At least part of the increase in global liquidity
and the associated decrease in risk premium
is likely the result of a structural, and possibly
enduring, component related to improvements
in the liquidity of financial markets. These
improvements are a result of financial globalization; financial innovation, such as securitization and the growth of derivatives markets; and
increased market participation. Even in the
context of the recent market turmoil, these
improvements do not appear to have been completely reversed. However, money markets are
yet to return to normal and this could still have
a further bearing on global liquidity. At the
same time, low long-term interest rates may also
reflect the impact of global savings-investment
imbalances, which are likely to correct over the
medium term.
rates in the VAR. However, a thorough analysis of the
relationship between market liquidity and monetary
policy stance is left for future research.

37

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

need to be considered. In Japan, given the
muted outlook for prices, monetary policy
should remain supportive. The return to a more
neutral stance should proceed in tandem with
a firming of inflation prospects and a reduction
of concerns about the consequences of recent
financial volatility.
Despite the weaker growth prospects for
advanced economies, a number of emerging market economies still face overheating
pressures and rising food prices, and further
monetary tightening may be required to contain
inflation. Moreover, notwithstanding recent
financial developments, strong foreign exchange
inflows from current account surpluses as well
as continuing net capital inflows are likely to
continue to complicate the policymakers’ task.
In some cases, greater exchange rate flexibility
would help provide more room for monetary
control. Specifically for China, further upward
flexibility of the renminbi, along with measures
to reform the exchange rate regime and boost
consumption, would also contribute to a necessary rebalancing of demand and to an orderly
unwinding of global imbalances. More generally, policymakers in emerging market countries
should be pragmatic in managing the trade-offs
between excessive credit growth driven by rapid
reserve accumulation and concerns about competitiveness from exchange rate appreciation,
but should be careful to avoid measures that
could bring microeconomic inefficiencies and
other longer-term costs. Greater restraint over
growth of government spending, a tightening of
prudential standards in financial systems, and
steps to liberalize controls on capital outflows
could all play useful roles.
In due course, lessons will need to be drawn
from the recent experience of turbulent market
conditions to reduce vulnerabilities to future
strains, lessons that would be relevant in both
advanced and developing economies. One set of
issues concerns the various approaches central
banks have used to provide liquidity to relieve
financial strains and linkage with broader financial safety nets. For some countries, stronger
deposit insurance systems and bank resolution

38

mechanisms may provide more scope to take a
disciplined approach to providing liquidity to
individual institutions that minimizes moral hazard without generating systemic risk. There are
also a series of regulatory issues that will need
to be addressed, as discussed in more detail in
the October GFSR. First, greater attention will
need to be given to ensuring adequate transparency over risks, including off-balance-sheet
exposures, to ensure that the market is able
to price risk properly in a world where financial instruments have become more complex,
particularly with increasing reliance on securitization. Second, there is a need to strengthen
checks and balances throughout the supply
chain of structured products to ensure that loan
originators have appropriate incentives to assess
repayment capacity. Third, the approach taken
to rating of complex financial products should
be reviewed to ensure that investors are alerted
to liquidity and market risks, in addition to
credit risks. Fourth, financial institutions should
be encouraged to improve liquidity risk management. And fifth, the relevant perimeter for risk
consolidation for banks may need to be widened
to recognize that banks may be forced under
adverse circumstances to step in to support their
affiliates.
The advanced economies have made significant progress toward fiscal consolidation
during the present expansion, but need to do
more to advance plans to ensure fiscal sustainability in the face of population aging, although
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to work
in most countries in the event of a downturn.
General government structural deficits have
been lowered substantially across the major
economies since 2003, and further progress is expected in 2007. However, prospects
through 2012 show limited further consolidation, implying little reduction in net debt to
GDP from current levels. Moreover, much of the
consolidation that has occurred in recent years
has reflected rapid revenue growth driven by the
rising share of profits and high-end incomes,
and it is not clear to what extent these revenue
gains will be sustained. Governments should

POLICY CHALLENGES

adopt more ambitious medium-term consolidation plans, together with reforms to tackle the
rising pressures from government health and
social security spending (see Box 1.3 of the
April 2007 World Economic Outlook).
• In the United States, the newly adopted goal of
balancing the federal budget by 2012 is a step
forward, but the policies to achieve this objective are not yet in place, and a more ambitious medium-term target—such as balancing
the budget without relying on Social Security
revenues—would better prepare for the
coming buildup in spending pressures and
contribute to current account adjustment.
• In the euro area, the Eurogroup ministers
have committed to achieving country-specific
medium-term objectives (MTOs) by 2010.
Although this commitment is welcome, it will
be important that countries that fall short of
their MTOs adjust by at least ½ percentage
point of GDP a year—a goal that according to
current plans does not look likely to be met
in some countries in 2007.
• In Japan, net debt is projected to continue to
rise despite continuing consolidation efforts,
and faster progress than currently envisaged
would buy policy insurance against shocks and
help meet the challenges of population aging.
The emerging market and developing
countries have also generally taken advantage
of recent buoyant conditions to advance fiscal
consolidation goals, which has contributed
importantly to reduce balance sheet vulnerabilities. But, as with the advanced economies,
there are concerns that much of the recent
improvement reflects strong revenue growth—
for example, generated by high commodity
prices and strong profits—which may not be
sustained. Moreover, in many countries, government spending has been allowed to accelerate, which has added to overheating concerns.
Most countries face a long list of fiscal reform
challenges—to improve the structure of taxation, to strengthen the allocation of spending,
and to consolidate the overall framework for
fiscal management—and should do more to
tackle these challenges.

More broadly, countries must continue their
efforts to advance reforms that allow their
economies to take full advantage of the opportunities created by globalization and technological
advances. A key part of this agenda are initiatives to make sure that markets work well, with
priorities being liberalization of financial and
service sectors in western Europe and Japan and
a broad range of reforms in emerging market
and developing countries to improve infrastructure, develop financial systems, and strengthen
the business environment.
It is increasingly recognized that more is
needed to ensure that the benefits of globalization and technological advances are well
distributed, with rewards accruing not only to
the well-off and well positioned but also to the
broader population. As emphasized in the analytical chapters of the April 2007 World Economic
Outlook and in this report, a range of policies are
relevant here across advanced and developing
economies. Reforms to strengthen education
and training would help to ensure that workers
have the appropriate skills to compete and contribute in the emerging knowledge-based global
economy. Labor market reforms are needed to
ensure that jobs are created flexibly in the most
dynamic sectors. And social safety nets should
be enhanced to provide greater protection for
those who may be adversely affected by the process of change, without impeding the changes
themselves.
In some key areas, joint actions across countries will be crucial. The recent slow progress
with the Doha Trade Round is deeply disappointing, and major trading countries should
show leadership to find a way to reenergize the
process of multilateral trade liberalization. The
continuing proliferation of bilateral trade treaties
is a concern. Although such treaties can bring
benefits to the countries involved, they also have
negative externalities, and a code of conduct
is sorely needed that would help reduce trade
diversion and contain the complexities from multiple sets of rules of origin and other regulations.
Concerns about climate change and energy
security also clearly require a multilateral

approach. Global warming may be the world’s
largest collective action problem with the
negative consequences of individual activities felt largely by others. It is to be hoped
that countries can come together to develop
a market-based framework that balances the
long-term costs of carbon emissions against
the immediate economic costs of mitigation,
which can attract broad country participation
while providing a fair distribution of the costs
involved. Approaches to energy security must
be consistent with greater attention to environmental consequences, involving reduced focus
on the autarkic strategy of developing national
sources of energy, often with considerable
associated environmental damage, and more
attention to price-based incentives to containing growth of energy consumption and steps
to encourage international diversification of
energy sources (for example, by reducing barriers to trade in biofuels).
Finally, joint actions toward ensuring a
smooth unwinding of global imbalances remains
an important task. Following up on the IMF’s
Multilateral Consultation, the key now is consistent implementation by participating countries
of the policy plans that have been announced,
which, according to IMF staff analysis, will make
a significant contribution toward the reduction
of imbalances while sustaining growth. With the
agreement of participants in the Consultation,
implementation will be monitored by the IMF,
including through future issues of the World
Economic Outlook.

Commodity markets have generally been tight
since the beginning of 2007, notwithstanding
the recent financial turmoil. The IMF commodities and energy price index rose by 21 percent
in the first eight months of the year, dominated

40

APPENDIX 1.1. DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMODITY MARKETS

by a resurgence in oil prices and supported
by rising metals and food prices (Figure 1.18).
Oil prices rose to all-time highs in September,
largely resulting from solid demand growth
in the face of tight supply. Metals prices have
remained strong, despite some losses amid
sell-offs during the recent financial turmoil,
and food prices have been boosted by strong
demand—particularly for biofuel production—
and supply shortfalls. Looking forward, with
continued geopolitical and supply risks coupled
with stronger demand—especially from China,
the Middle East, and the United States—oil
prices are likely to remain high in the absence
of a further change in OPEC’s quota policies
or a major global slowdown. Metals prices are
expected to soften further from recent highs,
although rising production costs will limit the
decline. Food prices should also moderate over
the medium term, although demand for biofuels and from emerging markets could provide
continued support.

Surging Oil Prices Reflect Robust Demand amid
Tight Supply
Record-high crude oil prices. Following a dip
in January, the average petroleum spot price
(APSP) has remained strong since late March.
Despite OPEC’s announced quota increase
of 0.5 million barrels a day (mbd) starting in
November and some softening in August amid
the subprime turmoil, the APSP set an all-time
record high in mid-September, with the West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) reaching beyond
$83 and Dubai beyond $75; the Brent price has
also reached a record high of almost $80 in late
September (Figure 1.19, top panel). Long-term
futures prices have risen much less than spot
prices: since early July, the crude oil forward
curve has moved from partial contango at the
front end (where futures prices are higher than
the spot price) to full backwardation (the opposite situation) for the first time in three years
(Figure 1.19, upper-middle panel). This development suggests that market concerns are focused
on the current availability of oil in the context

of increased supply uncertainty and declining crude inventories.5 The weakening of the
U.S. dollar—by lowering real prices for consumers and producers—may have also contributed
to higher dollar prices: in terms of the euro
and the SDR, oil prices have not risen as sharply
(Figure 1.19, lower-middle panel).
Gasoline price spike. Refinery bottlenecks
pushed U.S. retail gasoline prices to a record
high in late May, but prices have since eased
somewhat (Box 1.5). While the long-term
gasoline price trend is determined by crude oil
prices, over shorter periods changes in refinery
availability can cause crude and gasoline price
movements to diverge.6 Indeed, the gasoline
crack spread spike in May 2007 followed two
major spikes within a span of less than two
years,7 likely reflecting an increased susceptibility of gasoline prices to supply shocks in the
face of increasing refinery bottlenecks. Refinery problems in the United States have spilled
over to other regions, in part through higher
demand for imports of refined products—
particularly in the United States and the Middle
East—resulting in a rise in crude-gasoline price
differentials in all major markets in the second
quarter (Figure 1.19, lower panel). Refinery bottlenecks also depressed the price of WTI—the
U.S. reference crude—relative to other crudes,
particularly Brent, as crude inventories built
up, waiting to be refined in the central United
States. As refinery problems in the U.S. Midwest
eased, WTI recovered and rose above Brent in
late July.

costs of carry (such as cost of interest, cost of storage, and
insurance) minus benefits of carry (or the “convenience
yield”). When the spot market is tight, the benefits (or
convenience) of having the commodity available on hand
may offset costs of carry, pushing futures prices below the
spot price.
6In addition, gasoline demand has a strong seasonal
component that could cause large crude-gasoline
differentials.

damaged Gulf of Mexico refineries and the second when
ethanol was introduced as a gasoline additive.

APPENDIX 1.1. DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMODITY MARKETS

Buoyant consumption. Global oil demand accelerated in the first half of 2007, growing at about
1 percent year on year, compared with about
½ percent during the same period in 2006.
Demand has been subdued in many OECD
countries, with consumption falling in Europe
and Japan in the first half of 2007, as warm winter temperatures reduced demand for heating
oil. Demand also weakened in the United States
in the early part of 2007 but ended up increasing as a whole by about 1¼ percent year on
year in the first half of 2007 as a result of strong
consumption of transportation fuels, particularly
diesel. Weak overall OECD demand, however,
has been more than offset by robust demand
growth in non-OECD countries—led by buoyant demand from China, India, and the Middle
East (Figure 1.20, top panel; and Table 1.2). The
strong non-OECD consumption growth, despite
high prices, reflects rapid income growth in
emerging market countries and below-market
prices (especially in the Middle East), coupled
with a weakening U.S. dollar that makes oil
more affordable in local currencies.
Supply and inventories. Notwithstanding robust
demand growth, overall output was unchanged
in the first half of 2007 relative to the same
period last year, and inventories were flat. The
rise in non-OPEC production (1.0 mbd) was
offset by a decline in OPEC production (0.9
mbd) (Figure 1.20, middle panel), reflecting
quota cuts as well as shutdowns in Nigeria.
Non-OPEC production growth was also lower
than expected, reflecting a fall in production
in Alaska, Mexico, and Norway, despite strong
growth in Russia and Azerbaijan (Figure 1.20,
lower panel). Preliminary estimates suggest
global supply fell by 0.4 mbd in August owing to
hurricane outages in Mexico and maintenance
work in the North Sea. OECD commercial oil
and product inventories have remained flat in
the first half of 2007. U.S. gasoline inventories
fell precipitously starting in February 2007 and
are now decisively below their five-year average. Crude inventories began to decline in the
third quarter of 2007—losing 10 percent of the
stock—but still remain comfortable (Figure 1.21,

on non-OECD inventories.
Increased OPEC spare capacity. OPEC crude oil
production capacity increased by 0.5 mbd in
the first half of 2007 relative to the same period
in 2006. This, together with previous production cuts, has increased spare capacity to more
comfortable levels. While this could in principle
mitigate upward pressures on prices by reducing
concerns about potential future supply disruptions, its impact on current prices has been
more than offset by lower OPEC production
(Figure 1.21).
Outlook. Looking forward, demand growth is
expected to outstrip non-OPEC supply growth
in 2007 and 2008. The International Energy
Agency’s (IEA’s) revised forecasts point to a
tighter market than envisaged earlier. On the
supply side, growth is expected to be limited,
with non-OPEC supply growth remaining lackluster at 0.6 mbd in 2007 (slightly higher than
the increase in 2006), reflecting a proliferation
of project delays and higher output declines
than earlier expected in maturing fields (particularly in Norway, the United Kingdom, and
Mexico). OPEC envisages a more optimistic
supply scenario, projecting a rise in non-OPEC

production of about 0.8 mbd in 2007. Rapid
growth of the biofuels supply will raise the
supply of transportation fuel, but biofuels still
account for just over 1 percent of total fuel use
(Box 1.6). The impact of biofuels on oil prices
should be small—although they are having a
tangible impact on food prices.
In contrast, on the demand side, the IEA
expects consumption to grow by 1.4 mbd, driven
by emerging market economies, in particular
China, India, and the Middle East, as well as
the United States—despite a slight downward
revision to U.S. demand growth in the wake
of the credit turmoil in August 2007. Furthermore, OECD demand for nontransportation
fuels—which is more sensitive to the weather—is
expected to pick up in the second half of 2007,
assuming that temperatures revert to more normal levels from a relatively mild 2006. OPEC’s
forecasts point to a somewhat smaller increase in
global consumption (1.3 mbd in 2007).
As a result, although oil prices currently lie
at the upper end of their historical range and
modest declines are possible, upward pressures remain. An important characteristic of
the recent price surge is that—unlike last year’s
price peak in August—there has been no apparent intensification of geopolitical risks in the
wake of the surge. Therefore, further upward
price pressure could materialize in the event of
renewed geopolitical concerns. The extent of
upward pressures will in part depend on OPEC’s
quota policies, dollar exchange rate movements,
and global activity, but the direction and magnitude of these pressures remain uncertain. OPEC
has indicated that it would consider increasing
supply further in 2007:Q4, if necessary, as its
assessment (as outlined above) is consistent with
an implicit price target in the $60–$70 range.
While OECD economic activity is expected to
weaken somewhat, oil demand will be significantly affected only if the slowdown spills over
to emerging markets where oil consumption
growth is the most prominent.
As of October 5, futures and options markets
indicate that oil prices will average over $69 a
barrel in the remainder of 2007 and $76 a bar-

APPENDIX 1.1. DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMODITY MARKETS

rel in 2008, with a 50 percent probability that
Brent crude prices will be between $69 and $87
by January 2008 (Figure 1.22, top panel).
Over the medium term, the IEA expects
tight market conditions to persist and possibly
intensify by 2012, assuming strong GDP growth
continues. Average global demand in the 2007–
12 period would remain strong, increasing
by 1.9 mbd a year—slightly above the average
annual increase during 2002–07: a period of
rising prices, spurred by accelerating non-OECD
demand. OPEC’s capacity is expected to increase
by an average of 0.8 mbd a year and non-OPEC
capacity by only 0.5 mbd a year over the same
period (compared with 0.7 mbd in the previous
five years), as rising investment costs and prolonged project delays, together with high decline
rates of major fields, create a drag on capacity
expansion plans. With the increase in capacity
likely falling short of the increase in demand,
medium-term upward pressure on prices may
continue in the absence of a global slowdown.

the financial turmoil, although it strengthened
somewhat in September. By contrast, after a

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.5. Refinery Bottlenecks
Gasoline and diesel prices in the United States
and elsewhere rose sharply in May 2007, with
“crack spreads” (premium over crude oil prices)
reaching levels close to those seen following
Hurricane Katrina. The rise in spreads stemmed
from refinery outages in the United States,
owing to delayed maintenance and unexpected
factors, which, combined with tight global refinery capacity, resulted in a drawdown in product
stocks just before the peak summer demand
period for transport fuels. Spreads have since
come down (see Figure 1.19, bottom panel).
Refinery problems are not new in the United
States. Refining capacity has lagged behind
consumption growth, implying greater dependence on gasoline imports over the years (top
panel of figure).1 New investment has been
hampered by strict environmental regulations,
which can vary considerably by locality and thus
add to uncertainty, as well as by a depressed oil
market throughout the 1990s (which kept refining profit margins low). No new refineries have
been built in the United States since the late
1970s. While notional capacity has increased
somewhat through expanding capacity at existing refineries and enhancing efficiency, this
process is limited by aging distillation units and
increasingly strict fuel specifications, which have
led to more required downtime and longer
processing periods.
There is also a mismatch between the type of
crude available and the refining capabilities at
a more global scale. The majority of refineries
cannot process heavy or sour oil2 (which is in
relatively greater supply globally) into high-

Note: The author of this box is Valerie MercerBlackman.
1Refinery capacity problems also exist in Europe
and in Japan, but unlike in the United States, consumption has stabilized in these regions.
2Heavy oil refers to a crude type that is relatively
dense or has a high gravity per volumetric unit. Sour
crude refers to a crude type that has relatively high
sulfur content per volumetric unit. Both properties
mean that the crude requires additional and more
complex distillation to turn it into a unit of light, lowsulfur product.

and increasingly so) (bottom panel of figure).
In part reflecting these global mismatches,
OPEC (2007) projects that growth of trade in
refined products will exceed growth of trade
in crude by 2020, with much of the growth
coming from trade in products refined from
sour oil (abundant in the Middle East) and
directed mostly toward Asian markets. Planned

expand capacity, albeit slowly. The International Energy Agency predicts that most of the
new distillation capacity additions will be in

planned globally over the next five years, Asia
and the Middle East are expected to contribute

prices extended their strong price run-up
of recent years, while some food prices rose
sharply. Agricultural raw materials and beverage prices increased more slowly. Looking
forward, the index is expected to decline somewhat as supply responds to increased demand,
although short-term downside price risks to
food prices should be limited by the strong
biofuel demand.
Robust metals prices reflecting supply problems.
While prices suffered losses amid sell-offs
during the recent credit crunch, they have
remained strong, largely reflecting supply problems. Overall, prices rose by about 8¾ percent
during the first eight months of 2007, led by
lead—which set new record highs during the
period—as well as copper and tin (Figure 1.22,
lower panel). Nickel and uranium, however,
suffered major losses more recently after both
reached record highs in the early summer.
While demand has been buoyant—for example, for copper, reflecting increased Chinese
demand for restocking, and for uranium (during the first half of 2007), owing to increased
demand for nuclear energy—supply factors
appear to have been the main driver of higher
prices. Labor disputes in copper mines in
Chile, Mexico, and Peru continued to disrupt
production, while the ensuing wage increases
have increased the long-term cost of production. In addition, certain restrictive government policies—such as Indonesia’s tightened
tin export regulation—have reduced supply.
Finally, industry consolidation has reduced
the number of plants against the background

The risks to these projections, however, are
on the downside. Rising costs of materials and
a chronic lack of skilled labor may delay or constrain projects. In addition, uncertainties arising
from environmental concerns and efforts to
switch to cleaner alternatives, in part through
stricter regulations to control emissions, will
likely raise costs for potential refinery investors.

of delays in new projects. Consequently, inventories have been low for most metals, thereby
reducing the safety cushion in the event of
supply disruptions. Looking forward, prices are
expected to soften from recent highs, but they
are expected to be supported by increasing
costs over the longer term, reflecting intense
competition for skilled labor and equipment
and energy costs.
Buoyant food prices amid robust biofuel demand.
Food prices rose by 10½ percent during January–August, led by soybean, edible oils, and
wheat prices, and have remained relatively
immune to the recent financial turmoil.
Expansion of biofuel production has increased
demand for corn, soybeans, and edible oils.
Although corn prices fell by 8½ percent during the first eight months of 2007—as a result
of production growth of 15 percent relative
to 2006 in response to high prices—they are
still about 50 percent higher than in the same
period in 2006. Wheat prices reached their
highest level since the mid-1990s in mid-July,
reflecting adverse weather amid historically
low inventories. Meat prices rose by more than
8 percent, reflecting the increased cost of
feed. Higher prices have been accompanied by
generally tighter demand-supply balances, as
manifested in declining stock-to-consumption
ratios for corn, wheat, and meat, as well as the
projected decline for soybeans. In contrast,
sugar prices have weakened significantly over
the past year, owing to the strength of supply
in Brazil and limited export opportunities for
Brazilian sugar-based ethanol.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.6. Making the Most of Biofuels
High oil prices in recent years, together with
generous policy support, have led to a surge
in biofuel use as a supplement to transportation fuels in advanced economies.1 In 2005,
the United States overtook Brazil to become
the world’s largest producer of ethanol, while
the European Union is the largest biodiesel
producer. This box examines this development,
assessing whether the strong push toward biofuels production makes sense in a global context,
from both an economic and an environmental
perspective.
What Are the Costs and Benefits of Biofuels?
There are important disagreements among
policymakers and analysts on the viability of
biofuels as a supplement to transportation
fuels. Part of the disagreement stems from
the difficulty of measuring their net benefit.
Average production costs and net greenhouse
gas emissions can vary substantially according
to location, labor intensity, feedstock prices,
production scale, and available infrastructure.
Moreover, rapid advances in some biofuels
production technology are rendering early
estimates obsolete.
Subject to these limitations, the table shows
indicators of costs and benefits of producing a
unit of biofuel. Only Brazilian ethanol derived
from sugarcane is less costly to produce than
gasoline and corn-based ethanol (about 15 percent and, in energy-equivalent terms, 25 percent less, respectively). Furthermore, sugarcane
ethanol produces 91 percent fewer greenhouse
gas emissions per kilometer traveled than
gasoline. Soaring palm oil prices since 2006
have recently eliminated the relative cost
advantage Malaysian biodiesel had compared
with diesel, but it is still cheaper to produce
than other types of biodiesel. According to
Note: The author of this box is Valerie MercerBlackman.
1Ethanol accounts for over 80 percent of global
biofuel use; it can be blended with gasoline and is
produced from corn, wheat, and sugar. Biodiesel can
substitute for diesel fuel and is produced from edible
oils (soy, palm, rapeseed) and other fats.

48

some estimates, Jatropha-based biodiesel that is
developed in India may be cheaper to produce
than diesel, but some inefficiencies remain. All
biofuels do less environmental damage than
gasoline or diesel, but the relative benefits
of corn- and wheat-based ethanol are small.
Second-generation biofuels have substantially
greater environmental benefits but are costlier
to produce.2
In addition to these quantifiable aspects of
biofuels’ production, there are other, indirect,
costs that would quickly escalate if firstgeneration biofuels were used more intensively
than they are now. First, the growing use of
grains and oils as feedstock in biofuel production could further boost food prices beyond
current levels. Second, feedstock planting on
a greater scale—particularly for biodiesel—
would exert additional stress on already highly
exploited land and water resources worldwide.
A study by LMC International (2006) finds
that raising biofuels production sufficiently to
provide 5 percent of global fuel needs by 2015
would require expanding planted land acreage
of all cultivated land by 15 percent. Finally,
substantial fi xed costs would be required to
build the infrastructure and vehicles necessary for the distribution of ethanol on a larger
scale. 3
On the other hand, there are also potentially significant indirect benefits, particularly
for commodity-producing developing countries. First, biofuels allow for the diversification
of energy sources and thus lower a country’s
exposure to oil price volatility. They also hold
the promise of contributing to rural development by creating jobs in the production of the
feedstock and the relatively simple manufacture of biofuels. Given their negligible tailpipe
2Global biofuels research aimed at developing
biofuels that use waste vegetable products as inputs
instead of foods (known as second-generation biofuels) is ongoing, but is expected to take at least five
years to become commercially viable.
3Conventional gasoline-powered vehicles can only
use fuel with up to about 15 percent ethanol without
costly alterations.

emissions, they can help reduce local pollution from agents such as sulfur particles—
particularly when vehicle fleets are old. Finally,
a producer from a Kyoto-Protocol-signatory
developing country can earn carbon credits
through the clean development mechanism
for every unit of renewable energy created
(Appendix 1.2).
On balance, therefore, some biofuels are
economically and environmentally beneficial
at modest blends. Whether the net benefits are
realized, and how they are distributed, depends
crucially on the policy context under which they
are instituted.

What Are the Likely Effects of the Current U.S. and
EU Biofuels Policies?
A number of countries have adopted policies
to promote domestic biofuels production in an
effort to reduce their dependence on petroleum imports.4 The most generous incentives
4In addition to the EU countries and the United
States, tax benefits for consumers exist in Australia,
Canada, Brazil, and India. Moreover, many countries
have adopted targets—some mandatory—as well as
research tax incentives for increasing biofuels production. Among them are Argentina, Canada, Brazil,
India, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Colombia,
China, and Japan.

Box 1.6 (concluded)
are offered by the United States and the EU
countries.
• In the United States, blenders receive tax
credits of $0.51 and $1, respectively, per
gallon of ethanol and biodiesel sold against
their income tax. There is also a $0.54 a gallon ($0.14 a liter) tariff on ethanol imports
(none on biodiesel).5 In several states, a
10 percent ethanol blend must be added to
gasoline as an oxygenate (to make it burn
more efficiently) as of May 2006; other
states have additional tax incentives. At the
federal level, the 2005 Energy Policy Act set
a goal that renewable fuels reach 7.5 billion
gallons by 2012 (about 10 percent of the total
expected gasoline use). Most of the target is
expected to be met by domestically produced
corn-based ethanol. A bill that would almost
quintuple the biofuels target, to 35 billion gallons by 2022, is under consideration.
• In the European Union, most countries offer
fuel tax exemptions for biofuels (a large benefit, given high fuel taxes) and research subsidies. The average tariff on ethanol imports
is $0.19 a liter, whereas biodiesel feedstocks
have tariffs of up to 6.5 percent. Countries’
official targets vary, but most converge to the
EU current voluntary and somewhat ambitious target of biofuels comprising 5.75 percent of total fuels by 2010. The European
Union also has a legally binding target of
10 percent by 2020.
To illustrate the effect of U.S. and EU
policies, a hypothetical yet politically unlikely
alternative scenario was simulated to 2012. The
scenario illustrates the impact of removing
biofuels tax credits and tariffs in the United
States and European Union on global biofuels
production and on net commodity exports.
5However, the United States and European Union
both have tariffs on the oils used as feedstock for
biodiesel, which at the outset ironically puts domestic
producers at a disadvantage relative to importers. This
is offset by the $1.00 a gallon blender credit (in the
United States) and tax exemptions for biodiesel (in
Europe); these distortions have given rise to “subsidy
arbitrage” across countries.

50

Many important interactions are ignored, and
so the analysis should be considered as illustrative of the likely effects rather than as predictive. The baseline forecast for production and
consumption volume of biofuels by country is
based on the International Energy Agency’s
medium-term projections, whereas baseline
commodity price projections are those of the
IMF. Total demand for biofuels in 2012 and
its distribution across countries is assumed to
remain exactly the same under both scenarios,
and still largely dictated by targets and mandates. Retail prices for mostly first-generation
biofuels continue to be determined by domestic
fuel prices as a result of their negligible share
in total transportation fuels. Therefore, the
only changes relative to baseline in the analysis
are the geographical distribution of production, and feedstock prices.
Under this scenario, production using other,
more expensive, feedstocks in the United States
and European Union would become unprofitable and shut down as supply increasingly came
from lower-cost importers (see figure). By 2012
ethanol would be produced largely by Brazil
and other Latin American countries, and biodiesel by Asian countries (using Jatropha for the
case of India).6 There is also an indirect effect
through commodity prices. The ensuing higher
demand for sugarcane and palm oil raises their
price by 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively, while lower demand for corn, wheat,
soybean oil, and rapeseed oil (the main biofuels
feedstocks in the United States and the European Union) reduces their prices by 10 percent

6In the alternative scenario, countries are assumed
to produce ethanol and biodiesel in proportion to
their expected 2007 sugarcane and palm oil exports,
respectively, using U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) data. This is because the production technology is fairly simple. At projected consumption
levels, there would not yet be significant constraints
on land use. Moreover, the market for Indian
Jatropha-based biodiesel is expected to open up in
the alternative scenario, as it is already being developed but does not have a large enough impetus in
the baseline scenario.

generally improve for biofuels producers (less
so for net grain exporters). They would worsen
slightly for net palm oil importers such as India
and Africa, and by a negligible amount in the
United States and the European Union (less
than 0.01 percent of total trade). All in all, overall average global production costs and greenhouse gas emissions would decline as more
efficient producers came in. Fiscal costs in the
United States and the European Union would
also fall, although by a very small percentage of
their respective budgets.8
How Could Biofuels Policies Improve?
The analysis in this box illustrates how
current policies in the United States and the
European Union are sustaining inefficient
production patterns. This does not mean that
biofuel use should not be promoted as a supplement to regular fuel in small amounts; biofuels
have some useful environmental benefits relative to petroleum-based fuels. Certain policies
could be implemented to enhance these net
benefits.
• The first-best policy would be to allow free
trade in biofuels while levying a carbon
tax on all fuels to reflect emissions costs.
This way, the environmental benefits of
biofuels would be fully maximized (see
Appendix 1.2).
• A blending mandate with a clear time limit
could be justified for biofuels as a means to
overcome the transitional fixed costs of moving to a new technology.
• Research and development of renewables
should be promoted. There is a legitimate
role for governments to fund promising
research on such activities, given their public
good character, especially if the environmental impact is not being adequately priced.

8The main direct and indirect fiscal costs in the
United States and European Union stem from
agricultural policies, which are assumed to remain
unchanged in the baseline and alternative scenarios.

Overall, the recent boom in food prices
reflects a combination of factors:
• Strong demand for biofuel: higher ethanol
production in the United States is projected
to account for 60 percent of the global
increase in corn consumption in 2007 (Figure 1.23, top panel). The impact on corn
prices has been amplified by policy commitments to promote the use of ethanol further,
which have pushed up futures prices (Figure 1.23, middle panel). According to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, the amount
of corn used to produce ethanol in the
United States is likely to increase from 14 percent of total U.S. production in 2005/06 to
30 percent by 2010/11. Similarly, increasing
use of soybean and rapeseed oil in producing biofuels in the United States and the
European Union has accounted for the bulk
of demand growth for these crops in recent
years (Figure 1.23, bottom panel). Strong
expansion in biofuel production has also indirectly buoyed prices of other nonfuel-related
food items by providing incentives for farmers
to switch away from other crop plantings and
by increasing the cost of livestock feed.
• Increased demand from emerging markets:
China has been an important source of
global food demand growth, accounting, for
example, for 35–40 percent of the increase
in global consumption of soybeans and meat.
India’s contribution to global demand for
food, particularly meat, has also picked up
recently. Although increased food consumption by emerging market economies has
supported food prices, it is unlikely to have
played a leading role in the recent surge,
given that these economies’ food demand
began to increase strongly in the 1990s, long
before the current run-up in prices.
• Adverse supply shocks: unfavorable weather
conditions have reduced the global harvest
for some food items. For example, the severe
drought in Australia, a major wheat exporter,
reduced the Australian wheat production by
60 percent in 2006. In addition, an outbreak
of the “blue-ear disease” has significantly

APPENDIX 1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE: ECONOMIC IMPACT AND POLICY RESPONSES

reduced pork stocks in China and pushed up
domestic meat prices by over 50 percent in
August 2007 (year on year), raising annual
food price inflation to over 16 percent.
Semiconductors. Global semiconductor sales revenue declined by more than 2 percent the first
half of 2007 year on year, compared with growth
of more than 9 percent during the same period
in 2006. This reflected declining average selling
prices, because of fierce competition in the
microprocessor segment amid excess capacity in
DRAM markets, fragile demand, and high inventories. Looking forward, this trend is expected
to continue in the second half of 2007 and
beyond, with the forecast for 2007 sales growth
revised significantly downward to 1.8 percent
from the 10 percent envisaged earlier.

Appendix 1.2. Climate Change: Economic
Impact and Policy Responses
The authors of this appendix, including the boxes, are
Ben Jones, Michael Keen, John Norregaard, and Jon
Strand.
There is now a wide consensus that man-made
climate change is occurring, will continue into
the foreseeable future, and is likely to intensify
(IPCC, 2007b).8 The challenges for economic
policy that this poses are substantial. Perhaps
most fundamentally, climate change is a global
externality: the social consequences of emitting
the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that drive the
process are not borne fully by those emitting
the gases, but are shared across the world—with
low-income countries likely to be most seriously
affected. This raises significant problems of
international coordination. These are com8The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological
Organisation to provide syntheses of research on climate
change. There are, it should be noted, dissenting opinions on the relationships between human activities and
increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
and between increased concentrations and observed and
projected temperature changes: see, for example, Lindzen,
Chou, and Hou (2001); and Carter and others (2007).

pounded by the stock nature of the externality (harm arising not from the current flow but
from the cumulated stock), which implies that
much future damage reflects past emissions.
Further conceptual and practical issues arise
from the long lags in the process and from the
considerable uncertainties that remain, including the risk (even if with relatively low probability) of extremely damaging events.
This appendix explores these challenges. It
briefly lays out what is known about the science
of climate change, to set the scene for a review of
its economic impact. The appendix also discusses
the economics of policy interventions to promote adaptation aimed at reducing the damage
from climate change and of mitigation strategies
to limit the atmospheric changes that cause it.
These issues will be explored in greater depth in
the April 2008 World Economic Outlook.

Outlining the Challenge
The main GHGs emitted by human activity
are carbon dioxide (CO2), contributing about
77 percent of total GHG emissions, and methane and nitrous oxide, each contributing about
14 and 8 percent, respectively.9 The atmospheric
concentration of GHGs (measured in CO2
equivalents, CO2e) has increased from about
300 parts per million (ppm) in 1750 to 430 ppm
now, and is increasing by about 2 ppm a year.10
The global average temperature increased by
about 0.7°C between 1906 and 2005,11 and existing GHG concentrations are expected to cause a
further substantive temperature increase in the
coming decades.12
9Water vapor is the most abundant GHG, but human
activities have only a small direct effect on its amount,
and, unlike other GHGs, it has only a relatively short-lived
climatic impact. References to GHGs henceforth exclude
water vapor.
10Stern and others (2007).
11IPCC (2007b). The increase has not been monotonic,
however.
12Model-based estimates are that even if atmospheric
concentrations were held constant at 2000 levels, further
warming of about 0.2°C would occur over the next 20
years (with a best estimate of cumulative warming of
0.6°C by the end of the century): IPCC (2007b).

With no policy response, “business-as-usual”
(BAU) emissions are projected by IPCC (2007b)
to lead to average global temperature increases
of between 1.1°C and 6.4°C (above preindustrial
levels) by 2100.13 As an indication of the potential significance of this projection, warming of
5°C would be roughly comparable to the difference between temperatures during the most
recent ice age and today.
Although timing and geographical incidence
are uncertain, a number of climatic effects are
expected. The greatest increases in temperature
are projected for the northern parts of North
America, Europe, and Asia, with smaller (but
still sizable) increases in tropical areas. The
global pattern of rainfall is likely to change, with
many already dry areas (including in Africa,
Australia, South Asia, the Middle East, and
the Mediterranean) expected to become even
drier. There are further possible (but highly
uncertain) effects on rainfall in many tropical
zones (such as the Amazon region) as well as
on seasonal patterns (of the Asian monsoon, for
example), potentially affecting the sustainability
of large human populations and critical natural
resources. Flood risk is projected to increase by
more intense rainfall and sea-level rise (from
0.2 to 0.6 meters in this century14—more with
accelerated glacial melting). In addition, the
frequency and/or severity of extreme weather
events, including hurricanes, floods, heat waves,
and droughts, are expected to increase, most
seriously in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
Beyond these effects, there may be “tipping points,” which, if passed, would result in
more dramatic and irreversible climate effects.
These include the potential for rapid glacial

13IPCC (2007b) reports temperature projections for
a series of scenarios, providing for each an upper and
lower bound, with an 82 percent probability of temperature rise being between them: the range reported here is
between the lowest and highest of these bounds. Underlying all these scenarios—and providing a simple, ready
reckoner—is a common assumption that doubling CO2
concentrations above preindustrial levels implies a 66 percent or higher chance of global average surface warming
of 2°–4.5°C (with a best estimate of about 3°C).

melting, reversal of the Gulf Stream (leading to
dramatic climate change in northern Europe),
and large-scale tundra thawing in Canada, China,
and Russia, resulting in massive methane release.
Although there is considerable uncertainty as to
the precise location of these thresholds, many—
such as irreversible melting of the Greenland ice
sheet, contributing to several meters of sea-level
rise—may lie within the range of temperature
increases that are possible (even under some
mitigation scenarios) in this century.

Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Climate change is caused by the accumulated
stock of GHGs, while most policies to limit the
risk can address only the flow of emissions.15
The top two panels of Figure 1.24 show the
sources of the stock of CO2 (accumulated
emissions since 1750) by region, together with
annual emissions in 2004, both in percent of
the total. Advanced economies account for
about 75–80 percent of this stock, but a much
greater proportion of current emissions stems
from emerging market and developing countries
(henceforth, “developing countries” includes
emerging markets).
The bottom two panels in Figure 1.24 show
that emissions per capita are about four times as
high in OECD countries as elsewhere; relative
to GDP, however, they are higher in developing
countries. Reflecting this pattern of emission
intensity, and prospective future growth, the
share of developing countries in total emissions
under BAU is expected to rise substantially
from 2004 to 2050 (Figure 1.25).

Macroeconomic and Fiscal Impact of
Climate Change
The macroeconomic and fiscal impact of climate change is potentially substantial, and could
include the following effects:

15There are geoengineering approaches that instead
seek to limit the warming from a given atmospheric concentration by limiting incoming radiation from the sun:
see, for instance, Schelling (2007).

55

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

• direct negative impact on output and productivity from long-term temperature change
and more intense and/or frequent extreme
weather events,16 particularly in the agriculture, fisheries, and tourism sectors.17 Agricultural effects are likely to differ by region,
with reduced output in hotter (and generally
poorer) regions, whereas northern (often
more prosperous) areas may benefit from
temperature increases of 1°–3°C;18
• costs from sea-level rise and increased severity
of flooding. One study estimates that a onemeter increase would reduce GDP by close
to 10 percent for several countries, including
Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritania, and Vietnam
(Dasgupta and others, 2007). This degree of
sea-level rise is some way above the consensus
estimate, and the costs are likely to fall more
than proportionately at lower levels of the
rise, but the effects could be sizable. Some
small island states, including Kiribati, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia,
are seen as particularly at risk, as are populations in coastal areas across a wider set of
countries, including many rapidly expanding
urban centers;19
• increased risk of widespread migration and
conflict, resulting from long-term climate
deterioration and greater damage from
extreme weather events;
• deteriorating fiscal positions arising from
weakening of traditional tax bases and/or

16There is evidence of rapid increases in the economic costs of extreme events. For example, Munich
Re (cited in “UN Finance Initiative CEO Briefing,”
2006) reports that the infrastructure and some other
costs of extreme weather events increased by an annual
average of 6 percent between 1950 to 2005. A continuation of this trend would see expected losses of $800 billion by 2041, with peak-year losses of over $1 trillion.
17During the drought of 1991–92, to give just one example of the costliness of such events, agricultural output in
Malawi fell by about 25 percent and GDP by 7 percent.
18However, this would depend largely on there being a
strongly positive carbon fertilization effect, which remains
uncertain.

increased expenditure on some aspects of mitigation and adaptation (as discussed below);
• more positively, there is potential revenue to
be gained from mitigation schemes—a double
dividend, with benefits to the public finances
as well as to the environment, from reduced
reliance on more distortionary taxes;
• costs arising from efforts to mitigate carbon
emissions, including higher energy prices and
increased investment, are becoming important in many (so far, largely the industrial)
countries;
• balance of payments problems in some
countries owing to reduced exports of goods
and services (agricultural products, fish, and
tourism) or increased need for food and
other essential imports. Damage to transport
infrastructure (ports and roads) may disrupt
trade flows; and
• “nonmarket” effects associated with the loss
of biodiversity and ecological systems, and the
effects of climate change on human health
and the quality of life.
Determining an effective response to climate
change requires calibrating the nature, extent,
and distribution of these effects. Climate scientists have naturally focused on the uncertainties
associated with the complex nonlinear dynamics of the warming process. But there are also
substantial uncertainties associated with estimating the associated economic and wider welfare
effects. Key variables include rates of future population and productivity growth, especially the
rate of convergence of economic growth across
regions, the intensity of emissions through time
and for different regions, and the rate of adoption of new technologies. Aggregating effects
over time also requires a choice of discount rate,
which, as discussed later, has been the focus of
much recent discussion.
Several studies take on these challenges, using
models that emphasize different linkages. The
recent Stern Review (Stern and others, 2007)
uses an “integrated” climate-macroeconomic
model and a probabilistic welfare framework
that included nonmarket effects as well as
low-probability but very damaging extreme

APPENDIX 1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE: ECONOMIC IMPACT AND POLICY RESPONSES

outcomes. Figure 1.26 shows the time path of
expected damage (in percent of global GDP
per capita) under Stern’s three main scenarios,
which differ in climate sensitivity and the valuation of nonmarket effects (such as reduced
biodiversity). The shaded areas show the corresponding 90 percent confidence intervals. The
projected potential losses rise substantially over
time: the range of the central estimates is from
1 to 2 percent of GDP in 2050, 2 to 8 percent by
2100, and 5 to 14 percent by 2200.20
Other studies that assess the macroeconomic
effects of climate change at different levels
of warming include Mendelsohn and others
(2000); Nordhaus and Boyer (2000); Hope
(2006); and Tol (2005). Figure 1.27 presents
some of these results alongside the central
estimates of the three Stern Review scenarios
referred to above. These results span a wide
range of possible economic costs ranging from
negligible (even positive at low levels of warming) to output losses of about 10 percent for
average global warming of 6°C (possible, but
unlikely by 2100, according to the IPCC).
Why are the estimates of the economic
impact of climate change so different? The
Mendelsohn analysis is based on relatively narrow sector coverage and assumes a relatively
high capacity for adaptation. Nordhaus and
Stern include estimates of wider nonmarket
effects, and at higher levels of warming their
results are driven largely by more extensive
allowance for the risks and costs of catastrophic
impacts and economic disruptions. Nordhaus,
Stern, and Tol look beyond aggregate effects,
recognizing that the poorest countries are likely
to be affected hardest and earliest, generally
owing to greater exposure to physical climate
change and weaker socioeconomic resilience.21

disproportionately high burden of climate change borne

scenarios of Figure 1.27.
21This often reflects lower income levels, greater
economic dependency on agriculture and vulnerable ecosystems, food insecurity, and less-developed infrastructure
and public services.

For example, at 2.5°C warming, Tol finds overall
positive economic effects, reflecting output
gains in rich countries, but he also finds (as
does Nordhaus) GDP losses of about 4 percent
in Africa. At higher levels of warming, similar
distributional effects persist, although economic
effects become universally negative (but with
the range of uncertainty becoming wider).
Allowing for these distributional aspects of
climate change leads to larger effects than does
focusing on total output. Differing choices of
discount rate also powerfully affect the assessments that emerge from aggregating effects
over time (see discussion below).

Whereas views differ on the appropriate extent
and urgency, there is broad consensus on the
need for some action to reduce the high economic risks posed by expected levels of warming
consistent with BAU projections. This can take
the following two main forms, with action on
both fronts now widely seen as needed:
• adapting behavior and investment to reduce
the economic and social impact of climate
change, for example, by constructing flood
defenses in response to rising sea levels; and
• mitigating the extent of climate change by
reducing GHG emissions through improved
energy efficiency; carbon capture and storage;
increased reliance on nuclear and renewable
energy sources (wind, wave, tidal, geothermal
and solar energy, hydroelectric power, and
biomass for heat, electricity, and biofuels);
and reduced deforestation.
While a number of policies bearing on
climate change are in place (and some of them
are discussed below), it is likely that their scale
and coverage will need to be increased. The
question of quite how much policy intervention would be desirable, however, has generated a lively debate, reflecting the differing
assessments of the relative costs and benefits
of action and inaction. The Stern Review, for
example, argues for globally coordinated action
to stabilize atmospheric concentration at about

APPENDIX 1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE: ECONOMIC IMPACT AND POLICY RESPONSES

450–550 ppm. This, the review proposes,
would be achieved by substantial reduction
in emissions (not merely relative to the large
increase projected under BAU, but in absolute
terms), beginning between 2020 and 2030
(Figure 1.28). This prescription reflects the
Stern Review’s conclusion that the potential costs
of climate change under BAU are equivalent to
a loss of between 5 and 14 percent of global per
capita consumption, beginning now, 22 whereas
the estimated mitigation costs consistent with
stabilization (at around 500–550 ppm) are
about 1 percent of GDP (the latter within a
range of +/–3 percent).23
These results are heavily influenced by the
use in the Stern Review of a low discount rate,
reflecting a view that it is ethically inappropriate
to attach less weight to the welfare of future generations than to our own. A low discount rate
places a high weight on the benefits of mitigation, which largely come far in the future, relative to more immediate mitigation costs, thus
warranting a high immediate mitigation effort.
A fundamental problem in gaining broad support for mitigation policies is a lack of consensus on the appropriate discount rate to use in
designing and evaluating alternative outcomes
(Box 1.7).

Adaptation to Climate Change
Adaptation is the process by which adverse
economic effects of climate change and variability are limited by changes in private behavior
and public policies, reducing exposure to both
extreme weather events and long-term climate
deterioration. It encompasses two broad areas:
(1) specific steps to reduce costs from climate
change (such as planting more resilient crops or
strengthening flood defenses) and (2) strengthening the capacity to respond to it (for example,

22This rises to 20 percent when account is taken of
the disproportionately high costs of climate change for
poorer parts of the world. This is not taken into account
in the scenarios of Figure 1.27.
23These cost assessments rise steeply (by a factor of
three) with more aggressive abatement designed to stabilize emissions at 450 ppm.

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.7. The Discounting Debate
The choice of discount rate is central to
assessments regarding the timing and extent of
many responses to climate change. Discussion
has focused on the result that the appropriate
rate to discount future consumption in a standard (Ramsey) growth models is given by
ρ ≡ σ + η.g,
where σ (the rate of pure time preference) is
the rate at which future utility is discounted,
g is the rate of growth of per capita consumption, and η is the elasticity of the marginal
utility of consumption (which describes the
rate at which society values the consumption
of better-off generations relative to those less
well off, and so captures aversion to inequality between the generations). The precise
view taken of these parameters matters deeply
because of the substantial mismatch in the timing of the costs incurred in limiting the damage
from climate change (which would occur soon)
and the benefits from doing so (occurring much
later). The lower the discount rate, the greater
the relative weight attached to future benefits,
and so the stronger the case for action now.
Stern and others (2007) take σ = 0.001, η = 1,
and g = 1.013, implying a discount rate ρ of
1.4 percent. The low value for σ reflects the
view that equal weight should be given to the
welfare of all current and future generations

through improved weather forecasting or fuller
planning for associated fiscal risks).
Significant adaptation is likely to occur
through private market decisions, with no need
for public policy interventions—one example
being recent credit market innovations to create
specialized weather derivatives and catastrophe
bonds. Policy support is likely to be needed,
however, in response to extensive market failures
that impede efficient adaptation. These may
include the following:
• an undersupply of information on the need
and options for adapting to climate change,
and on shifting patterns of variability;

60

(with σ positive only to reflect the possibility of
global catastrophe). Critics such as Nordhaus
(2006) point out that this is not the only possible ethical position and does not appear to be
a realistic description of many decisions people
currently make (such as public investments in
infrastructure). Reflecting the importance of the
issue, raising the rate of pure time preference
even to (a still modest) 1.5 reduces the range
of expected damage costs from 5–20 percent to
1.4–6 percent of global consumption.
Views on the appropriate discount rate differ
in other respects too. Dasgupta (2007) argues
that a value of η = 1 is too low: it implies that
a 10 percent reduction in the consumption of
any future generation causes the same loss of
social welfare as does a 10 percent reduction in
current consumption—arguably, it should cause
less of a loss, because growth means that future
generations will have a higher level of consumption. Increasing the presumed value of this
elasticity value from the Stern value of 1 to a
modest 1.5 reduces the range of expected damage costs outlined above from 5–20 percent to
3–15 percent. As Stern and others (2007) point
out, however, a greater aversion to inequality
would also result in attaching more weight to
the more immediate welfare losses in poorer
countries, tending to strengthen the case for
prompt action.

• limited attention to the interests of future
generations, leading to insufficient investment
in reducing exposure to climate risk;
• credit market imperfections and insufficient
access to capital, hampering adaptation that
requires substantial investments, particularly
in the poorest countries; and
• moral hazard problems that can arise when
vulnerable households, firms, or governments are (or feel they are) protected against
climate risks. For example, individuals
may expect to be compensated for losses
through insurance indemnities or government disaster responses, and governments

APPENDIX 1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE: ECONOMIC IMPACT AND POLICY RESPONSES

may anticipate foreign support if a natural
disaster strikes.
Efficient adaptation will also require international coordination in the face of cross-border
vulnerabilities, for example, to manage major
river systems, such as the Ganges or the Nile,
in response to new patterns of water stress.
Similarly, governments may need to cooperate
at a global or regional level to overcome the
barriers to adaptation, for example, to improve
regional weather forecasting or deliver disaster
relief to migrating populations. Policy formation in this area is hampered, however, by a
shortage of strong quantitative evidence on the
likely scale of adaptation costs and benefits. One
estimate puts the costs of adaptation to protect
developing countries from climate change
risks at between $3 billion and $37 billion each
year—a very wide range (the higher figure being
roughly !/3 of total Official Development Assistance and concessional finance).

Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
There are several feasible ways of achieving significant mitigation, and future technological advances are likely to further broaden
the options. Putting them into effect, however, requires policies that are agreed on
among major emitters and are in their own
interests to actually implement. A crucial
task for policymakers (including international institutions) is to design such policies,
encourage and facilitate agreement on them,
and ensure that they are implemented. A
fundamental difficulty is overcoming the freerider problem implied by the externalities
involved: the harm caused by GHG emissions
is felt by the entire global community, whereas
the related costs of mitigation are borne fully by
the emitter—so that each country may have a
preference for mitigation by others rather than
itself.24
24This does not mean there is no national incentive
to mitigate: there may be local or national benefits from
reducing local air pollution or energy insecurity. National
and collective interests, however, remain potentially
misaligned.

Core policy options for GHG mitigation are
the following:
• taxes on GHG emissions, the first-best being
a carbon tax applied uniformly across both
emission sources and countries. Some existing
tax instruments—notably, fuel excises—bear
on emissions, but the approach is generally
far from systematic;
• “cap-and-trade” schemes, which fix a total
quantity of emissions while allowing trade
in the associated rights to emit (such as the
Emission Trading Scheme of the European
Union, EU-ETS, discussed below);
• hybrid schemes, which combine elements of
both tax and cap-and-trade schemes;
• energy efficiency standards for vehicles,
buildings, and industrial processes, such as the
U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards or the Japanese “top runner” program;
• subsidies to develop and deliver new and/or
improved energy efficiency, energy storage,
renewables, nuclear, and carbon sequestration technologies (such as expenditure in
the European Union under the Framework
Programme budget); and
• governance and incentive schemes to reduce
deforestation and agricultural emissions (such
as the payments to forest owners in Costa Rica
and Mexico).
The first five of these are aimed at reducing fossil-fuel-related carbon emissions, which
represent about 60 percent (and rising) of total
GHG emissions. The last is relevant mainly in
developing countries, where substantial scope
for low-cost reductions in deforestation has been
identified (see, for instance, Chomitz, 2007; and
Grieg-Gran, 2006).
Policy should be designed to deliver mitigation efficiently, and with a distribution of the
costs and benefits that is perceived as fair. In
general, this requires policies that equalize
marginal abatement costs across sectors and
countries, with appropriate compensatory
mechanisms to correct any undesirable distributional effects.
A key policy choice, likely to become central
in discussions of climate policies beyond the

61

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Kyoto Protocol period (2008–12), is between
carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems. Under
ideal conditions—tradability and auctioning
of emissions rights, perfect competition, and
full certainty about abatement costs—a system
of uniform GHG emission taxes is equivalent
to a common cap-and-trade scheme: that is,
they could lead to the same level of abatement,
achieved at the same (minimized) total cost, and
raise the same amount of revenue.
Under more realistic assumptions, however,
the two instruments differ significantly. One
key factor is uncertainty about the costs of
reducing GHG emissions (see Box 1.8, based
on Weitzman, 1974). In the case in which the
marginal cost of reducing emissions increases
only slowly with the level of reduction, while
the marginal benefit from such abatement
falls quickly, a cap-and-trade scheme is typically
preferable to a tax scheme. Intuitively, a flat
marginal cost curve means that surprises in the
level of marginal costs will have a large impact
on the realized level of mitigation under a tax
scheme (compared with none, of course, under
a cap-and-trade scheme) that, because of the
steep marginal benefit curve, has a large impact
on realized social benefit. By similar reasoning,
a tax regime will tend to be preferable when the
marginal cost curve is relatively steep and the
damage function is relatively flat.
To see the implications of this in the climate
change context, recall that the harm from global
warming arises not from the flow but from the
cumulative stock of emissions. This means that
the expected damage function is relatively flat,
because emissions over any relatively brief interval add relatively little to the accumulated GHG
stock. This may lead to a preference for a tax
instrument set over relatively short periods, but
adjusted in its evolution over time by monitoring
the associated emissions (and better informed,
it is to be hoped, by increased understanding of the impact of alternative atmospheric
concentrations).
Political economy considerations may also
influence the choice between the two
approaches. Proponents of cap-and-trade

62

schemes argue that coordinating tax strategies
across countries and jurisdictions is difficult.
Moreover, caps can be allocated in a way that
reduces the distributional consequences of
mitigation and fosters interest in maintaining
the scheme, thus reducing the risk that the
scheme will be abandoned in the future. It may
also be easier to explain a policy based explicitly on scientific guidance about appropriate
emissions levels than a simple tax scheme. Others argue that taxation offers clearer and more
stable signals about the future value of emissions reductions, or may be a more useful tool
for importing countries faced with monopolistic
supply, 25 while some trading schemes may be
subject to substantial price volatility (price
being more sensitive to demand shocks when
total supply is fixed).
Hybrid schemes, combining features of both
tax and cap-and-trade schemes, have been
proposed to address some of the drawbacks of
pure tax and cap-and-trade schemes. These
involve, for example, selling extra permits at
a fixed price so as to eliminate price spikes.
However, these schemes have potential limitations, for example, by increasing the difficulty of devising mechanisms to link trading
schemes.26
In practice, a controversial feature of capand-trade schemes has been a tendency for
emissions rights to be partly or fully given away
without charge to emitters, rather than auctioned to the highest bidders. This makes the
introduction of the scheme more palatable to
current emitters, but dissipates a potential
source of government revenue. Under the EUETS (Box 1.9), at least 95 percent of emissions
25For example, Strand (forthcoming) shows that a
tax has advantages for importers in giving a strategic
advantage when fossil-fuel supply is monopolistic, since
the exporter then tends to select a less aggressive pricing
and/or supply strategy in the tax case. Put differently, a
tax is in these circumstances a more effective device for
importers to extract rent from exporters.
26McKibbin and Wilcoxen (2002), for instance, propose
a scheme under which the short-run carbon price is
determined by a cap-and-trade scheme with a ceiling
price, but with no trading across countries.

The optimal level of emissions reduction is
found where the marginal social benefit from
such abatement (MBA) equals its marginal cost
(MCA), which is at abatement level A in each
panel of the figure. If it were known that the
MCA curve would be exactly the unbroken line
shown, that optimum could be achieved either
by simply mandating abatement of A or by setting
a tax on emissions at the level T (this being such
that when the private sector equates the cost it
would incur if it chose to reduce emissions slightly
to the tax it would pay if it did not, it will abate
exactly to A). The two instruments would thus be
exactly equivalent. But suppose now that—after
the policy instrument has been set and before it
can be changed—abatement costs turn out to be
higher, at MCA′. In this case, the ideal outcome
would be the level of abatement at point C. With
the tax fixed at T, however, abatement will actually
be at B, to the left of C—that is, there will be too
little abatement. Comparing the marginal benefits
and costs associated with this policy error, there
is an ex post welfare loss—relative to the ideal at
C—given by the triangle BDC. The quantity restriction will also differ from the ex post optimum if
marginal costs turn out to be MCA′: in this case,
with quantity fixed at A, there will too much
abatement, with a welfare loss given by the triangle CEF. Conversely, if marginal abatement costs
turn out lower than expected, at MCA″, there is a
welfare loss associated with too much abatement
under the tax scheme, and a loss associated with
too little abatement under the quantity scheme.
Comparing the upper and lower panels,
whether the loss from the tax instrument is
greater or less than that from quantity setting
depends on the relative slopes of the MBA and
MCA curves. Taxes are preferred in the lower
panel, where MBA is relatively flat and MCA
relatively steep.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.9. Experience with Emissions Trading in the European Union
The EU-ETS, initiated in 2005, is a central
policy instrument to meet the EU greenhouse
gas emissions goals under the Kyoto Protocol. It
aims at capping overall carbon dioxide emissions from electric power utilities and major
industrial emitters representing about 40 percent of total EU carbon emissions. Emissions
rights for Phases I and II (2005–07 and 2008–
12) are allocated to individual installations,
which are free to trade with other participants
in the event of either surplus or insufficient
permits to cover actual emissions levels.
The scheme is intended to promote economic efficiency in implementing a given
overall emissions reduction, by enabling
participating firms to reduce their emissions at
the lowest marginal abatement costs. A number
of design flaws, however, have reduced the
scheme’s effectiveness.
First, the total allocation has turned out to
exceed actual emissions in the initial 2005–07
period, reflecting, among other things, informational difficulties and reduced demand for
energy after the sharp run-up in oil prices.
The current cap-setting process for Phase II
(2008–12) is expected to generate some, rather

emissions, cannot cater for variance in abatement costs at the firm level, and forgo potential
revenue. Standards can, however, be useful
when individuals are shortsighted in evaluating
returns on investments. In addition, their use
may be appropriate in markets where assessment of alternatives is constrained by substantial
complexity or high transaction costs relative to
the potential benefits, for example, in consumer
electronics markets.27
The introduction of realistic carbon pricing,
whether through tax or cap-and-trade schemes,

27Spending on federal energy efficiency appliance

savings of $1,270 per household (Meyers and others,
2002).

64

limited, market scarcity, with emissions reduction in the region of 2.4 percent compared
with BAU expected in 2010 (see Capoor and
Ambrosi, 2007).
Second, the provision of free allocations to
participating installations has created market
expectations that free allocations in the future
will be based on current emissions, thus limiting
the current incentive to abate. Rigid exit and
entry rules (whereby exiting units lose their
free allocations, and new entering units in most
cases obtain fully free allocations) add to these
problems.
The EU-ETS is a pioneering example of
coordinated international action on climate
change. Progress is being made to improve its
design and operations, with increased harmonization of allocations, monitoring, and compliance methodologies. Further reform is needed,
however, to improve its economic efficiency, for
example, in regard to the rules for allocating
emissions rights, in total and within and across
participating countries. Community-based,
rather than national, cap-setting is another issue
for consideration for the promotion of a more
harmonized scheme.

can do much to provide appropriate incentives
to develop alternative energy sources. Public
subsidies to develop new, immature, or strategically important energy efficiency, energy storage,
renewables, nuclear, and carbon sequestration technologies may nevertheless be a useful
supplement to emissions taxes and cap-and-trade
schemes if there are significant positive externalities related to their development and production. Private developers of new technologies may
not reap the full social returns from developing
new technologies (perhaps because they can be
easily copied), which leads to underinvestment
in the absence of subsidies. However, largescale subsidies of this kind also have substantial
drawbacks: they reduce the cost of production
and thus may increase polluting output; in addition, tax-based incentives not only forgo revenue

APPENDIX 1.2. CLIMATE CHANGE: ECONOMIC IMPACT AND POLICY RESPONSES

directly but can also create avoidance opportunities; finally, the correct levels of subsidy are
difficult to determine. Given the revenue at
stake, monitoring the cost and effectiveness of
such subsidies is likely to become increasingly
important.

Problems of Policy Coordination and
Implementation
A core challenge is to reach agreement
among major emitting countries on the implementation of policies to limit future GHG
emissions. This is difficult for the following
reasons:
• The negative externalities related to GHG
emissions are global, so that countries’ selfinterest may not lead them to mitigate as
much as their collective interest requires.
• Although abatement must start soon to have
any significant future impact, the bulk of the
prospective benefits arise relatively far in the
future. Voters and policymakers may thus give
too little emphasis to future benefits from current abatement.
• The considerable uncertainty that remains,
including in relation to very damaging but
low-probability events, calls for prudence—but
may also imply some value, to a degree, in
limiting costly actions now (recognizing that
they might divert resources from alternative
uses that have clear immediate benefit) while
learning more about the problem and possible solutions.
• The potential future damage from climate
change reflects past emissions, almost 80 percent of which originated in advanced economies (see Figure 1.24). This would suggest
that they bear greater responsibility for the climate problem. On the other hand, however,
more than half of current total emissions, and
a much larger share of future emissions, are
expected to be generated by less-advanced
economies (see Figure 1.25).
• The effects of climate change are unevenly
distributed across countries. Many tropical
countries (most of which are poor) will sustain large losses from further global warming.

Some currently cool countries (including
Canada, Russia, and northern Europe) can
instead expect to lose little, or even gain,
from moderate climate change.
• Countries naturally fear disadvantaging
their producers in world markets by raising
energy prices unless their competitors do
likewise.
Initial steps toward international cooperation—
most notably the Kyoto Protocol—have had only
limited success. Figure 1.29 shows emissions for
major industrial countries effectively subject to
emissions limitations under the Kyoto Protocol,
both in 2004 and as projected for 2012 (when
the Kyoto Protocol expires), together with their
Kyoto Protocol targets. The United States,
also included here, was assigned an emissions
reduction under the Kyoto Protocol but did not
ratify the Protocol and is thus not committed
to it. Several ratifying countries are currently
some way from achieving their commitments.
The punishment for any such failure—tighter
targets under any future agreement—is small
and perhaps not credible.28
Early agreement on extension and development of mechanisms beyond the end of the
Kyoto Protocol is critical, not least given the
long lead time for many energy investments and
the consequent need for reducing uncertainty
about likely future carbon prices. It will also be a
major policy challenge to broaden the coverage
of a new mechanism to include major emitters
in emerging market and low-income countries.
Some efforts to limit emissions currently
undertaken by parties not bound by the Kyoto
Protocol, notably Australia and the United
States, have supported the development and
diffusion of new technologies designed to
promote energy efficiency. In addition, some
non–Annex I countries have made efforts to
reform energy pricing and reduce deforestation
in order to increase energy security and reduce

28The punishment for not fulfilling emissions reductions committed to under the Kyoto Protocol is that
quotas will be reduced by 130 percent of current shortfall
in future (as yet unspecified) implementation periods.

local air pollution. In each case, there have been
important cobenefits in constraining the growth
of GHG emissions.
A range of wider international frameworks
and processes is being developed, which should
help to reduce GHG emissions. These include
collaborative efforts to promote technology
cooperation, such as the Asia-Pacific Partnership, together with a joint project between
the European Union and China designed to
establish a carbon storage demonstration project, potentially an important precursor to more
widescale diffusion of such technology. Finally,
international cooperation in relation to the
design and implementation of energy efficiency
standards is raising the potential cost-effectiveness of energy savings across countries and
strengthening incentives to innovate throughout
the supply chain.

Climate change resulting from man-made
increases in atmospheric GHG concentrations
presents a serious challenge to human welfare.
Understanding of both the issue and potential
policy responses has developed rapidly in recent
years, but much remains to be learned, including the nature, extent, and likelihood of the
macroeconomic and fiscal effects from climate
change and alternative responses to it.
Dealing effectively with climate change
requires international cooperation to manage
risks and associated economic costs related to
necessary reductions in GHG emissions and
development of adaptive capacity. Existing cooperative mechanisms will need to be extended
significantly in breadth, depth, and efficiency,
while paying due regard to the need for equitable sharing of the burden, in order to meet this
challenge.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Against the background of the global outlook outlined
in Chapter 1, this chapter analyzes prospects and
policy issues in the major advanced economies and in
the main regional groupings of emerging market and
developing countries. A consistent theme is that policymakers around the world face the immediate challenge
of maintaining strong noninflationary growth in the
face of recent turbulent global financial conditions.
They also need to continue to push forward with
reforms necessary to ensure continued strong growth in
the future.

United States and Canada: Uncertainties
About the U.S. Outlook Have Risen
Following a weak start to 2007, the U.S.
economy rebounded strongly in the second
quarter, growing by 3.8 percent (annualized
rate). Net exports and business investment
provided a significant boost to growth, although
private consumption growth slowed markedly in
the face of rising gasoline prices, and residential
investment continued to exert a significant drag
on growth (Figure 2.1). Recent data, however,
have painted a weaker picture of the U.S. economy going forward, reflecting in part the impact
of the recent turmoil in financial markets. While
personal consumption spending, employment,
and nonresidential construction data have been
solid, housing market indicators have been
very weak, and consumer sentiment, the ISM
business surveys, and durable goods orders all
declined in the most recent readings.
Against this background, the projection for
U.S. growth in 2007 as a whole is unchanged at
1.9 percent, but has been lowered by 0.9 percentage point (relative to the July World Economic Outlook Update) to 1.9 percent in 2008
(Table 2.1). Ongoing difficulties in the mortgage market are expected to extend the decline
in residential investment, while house price
declines are likely to encourage households to

Figure 2.1. United States: Indicators of Investment
(Percent change from a year earlier unless otherwise stated)
Weak investment spending, particularly in the residential sector, has been at the heart
of the U.S. economic slowdown. Against the background of recent financial market
turbulence, the investment outlook remains very uncertain.

raise their saving rate out of current incomes
and thereby dampen consumption spending.
Exports, however, are expected to grow robustly,
benefiting from the continued decline in the
dollar and solid growth in partner countries,
and healthy corporate balance sheets should
support business investment.
Risks to this outlook, however, are on the
downside. While the recent further weakening
of the U.S. dollar could lead to more vigorous
export growth than in the baseline forecast,
three downside risks are particularly apparent.
• First, while the turmoil in the financial markets appears to have eased, at this stage it is
unclear to what extent the cost and availability

70

of credit across the broader economy will be
affected. The reintermediation of credit onto
the balance sheets of banks as they absorb
off-balance-sheet entities that are experiencing
financial difficulties could curtail new lending,
while difficulties among specialized mortgage
lenders will reduce the availability of housing
finance. Spreads in high-yield markets are also
likely to remain elevated, affecting the investment outlook. A significant pullback in lending by financial institutions would clearly have
negative implications for the growth outlook.
• Second, there are significant downside risks
from the housing market. With inventories
of unsold homes high, rising delinquencies

UNITED STATES AND CANADA: UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE U.S. OUTLOOK HAVE RISEN

and tighter credit conditions in the subprime
mortgage market, and the cost of some other
types of higher-quality mortgages rising, a
deeper and more protracted housing downturn than assumed in the current baseline is
a risk. Not only would this extend the decline
in residential investment, but deeper falls in
house prices would put additional pressure
on household finances and consumption, particularly if the labor market were to continue
to weaken (see Box 2.1 for a discussion of the
effects of house prices on growth).
• Third, at this stage it is unclear to what extent
the recent sharp slowdown in productivity
growth is attributable to structural, as opposed
to cyclical, factors. Reflecting the view that the
slowdown is indeed partly structural, IMF staff
estimates of medium-term potential growth
have been marked down to 2¾ percent. But, if
underlying productivity growth is weaker than
now estimated, this would feed through into
expectations of future incomes, thus reducing
consumption and investment spending.
With the economy weakening, inflation pressures have moderated. As measured by the core
personal consumption expenditure deflator,
12-month inflation has come down below 2 percent. Pressures on core inflation are expected to
continue to ease in the coming months against
the backdrop of slowing growth in shelter costs
(which have been an important driver of core
inflation over the past year) and modest growth,
although the depreciation of the dollar could
add to import prices.
Against the background of the changing balance of risks to growth and inflation, the Federal
Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis
points to 4.75 percent at its September meeting.
Looking forward, signs that growth was likely
to continue below trend would justify further
interest rate reductions, provided that inflation
remains contained. At this stage, markets expect
the Fed to cut rates by a further 50 basis points
in the coming months.
The current account deficit is projected to
narrow, reaching 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008
compared with 6.2 percent of GDP in 2006,

assuming that the real effective value of

import demand are expected to more than
offset the impact of higher oil prices and
lower net investment income. Despite the large
external borrowing needed to finance the
deficit, valuation gains from the depreciating

The Run-Up in House Prices
Traditional valuation measures, ratios of
both house price to income and house price to
rent, have risen steeply in several Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and emerging market countries in
recent years (first figure). Specifically,
• Relative to incomes and rents, many industrial

Following a long run-up, house prices in the
United States have decelerated sharply since
mid-2005, and the subsequent drop in residential investment has been a substantial drag
on the economy over the past year. Housing
markets in many other countries—in both
advanced and emerging market economies—
have experienced boom conditions in recent
years, and some of these have also recently
shown signs of softening. So far, these moderations have occurred without the deep
correction seen in the United States, but there
remains the concern that the U.S. experience
might presage steep housing downturns in
other countries that have also experienced a
rapid rise in house prices, with associated risks
for output growth.
Recent financial turbulence has raised the
risk of more drawn-out difficulties in the
U.S. housing sector that could have a deeper
impact on the broader economy. Tightening
credit conditions could affect a broader range
of households and further curtail effective
demand for housing. And house prices could
decline more sharply than currently expected
with implications for residential investment
and consumer spending. At the same time,
credit conditions may also tighten in some of
the western European countries—because of
their large exposures to asset-backed commercial paper and continuing strains in short-term
funding markets—and this could have a significant bearing on the housing market in these
countries.

in house prices than the United States. For
the OECD countries on average, the ratio of
house price to income has risen by more than
one-third, and the ratio of house price to rent
by almost two-thirds, since 1997. The largest
increases in house prices relative to incomes
have been experienced by France, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. By contrast, Germany and Japan have
experienced falling house price valuation
ratios over the past 10 years.
• Based on limited data, many emerging market
economies have also experienced substantial
house price run-ups since 2000, exceeding
growth in per capita incomes. The largest
increases were recorded in Estonia and Latvia
(although data are only for the capital cities
and are therefore likely to overestimate countrywide growth). Other large price rises, with
real house prices almost doubling or more,
were recorded in the Czech Republic, Lithuania, and South Africa. However, real house
prices have declined in Colombia, Indonesia,
and Singapore.
• In China, the increase in real house prices
was less than real income growth over the
same period, although there have been
localized booms in fast-growing cities such as
Beijing and Shanghai.
Risk of Weakening Housing Markets
The risk of a broader weakening in housing
markets depends partly on how much of the
previous price rise can be justified by changes
in fundamental determinants of house prices,
including interest rates, availability of financing, income growth, and demographics. It also
depends on how those fundamentals, including
long-term interest rates, evolve in the future.
The assessment is likely to differ across countries, as will the time horizon over which the
risk applies.1
1See, for example, Girouard and others (2006) and
the collection of papers presented at the Jackson Hole
Symposium on Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy, August 30–September 1, 2007.

The following analysis extends and updates
an earlier IMF study that modeled house price
inflation as a function of an affordability ratio
(the lagged ratio of house prices to disposable
incomes), the growth in disposable income per
capita, short-term interest rates, credit growth,
growth in the country’s equity market index,
and growth in the working-age population (see
Terrones, 2004). The previous study is extended
in two ways. First, long-term interest rates are
included in addition to the variables considered
in the previous study. This is generally found
to be significant. Second, separate equations
are estimated for each country, so that the
role assigned to each factor is allowed to vary
across countries, although the same variables
are included for all countries. The equation is
estimated for a group of 18 OECD countries for
which adequate data are available, using quarterly data for the period 1970–2006.
The results indicate that almost threequarters of the rise in real house prices over the
period 1997–2006 can be explained on average
by the estimated model, although this still leaves
a significant unexplained component. For the
United States, real house prices are assessed
to have risen by about one-third more than
explained by fundamentals (second figure).
The unexplained share of house price increases
is assessed to be still larger in a number of
other countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. However,
there is considerable uncertainty about these
estimates, because local conditions that are
not captured in the econometric analysis could
play an important role. For example, migration
patterns, supply constraints, and changes in the
availability of mortgage financing—including to
the subprime sector—could all be relevant. On
the other hand, some of the increase in house
prices that is explained by the model, such as
through the role for credit growth, may not
reflect solely economic fundamentals. Nevertheless, taken at face value, the estimates suggest
that a number of advanced economies’ housing markets outside the United States could be
vulnerable to a correction.

The countries most at risk from a weakening housing sector are likely to be those that
have experienced the largest increases in
house-price-sensitive components of aggregate
demand as well as those where the run-up in
prices seems less easily explained by changes
in fundamentals. Over the past decade, growth
has been boosted across many OECD economies by strong residential investment, with the
countries that experienced the largest runup in house prices generally witnessing the
strongest additional residential investment (see
second figure). For example, in Ireland and
Spain, the ratio of real residential investment
to GDP rose by 1.8 percentage points compared
with an increase of 0.6 percentage point in the
United States over the same period, although
part of the difference is accounted for by
weakening U.S. residential investment in 2006.2
Home builders’ ability to respond to higher
prices is, however, constrained in some countries, such as the Netherlands and the United
Kingdom, by planning restrictions and land
limits (Barker, 2004). This may help explain
why housing demand pressures have raised
prices more than has residential investment in
these countries.
When home builders perceive the profitability
of new housing investment to moderate, residential investment can decline rapidly, reversing some of the boost to output growth from
housing investment. This has already been a
significant feature of the housing correction in
the United States. A number of other countries,
such as Denmark, Ireland, and Spain, could
also be subject to such a correction. However,
the pace and depth of the corrections would
depend on country-specific factors. In the
United States, the correction has been exacerbated by the sharp reversal in the subprime
mortgage market, a factor less relevant else2The spread of increases in residential investment
is even larger in terms of nominal ratios of residential
investment to GDP, reflecting the variation in the relative price of housing.

where, because subprime mortgages represent a
much smaller share of lending.
A decline in house prices could also affect
the broader economy through its impact on
consumer spending. The strength of this link
would again vary across countries and also
depend on why house prices have changed.
Weakening house prices would be expected to
dampen spending of some households through
a negative “wealth effect,” although other
households (such as renters planning to buy
a home) are made better off by lower prices.
Spending can also be affected through a collateral channel, because house price movements
affect the value of home equity and the terms
under which households can borrow from
banks. This latter effect tends to be stronger
in economies such as the United Kingdom and
the United States, where financing of home
equity withdrawal is more easily available. 3 The
figure shows that the cross-country correlation between the household saving ratio and
house prices is weak. Research also suggests
that these links vary over time within a given
country, depending on why house prices have
varied.4 For example, in the United Kingdom,
house price rises were more strongly associated
with rising income expectations in the mid- to
late 1980s than during the recent run-up. This
may help explain why the earlier period was

improved slightly in 2006 for the third year
running. Nevertheless, although the real effective U.S. dollar is still estimated to be above
its medium-term fundamental value, valuation gains cannot be relied on to stabilize the
liability stock going forward. It is therefore
important that national savings increase in the

associated with a more pronounced consumption boom.
Consumer spending is also influenced by
many factors other than house prices. Relevant
factors include current and expected incomes,
financial market wealth, and retail lending
conditions. During the recent U.S. housing correction, robust employment growth and solid
equity market performance have supported
consumption. The extent to which a weakening
housing market is associated with weaker spending in other economies will also depend on the
evolution of these factors.
In sum, after a period of remarkable house
price growth, conditions have eased back in
a number of advanced economies’ housing
markets. There is some risk to global output
growth from these developments: economies
that have experienced a larger unexplained
increase in house prices than the United
States account for almost 20 percent of the
total output of advanced economies. These
risks may have been exacerbated by recent
market turmoil and by an associated repricing of risk. Furthermore, western European
banks are exposed to the U.S. housing sector,
and strains in short-term funding markets
could restrain their lending activity and have
an adverse impact on the housing market in
these countries. The extent of these risks is, as
yet, unclear. In general, residential investment
is the component of demand most at risk to
weaker housing market conditions, although
consumption could also come under pressure
in some countries. Spillovers from the U.S.
housing market have also occurred through
financial channels, and such links need to be
carefully monitored.

coming years to support a reduction in the current account deficit.
Fiscal developments have remained favorable, with the federal government deficit now
expected to come in at 1.2 percent of GDP in
FY2007, less than half of that budgeted. This
overperformance reflects both revenue buoy-

ancy and lower-than-budgeted expenditures.1
Going forward, the U.S. administration aims
to balance the budget by FY2012 (a target also
adopted by the U.S. Congress in its own budget
resolution). Official projections, however, do not
fully account for the alternative minimum tax
relief or war costs in future years. The projections also assume spending restraint that may be
difficult to achieve. Adjusting for these items,
the IMF staff projects that the deficit will likely
remain above 1 percent of GDP through FY2012.
In the IMF staff’s view, a more ambitious fiscal
consolidation strategy than currently envisaged,
combined with reforms to Social Security and
Medicare, would better help ensure long-term
fiscal sustainability, although automatic fiscal
stabilizers should be allowed to operate in the
event of a protracted downturn. Such a fiscal
strategy should aim at achieving budget balance,
excluding the Social Security surplus. Spending
restraint is essential in this regard, but steps to
increase revenues also may be considered.
The recent turmoil in financial markets
has underscored the need for regulators and
supervisors to increase their focus on several
aspects of the U.S. financial system (see also the
October 2007 Global Financial Stability Report, or
GFSR). For example, greater transparency and
disclosure by systemically important financial
institutions, including of their links with offbalance-sheet vehicles, would help reduce uncertainties about counterparty risk that were at
the center of the drying up of liquidity in some
parts of the financial markets. It is also important to consider how securitization and financial
innovation more generally have affected the
incentive structure in financial markets. This
would include looking at whether the incentives
for loan originators to accurately assess risk have

1Estimates suggest that 40 percent of the revenue
increase during 2004–06 can be explained by corporate
profits growing faster than GDP, 40 percent by the growth
of capital gains, and much of the remaining 20 percent
by stronger income growth at the upper end of the
income distribution (which, given the progressive tax
system, implies higher average tax rates). See Swiston,
Mühleisen, and Mathai (2007).

76

been diluted, and whether investors put excessive reliance on rating agencies in assessing risks
rather than conducting their own due diligence.
In Canada, real GDP growth accelerated to
over 3 percent in the first half of 2007. Strong
domestic demand remained the main driver
of growth, boosted by continuing gains in the
terms of trade and strong credit and employment growth, while the inventory correction,
which had been a significant drag on growth in
late 2006, reversed. Nevertheless, the short-term
outlook is clouded by weaker prospects in the
United States and the recent global financial
market turmoil, which has affected parts of the
Canadian markets, and the growth forecast for
2008 has been marked down to 2.3 percent
(0.5 percentage point lower than in the July
World Economic Outlook Update). With core CPI
inflation above the midpoint of the Bank of Canada’s 1–3 percent target range despite the substantial appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the
central bank raised its policy rate to 4½ percent
in July (the first increase since May 2006), but
has remained on hold since. The fiscal position
remains strong, with the budget in surplus and
the public debt ratio on a firm downward path.

Western Europe: How Resilient Is
the Recovery?
The financial market turbulence has come at a
time when western Europe has been enjoying its
best economic performance for a decade. A long
spell of robust global growth, healthy corporate
balance sheets, accommodative financing conditions, and past reforms have laid the foundation
for a strong upswing. The euro area economy
has been expanding at about 3 percent (year on
year) since the middle of 2006, although growth
eased in the second quarter of 2007, partly
owing to weather and holiday effects. Growth
has been driven by a broad-based acceleration in
investment spending, especially in Germany, in
response to high regional and global demand for
machinery and equipment, a pickup in construction, and robust exports. Private consumption
softened in the first half of 2007, reflecting the

WESTERN EUROPE: HOW RESILIENT IS THE RECOVERY?

German value-added tax (VAT) hike and preelection uncertainty in France, but consumer
confidence remained fairly robust until June,
when it began to weaken. In the United Kingdom, the expansion has continued at a strong
and steady pace, with growth of 3 percent (year
on year) in the second quarter of 2007, led by
consumption. In Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, growth was also sustained above potential
rates in the second quarter.
Recent data provide mixed signals about the
likely growth performance of western European
economies in the coming quarters, although
the recent financial market turbulence and
weaker growth in the United States are pointing
to a likely slowdown. Euro area growth is now
forecast to slow to about 2.5 percent in 2007 and
2.1 percent in 2008, while growth in the United
Kingdom is now expected to ease from 3.1 percent in 2007 to 2.3 percent in 2008. Exports will
be affected by weakening external demand, and
the strength of the euro is likely to weigh on
export prospects of countries lacking a sufficient
cushion in competitiveness, including France,
Portugal, and Spain. The tightening of global
credit conditions is likely to lead to some cooling of European housing markets and dampening prospects for residential investment and
household consumption. Growth is also likely to
be affected by tighter availability of bank credit.
A number of European banks have significant
exposure to the U.S. housing market, particularly through off-balance-sheet vehicles supported by backup lines of credit, and the sector
as a whole has been affected by the higher cost
of funding and liquidity shortages. Responding
to pressures in short-term interbank markets,
the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
Bank of England (BoE) stepped in to provide
liquidity. On a more positive note, high capacity
utilization and strong corporate profitability are
projected to support investment, while recent
improvements in the labor market should help
to hold up consumer spending.2
2Recently approved tax cuts in France will also support
activity in 2008.

The balance of risks to the outlook are to the
downside. Deteriorating conditions in credit
markets could further slow consumption and
investment, particularly if banks sharply curtail
lending in the coming quarters as they seek
to improve their balance sheets in what still
remains a volatile and uncertain environment.
In countries where housing prices still seem
elevated—France, Ireland, Spain, and the United
Kingdom—growth dynamics will depend on
the pace of adjustment in the housing sector in
response to tightening credit conditions and, in
some cases, changes in the fiscal treatment of
housing investment. Other risks—mainly relating
to volatile oil prices, a more protracted slowdown
in the U.S. economy, and a disorderly unwinding
of global imbalances—are also to the downside.
The euro area headline CPI has remained
below 2 percent this year, but ticked up in September and is expected to temporarily exceed
this threshold during the remainder of the year
on account of higher energy and food prices
(Figure 2.2). It is projected to hover around
2 percent in 2008 as tighter credit conditions,
lower pressures of resources, as well as the
unwinding of the German VAT increase are
expected to offset rising energy costs. Despite
continuing tightening in the labor markets,
wage growth in the euro area is expected to
remain moderate in the coming quarters, as
the slowdown in activity, appreciation of the
euro, and structural changes in the labor supply,
including increased competition (partly due
to the enlargement of the European Union)
and large migration inflows, should continue
to keep inflation in check (Box 2.2). In the
United Kingdom, inflation temporarily overshot
the BoE’s 2 percent target, in part owing to the
pass-through of energy price increases, but has
recently fallen below the target.
The ECB and the BoE tightened monetary
policy through June in the face of rising resource
utilization and firming inflation, but have
remained appropriately on hold since the onset
of the financial market turmoil. In the euro
area, considering the downside risks to growth
and inflation from financial market turmoil,

Figure 2.2. Western Europe: What Is the Outlook
for Inflation?
Inflation has been firming up in the euro area in tandem with rising resource
utilization. Wages are not yet outpacing productivity, but structural changes in the
labor supply are moderating the pickup in wages. Productivity improvements seem
to have been concentrated in cyclical industries so far.

2Differences between inflation expectations from 10-year breakeven rates in the United
Kingdom and the Bank of England's inflation target are, in part, because bonds are indexed

because, in contrast to the CPI, the RPI includes interest rate payments on mortgages.

monetary policy can afford to stay on hold over
the near term. However, as these downside risks
dissipate, some further tightening may well be
required. Conversely, in the event of a more protracted slowdown, an easing of monetary policy
would need to be considered. In the United
Kingdom, the monetary authorities will need
to consider similar factors—with inflation, the
exchange rate, the possible softening in domestic
credit supply, and the U.S. outlook to be weighed
against the strength of domestic demand.
Many, although not all, euro area countries
took advantage of buoyant revenue growth in
2006 to advance fiscal consolidation. The euro
area’s cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit declined
by almost 1 percentage point of GDP in 2006,
led by reductions in Germany, France, and Italy
(adjusting for one-off measures), and public
debt declined relative to GDP. The challenge is
to continue the progress on fiscal consolidation.
Besides preparing for population aging, lower
fiscal deficits would help create room for cutting
distortionary taxes, laying the ground for a longlasting improvement in economic performance.
Under the reformed Stability and Growth Pact,
most countries in the euro area are aiming for
budget balance or even a small surplus over
the medium term, and countries that have
not yet reached their medium-term objectives
are required to adjust by at least ½ percent of
GDP a year. However, this goal seems unlikely
to be met in a number of countries, including
France (which has recently approved a package
of tax cuts) and Italy (where the government
has scaled back its fiscal adjustment in 2007–08,
despite significant revenue overperformance).
The euro area’s long-term prospects hinge on
its ability to accelerate productivity and employment growth, as well as improve structural
flexibility of member countries’ economies.
Employment performance has strengthened
recently owing to past reforms and cyclical
factors, but productivity performance remains
lackluster. Although the euro area fares well on
international comparisons of productivity in tradable goods sectors, its productivity in services,
which tend to be more sheltered from competi-

Although unemployment has declined significantly over the past several years in the euro
area, labor costs have not accelerated. Labor
costs decelerated during 1992–97 and have
moved sideways thereafter. Specifically, the rate
of increase of compensation per employee and
negotiated wages declined from about 7 percent
in 1992 to about 2 percent in 1997 and has
hovered between 1½ percent and 2½ percent a
year since then, and real wage growth has also
been declining (figure). Changes in national
policies and union behavior as well as increased
competition from emerging market countries
were the key factors underlying these developments. Measures such as the exemption of small
and medium-size enterprises from the 35-hour
workweek in France increased scope for fixedterm and part-time contracts in Italy (under the
so-called Biagi reforms), and flexible workingtime agreements between employers and unions
in various sectors in Germany have facilitated

Background

Labor Market Indicators for the Euro Area

1960–64

Labor market performance in the euro area
appears to have improved significantly over
the past decade. During the 1970s, against the
background of expanding welfare states, growing union assertiveness, and macroeconomic
policy misjudgments, oil price and other shocks
led to a sharp increase in unemployment and
inflation and a decline in labor force participation. Experiences over the past few years could
not have been more different: whereas oil
and administrative prices grew rapidly, wages
remained subdued and unemployment fell to
a quarter-century low of 7 percent in mid-2007.
This box examines the factors underlying the
improved trade-off between wages and unemployment and concludes that labor market
reforms have made an important contribution
in this regard. Nonetheless, more work remains
to be done to continue reducing unemployment on a sustainable basis and to boost the still
relatively low labor force participation.

increased flexibility and have helped contain
the growth of labor costs.
Analytical Framework
The labor supply (wage) curve proposed in
Blanchflower and Oswald (1990) provides a
framework for estimating the effect of labor
market reforms on the supply of labor. In this

79

CHAPTER 2

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Box 2.2 (concluded)
framework, real wages adjusted for productivity
changes are modeled as a function of the unemployment rate and supply-side factors:
Wt
ln ––––
= αt – θ ln(ut ),
Ct At
where Wt denotes wages, Ct is the consumer price
index, At is the total factor productivity (scaled
by the labor share), ut is the unemployment rate,
and αt denotes the cumulative effect of factors
that affect wage-setting behavior and thus shift
the wage curve. These factors include changes in
unemployment benefits, the tax wedge between
earned wages and workers’ purchasing power,
and employment preferences of workers.
The cumulative effect of labor market reforms
and changes in preferences toward employment, αt, can be obtained as a residual from the
above equation. Estimation of this equation for
euro area data from 1992 to 2006 shows that
αt declined gradually by about 6 percent over
this period, suggesting an improved trade-off
between wages and unemployment, that is, lower
unemployment for a given level of real wages.
Factors Behind Wage and Employment Developments
What are the factors that contributed to this
improved trade-off between wages and unemployment in the euro area since the early 1990s?
• Structural reforms have helped increase the
labor supply for any given real wage. Examples of such policies include the deregulation of part-time and “temp” work in Spain

tion, is subpar. Improving contestability of services markets (particularly wholesale and retail
trade and financial services) through deregulation and opening to foreign competition is critical for boosting long-term growth prospects. The
Services Directive goes a long way in this direction, and the challenge now is to implement it
in a meaningful way and possibly broaden it to
additional sectors. Continued labor and product
market reforms need to focus on strengthening
incentives to work and on improving wage flex-

and France in the 1990s. As a result of such
deregulation, the share of temporary employment in total employment increased significantly (see figure).1
Participation rates of older workers have risen
as a result of the phasing out of early retirement schemes. Similarly, female participation
has continued to increase (see figure).
Labor taxation has been reduced. Effective
social security contribution rates declined
in France, Germany, and Italy, and the tax
wedge (the difference between wages and
take-home pay) narrowed in France, Italy, and
Spain in the second half of the 1990s.
Greater emphasis has been given to employment by both unions and workers as their
preferences have shifted toward job preservation and job creation, possibly in response to
increased external competition, particularly
from Asian emerging market countries.
Higher net immigration has contributed
to moderate wage growth (see figure). The
employment of lower-cost immigrants in agriculture and other sectors has reduced overall
inflation, allowing workers to have the same
real wage growth for lower nominal wage
increases. Also, by reducing skill mismatches
and taking jobs that are difficult to fill, immigrants raise growth and welfare, increasing
overall employment.

ibility. The Lisbon Strategy holds promise in this
regard, provided its full potential is unleashed.
Further financial integration can facilitate sharing of risks relating to country-specific demand
or supply shocks (Stavrev, 2007).

Decisively Beaten in Japan
The Japanese economy contracted slightly in
the second quarter of 2007, following two quar-

INDUSTRIAL ASIA: DEFLATION IS NOT YET DECISIVELY BEATEN IN JAPAN

ters of strong gains. The decline in real GDP
in the quarter was driven largely by declines in
investment and weaker consumption growth.
Looking ahead, the September Tankan survey
showed that business confidence remains solid,
consistent with continued strong performance
by large exporters, but some recent data on
domestic demand, such as for household
consumption, have been more mixed. Further,
heightened global financial market volatility
has clouded the near-term outlook, although
the direct exposure of the Japanese financial
system to the U.S. subprime mortgage market is
limited.
Reflecting the weak second quarter outcome
and other incoming information, the projection
for real GDP growth has been marked down
to 2 percent in 2007 and 1.7 percent in 2008
(0.6 and 0.3 percentage point lower than in the
July World Economic Outlook Update). The tight
labor market—the unemployment rate stood at
3.8 percent in August—is expected to underpin
stronger income and consumption growth going
forward, and robust profits and healthy balance
sheets should provide support to corporate
investment. Risks to the outlook appear tilted
somewhat to the downside at this stage. While
faster wage growth could boost consumption
spending, growth would be dampened by a
more significant downturn in the global economy, higher oil prices, or a further appreciation
of the yen.
Despite four years of robust growth, deflation has yet to be decisively beaten (Figure 2.3).
Indeed, after a period of rising consumer prices,
the year-on-year changes in the headline and
core CPI have once again turned modestly
negative in recent months, although land prices
are now rising. While the decline in consumer
prices is likely to be reversed in the period
ahead as higher energy prices feed into the CPI,
prospects for a decisive move to positive inflation remain elusive. A number of factors seem to
be limiting inflation. Corporate investment has
been strong in recent years and, combined with
structural reforms that have boosted productivity, this has likely increased the growth potential

Figure 2.3. Japan: Deflation Still Not Decisively Beaten
Sustained growth in recent years has not yet resulted in a decisive exit from deflation.
With strong investment spending and improved productivity-boosting capacity, and
inflation expectations remaining low, price increases are likely to remain limited in the
near term.

of the economy. Indeed, measures of capacity
utilization have only recently begun to suggest
that the economy is working at full capacity. In
addition, wages have been held down by demographic changes that are seeing retiring older
workers with high wages replaced by younger,
lower-paid ones, and an increasing prevalence
of new hires under temporary employment
contracts who tend to have lower wages. Last,
inflation expectations are anchored at low levels
after many years of deflation. Although on some
measures expectations have risen in recent
months, consumers and investors are still apparently less certain about prospects for higher
inflation than they were a year ago.
Against this background, the Bank of Japan
has maintained an accommodative monetary
stance, keeping its policy rate steady at about
0.5 percent since February. Although interest
rates will eventually need to return to more
normal levels, such increases should await
clear signs that prospective inflation is moving
decisively higher and that concerns over recent
market volatility have waned. There is also scope
for the Bank of Japan to help guide inflation
expectations higher. A clearer indication from
the Bank of Japan of its desired inflation rate
and more forward-looking statements that
inform financial markets about the central
bank’s views of the likely evolution of risks to
growth and inflation and the likely future course
of monetary policy would help.
With central banks in many other countries tightening monetary policy over the past
year, interest rate differentials with Japan have
widened. Until the recent increase in financial
market volatility, this interest rate differential
had contributed to strong capital outflows from
Japan and a weaker yen. The yen carry trade—
the practice of borrowing in yen to purchase
higher-yielding assets in other currencies—was
only one factor behind these outflows. Japanese investors have also increasingly turned to
foreign investments to diversify their portfolios
and earn higher returns, with retail investors
(through mutual funds) and pension and life
insurance companies being the main sources.

82

Indeed, with the share of household financial
assets held overseas still small, such outflows
could be expected to continue going forward
even if interest rate differentials narrow.
The yen depreciated on a real effective basis
in the first half of 2007 to its weakest level in
more than two decades, but it has regained
ground recently as heightened financial market volatility has prompted some unwinding of
yen carry trade capital outflows. Although the
yen is undervalued relative to its medium-term
fundamentals, it is appropriate for monetary
policy to continue to focus on overcoming deflation and sustaining growth rather than on the
level of the exchange rate. Indeed, a premature
increase in policy rates could ultimately prove
counterproductive by undermining growth,
aggravating deflation, and working against the
resolution of global imbalances. Nevertheless,
as domestic economic fundamentals continue
to improve and/or ongoing financial market
volatility further discourages carry trade capital
outflows, it would be expected that the yen will
appreciate, and such upward pressures should
not be resisted.
Considerable progress has been made in
reducing the fiscal deficit in recent years on
the back of buoyant corporate tax revenues and
reduced outlays on public investment. Going
forward, however, the pace of adjustment is
set to slow. The IMF staff’s assessment is that
the structural budget deficit will decline by
only about ¼ percent of GDP a year compared
with about 1 percent of GDP a year over the
past three years. Given the continued favorable
outlook, a stronger fiscal adjustment would be
desirable to help put the public debt ratio on
a firmly declining path. In terms of specific
measures, although there remains some scope
for further reductions in public investment
spending, a broad reform of the tax system that
includes steps to widen the income tax base,
raise the consumption tax rate, and strengthen
tax administration would provide the basis for
higher revenues. Fiscal consolidation would
also be supported by further structural reforms
to improve growth potential, particularly to

EMERGING ASIA: SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING STRONG FOREIGN EXCHANGE INFLOWS

increase labor utilization and promote greater
market opening and deregulation in sheltered
sectors of the economy.
The Australian and New Zealand economies
are expanding strongly, although the global
financial market turmoil could act to modestly
dampen growth in the near term. While the
impact has been more limited than in some
other countries, financial markets in Australia
and New Zealand have been affected by recent
developments, with interbank interest rates and
credit spreads increasing, and reduced liquidity among nonbank institutions. Nevertheless,
at this juncture, the main short-term policy
challenge in both countries continues to be
to keep firm control on inflation in the face
of strong domestic demand and tight labor
markets. To this end, both central banks have
recently raised their policy rates—to 6½ percent
in Australia and to 8¼ percent in New Zealand.
Flexible exchange rates and prudent fiscal
policies have played central roles in managing
the domestic impact of strong capital inflows
and the improving terms of trade. Against this
background, it is important that both governments continue to exercise fiscal restraint in the
period ahead.

Emerging Asia: Successfully Managing
Strong Foreign Exchange Inflows
Growth in emerging Asia remained exceptionally rapid in the first half of 2007. The regional
expansion was led by China, where real GDP
grew by 11½ percent (year on year) in the first
half of 2007 as exports and investment accelerated, and by India, where gains in domestic
demand, particularly investment, underpinned
9¼ percent (year on year) growth in the first
half. Growth also accelerated in Singapore
(where consumption and investment both
strengthened), the Philippines (where record
remittance inflows boosted consumption and
government spending grew strongly), Korea
(where the industrial sector rebounded), and
Indonesia (where lower interest rates boosted
domestic demand). In Thailand, political uncer-

tainties continued to undermine confidence
and domestic demand. Growth appears to have
remained buoyant in the third quarter, with
global financial market volatility having a limited
impact on the region to date, although the
weaker outlook for the advanced economies is
likely to slow export growth going forward.
Against this background, growth projections
have been revised downward modestly since
the July World Economic Outlook Update. The
regional economy is now expected to expand
by 9.2 percent this year and 8.3 percent in 2008
(Table 2.3). Growth in China is projected at
11.5 percent in 2007, before slowing to 10 percent in 2008, while the Indian economy is
expected to expand by 8.9 percent this year
and 8.4 percent in 2008. The newly industrialized Asian economies are expected to be most
affected by the weaker U.S. outlook, and growth
for 2008 has been revised down to 4.4 percent
(0.4 percentage point lower than in the July
World Economic Outlook Update). Among the
ASEAN-4 economies, some rebound in Thailand
as confidence recovers is expected to offset modest slowdowns in Malaysia and the Philippines.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced at
this stage. Slower demand for Asian exports,
and electronic goods in particular, and the
possibility of further global financial market
turbulence are particular downside concerns.
On the upside, the projected easing of growth
in China may not materialize unless the authorities tighten monetary policy more decisively
and allow a faster appreciation of the exchange
rate. Faster growth in the near term, however,
would come at the cost of increased downside
risks related to overinvestment beyond the
projection period. Growth in India could also
be stronger than projected, particularly if
robust corporate profits further boost investment spending.
Foreign exchange inflows to the region have
been very strong (Figure 2.4). Current account
transactions have accounted for much of the
inflow, with the regional current account surplus
expected at 6½ percent of GDP this year—the
surplus in China is rising rapidly and that in

Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, Singapore, and
Taiwan Province of China remains large. Net
capital flows to the region, which in aggregate
are dominated by foreign direct investment,
have also picked up this year, although they
remain below the 2004 level. Nevertheless, they
are the predominant source of foreign exchange
inflows for India, Korea, and Vietnam.
Large foreign exchange inflows present
opportunities to boost investment and growth,
but they also create short-term challenges.
Policies have, however, generally steered a path
between maintaining external competitiveness—
regional exports continue to grow rapidly—
limiting risks of overheating, and preparing
for their possible reversals. In most countries,
inflation remains low or has eased considerably
following earlier upward pressures (Indonesia
and the Philippines), while the pace of credit
growth has slowed (Korea and Singapore are
exceptions). In India, inflation has eased in
recent months, but upside risks remain—core
inflation is still elevated, credit growth remains
rapid, and equity prices have risen sharply over

84

the past 12 months. In China, surging food
prices drove CPI inflation up to 6.5 percent in
August (even though nonfood price inflation
remains subdued), credit is expanding strongly,
and there are concerns about overvaluation in
equity prices.
The successful management of foreign
exchange inflows into the region has been
achieved through a pragmatic range of policy
responses tailored to suit individual country
circumstances.
• Exchange rate reforms have been introduced
in some countries (China and Malaysia), and
most currencies have appreciated in nominal
and real effective terms over the past couple
of years. Nevertheless, rapid reserve accumulation has continued.
• Restrictions on capital outflows have been
eased. Regulatory reform has made it easier
for private investors to acquire and hold
foreign assets (China, Korea, Malaysia, and
Thailand), and national pension funds have
been permitted to invest an increasing share
of their assets in foreign investments (Thai-

EMERGING ASIA: SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING STRONG FOREIGN EXCHANGE INFLOWS

Figure 2.4. Emerging Asia: Managing Strong Foreign
Exchange Inflows
Foreign exchange inflows into emerging Asia have been very strong, driven largely
by current account surpluses. Policymakers have responded by letting exchange
rates appreciate to some extent and liberalizing capital outflows, while continuing to
accumulate reserves.

land). Foreign direct investment outflows
from the region have also increased, as Asian
firms have sought to increase their global
presence and acquire natural resources overseas. In the case of Thailand, wide-ranging
controls on capital inflows were introduced in
December 2006, although most of these have
now been removed, while in India restrictions
on external commercial borrowing have been
tightened.
• Declining inflation has allowed some central
banks to cut interest rates (Indonesia, the
Philippines, and Thailand), whereas others have recently tightened monetary policy
(including China, India, and Korea). The
restraint of government expenditures has
also played a role in a number of countries,
notably Hong Kong SAR, India, Malaysia, and
Taiwan Province of China.
Looking forward, policymakers will need to
respond flexibly to future foreign exchange
flows. The continued liberalization of restrictions on capital outflows would be helpful, not
only from a short-term demand management
perspective if strong foreign exchange inflows
continue, but also because of the broader diversification benefits that investors will gain. As discussed in Chapter 3, fiscal expenditure restraint
can be an effective tool for managing large
capital inflows and will need to play a role in
the policy response. This is particularly the case
in countries such as India and Pakistan, where
further consolidation is still needed despite
recent progress in reducing government deficits
and debt levels. Strong financial sector supervision and the continued development of domestic financial markets will also be important (see
the October 2007 GFSR). One concern in this
respect is that corporates in some countries have
increased their foreign currency borrowing, raising their exposure to any future exchange rate
correction.
Greater exchange rate flexibility in some
countries would also be helpful. In China, the
large increase in reserves has been only partially
sterilized and has added to already substantial
liquidity in the banking system, threatening to

underpin a further surge in lending and investment growth. A more flexible exchange rate
would give monetary policy more scope to focus
on domestic objectives, particularly the need to
slow lending and investment growth. Along with
policies that reduce the need for precautionary
savings (including increased spending on health
care, pensions, and the social safety net), appreciation of the renminbi—which is undervalued
relative to medium-term fundamentals—would
also boost consumption by increasing household purchasing power. Together with reduced
incentives for investment in the export sector,
this would contribute to a narrowing of the
very large current account surplus. Elsewhere,
flexible exchange rate management will enable
countries to adjust to evolving developments in
global financial markets, while monetary policy
has scope to respond to changes in the balance
of risks to growth and inflation.

Latin America—Responding to Surging
Foreign Exchange Inflows
Following 5½ percent growth in 2006, the
pace of expansion in Western Hemisphere

86

countries is projected to moderate to 5 percent in 2007 as a whole and to 4.3 percent
in 2008 (Table 2.4). This easing would reflect
in part spillovers from the slowdown of activity in the United States on Mexico and Central
America, mainly through trade linkages as well
as somewhat slower growth of remittances from
migrant workers, and the end of a hotel construction boom in the Caribbean. In a number
of commodity-exporting countries in South
America—including Argentina, Colombia, Peru,
Uruguay, and Venezuela—growth is expected
to come down from very high rates in 2006, in
part because of increasing supply constraints.
Growth is picking up in Brazil in 2007, responding to monetary policy easing after inflation was
brought on track with central bank objectives,
but is also expected to slow in 2008.
The balance of risks to these projections for
the region would seem to be moderately on the
downside, arising principally from the possibility of continued turbulent conditions in global
financial markets having spillover effects on
Latin America through trade and financial channels. So far the impact of recent financial developments on Latin America has been relatively

LATIN AMERICA—RESPONDING TO SURGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE INFLOWS

contained, because the strengthening of macroeconomic policy frameworks and public sector
balance sheets has helped to anchor investor
confidence. However, a weaker path for the
U.S. economy would dampen demand for Latin
American exports, with Mexico and Central
America being most at risk because of greater
trade linkages. Moreover, commodity exporters in South America would be affected by any
softening in food, metals, or energy prices as
a result of slower global demand growth. The
impact through the financial channel would
most likely be less dramatic than the “sudden
stops” experienced in the past, given Latin
America’s stronger fundamentals, but nevertheless there would be a cooling influence from
less-buoyant equity prices and from increases in
borrowing spreads. On the other hand, there
are also upside risks. Surging capital inflows in
the first half of 2007 boosted local asset prices
and credit growth, and further measures may
still be needed to rein in growth of domestic
demand in a number of countries in response to
overheating concerns (Figure 2.5).
A key macroeconomic challenge for Latin
America is how to handle foreign exchange
inflows. Through 2006, these inflows were
largely trade related, as strong foreign demand
and high commodity prices boosted export
earnings, and the regional current account
surplus rose to a record 1.8 percent of GDP. In
contrast, net capital inflows were on a declining trend, as governments took advantage of
improved fiscal performance to repay foreign
borrowing. However, these trends have reversed
recently. Current account surpluses are moderating in 2007, as strong domestic demand has
boosted import growth. In contrast, net capital
inflows have risen rapidly since mid-2006, as
portfolio and bank-related flows surged, particularly to Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia.3 The
recent turbulence in global financial markets
has taken some of the momentum out of these
flows, but the expectation is that Latin America

A number of Latin American countries are experiencing heavy capital inflows that are

inflows has varied across countries. Strong increases in government spending are
adding to demand pressures.

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

will continue to receive sizable capital inflows
in the period ahead, although countries should
be prepared for the possibility of increased
volatility.
Latin American economies have allowed
exchange rates to move more flexibly than
in the past, in response to shifts in exchange
market pressures. Faced with strong inflows in
the first half of 2007, exchange rates strengthened appreciably in a number of countries,
including Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, and
Peru, notwithstanding continued intervention.
In Brazil, foreign exchange inflows in the first
half of 2007 were double their level in the same
period of 2006, driving an appreciation of the
real to its strongest level against the dollar in
seven years, notwithstanding heavy intervention.
The exchange rate appreciation has contributed to containing inflation, giving room to
the central bank to continue to lower interest
rates, thus reducing the wide interest differential
with other countries. In July–August, market
pressures turned, in the context of financial
turbulence, and exchange rates initially weakened across the region, although they have
recovered ground in recent weeks. In Argentina,
the peso has fluctuated in a narrow range amid
central bank interventions, and in Venezuela,
the exchange rate has been kept unchanged for
more than two years, and inflation has risen to
about 20 percent.
Fiscal policy choices have affected the tradeoffs faced by Latin American countries in handling foreign exchange inflows. In Chile, fiscal
policy has played a deliberately countercyclical
role, as the budget has aimed at a structural surplus adjusted for variations in copper prices, a
key determinant of revenues, and this approach
has generated substantial capital outflows that
have balanced upward pressure on the currency.
Elsewhere, general government balances have
mostly been kept in surplus or small deficit,
helping to bring down the ratios of public debt
to GDP. However, with fiscal revenues being
boosted by strong growth and export performance, government spending has also been
allowed to accelerate in a number of countries,

88

providing a procyclical fiscal impulse and adding
to overheating pressures. Such concerns are
particularly salient in Argentina, where recent
policy measures have added to fiscal stimulus,
and in Venezuela.
Latin American countries have used various
financial measures to try to discourage capital
inflows, but the impact has been limited. For
example, Colombia imposed a 40 percent unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) for six
months on portfolio and bank-related inflows in
May 2007—Argentina has had a similar mechanism (applying a 30 percent URR for one year)
in place since 2005. However, these measures
have generally had limited impact on market
developments. Of greater long-term significance,
countries have liberalized restrictions on capital
outflows. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, and Peru have eased limits on holdings of foreign assets by local mutual funds and
pension funds. Over time, such steps should
help raise returns and diversify portfolios, while
also easing pressures in the foreign exchange
market.
A number of countries have also resorted
to other microeconomic measures to contain
domestic side effects of strong foreign exchange
inflows or to contain the impact of strong
growth in domestic demand on inflation. For
example, Brazil has raised import tariffs on
textiles, clothing, and footwear to protect laborintensive domestic production from competition
from Asian imports; both Brazil and Colombia
have introduced cheap credit lines, and Argentina has maintained extensive administrative
measures to contain increases in consumer
prices, including limiting price adjustments in
regulated industries, selective price agreements,
and export restraints. Argentina’s actions, if
sustained, could exacerbate capacity constraints
in key sectors and undermine the business
climate.
From a longer-term perspective, Latin
America’s present expansion is its longest since
the 1960s, and sustained growth has helped
reduce external vulnerabilities. However, the
region continues to be at the bottom of the

world growth league, and governments should
take advantage of present conditions to advance
the reforms that are needed to support more
rapid growth in investment and productivity. Impediments to improved performance
include inefficient public sectors, limited
financial intermediation, weak infrastructure,
and high income inequality. One encouraging
recent development has been progress with
fiscal reforms in Mexico, including measures to
contain the costs of civil service pensions and
to broaden the tax base to replace declining oil
revenues and provide additional funding for
infrastructure and social spending.

Emerging Europe: Brisk Activity,
Rising Imbalances
Growth in emerging Europe accelerated to
6.3 percent in 2006, and the pace moderated
only slightly in the first half of 2007 (Table 2.5).
Spending on new productive capacity and
construction activity bolstered investment, while

rising disposable incomes, improving labor markets, and easy access to credit, financed mainly
through cross-border interbank loans, continued to buttress consumer spending and investment, especially in the Baltics and in southern
and southeastern Europe. Exports benefited
from an upswing in western Europe—the main
trading partner—as well as increased integration of emerging Europe into regional production chains and the upgrading of the quality
of export products. In particular, a pickup in
exports helped support Turkey’s economy,
where domestic demand has slowed in the face
of monetary tightening to reduce inflation
after it spiked in mid-2006. Growth in Hungary
continued to be weaker than in the rest of the
region, reflecting in part the short-term impact
of fiscal consolidation.
The recent strong performance, however, has
been accompanied by rising concerns about
widening external imbalances and overheating
in the Baltics and southern and southeastern
Europe, where booming credit has boosted

Fueling Domestic Demand

Real private credit growth, 2004–06

The brisk pace of credit growth in the Baltics and other areas of emerging Europe
supports financial deepening, but it raises macroeconomic and prudential concerns.
Credit growth bolstered domestic demand in these country groups, leading to a sharp
deterioration in the external positions. Procyclical fiscal policies exacerbated
imbalances in some cases. Current account deficits were financed largely through
bank-to-bank and other borrowing rather than foreign direct investment, as in central
Europe.

private domestic demand and elevated inflation
and external deficits (Figure 2.6). In Latvia, the
current account deficit widened to 21 percent
of GDP in 2006, but deficits are also high, at
10–16 percent of GDP, in other Baltic countries,
Bulgaria, and Romania. Credit booms in the Baltics and southern and southeastern Europe have
been supported by readily available financing
through foreign parent banks at low real interest
rates and, in some cases, by procyclical fiscal
policies (see Figure 2.6). A significant portion of
credit in the Baltics and other emerging Europe
has been denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currency (more so than in other emerging
market regions) and directed to real estate,
and the balance sheet mismatches such lending
creates raise prudential and macroeconomic
concerns. In central Europe, external positions
have been stronger, in part because capital
inflows there have tended to take the form of
foreign direct investment in the tradable goods
sectors, with the ensuing exports helping to
keep current account deficits under control.
Inflation has also been better contained in central Europe, owing in part to monetary policy
independence in mostly inflation-targeting
countries, past nominal currency appreciation,
and the dampening effect of global competition
on wages, although expanding demand is now
starting to test resource constraints.4
Large external imbalances in the Baltics and
southern and southeastern Europe are also
raising concerns about possible real exchange
rate overvaluation, although it is recognized that
some part of the real exchange rate appreciation recently experienced by these countries has
been consistent with improving fundamentals.
Supporting factors include strong productivity
growth in the tradables sector (the well-known
Balassa-Samuelson effect); EU transfers to
the new member states, which are projected
to remain sizable in the coming years; and
improvements in the quality of services. Moreover, part of the real appreciation is likely to

EMERGING EUROPE: BRISK ACTIVITY, RISING IMBALANCES

have been a one-off level adjustment associated with, for example, the adoption of the EU
acquis and the increased availability of foreign
capital owing to the confluence of unusually
benign global financial conditions and structural
changes in the investor base for emerging markets. Speculative flows may also have contributed
to real appreciation, but such factors are difficult to quantify. Emerging European countries,
particularly those with large external financing
needs and appreciable currency mismatches in
private sector balance sheets, could thus be vulnerable to a change in investor sentiment.
Regional growth is forecast to soften to
5.8 percent in 2007 and further to 5.2 percent in
2008. Domestic demand will slow owing to monetary and fiscal tightening, but should remain
strong, supported, among other things, by large
inflows of EU transfers and the still significant
incentives for outsourcing from western Europe.
Tighter global credit conditions are likely to
dampen growth of house prices and household
consumption, with knock-on effects for construction and business investment.5 Exports are also
likely to slow as a result of weakening external
demand from western Europe and, to a lesser
extent, strong currencies and rising wage costs.
However, the still significant wage differential
vis-à-vis western Europe and strong productivity
growth will continue to support the competitiveness. The slowdown of activity is expected to be
most pronounced in the Baltics, where some
cooling of demand would be welcome.
Risks to this outlook are tilted to the downside, largely owing to the possibility of a sharperthan-expected squeeze on credit. In addition,
risks of a disorderly unwinding of large external
imbalances are concentrated in some countries, with spillovers to the rest of the region
mainly through contagion. Countries with large
external imbalances—the Baltics, Romania, and
Bulgaria—may be significantly affected by the

announced their intention to tighten the terms of credit,
amid heightened concerns about the brisk pace of credit
growth in the Baltics.

increased cost of external financing and higher
risk premiums, following recent financial market
turbulence, although the strength of fiscal positions may mitigate the fallout in some cases.
There is scope for financial market contagion,
whereby a widening of the risk premium for one
emerging European country may prompt investors to reassess sovereign risk of other countries
in the region. The common-lender problem—a
narrow group of predominantly European banks
accounting for a significant portion of outstanding claims on emerging European banks and
the private sector—is another potential channel
for transmission of financial shocks across the
region. The potential for spillovers from emerging Europe to western Europe through financial
and trade channels exists, but is considerably
smaller than within the emerging Europe region
(Haas and Tamirisa, 2007).
Macroeconomic policies therefore need to
focus on steering economies toward soft landings, while containing vulnerabilities and laying
the foundation for sustainable long-term growth.
Countries with fixed exchange rate regimes (for
example, the Baltics and Bulgaria) or tightly
managed floats (for example, Croatia) should
rely more on fiscal restraint as they seek to rein
in demand pressures. Countries with floating
exchange rates (for example, Romania) can also
raise interest rates as needed to stem inflationary pressures while reining in procyclical fiscal
expansions. Since overall fiscal policy multipliers
tend to be small in open emerging European
economies, specific fiscal measures aimed at
reducing tax and subsidy incentives for real
estate borrowing are worth considering. The
implementation of fiscal consolidation plans
remains a priority in countries with long-term
fiscal sustainability concerns, for example, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Structural reforms to improve price and wage flexibility also need to be advanced in some countries.
Strong bank supervision, particularly of foreign currency and real estate lending, is critical
for maintaining credit quality and bank capital
in an environment of rapidly expanding balance sheets. Many countries have been tighten-

91

CHAPTER 2

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

ing prudential and administrative regulations
aimed at encouraging banks to strengthen
risk management and/or to reduce the pace
of credit growth, but the effectiveness of the
latter measures seems to have been limited so
far (Hilbers, Ötker-Robe, and Pazarbasioglu,
2007). A stronger prudential policy response is
justified in countries where there are concerns
about loan quality. In many countries, subsidiaries and branches of banks from advanced
economies have been leading credit expansion, and the strength of their parent banks is
reassuring, but these banks may have come to
rely excessively on the strong profits of their
emerging market offshoots (Tamirisa and Igan,
2006). This underscores the need for strong
cross-border cooperation with foreign supervisors to ensure that any emerging signs of weaknesses are addressed in a timely and effective
manner. Raising borrowers’ awareness of risks
and improving market infrastructure facilitating banks’ risk assessment (for example, credit
bureaus) are also a priority.
For the new members of the European Union
that are committed to adopting the euro, the
key challenge is to meet the necessary entry
criteria and to enter the monetary union in
positions that allow these countries to continue
to perform well in the Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU). The sustained real appreciation
that accompanies rapid income convergence of
the new EU member states, even in cases where
the economies are not overheating, makes
satisfying the inflation entry precondition particularly challenging (Haas and Tamirisa, 2007).
The pursuit of consistent macroeconomic policies and further improvements in the structural
flexibility of the economies are thus essential for
the new member states to enter the euro area
smoothly and to excel in the EMU. Especially in
countries that are still far away from “prudent”
medium-term fiscal targets, fiscal adjustment
would help ease cyclical demand pressures,
while putting public finances on a sustainable
footing for the longer term and helping satisfy
the Maastricht fiscal criteria with a margin.
Clear communication of the new member states’

92

euro-adoption prospects is also essential, as it
would help households, businesses, and financial markets make appropriate decisions and
perhaps facilitate the unwinding of the currency
mismatches accumulated on earlier, more optimistic, expectations.

Commonwealth of Independent States:
Tensions Between Inflation and Exchange
Rate Objectives
The CIS region has not been immune to
the recent financial turmoil, but this has come
against the backdrop of the longest economic
expansion since the beginning of transition.
Although easing slightly, growth in the region
remained strong in the second quarter of 2007.
The Russian economy expanded by about
7#/4 percent (year on year), and economic activity
in other CIS countries has also remained buoyant. The robust expansion in the region has
been underpinned by high commodity prices
and strong capital inflows, as well as continuing
productivity gains. Consumption has remained
the main driver of growth, supported by rising real incomes and easy access to credit, but
there are also incipient signs of rebalancing in
the composition of demand, with investment
picking up recently. Credit to the private sector
has been expanding rapidly across the region,
fueled by capital inflows, ample domestic liquidity, and structural improvements in the financial sector.
Against the backdrop of the global disruption to liquidity and pullback from risky assets,
exchange rates in Kazakhstan and Russia came
under some downward pressure in late August.
In Kazakhstan, concerns that domestic banks
could be vulnerable to global credit retrenchment contributed to depreciation pressures,
while in Russia the repatriation of liquid ruble
assets by nonresident investors was the primary
factor behind the depreciation. As liquidity
conditions in interbank markets deteriorated
and banks experienced difficulties raising
external funds and started to curtail their
lending, the central banks of both countries

injected liquidity to ensure stability in the banking systems.
Growth momentum is expected to ease from
7¾ percent in 2006–07 to 7 percent in 2008,
largely owing to tightening credit conditions
and a weakening external environment. High
commodity prices and rising fiscal spending would continue to support activity in the
net-energy-exporting countries (Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) (Table 2.6 and Figure 2.7). In the netenergy-importing countries (as a group), growth
is expected to slow more rapidly, partly owing
to rising oil prices, although growth in these
countries will continue to be supported by the
ongoing global commodity boom6 and buoyant regional conditions, as manifested in strong
external demand and large inflows of foreign

direct investment and private remittances from
the net-energy-importing countries.
Nevertheless, risks to growth are tilted to the
downside, owing to a possible stronger impact of
financial market turbulence on the availability
of foreign and domestic financing, as well as
the impact of slower global growth on commodity prices and export demand. If growth were
to slow down significantly in Russia, demand
for imports from smaller countries in the
region (Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, the Kyrgyz
Republic, and Tajikistan)7 and flows of private
remittances to these countries are likely to be
adversely affected.
A long spell of robust demand growth in the
region has tightened resource constraints, keeping inflation at high levels (9–10 percent). Unit
labor costs are rising in some countries, reflecting higher labor utilization rates and tightening
labor markets (Ukraine). Equipment shortages

Dealing with Capital Inflows
The CIS has benefited from inflows of direct, portfolio, and other investment, which
supported financial deepening and economic expansion in the region. Yet large
capital inflows have also presented macroeconomic challenges. Countries have to
make a choice whether real appreciation should be effected mostly through inflation
or nominal appreciation, a choice that is exacerbated by rapid demand growth,
expansionary fiscal policies, and limited exchange rate flexibility in most CIS
countries.

are also emerging, as indicated by rising imports
of capital goods (Russia). In Azerbaijan, inflation is expected to rise to double digits in 2007
and 2008, as a large fiscal expansion is running
up against supply constraints. Besides pushing
up prices, robust demand growth in the region
is also weakening the external current account
positions, which nonetheless remain in a solid
surplus in most energy-exporting countries.
Competitiveness has suffered from rising prices
in some countries, although many currencies in
the region (notably, the Russian ruble) are still
judged to be undervalued relative to mediumterm fundamentals.
The region has attracted large inflows of
foreign private capital in recent years. Foreign
direct investment—reflecting privatization,
mergers and acquisitions, as well as greenfield
investment—has supported economic growth,
especially in the net-energy-importing countries.
Portfolio and other investment inflows have also
been increasing over the years, including in the
net-energy-exporting countries. This trend has
been particularly pronounced in Russia and
Kazakhstan, where external bank borrowing
soared prior to the onset of the financial market
turmoil.8 High domestic interest rates and
expectations of further ruble appreciation have
prompted banks to switch to external funding
of their domestic loan portfolios. More generally, limited flexibility in exchange rate policy in
many CIS countries may have created perceptions of “one-way bets,” encouraging speculative inflows. Prospects for continued bank and
portfolio capital inflows are more uncertain following the onset of the financial market turmoil,
but high oil and other commodity prices are
likely to continue to attract capital to the region.
The increased reliance on bank borrowing
and portfolio investment inflows for financing
growth in the region has brought policy challenges in its wake. In contrast to commodity
export revenues, which have been at least partly

8In the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, and Armenia,
official financing has been an important contributor to
growth.

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA—BENEFITING FROM GLOBALIZATION

sterilized in stabilization funds (for example,
in Kazakhstan and Russia), capital inflows have
largely fed through to boost domestic credit
growth and have generated inflationary pressures. Nominal appreciation in response to capital inflows has been limited, as many countries
are targeting nominal exchange rates. A decline
in non-oil revenues and/or rapid growth of government spending have added to overheating
problems (for example, in Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine). More recently,
concerns about a possible curtailment of external bank financing in the face of global market
turmoil have highlighted potential problems
that would arise if such flows were to reverse.
Some countries in the CIS region have
responded to the large capital inflows and overheating pressures by broadening and tightening
reserve requirements, and such approaches have
helped mop up liquidity in the system. However, ultimately, greater exchange rate flexibility
is required to improve inflation control (for
example, in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine),9
and preparations for moving to more flexible
exchange rates need to be accelerated to prevent high-inflation expectations from becoming
entrenched. Supporting this approach, further
efforts are needed to develop market-based
monetary instruments, deepen the domestic
money market, and tighten financial regulations, particularly to ensure that foreign borrowing does not lead to bank or corporate balance
sheet vulnerabilities. Growth of government
spending should be kept in check, striking a balance between addressing still-significant social
and infrastructure needs and excessively fueling
inflation and appreciation pressures.
Beyond the near term, boosting savings
and investment is critical to strengthening the
region’s growth outlook. Catch-up productivity gains are likely to diminish over time, while
adverse demographic trends are weighing on
long-term prospects. The rate of investment (at

9The central bank let the Russian ruble appreciate by
½ percent vis-à-vis the dollar-euro dual currency basket
on June 26 and again by 0.6 percent on August 9.

21 percent of GDP in 2006 and projected to
rise only slightly in 2007) remains lower than in
other regions of the world, while the concentration of investment in extractive industries and
construction points to the need to diversify
the sources of growth. Whether private investment responds to this challenge will depend on
further improvements in institutions and the
business climate. Financial deepening and the
development of arm’s-length sources of finance
would also strengthen long-term growth prospects. Additional strengthening of prudential
regulations (for example, stricter provisioning
and higher risk weights for particular categories
of loans) and banking supervision would help
improve the capacity of banks to manage risks
and maintain credit quality in the environment
of rapid loan growth.

Sub-Saharan Africa—Benefiting from
Globalization
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is enjoying another
strong year, with overall growth in the region
projected to rise from 5.7 percent in 2006 to
6.1 percent in 2007 and further to 6.8 percent
in 2008 (Table 2.7). The growth acceleration
reflects largely the coming onstream of new production facilities in oil-exporting countries, such
as Angola and Nigeria. But most other countries
in the region are projected to maintain relatively high rates of growth, while inflation would
generally moderate (excluding Zimbabwe, which
is expected to remain an outlier). Risks to the
forecast are, however, tilted somewhat to the
downside, reflecting mainly the possibility of
a weaker global outturn, which would weaken
demand for African commodity exports and
tighten financial constraints, as well as risks from
domestic political developments in individual
countries.
Taking a longer-term perspective, SSA is
clearly enjoying its best period of sustained
growth since independence. While the oilexporting countries are achieving the most
rapid growth, most other countries are also
growing strongly and outperforming historic

trends (Figure 2.8). Moreover, faster-growing
countries in the region are making substantial progress in reducing poverty rates. This
growth success reflects a potent combination
of a favorable external environment (particularly, improving terms of trade), sound policy
implementation, and the rising openness of
SSA economies, achieved not only by oil and
commodity exporters, but also by coastal and
landlocked countries. While rising fuel and
commodity-based exports have played a major
role, African countries have also been able to
expand nontraditional manufacturing exports
and to diversify export destinations, especially

96

to new destinations in Asia with strong demand
for resource-based products.10
The combination of more open economies in
a benign external environment, together with
improved and more consistent policy implementation, reforms to strengthen the business
environment, and official actions to reduce
debt burdens, has allowed SSA countries to
attract rising private capital inflows, as well as
to benefit from some step-up in aid inflows and
rising remittances. Foreign direct investment has

Most African countries have grown robustly in recent years, helped by rising trade
openness. Oil-exporting countries have grown particularly rapidly, with export
revenues pushing up reserve levels fast. Net private inflows have risen, especially to
coastal countries, while official flows have risen significantly to landlocked countries,
financing rising current account deficits in both groups of countries.

been particularly strong to resource-rich countries, but also elsewhere, for example, to fund
tourism projects. A smaller number of countries have also begun to attract interest from
private portfolio investors—South Africa, with
its well-developed financial structure, receives
the bulk of these funds, but other countries,
such as Ghana and Uganda, which have demonstrated increased policy credibility, have also
been experiencing rising capital inflows. Official
grants have not risen significantly at the aggregate level, despite commitments made at the
Gleneagles Summit, but a number of countries
have attracted rising aid inflows, particularly
landlocked countries such as Lesotho, Malawi,
and Rwanda.
SSA countries have so far experienced less
severe trade-offs from the challenges of managing foreign exchange inflows than other
parts of the developing world, but must be
ready to face these issues. Most countries in
the region have continued to run significant
current account deficits; the buildup in international reserves has been welcome, but reserves
remain quite low (outside the oil producers);
and upward movements in the real effective
exchange rate have been limited. The challenges are most pressing for oil exporters.
Similar to other oil producers, the oil-exporting
countries in Africa have made large terms-oftrade gains from recent fuel price increases,
and international reserves have risen rapidly.
These countries must be careful to spend oil
windfall gains in a prudent manner, without
straining domestic absorptive capacity, and
saving appropriately for future generations. As
discussed in IMF (2007), it will be important
to combine well-targeted increases in government spending with measures to improve the
supply-side response in the non-oil economy.
Similar lessons also apply to considering how
best to use stepped-up aid flows. Although such
increased inflows would provide an important
opportunity for poverty reduction, care will be
needed to avoid crowding out other productive
activities through upward pressure on scarce
domestic resources (Box 2.3).

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Box 2.3. Managing the Macroeconomic Consequences of Large and Volatile Aid Flows
At the G-8 meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland,
in 2005, world leaders pledged a large increase
in official development assistance to low-income
countries. The objective was to help poor
countries achieve the Millennium Development
Goals agreed upon at the Millennium Summit
of the United Nations in 2000. The promised
surge in aid flows is a unique opportunity to
fight poverty on a large scale; however, it raises
some macroeconomic challenges that need to
be addressed to ensure that aid flows have the
most beneficial impact.
Aid Flows Are Volatile
Aid flows to poor countries are often large
and very volatile (Bulír̆ and Hamann, 2006).
Between 1990 and 2005, about 40 poor countries experienced net aid inflows (excluding
debt relief) above 10 percent of GDP (figure).
This compares with net private capital flows
to emerging markets, which in the past two
decades have generally been less than 5 percent
of GDP. Moreover, annual changes in net aid
flows can be huge, easily exceeding 10 percent
of GDP, and even more than 20 percent of GDP
for a handful of countries. Moreover, recent
research shows that aid is volatile and unpredictable even in countries that follow reasonable
policies (Celasun and Walliser, forthcoming).
Such volatility poses particular macroeconomic
challenges to policymakers in low-income
countries, which often suffer from weak public
expenditure management, shortages of skilled
workers, undiversified production structures,
and shallow financial markets.
Challenges in Macroeconomic Managing of Aid
Flows
The problem of managing large aid inflows
has several dimensions. First, the volatility and
unpredictability of aid can complicate public
expenditure management. It would be highly
damaging if spending on recurrent expenditures (such as in the health and education secNote: The main author of this box is Thierry

tors) had to be adjusted upward and downward
on an annual basis because of aid fluctuations.
Moreover, sustained periods of large aid inflows
could weaken efforts in mobilizing domestic revenues, resulting in significant public
financing gaps when aid is phased out. Finally,
institutional constraints (such as weak capacity

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA—BENEFITING FROM GLOBALIZATION

to manage and monitor public expenditure,
or even corruption) may limit the capacity to
quickly absorb large amounts of aid effectively.
Another key macroeconomic concern arises
when large aid flows are spent on goods and
services produced in the domestic economy,
which can push up the price of nontraded
goods relative to the price of traded goods
(the real exchange rate), resulting in a loss of
competitiveness in export-oriented, high-valueadded sectors. This phenomenon is often called
Dutch disease. As an example, consider the case
in which aid is spent on hiring skilled workers,
such as nurses, doctors, and teachers. Because
skilled workers are in short supply, their wages
quickly go up. As a result, wages of educated
people in manufacturing industries and other
sectors also increase, hurting exporters who cannot pass on their higher costs to customers.
Rajan and Subramanian (2005) confirm that
Dutch disease is a real concern by showing that
in countries that received more aid in the 1980s
and 1990s, export-oriented, labor-intensive
manufacturing industries grew more slowly than
other industries. Similarly, Prati and Tressel
(2006) find that foreign aid inflows depress
overall exports of poor countries, as Dutch
disease would imply. They do not find, however, any negative effect of aid disbursed when
countries experience large exogenous shocks
(droughts, large negative commodity price
shocks, hurricanes, or earthquakes) or during post-war reconstruction. This suggests that
aid may help production recover from adverse
events.
Policies to Mitigate the Side Effects of Aid
Country case studies find that aid-recipient
countries were often reluctant to let the real
exchange rate appreciate as aid flowed in
(Berg and others, 2007). In some countries,
the fiscal authority simply did not spend the
aid in the year it was received, while the central
bank accumulated foreign exchange reserves
(Ethiopia and Ghana). In other countries, the
fiscal authority increased spending in line with
the surge in aid, while the monetary authority

tried to prevent real exchange rate appreciation
by sterilizing the monetary expansion associated
with the increase in public spending (Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda).
Gradually phasing in a spending buildup so
as to limit the strain on domestic capacity and
sterilizing the monetary expansion associated
with aid spending both amount to temporarily
saving part of the aid in the form of international reserves and can mitigate Dutch disease
problems and other side effects of aid. Indeed,
Prati and Tressel (2006) show that these policy
responses eased the aggregate demand and
real appreciation pressures associated with
aid inflows. The effectiveness of such policy
responses may also explain why Berg and others
(2007) do not find symptoms of Dutch disease
in a small group of countries that have recently
experienced aid surges.
However, policies aimed at redistributing aid
resources over time for the purpose of managing the macroeconomic consequences of large
aid flows pose specific challenges. In poor
countries, shallow financial markets may make
it difficult to execute sterilization operations
in the bond markets and result in a burden on
banks, for example, through higher reserve
requirements. Sterilization policies could also
lead to an undesired increase in interest rates
and crowding out of private investment.
As a general principle, countries receiving aid
should aim at spending it over time as part of
their poverty reduction strategy. However, in the
short term, saving part of volatile and unpredictable aid flows in the form of international
reserves can be justified from both a public
finance and a macroeconomic management
perspective. First, from a public finance perspective, if a temporary spurt of aid is all spent when
it arrives (as was often the case in the past), a
subsequent sharp drop in aid receipts could
prompt the need for either a costly retrenchment of spending or recourse to higher domestic financing of expenditures, which could
lead to loss of monetary control and inflation
(Celasun and Walliser, 2006). In contrast, saving
part of temporary aid surges would help avoid

99

CHAPTER 2

COUNTRY AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES

Box 2.3 (concluded)
excessive reliance on domestic financing and
prevent an unsustainable buildup of expenditures. On the whole, effective medium-term
budgeting requires that aid-recipient countries
smooth recurrent expenditures, so that all
programs undertaken are funded while providing for key lumpy expenditures (Heller, 2005).
Finally, to prevent aid dependency, periods of
sustained large flows should not diminish efforts
to mobilize domestic revenues (Gupta, Powell,
and Yang, 2006).
From a macroeconomic management perspective, saving part of temporary increases in
aid flows reflects the need to smooth aggregate
consumption and to balance demand against
supply. Building reserve buffers to self-insure
against future negative shocks is particularly
important in countries that have low reserve
coverage of imports and are subject to frequent
exogenous shocks (such as terms-of-trade shocks

More generally, to take full advantage of
globalization, SSA countries must continue
to build institutions that will help sustain
improved macroeconomic management, push
through governance and other reforms to
strengthen poverty alleviation, and develop the
infrastructure and business environment to
foster the rising productivity and investment
needed to sustain high growth even in the face
of a less benign global environment. Many
countries will need to develop more flexible
exchange rate regimes and more active monetary policy management in response to greater
trade and capital interlinkages with the rest
of the world. South Africa provides a leading
example on the continent of such management,
and it is encouraging that other countries, such
as Ghana, are moving or preparing to move in a
similar direction to put in place inflation-targeting regimes with more actively floating currencies. It will also be important to be prudent in
taking advantage of opportunities for external
funding to make sure that projects are carefully

and droughts). Saving part of aid to smooth
spending paths may also be necessary when a
country’s absorptive capacity is weak and when
there are risks of loss of competitiveness from
Dutch disease.
In choosing aid spending and absorption
paths, policymakers in recipient countries
should take into account country specifics
such as macroeconomic stability, current and
projected improvements in absorptive capacity,
the risks of Dutch disease, and debt sustainability. Given the challenges associated with
achieving optimal aid spending paths through
macroeconomic policy adjustments, donors
would contribute to a more effective use of aid
by committing to coordinated multiyear aid
disbursements tailored to country-specific circumstances. In this perspective, the 2005 Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness is a welcome
step in improving aid predictability.

chosen and that gains from official debt reduction are preserved.

Middle East: Balancing Cyclical
and Long-Term Considerations in
Fiscal Policy
The long spell of strong growth in the Middle
East continues to be supported by high oil prices
and robust domestic demand. Regional growth
has been maintained at over 5 percent a year in
the past four years, reaching 5.6 percent in 2006
(Table 2.8). Although investment in the oil sector stagnated in real terms because of increasing
investment costs, GDP growth in oil-exporting
countries was sustained by expansion in the nonoil sectors, pushed by rising government spending out of oil revenues, foreign capital inflows,
and rapidly growing domestic private credit. A
buildup of government spending on infrastructure and social projects, as well as investment
programs to expand oil production and refining
capacity, narrowed fiscal surpluses and external

current account surpluses, despite higher oil
prices (Figure 2.9). Oil-importing countries, for
their part, benefited from the favorable external environment and robust domestic demand,
with growth rising to 6 percent in 2006 and
early 2007. Growth remains strong and broad
based in Egypt and Jordan, but the Lebanese
economy is still weak in the aftermath of last
year’s military conflict.
Growth momentum should pick up near
term, supported by high oil prices and expansionary fiscal policy. Regional economies are
projected to expand by about 6 percent in
both 2007 and 2008, with growth accelerating
in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Egypt. Oil
prices are forecast to remain near current high
levels, but robust domestic demand is projected
to lower current account surpluses in the region
to 16 percent of GDP, down from almost 20 percent of GDP in 2006. Growth in oil-importing
economies is expected to continue to outpace
that in oil-exporting countries, supported by
strong private and public consumption and
investment growth. Risks appear broadly balanced. Slower global growth, increased financial
market volatility, or regional geopolitical risks
could hurt growth, but the strength of oil prices
provides upside potential.

With resource utilization and import prices
rising, inflation is accelerating (see Figure 2.9).
In Saudi Arabia, inflation rose for the first
time in a decade in 2006, although from very
low levels. Inflation increases have also been
moderate in Kuwait, given its open product and
factor markets. In Egypt, inflation accelerated
in 2006 and early 2007, owing to rising demand
pressures and increases in administered prices
(primarily fuel prices), as well as bird flu effects,
but has been slowing in recent months, in part
as a result of the tightening of the monetary
stance in the second half of 2006. In the Islamic
Republic of Iran, high inflation has become
entrenched owing to an extended and significant policy stimulus.
Weakness of the U.S. dollar added to inflationary pressures in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Most of these countries
peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, although
in a surprise move in May 2007, Kuwait (one of
the GCC members) abandoned the peg to the
U.S. dollar in favor of pegging to an undisclosed
currency basket and allowed its currency to
adjust in line with movements in the basket.11

Kuwait’s move came shortly after Oman’s decision not to join the planned common-currency
block in the region, at least not as a founding
member, because it would not be able to meet
all the requirements by the target date of 2010.
Although these steps need not undermine the
single-currency project, together with other economic developments, they would make it hard
to meet the 2010 deadline for launching the
single currency. The GCC countries also agreed
that each central bank would decide on its own
policies to control inflation. Inflationary pressures are expected to persist in the GCC countries as domestic demand expands in response
to the positive terms-of-trade and wealth developments, and the equilibrium real exchange
rate should appreciate as a result of these developments. The acceleration of imports associated
with expansionary fiscal policy and rising investment is expected to lower the GCC countries’
current account surpluses, thereby contributing
to the resolution of global imbalances.
Against this backdrop, the challenge for fiscal
policy in oil- and non-oil commodity-exporting
countries is striking a balance between the longterm developmental objectives and cyclical considerations. With the outlook for oil and other
commodity prices projected to remain strong,
raising the trend of government spending would
be warranted, as it would allow the terms-oftrade and wealth gains to be spent partly on
addressing infrastructure and social needs, in
line with long-term growth and diversification
objectives. However, these considerations will
have to be balanced against the shorter-term,
cyclical need to maintain fiscal surpluses as
a counterbalance to strong private demand
growth in an environment of rapidly expanding
domestic liquidity. Policymakers thus need to
carefully calibrate the speed of implementing
investment and social projects to the absorptive
capacity of their economies, while strengthening
market mechanisms to keep long-term inflation
expectations anchored at appropriate levels
and improving expenditure management to
ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of public
spending.

REFERENCES

For exporters of oil and other commodities,
whose fortunes are tied to commodity price
fluctuations, the main challenge is to diversify
toward non-oil sectors, while containing cyclical inflationary pressures.12 Policymakers in
oil-exporting countries (for example, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab
Emirates) thus need to calibrate the speed of
implementing large-scale projects to the absorptive capacity of the economy, while improving
the flexibility of markets to keep long-term
inflation expectations anchored at low levels
and developing tools for managing liquidity.
In some countries (Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates), slowing the pace of fiscal spending
and large investments under the public-private
partnership arrangements may be considered
a means of helping contain domestic demand.
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, sizable fiscal
adjustment and monetary tightening will help
ease demand pressures and put inflation on a
downward path.
In the structural policy area, the diversification strategy of oil exporters hinges on reforms
to improve the business climate and make investment in non-oil sectors more attractive. Increasing the role of the private sector in the provision
of services that up to now have been supplied
by governments, opening government procurement and domestic sectors to competition, and
lifting price controls would go a long way in this
regard. More flexible employment procedures
and measures facilitating labor mobility and
human capital development would also help
relieve labor supply bottlenecks and create job
opportunities for the young and rapidly growing
population.
These policies are germane to the oilimporting countries as well, which also share
rapid population growth and the challenges
of forestalling a further rise in unemploy12Non-oil sectors with potential for development in the
Middle East include, among others, tourism, energyintensive processing industries, and infrastructure development. Addressing supply constraints in oil production
and refining would also benefit the region and the global
economy.

ment. These economies have also been experiencing significant capital inflows, owing to
ample regional and global liquidity as well
as domestic privatization programs (Egypt).
Maintaining macroeconomic stability in these
circumstances requires tightening fiscal and,
where appropriate, monetary policies, while
strengthening the quality of supervision and
regulation would help develop and enhance the
efficiency and soundness of financial systems in
the region.

MANAGING LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS

This chapter examines the policy responses to surges in
private capital inflows in a group of emerging market
countries and open advanced economies over the past
two decades. The results suggest that fiscal restraint
during periods of large capital inflows can help limit
real currency appreciation and foster better growth
outcomes in the aftermath of such episodes. Resisting
nominal exchange rate appreciation through sterilized
intervention is likely to be ineffective when the influx
of capital is persistent. Tightening capital controls does
not appear to deliver better outcomes.

T

he wave of capital flows sweeping
through many emerging market economies since the early 2000s has brought
renewed attention on how macroeconomic policies should respond to them
(Figure 3.1). Although these flows are associated with ample global liquidity and favorable
worldwide economic conditions, in many cases
they are, at least in part, a reflection of strengthened macroeconomic policy frameworks and
growth-enhancing structural reforms, and they
help deliver the economic benefits of increased
financial integration.1 But the inflows also create
important challenges for policymakers because
of their potential to generate overheating, loss
of competitiveness, and increased vulnerability
to crisis.
Reflecting these concerns, policies in emerging market countries have responded to capital
inflows in a variety of ways.2 Whereas some
countries have let exchange rates move upward,
in many cases the monetary authorities have
intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets to resist currency appreciation. To varying

degrees, they have sought to neutralize the
monetary impact of intervention through sterilization, with a view to forestalling an excessively
rapid expansion of domestic demand. Controls
on capital inflows have been introduced or
tightened, and controls on outflows eased, to
relieve upward pressure on exchange rates. Fiscal policies have also responded—in some cases,
stronger revenue growth from buoyant activity has been harnessed to achieve better fiscal
outcomes, although in many countries rising revenues have led to higher government spending.
For a number of emerging market countries,
recent policy concerns mirror those in the
first half of the 1990s, when renewed access to
international capital markets in the wake of the
resolution of the debt crisis resulted in a surge in
the availability of external capital. An important
lesson from that earlier period is that the policy
choices made in response to the arrival of capital
inflows may have an important bearing on
macroeconomic outcomes, including the consequences of their abrupt reversal (Montiel, 1999).
Although a number of studies have examined
the policy responses to capital inflows, they have
focused mainly on the experience of a few countries during the 1990s. There have been fewer
studies on recent episodes and fewer attempts
at comprehensive cross-country examination
of policy responses.3 The main objective of this
chapter is thus to review the experience with
large capital inflows over the past two decades
in a large number of emerging market and
advanced economies, characterize the various
policy responses to these experiences, and assess
their macroeconomic implications. The chapter
addresses the following questions:
• What policy challenges are created by surges
of net private capital inflows?
• What policy measures were adopted in the
past, and did they work? For example, did
3Examples of the first type of study are Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1994); Fernández-Arias and Montiel
(1996); Glick (1998); Montiel (1999); Reinhart and Reinhart (1998); and Edwards (2000). There is an example
of a cross-country analysis of policy responses to capital
inflows in World Bank (1997).

106

intervention and capital controls succeed in
limiting real appreciation? Did these measures
help mitigate the risk of sharp reversals of
capital inflows? Does the fiscal policy response
make a difference?
Four main lessons emerge from this analysis.
First, countries that experience more volatile
macroeconomic fluctuations—including a sharp
reversal of inflows—tend to have higher current account deficits and experience stronger
increases in both aggregate demand and the
real value of the currency during the period of
capital inflows. Second, episodes during which
the decline in GDP growth following the surge
in inflows was more moderate tend to be those
in which the authorities exercised greater fiscal restraint during the inflow period, which
helped contain aggregate demand and limit
real appreciation. Third, countries resisting
nominal exchange rate appreciation through
intervention were generally not able to moderate real appreciation in the face of a persistent
surge in capital inflows and faced more serious
adverse macroeconomic consequences when the
surge eventually stopped. Fourth, tightening
capital controls has, in general, been associated neither with lower real appreciation nor
with reduced vulnerability to a sharp reversal of
inflows.
In practice, the appropriate policy response
to large capital inflows depends on a variety of
country-specific circumstances, including the
nature of the underlying inflows (in particular, the extent to which they reflect domestic
or external factors and the extent to which
the inflows are expected to be persistent), the
stage of the business cycle, and the fiscal policy
situation. In addition, and as discussed in the
October 2007 Global Financial Stability Report, the
quality of domestic financial markets also matters. Nevertheless, the findings of this chapter
provide helpful guidance on what has worked,
and not worked, in the past.
One key implication is that the consequences
of large capital inflows are of particular concern
to countries with substantial current account
deficits, such as many in emerging Europe,

TWO WAVES OF LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS

and to countries with inflexible exchange rate
regimes. Especially in the latter context, the
most effective policy instrument available to
attenuate these consequences is to maintain
fiscal spending discipline in the face of buoyant revenues, rather than allowing procyclical
growth of public spending. Moreover, countries
that adopted a policy of resistance to exchange
rate appreciation when the capital inflows
started to arrive should consider moving to a
more flexible exchange rate policy as the influx
of capital is sustained.

Two Waves of Large Capital Inflows to
Emerging Markets
There have been two great waves of private
capital flows to emerging market countries in
the past two decades (see Figure 3.1).4 The first
began in the early 1990s, then ended abruptly
with the 1997–98 Asian crisis. The recent wave
has been building since 2002, but has accelerated markedly recently, with flows in the first
half of this year already far exceeding the total
for 2006.
Looking at the nature and composition
of the inflows reveals interesting differences
between the current wave of capital inflows and
the one in the 1990s. In particular, the current
wave is taking place in the context of much
stronger current account positions for most
(but not all) emerging market countries and a
substantial acceleration in the accumulation of
foreign reserves (Figure 3.2). The surge in pri-

For emerging markets as a whole, the surge in net private capital inflows since the
early 2000s reflects a strong acceleration in gross inflows that has more than offset
the pickup in gross outflows, and it has been accompanied by a current account
surplus and a substantial accumulation of foreign reserves.

4The concept of “private” capital inflows adopted in
this chapter is based on the nature of the recipient sector.
That is, only changes in foreign assets and liabilities of
the domestic private sector—as recorded in the IMF’s
Balance of Payments database—are taken into account,
independently of the nature of the foreign counterpart.
The main difference compared with a “source” concept
of private inflows is the exclusion of sovereign borrowing (specifically, the changes in a government’s assets
and liabilities vis-à-vis the foreign private sector) and
the inclusion of private borrowing from external official
sources. Although this difference may be relevant for the
early to mid-1990s, it is less likely to be relevant for the
recent past, given the decline in sovereign borrowing and
official lending.

vate capital inflows has also been accompanied
by a sharp increase in outflows, in line with
the global trend toward increasing diversification of international portfolios. Behind these
aggregate trends are some distinctive regional
patterns:
• In Latin America,5 net private capital inflows,
as a percentage of GDP, have picked up
since 2004 and are projected to return to
the 1990s levels during the course of this
year (Figure 3.3). The surge in gross private
capital inflows has been largely offset by the
continued increase in gross private capital
outflows—which reached historical highs
in 2006. The increase in net private capital
inflows coincided with a turnaround of the
current account position of the region, from
the large external deficit of the 1990s to a
record-high surplus in 2006, resulting in a
substantial accumulation of foreign reserves.
• In emerging Asia,6 net private capital inflows
have rebounded from their sharp reversal during the 1997–98 crisis. Gross capital
inflows to the region have now returned
to the historically high levels of the precrisis period, but private capital outflows—
particularly portfolio flows—have accelerated
strongly since the early 2000s, leaving net
inflows well below their pre-crisis levels. For
the region as a whole, large and growing
current account surpluses have represented
an even bigger source of foreign currency
inflows, driving a massive accumulation of
foreign reserves.
• In emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS),7 net capital inflows

TWO WAVES OF LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS

have been on a rising trend since the early
1990s, as opportunities created by entry into
the European Union have propelled gross
inflows to levels (as a share of GDP) that
are unprecedented for emerging market
countries in recent history. Unlike in other
regions, though, net capital inflows have been
accompanied by a deteriorating external position, with the current account deficit (excluding Russia) at about 6 percent of regional
GDP in 2006.
• In other emerging markets,8 net capital inflows
have also accelerated strongly over the past
three years, driven by the rebound of net private inflows to Turkey and South Africa after
the reversal in the early 2000s. For this group
of countries as a whole, the recent robust
acceleration in gross inflows has more than
offset the trend increase in gross outflows and
has more than compensated for a current
account deficit.
An important feature of the recent wave of
net capital inflows to emerging markets—which
differentiates it from the 1990s—is the predominance of net foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows relative to net “financial” flows (portfolio
and other flows) in all four regions (Figure 3.4).
This reflects continued strength in FDI inflows,
together with the rapid increase in financial outflows from emerging markets, which has largely
offset the acceleration of financial inflows in
most of these countries.
In sum, the recent cycle of capital inflows
is different from the previous one, because it
involves a larger set of countries; is underpinned
by generally more solid current account positions (with the notable exception of emerging
European countries); and is taking place in a
more financially integrated world economy,
in which significant financial outflows are at
least partially offsetting the inflows of capital to
emerging markets.

The total number of episodes of large net private capital inflows has sharply
increased since early 2000, driven by the increase in the number of episodes in
emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) generally represents the largest share of total

To systematically assess countries’ experiences with large net capital inflows, characterize their policy responses, and gauge the
effectiveness of these responses, this chapter
uses a consistent set of criteria to identify
episodes of large net private capital inflows to
emerging market countries that have occurred
over the past two decades. Such episodes are
also identified for a group of open advanced
economies to compare their experience with
that of emerging markets.9
To identify these episodes, two criteria
are used that account for both country- and
region-specific dimensions.10 The countryspecific dimension of the episodes is captured
by the following criterion: the ratio of net
capital inflows to GDP for a particular country
must be significantly (one standard deviation)
larger than the trend of capital inflows to that
country. The regional dimension is captured
by the following criterion: capital inflows are
significantly larger than a regional threshold
(the 75th percentile of the distribution of the
ratios of net private capital inflows to GDP of
the countries in that region), even if they are
not out of line with country-specific historical trends. An episode is defined as a year or
string of years in which at least one of these
criteria is met.
An important characteristic of these episodes
is how they ended. In particular, an episode is
considered to end “abruptly” if the ratio of net
private capital inflows to GDP in the year after
the episode terminates is more than 5 percentage points of GDP lower than at the end of the
episode—closely following the definition of
“sudden stops” in the literature (see Mauro and
Becker, 2006). An episode is also considered to
finish abruptly if its end coincides with a cur9This group includes Australia, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.

to identify them.

rency crisis, that is, with a steep depreciation of
the exchange rate.11
Based on these criteria, 109 episodes of large
net private capital inflows since 1987 were identified; 87 of these were completed by 2006. These
episodes show several interesting patterns, broadly
in line with the stylized facts discussed above:
• The incidence of episodes over time mirrors trends in net private capital inflows to
emerging markets, with two waves of episodes
of large capital inflows to emerging markets
since the late 1980s—one in the mid-1990s
and the recent one, starting in 2002 (Figure 3.5, upper panel).
• Episodes completed during the first wave
(between 1987 and 1998) generally involved
a smaller volume of flows relative to GDP,
especially compared with episodes that are
ongoing; but they lasted longer than those that
ended between 1999 and 2006 (Table 3.1).
• Emerging Asian and Latin American countries dominated the first wave of episodes,
whereas the more recent episodes have been
concentrated more in emerging Europe and
other emerging market countries (Figure 3.5,
middle panel).
• More than one-third of the completed episodes ended with a sudden stop or a currency
crisis (see Table 3.1), suggesting that abrupt
endings are not a rare phenomenon.12
• Late and ongoing episodes are characterized by
larger FDI flows, relative to the episodes completed in the 1990s (Figure 3.5, lower panel).

(1996)—a depreciation of at least 25 percent cumulative
over a 12-month period, and at least 10 percentage points
greater than in the preceding 12 months.
12In particular, of the 87 completed episodes, 34 ended
with a sudden stop and 13 with a currency crisis. In seven
episodes, a sudden stop coincided with a currency crisis.

measures to prevent overheating and real currency appreciation, and reduce the economy’s
vulnerability to a sharp reversal of the capital
inflows. A key policy decision for countries
facing large capital inflows is to what extent to
resist pressures for the currency to appreciate by
intervening in the foreign exchange market.13
One of the main motivations for intervention
is the concern that massive and rapid capital
inflows may induce steep exchange rate appreciation in a short period of time, damaging the
competitiveness of export sectors and potentially
reducing economic growth. Moreover, if net
capital inflows occur in the context of a current account deficit, the real appreciation could
exacerbate the external imbalance, heightening
vulnerability to a sharp reversal of capital inflows.
From a macroeconomic stabilization perspective,
however, the accumulation of foreign reserves
required to keep the exchange rate from appreciating may lead to excessively loose monetary
conditions, thus creating the potential for overheating and financial system vulnerabilities. In
this case, real appreciation could occur through
higher inflation, rather than through an increase
in nominal exchange rates.14
13These issues are discussed, in the context of European transition economies, in Lane, Lipschitz, and
Mourmouras (2002).
14Allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate could also
discourage short-term speculative capital inflows, by introducing uncertainty on the changes in the value of the
currency (see Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart, 1996).

CHAPTER 3

MANAGING LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS

The “impossible trinity” paradigm of open
economy macroeconomics—the inability to
simultaneously target the exchange rate, run
an independent monetary policy, and allow full
capital mobility—suggests that in the absence
of direct capital controls, countries facing large
capital inflows need to choose between nominal appreciation and inflation.15 In practice,
however, given that capital mobility is not
perfect—even in the absence of direct capital
controls—policymakers may have more scope to
pursue intermediate options than this paradigm
would suggest, and they have generally used
the full menu of available measures.16 When
they have intervened to prevent exchange rate
appreciation, they have often sought to sterilize
the monetary impact of intervention through
open market operations and other measures
(such as increasing bank reserve requirements
or transferring government deposits from the
banking system to the central bank).17 In some
cases, policymakers have tried to restrict the net
inflow of capital by imposing controls on capital
inflows or by removing controls on capital outflows (Box 3.1).
Although the motives for sterilization are
clear, its effectiveness is less so, and it can
entail substantial costs. Because sterilization is
designed to prevent a decline in interest rates, it
maintains the incentives for continuing capital
inflows, thus perpetuating the problem. Moreover, sterilization often implies quasi-fiscal costs,
because it generally involves the central bank
exchanging high-yield domestic assets for low15For a general discussion of the impossible trinity
paradigm, see Obstfeld and Taylor (2002).
16See Reinhart and Reinhart (1998); Montiel (1999);
and World Bank (1997) for a survey of the theory behind
policy responses to capital inflows and some empirical
evidence.
17 With perfect substitution between domestic and
foreign assets, maintaining predetermined exchange
rates would amount to giving up monetary autonomy,
as suggested by the strict form of the impossible trinity.
Under these circumstances, sterilization would be futile,
because any uncovered interest rate differential would
be quickly eliminated by international interest arbitrage.
But because foreign and domestic assets are not perfect
substitutes, interest rate differentials can and do persist.

112

yield reserves. If sterilization is implemented by
increasing unremunerated bank reserve requirements, this cost is shifted to the banking system,
promoting disintermediation.
Fiscal policy is another instrument available to attenuate the effects of capital flows on
aggregate demand and the real exchange rate
during a surge of inflows and in its aftermath.
Typically, fiscal policy in emerging markets
receiving capital inflows is procylical, because a
fast- growing economy generates revenues that
feed higher government spending, thus aggravating overheating problems (see Kaminsky,
Reinhart, and Végh, 2004; and Mendoza and
Ostry, 2007). By contrast, greater restraint on
expenditure growth has three benefits. First,
by dampening aggregate demand during the
period of high inflows, it allows lower interest
rates and may therefore reduce incentives for
inflows. Second, it alleviates the appreciating
pressures on the exchange rate directly, given
the bias of public spending toward nontraded
goods (Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart, 1994).
Third, to the extent that it helps address or
forestall debt sustainability concerns, it may
provide greater scope for a countercyclical fiscal
response to cushion economic activity when
the inflows stop. Although discretionary fiscal
tightening during a period of capital inflows
may be problematic because of political constraints and implementation lags, avoiding fiscal
excesses—holding the line on spending—could
nonetheless play an important stabilization role
in this context.18

Measuring Policy Responses
For the purposes of this chapter, these
policy choices are characterized using a set of

18In particular, fiscal rules based on cyclically adjusted
balances could help resist political and social pressures
for additional spending in the face of large capital
inflows. A relevant example is provided by Chile, which
aims at achieving a cyclically adjusted fiscal surplus, with
an additional adjuster to save excess copper revenues,
thereby contributing to offset appreciation pressures on
the currency (see IMF, 2007c).

POLICY RESPONSES TO LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS

Box 3.1. Can Capital Controls Work?
Capital controls are one of the more controversial choices available to policymakers during
periods of large capital flows. Countries employ
control measures to attain a variety of policy
objectives, such as discouraging capital inflows
to reduce upward pressures on the exchange
rate, reducing the risk associated with the sudden reversal of inflows, and maintaining some
degree of monetary policy independence. After
a brief overview of the different types of capital
controls and their measurement, this box examines the macroeconomic impact of capital
controls during the large inflow episodes identified in the chapter, compares the results with
the recent literature, and provides a summary
of microeconomic distortions associated with
capital controls.1
Capital Controls: Implementation and
Measurement Issues
Although capital controls cover a wide range
of measures regulating inflows and outflows of
foreign capital, they generally take two broad
forms: direct (or administrative) and indirect
(or market based). Direct controls are associated with administrative measures, such as direct
prohibitions and explicit limits on the volume
of transactions. For example, Malaysia introduced a set of direct capital controls in 1998
that involved various quantitative restrictions
on cross-border trade of its currency and credit
transactions. Indirect capital controls include
explicit or implicit taxation of financial flows
and differential exchange rates for capital
transactions. For example, in order to discourage capital inflows, Chile imposed an implicit
tax in 1991 in the form of an unremunerated
reserve requirement (URR) on specified inflows
Note: The main authors of this box are Selim
Elekdag and M. Ayhan Kose.
1This box focuses mainly on the implications of the
temporary use of capital controls during periods of
inflow surges in countries with fairly liberalized capital
accounts. There is a large body of literature analyzing
the growth and stability outcomes of capital controls
for countries at different stages of the liberalization
process (Kose and others, 2006).

for up to one year. These controls were substantially relaxed in 1998.
Recently, to slow the rate of appreciation
of their respective currencies, a number of
countries have introduced controls on capital
inflows. In December 2006, Thailand imposed
a URR of 30 percent on most capital inflows,
requiring them to be deposited with the central
bank for one year. The scope of these controls
has been substantially narrowed since their
inception because of their adverse impact on
market developments and investor confidence.
In May 2007, Colombia introduced a package
of measures, including a 40 percent URR on
external borrowing to be held for six months
in the central bank. At the same time, a new
ceiling on the foreign exchange position of
banks, counting gross positions in derivative
markets, was established to limit circumvention
of the URR and in response to growing concerns about banks’ exposure to counterparty
risk. Brazil, Kazakhstan, Korea, and India have
also recently implemented other specific capital
control measures.
The traditional approach to measuring capital
controls is based on the IMF’s Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions
(AREAER), which provides information on different types of controls. Early work quantified
the narrative descriptions in the AREAER by
simply using a binary measure (Grilli and MilesiFerretti, 1995). More sophisticated approaches
use finer measures of controls, but they still
essentially summarize the information in the
AREAER (Chinn and Ito, 2006; Edwards, 2005;
Miniane, 2004; Mody and Murshid, 2005; and
Quinn, 2003). With the expansion of the set
of control categories and further refinements
in the 1996 issue of the AREAER, it is now
possible to distinguish between controls on
inflows and those on outflows beginning in 1995
(IMF, 2007a).
Using these measures, a large body of literature has studied the macroeconomic and
microeconomic implications of capital controls.
However, it is worth noting up front that, irrespective of their type, it is a challenge to effec-

tively quantify the extent of capital controls.
In particular, it would be desirable to capture
the degree of enforcement of capital controls.
Moreover, the impact of a measure would
depend on a broad assessment of the openness
of the capital account.

The literature assessing whether capital controls have attained their stated macroeconomic
objectives is, at best, mixed. It is hard to draw
a set of general results because most of the
studies are based on country cases (Ariyoshi
and others, 2000). Overall, the studies suggest
that controls on inflows did not affect the volume of net flows in most countries, although
it seems that the controls were able to temporarily tilt the composition toward longer
maturities in a few cases (Chile after 1991; see
Edwards and Rigobon, 2005).2 Even in cases in
which a narrow range of objectives were met,
controls had only temporary effects as market
participants eventually found ways to circumvent them.
What additional evidence can be derived
from the study of capital inflow episodes in
this chapter? Episodes characterized by tighter
controls on inflows are associated with narrower current account deficits and lower net
private inflows, including lower net FDI flows
(first figure). Although stricter inflow controls
are accompanied by lower post-inflow growth
and a larger appreciation of the currency,
these distinctions are not statistically significant. In contrast, inflation rates have been
significantly higher in episodes with tighter
controls.
Does having capital controls in place reduce
vulnerability to financial crises and sudden
stops? Episodes that ended in an abrupt reversal
of net inflows do not seem to be associated with

lower capital controls (second figure).3 On the
contrary, although the differences are not statistically significant, episodes that ended abruptly
were associated with somewhat stricter inflow
controls. Consistent with this finding, recent

2Moreover, stricter controls on outflows appeared to
reduce net capital flows and allow more independent
monetary policy in Malaysia after 1998, but there is
little support for such outcomes in other countries
(Magud and Reinhart, 2007).

3The evolution of capital controls is also examined
using the full sample of episodes. The results suggest
that there has not been any significant change in the
median of capital controls during episodes relative to
the periods before or after.

wave of inflows during the 1990s suggests that
elimination of controls on outflows has often led
to larger inflows.4 However, the study of episodes
in this chapter suggests that in about 40 percent
of episodes in which rising gross outflows offset
gross inflows, countries indeed relaxed capital
controls on outflows. Most of these episodes
occurred during the past three years.

studies also document that countries with capital controls are in fact more susceptible to crises
(Glick, Guo, and Hutchison, 2006). This could
be simply because of a “selection effect”—often
it is countries with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals that put controls in place to insulate
themselves from crises. However, these studies
find that even after controlling for such effects,
countries with controls have a higher likelihood
of currency crises and sudden stops. Moreover,
there seems to be little empirical evidence that
the output costs of currency and banking crises
are smaller in countries that restrict capital
mobility (IMF, 2007a).
Another policy used by some countries to
cope with large net inflows was the removal of
controls on outflows. Evidence based on the

Although there is little evidence that capital
controls are effective at achieving their macroeconomic objectives beyond a limited period,
they are associated with substantial microeconomic costs, especially when they are sustained
for a prolonged period of time (IMF, 2007a).5
• Cost of capital. Capital controls are estimated
to make it more difficult and expensive for
small firms to raise capital (Forbes, 2007a).
Moreover, multinational affiliates located
in countries with capital controls face local
borrowing costs that are much higher
than those of affiliates of the same parent
company borrowing locally in countries
without capital controls (Desai, Foley, and
Hines, 2004).
• Costs of distortions and reduced market discipline.
Economic behavior is likely to be distorted by
capital controls, and resources are wasted in
seeking to circumvent controls (Johnson and
Mitton, 2003; and Forbes, 2007b).
• Lower international trade. Capital controls
increase the cost of engaging in international
trade, even for those firms that do not intend

4Liberalizing outflow restrictions may attract heavier
inflows by sending a positive signal to markets and
increasing investor confidence, and thereby fueling
even larger inflows (Bartolini and Drazen, 1997),
which is supported by evidence based on several countries (Reinhart and Reinhart, 1998).
5A full discussion of the costs and distortions stemming from capital controls is beyond the scope of
this box. By analyzing the specific effects of capital
controls on individual firms and/or sectors in a particular country, microeconomic studies are often able
to produce more concrete results than those focusing
on macroeconomic implications of controls.

to evade them, because of expenses incurred
to meet various inspection and reporting
requirements associated with controls (Wei
and Zhang, 2007).
In sum, although the macroeconomic impact
of capital controls has been temporary at best,
evidence suggests they have been associated

quantitative indicators. The main indicators are
as follows:
• Exchange rate policy. Exchange rate policy
is characterized based on an index of
“exchange market pressures” (EMP), which is
a combination of movements in the exchange
rate and international reserves.19 In theory,
for a pure float, the change in the exchange
rate would correspond exactly to the index
of exchange market pressures. At the other
extreme, for a peg, the exchange rate would
be constant, and fluctuations in EMP would
be driven entirely by changes in reserves
through intervention. Dividing the changes
in foreign reserves by EMP yields a ratio measuring the proportion of exchange market
pressures that are resisted through intervention. This ratio is then standardized to
create an index of the degree of resistance to
changes in exchange rates—hereafter called
a “resistance index”—with values between
0 and 1, where values closer to 1 imply a
greater degree of resistance to exchange rate
fluctuations.
• Sterilization policy. The sterilization index
captures the extent to which the monetary
authorities are able to insulate domestic
liquidity from foreign exchange market intervention. Specifically, it measures the degree
to which the monetary authorities contracted
domestic credit to offset the expansion of the
monetary base associated with the accumula-

description of the index is in Appendix 3.1.

with substantial microeconomic costs. While
capital controls might have a role in certain
cases, they should not be seen as a substitute
for sound macroeconomic policies that include
a prudent fiscal stance and a supporting
exchange rate and monetary policy framework,
as well as appropriate prudential measures.

tion of foreign reserves.20 A value of the index
equal to (or above) unity implies full sterilization, whereas a value of zero (or a negative
value) represents no sterilization. Moreover,
changes in nominal short-term interest rates
will be considered as an alternative measure
of the cyclical stance of monetary policy.21
• Fiscal policy. The cyclical stance of fiscal
policy in response to large capital inflows is
represented by the change in the growth of
real noninterest government expenditure.
Although it is possible to consider other
measures of fiscal policy, such as government
revenues and fiscal balances, these variables
are more closely related to cyclical changes
in the economy, and thus they generally give
ambiguous indications about the cyclical
stance of fiscal policy (Kaminsky, Reinhart,
and Végh, 2004).22
20This index of sterilization thus follows the literature
on the coefficient of sterilization (see, for example,
Cavoli and Rajan, 2006; and Kwack, 2001).
21Clearly, movements in short-term interest rates can
be seen as counterparts of changes in central banks’
domestic assets and thus of the sterilization effort, with
a decrease in central banks’ domestic assets leading to
an increase in interest rates. In practice, however, using
the sterilization index as a measure of the monetary
policy stance is complicated by the fact that the demand
for money balances could be highly unstable, especially
in countries with high and volatile inflation (Kaminsky,
Reinhart, and Végh, 2004). Hence, an increase in the
monetary base (low sterilization) may not reflect an
expansionary monetary policy, but simply the accommodation of a higher demand for money.
22The cyclical component of the fiscal response to
capital inflows is also calculated as the deviation of real
government spending from its trend, obtained using the
Hodrick-Prescott filter.

• Capital controls. The degree to which the authorities restrict net inflows of capital by imposing administrative controls on capital inflows
is captured through an index based on the
IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements
and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). The same
source is used to construct a second index that
measures the degree to which authorities react
to the surge in capital inflows by liberalizing a
variety of restrictions on capital outflows.23

Some Stylized Facts on Policy Responses
Recent years have seen substantial changes in
the use of these various policy responses, compared with the 1990s. The recent wave of capital
inflows has been associated with strong exchange
market pressures in all regions, which have been
resisted through the accumulation of foreign
reserves while also allowing some upward movement in exchange rates (Figure 3.6). This pattern
is significantly different from the earlier wave
of net capital inflows, when, for most emerging
market countries, pressures on exchange rates
were negative, reflecting large current account
deficits. During this wave, exchange rates typically
depreciated. Emerging Asia was one region that
experienced positive exchange market pressures
over 1994–96, but these pressures were absorbed
through reserve accumulation.
The fact that foreign exchange reserves
increased during the 1990s may indicate an
asymmetry in the response to exchange rate
pressures, with a tendency to intervene to prevent the appreciation of the currency but not to
stem a depreciation (except when the pressures
became extreme in a financial crisis, as shown
by the large reduction of reserves in 1997 in
emerging Asia and, in 2001, in Latin America
and other emerging markets). Over the past
three years, there has been substantial exchange
23The IMF’s AREAER has indices on nine different
dimensions of capital controls, both on inflows and
outflows, including controls on capital and money market
instruments, on direct investment, and on personal capital movements. The indices used in this chapter are the
average across these nine dimensions.

MANAGING LARGE CAPITAL INFLOWS

rate appreciation in the face of high and rising
positive exchange market pressures, reflecting
the trend toward increasing exchange rate flexibility in many countries, especially in emerging
Asia. Nevertheless, the relatively high values of
the resistance index over the recent past in all
four emerging market regions considered in this
chapter reflect a continued, widespread desire
to limit the extent of exchange rate appreciation
(Figure 3.7).
At the same time, the degree of sterilization has increased over the past few years in
emerging Asia, and more moderately in Latin
America and emerging Europe and the CIS
(see Figure 3.7). The high values of the index
in the early 1990s and the early 2000s—the
beginning of the two waves of large capital
inflows—suggest an aggressive sterilization effort
when capital began to pour in. This index subsequently tapered off, perhaps indicating that as
intervention continued, the authorities became
increasingly conscious of its cost.24
The pattern of real government expenditure
reveals that in the emerging market countries
considered in this chapter, real government
expenditure growth accelerated over the past
few years, especially in Latin America and
emerging Europe and the CIS (see Figure 3.7).
Finally, the indices of capital controls in
emerging market regions suggest that controls
on capital inflows have been relaxed since
the late 1990s, although in the aggregate the
changes have been relatively slow (see Figure 3.7). Emerging European and the CIS
countries have relaxed these controls the most,
with emerging Asian countries remaining quite
restrictive. Restrictions on residents’ capital outflows have also been progressively loosened in
emerging Europe and the CIS, and other emerg-

24At

the same time, the slight decline of the index over
the past two decades could reflect both the increased
degree of financial integration, which heightens the substitutability of domestic and foreign assets and thus makes
sterilization less effective, and the increased demand for
money balances from lower inflation and higher output
growth, which reduced the need to sterilize the inflationary impact of the increase in reserves.

ing market regions, and only more recently in
emerging Asia and Latin America, which started
from a relatively more open position.
Looking specifically at episodes of large
capital inflows, the policy responses are characterized by the following general trends
(Figure 3.8):25
• The resistance index tends to increase during an episode. This is especially the case for
episodes completed before 1998 in which the
increase in the index during the inflow period
is statistically significant.26
• Sterilization does not tend to increase during
an episode, relative to the two years before the
episode. This result seems consistent with the
temporary nature of the sterilization efforts
during the episodes discussed above, as many
countries were unable to sustain aggressive sterilization over the inflow periods, at least partly
because of the associated quasi-fiscal costs.
• Real government expenditures tend to
increase strongly as capital inflows surge, suggesting that fiscal policy has generally been
procyclical.
• Controls on inward capital flows appear to
have been tightened (even if not significantly so) during the episodes completed
before 1998. By contrast, during the more
recent and ongoing episodes, capital controls appear to have been eased, in line with
the general trend toward increased financial integration and greater capital mobility
(IMF, 2007a). For completed episodes, the

25For

each episode, the averages of policy indicators
over the years of the episode, the two years before its
beginning, and the two years after its end are first estimated. Figures 3.8–3.13 report the medians across these
averages.
26Although Figures 3.8–3.13 show medians across
episodes, a statistical test (based on a chi-squared statistic)
is also performed to determine whether the difference
between the two medians is significant at a 10 percent
confidence level or better. If the test is passed, it means
that the difference between the medians reflects a
genuine difference across the two groups of episodes. If
the test fails, it means that the heterogeneity within the
two groups of episodes is large, and thus the difference
between the medians is not necessarily indicative of a
genuine difference between the two classes of episodes.

Figure 3.8. Policy Indicators in the Episodes of Large
Net Private Capital Inflows1
Both resistance to exchange market pressures and government expenditure growth
have generally increased during completed episodes, while the extent of sterilization
has not changed significantly. Controls on capital inflows and outflows seem to have
been relaxed during ongoing episodes, even if the difference is not statistically
significant.

Figure 3.9. Selected Macroeconomic Variables:

Episodes of large net private capital inflows are associated with increases in GDP
growth, aggregate demand, and current account deficits, which are all reversed when
the episodes end. The real exchange rate generally appreciates but inflation does not
accelerate. While both foreign direct investment (FDI) and non-FDI inflows increase
during the episodes, only the former decline significantly in the aftermath.

However, these restrictions appear to be
less strict during the ongoing episodes (see
Box 3.1).

Linking Macroeconomic Outcomes and
Policy Responses
This section examines the macroeconomic
consequences of the policy responses to large
capital inflows. The analysis focuses especially on
how successful these policies were in reducing
the economy’s vulnerability to an abrupt—and
costly—end to the inflows.
A first step in this analysis is to examine the
behavior of real GDP growth, real aggregate
demand, the current account balance, and the
real effective exchange rate before, during, and
after the episodes (Figure 3.9). The main findings are as follows:
• Episodes of large capital inflows were associated with an acceleration of GDP growth,
but afterward growth often dropped
significantly.27
• Fluctuations in GDP growth have been accompanied by large swings in aggregate demand
and in the current account balance, with a
strong deterioration of the current account
during the inflow period and a sharp reversal
at the end.
• Consistent with the literature on capital outflows, the end of the inflow episodes typically
entailed a sharp reversal of non-FDI flows,
whereas FDI proved much more resilient
(Becker, Jeanne, Mauro, Ostry, and Ranciere,
2007).28

real GDP growth during the episodes.

27The post-inflow decline in GDP growth is significantly
larger for episodes that end “abruptly.” In these cases,
average GDP growth in the two years after the end of
the episodes tends to be about 3 percentage points lower
than during the episode, and about 1 percentage point
lower than during the two years before the episode. This
suggests that for episodes ending abruptly, it may take
some time to fully recover from the economic slowdown
associated with the “hard landing.”
28The stability of capital inflows vis-à-vis financial markets’ depth and liquidity is discussed in Chapter 3 of the

LINKING MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND POLICY RESPONSES

• The surge in capital inflows also appears to
be associated with a real effective exchange
rate appreciation, but the lack of statistical
significance in the difference between median
appreciation before and during the surge in
capital inflows reflects the considerable variation across country experience.
• The mechanism generating real appreciation
during an episode has not, on average, been
higher inflation. This reflects the fact that
for a significant group of episodes, the surge
in capital inflows occurred in the context of
inflation stabilization plans.29

Figure 3.10. Post-Inflow GDP Growth, Selected
Macroeconomic Variables, and Policy Indicators1
Episodes with the weakest post-inflow GDP growth are generally characterized by a
stronger increase in aggregate demand, larger real appreciation, and greater size of
inflows during the episode. They are also characterized by a strong increase in the
cyclical component of government spending.

Avoiding a Hard Landing After the Inflows
In light of these findings, an important test
of the effectiveness of policies during the inflow
period is whether they helped a country achieve
a soft landing, that is, a moderate decline in
GDP growth after the inflows abated.
Episodes characterized by a sharper postinflow decline in GDP growth tend to experience a faster acceleration in domestic demand, a
sharper rise in inflation, and a larger real appreciation during the inflow period (Figure 3.10,
upper panel). These episodes also lasted longer,
as shown by the much higher cumulative size
of the inflows.30 Hence, the sharper post-inflow
decline in GDP growth seems to be associated
with persistent, expansionary capital inflows,
which compound external imbalances and sow
the seeds of the eventual sharp reversal.
From a policy perspective, it is striking that
hard landings have also been associated with a

October 2007 Global Financial Stability Report.
29Examples are Peru 1992–97, Brazil 1994–96, Bulgaria
1992–93, and Latvia 1994–95. As noted in Calvo and Végh
(1999), except for the behavior of inflation, exchangerate-based inflation stabilization typically leads to the
same outcome as an “exogenous” capital inflow, that is, a
surge in capital inflows, a pickup in aggregate demand,
and a larger real appreciation of the domestic currency
that, together with larger current account deficits, sow
the seeds of a much stronger decline in GDP growth at
the end of an episode.
30Examples are Thailand 1988–96, Argentina 1992–94
and 1997–99, and Mexico 1990–94.

strong increase in government spending during
the inflow period, whereas expenditure restraint
helps reduce upward pressures on both aggregate
demand and the real exchange rate and facilitates a soft landing (Figure 3.10, lower panel).31
By contrast, a higher degree of resistance to
exchange rate changes during the inflow period
and a greater degree of sterilization were unable
to prevent real appreciation and were generally
unsuccessful in achieving a soft landing.
The results of cross-sectional regressions on
the sample of events confirm the correlation
between post-inflow GDP growth and the macroeconomic policies captured by the event analysis.
In particular, Table 3.2 shows that countercyclical

ing episodes of large capital inflows is associated with a smaller post-inflow decline in GDP
growth, even after controlling for other factors
that may have had a role in this decline—such
as changes in the terms of trade, world output
growth, and the real U.S. Federal funds rate.32
The regressions also present evidence indicating that greater resistance to exchange market
pressures is associated with a sharper economic
slowdown in the aftermath of the episodes.33
32These regressions do not control for the endogeneity
of the variables and should therefore not be interpreted
as indicating a causality relationship among them. Their
only purpose is to analyze the correlation between the
dependent and policy variables in a multivariate context.
33Moreover, episodes that ended with a sudden stop
tend to have a sharper decline of GDP growth in the
aftermath of the episode, and also tend to be associated
with higher resistance to exchange market pressures—
20 of the 34 episodes that ended with a sudden stop are
characterized by a high (above median) value of the
resistance index.

LINKING MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES AND POLICY RESPONSES

Containing Real Exchange Rate Appreciation
These findings suggest that a smaller real
exchange rate appreciation in response to large
capital inflows may help reduce an economy’s
vulnerability to a sharp and costly reversal. But
what policies have been effective in containing
upward pressure on the exchange rate?
Splitting the episodes between those with high
(above-median) real appreciation and those
with low (below-median) real appreciation offers
a first attempt at answering this question.34
Figure 3.11 reveals that greater real appreciation
has been associated with stronger acceleration of
CPI inflation, more sterilized intervention, and
rising government expenditure. These results
suggest that a policy of sterilized intervention is
unlikely to prevent real appreciation and often
tends to be associated with higher inflation.
Moreover, in these episodes, a greater increase
in nominal interest rates—that is, a more
countercyclical monetary policy—is strongly
associated with greater real appreciation,
because higher returns on domestic assets end
up attracting more capital inflows and fueling
upward pressures on the currency. In contrast,
countercyclical fiscal policy in the form of slower
growth in government expenditure is again
strongly associated with lower real appreciation.
Finally, tighter controls on capital flows do not
appear to be associated with lower real appreciation (see Box 3.1 for detailed results on the role
of capital controls in the face of large capital
inflows).
To assess the strength of these correlations,
a cross-sectional regression was run on the
sample of events. This relates the extent of real
exchange rate appreciation during the period of
capital inflows to the policy responses discussed
in this chapter, along with other factors that may
also lead to real appreciation—including the

Figure 3.11. Real Effective Exchange Rate Appreciation

the cyclical component of government spending, a higher degree of sterilized
intervention, and an increase in nominal interest rates.

The results support the conclusion that a policy
of resistance to exchange market pressures does
not seem to be associated with lower real appreciation, while countercyclical fiscal policies have
had the desired effect (Table 3.3).

Regional Differences and Two Particularly
Relevant Cases
The importance of fiscal restraint in reducing
the degree of real exchange rate appreciation
and in smoothing GDP fluctuations in the periods surrounding the episodes is also borne out
from a regional perspective. The regions with
stronger real appreciation during the episodes,
Latin America and emerging Europe and the

124

CIS, also experienced larger increases in public
expenditure in those periods (Figure 3.12). By
contrast, the advanced economies that have
followed more countercyclical fiscal policies and
have refrained from resisting exchange market
pressures appear to have experienced less real
appreciation and smaller GDP growth fluctuations around the episodes.
It is also important to examine whether the
policy responses and outcomes depend on the
persistence of inflows and the current account
position.
• Episodes that lasted less than two years display
somewhat different patterns than longer
episodes, with significantly larger resistance
to exchange rate changes, less real appreciation, and better post-inflow GDP growth
(Figure 3.13, upper panel). However, these

CONCLUSIONS

results do not show that resistance is more
effective in such cases, because during short
inflow episodes higher resistance was not associated with significantly smaller real appreciation or better post-inflow growth (Figure 3.13,
lower panel). This suggests that resisting
exchange market pressures may be more feasible when facing transitory inflows, but it does
not generate significantly better outcomes, at
least when assessed over the entire duration
of the episodes.35 Moreover, in practice, it
may be difficult for policymakers to identify
ex ante when an episode of inflows will turn
out to be temporary.36
• The fiscal policy response appears to have
been less decisive in episodes associated with
high balance of payments pressures (defined
as an above-median sum of the current
account and net private capital inflows). For
such episodes, lower government spending
growth is not associated with significantly
lower real appreciation or better post-inflow
GDP growth (Figure 3.14, upper panel). By
contrast, fiscal spending restraint is associated with significantly better outcomes when
the episodes are characterized by low balance
of payments pressures (Figure 3.14, lower
panel). This suggests that a countercyclical
policy stance may be most important when
inflows occur in the context of a large current
account deficit.

spending.

large net private capital inflows over the past two
decades, focusing especially on the macroeconomic consequences of the policy choices made
in response to these inflows.
Although countries’ responses to a surge of
capital inflows depend on the specific nature
of the inflows as well as on various aspects of
their particular circumstances and objectives,
some overall patterns nonetheless emerge from
a systematic review of inflow episodes. First,
countries with relatively high current account
deficits have been more vulnerable to a sharp
reversal of capital inflows, because they have
been particularly affected by the increase in
aggregate demand and the real appreciation
of their currencies. Second, there is a clear
policy message that public expenditure restraint
during such episodes can contribute to both
a lower real exchange rate appreciation and
better post-inflow GDP growth performance.
Third, a policy of resistance to nominal
exchange rate appreciation has generally not
been successful in preventing real appreciation and has often been followed by a sharper
reversal of capital inflows, especially when these
inflows have persisted for a longer time. Fourth,
the chapter suggests that restrictions on capital
inflows have in general not facilitated lower real
appreciation and a soft landing at the end of an
episode.
These findings imply that the stabilization
challenges from large capital inflows are most
serious for countries with substantial current
account imbalances, which currently include
many emerging European countries. The most
effective tool available to policymakers to avoid
overheating and output instability is likely to
be fiscal restraint, especially in the context of
relatively inflexible exchange rate policies. This
chapter also suggests that even if a central bank
initially intervenes to resist nominal exchange
rate appreciation when capital inflows begin,
this stance should be progressively relaxed if the
inflows persist. This is because it becomes less
likely that such a policy will succeed in preventing real appreciation and a painful end to the
inflows.

APPENDIX 3.1. EVENT ANALYSIS AND POLICY INDICES: METHODOLOGIES AND DATA

In addition to the macroeconomic policy
instruments discussed in this chapter, the
authorities have other tools at their disposal,
which have not been analyzed systematically—
notably, financial supervision and regulation,
but also a wider range of policies such as labor
and product market reforms. The role of such
policies in responding to capital inflows would
be an important topic for future research.

Figure 3.14. Fiscal Policy and Balance of Payments
Pressures1
Fiscal spending restraint is particularly important in the context of larger current
account deficits (low balance of payments pressures).

Appendix 3.1. Event Analysis and Policy
Indices: Methodologies and Data
The main author of this appendix is Roberto
Cardarelli.

Event Analysis
Episodes of large net private capital inflows
were identified based on the following
methodology:
• For each country in the sample, a rolling,
backward-looking Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter (using the first five years of data and a
smoothing coefficient λ equal to 1,000) was
applied to annual net private capital inflows
to GDP ratios (NPCIR).37 For countries with
insufficient time observations, the HP filter was applied to the whole time series of
NPCIRs (with a λ equal to 100), rather than
on a rolling basis.
• For a country i, which belongs to region j, a
year t is an episode of “large capital inflow” if
either
– the deviation of the NPCIR from its trend at
time t is larger than one historical standard
deviation, and the NPCIR exceeds 1 percent
of GDP, or
– the NPCIR exceeds the 75th percentile of
the distribution of NPCIRs for the region j
over the whole sample.
Each episode begins in the first year in which
one of these criteria is satisfied and continues

in subsequent years if the episode continues to
meet these criteria.
According to this methodology, there could
be two consecutive episodes of large inflows.
However, sequences of episodes would make the
identification of pre- and post-episode periods
ambiguous. The following criteria are thus
adopted to make sure that there is no episode of
large capital inflows in the two years before each
episode:
• if the end-year of an episode is immediately
before the beginning year of another episode,
then the two episodes are combined to form a
single episode; and
• if there is only one year between the end of
an episode and the beginning of another, that
one year is included in the episode that combines the two episodes only if the NPCIR in
that year is positive. If it is negative, the first
episode is excluded.
Table 3.4 lists the episodes identified in this
chapter, and Figure 3.15 shows an example
using the case of Mexico.

The Exchange Market Pressure Index and the
Index of Resistance
For a country i in year t, the exchange market
pressure (EMP) index is defined as the weighted
average of two components: (1) the percent
change of the nominal exchange rate against a
reference country in year t (an increase indicates an appreciation) and (2) the change in
foreign reserves in year t. The weights are the
inverse of the standard deviations of the two
components, so as to ensure that none of them
dominates the index:38

38Weymark (1995) uses model-consistent weights, and
in particular weights that are based on the estimated
interest rate elasticity of the demand for money. Pentecost, Van Hooydonk, and Van Poeck (2001) use principal
component analysis to obtain the weights. This chapter
follows Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996); Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999); and Van Poeck, Vanneste, and
Veiner (2007), who use variance-smoothing weights.

where Δ%er i,t is the percentage year-over-year
change of the nominal bilateral exchange
rate of country i against a reference country,
identified as in Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger
(2005); Δresi,t is the change in country i central
bank’s net foreign assets (NFA) in year t normalized by the monetary base (MB) in year t – 1;
and σΔ%er and σΔres are the standard deviations
of the two variables in year t (based on the
monthly changes of exchange rates and foreign
reserves in the region to which the country

While the index ranges from – ∞ to +∞, its
values are standardized between the interval
0 and 1.40 When the index is equal to 0, it
means that there is no resistance to exchange
market pressures (either the exchange rate is
allowed to float freely or a “leaning with the
wind” policy is followed, which exacerbates,
rather than relieves, the exogenous pressures
on the exchange rate).41 When the index is
equal to 1, it denotes the maximum amount of
resistance (either the exchange rate is prevented
from moving at all or extreme forms of a “leaning against the wind” policy are followed, which
makes the exchange rate move in the opposite
direction to which it would have in the absence

39Using regional—rather than country-specific—
standard deviations avoids the risk that countries with
barely significant changes in their exchange rate would
result as having a flexible exchange rate policy because of
the very small standard deviation of these changes.
40In particular, if the index is negative or 0, it is
given the value of 0; if it is between 0 and 0.25, it is given
the value of 0.2; if it is between 0.25 and 0.5, it is given the
value of 0.4; if it is between 0.5 and 0.75, it is given the
value of 0.6; if it is between 0.75 and 1, it is given the value
of 0.8; and if it is 1 or above, it is given the value of 1.

negative values.

of intervention).42 Intermediate values between
0 and 1 indicate the extent to which market
pressures are relieved by intervention in the
foreign exchange market.

The Sterilization Index
For country i and year t, the sterilization
index is based on the coefficient β in the following annual ordinary least squares regression
(using 12 monthly observations):
ΔNDAi,t,m = αi,t + βi,t ΔNFAi,t,m + ui,t,m ,
where ΔNDAi,t,m is the monthly change in the
country i’s central bank’s net domestic assets
during month m of year t. This index measures
the central bank’s effort to sterilize the effect
of higher reserves on the monetary base, by
reducing its stock of domestic assets. This has
occurred generally through open market operations but also in several cases by transferring
deposits of the government or pension funds, or
the proceeds from privatization of public assets,
from the banking system to the central bank.43
A value of β equal to –1 or lower implies full
monetary sterilization, whereas a value of 0
represents no sterilization (values larger than
–1 imply “oversterilization”). For simplicity, the
slope coefficient is multiplied by –1, so that an
estimated value of the sterilization index equal
to 1 implies full sterilization, whereas a value of
0 represents no sterilization.
Although the chapter uses this index, a
broader sterilization index is also estimated
that reflects the central bank’s effort to prevent
an increase in the monetary base from causing an expansion of the money supply. This
has occurred generally through an increase in
the reserve requirements for the banking sec-

42These are the cases in which the index would have
values larger than 1.
43When the authorities offset the purchase of foreign
exchange by transferring government deposits from commercial banks to the central bank, the stock of the monetary base is unchanged, because they have exchanged
a claim on the domestic banking sector for an external
claim.

tor, which reduces the money multiplier. For
a year t, this broader index is the coefficient δ
in the annual regression based on 12 monthly
observations:
ΔM2i,t,m = αi,t + δi,t ΔNFAi,t,m + ui,t,m,
where ΔM2i,t,m is the monthly change in countryi money supply (defined as M2) in year t and
month m. In this case, a value of δ equal to 0
implies full monetary sterilization, whereas a
value of 1 represents no sterilization. Results
based on this broader index are consistent with
those obtained using the narrower index and
shown in the text. The results are available from
the authors on request.

4

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

This chapter examines the relationship between the
rapid pace of trade and financial globalization
and the rise in income inequality observed in most
countries over the past two decades. The analysis finds
that technological progress has had a greater impact
than globalization on inequality within countries.
The limited overall impact of globalization reflects
two offsetting tendencies: whereas trade globalization
is associated with a reduction in inequality, financial globalization—and foreign direct investment in
particular—is associated with an increase in inequality. It should be emphasized that these findings are
subject to a number of caveats related to data limitations, and it is particularly difficult to disentangle the
effects of technology and financial globalization since
they both work through processes that raise the demand
for skilled workers. The chapter concludes that policies
aimed at reducing barriers to trade and broadening
access to education and credit can allow the benefits of
globalization to be shared more equally.

T

he integration of the world economy
through the progressive globalization of
trade and finance has reached unprecedented levels, surpassing the pre–World
War I peak. This new wave of globalization is
having far-reaching implications for the economic well-being of citizens in all regions and
among all income groups, and is the subject of
active public debate. Previous issues of the World
Economic Outlook have analyzed the impact of globalization on business cycle spillovers and labor
markets (April 2007), on inflation (April 2006),
and on external imbalances (April 2005). This
chapter makes a further contribution to the
study of globalization by examining the impli-

cations for inequality and the distribution of
income within countries, with a focus on emerging market and developing countries (often
referred to as developing economies in the
remainder of the chapter).
The debate on the distributional effects of
globalization is often polarized between two
points of view. One school of thought argues
that globalization leads to a rising tide of
income, which raises all boats. Hence, even
low-income groups come out as winners from
globalization in absolute terms. This optimistic
view has parallels with the Kuznets hypothesis
from the development literature, which proposed that even though inequality might rise
in the initial phases of industrial development,
it eventually declined as the country’s transition to industrialization was completed.1 The
opposing school argues that although globalization may improve overall incomes, the benefits
are not shared equally among the citizens of a
country, with clear losers in relative and possibly even absolute terms.2 Moreover, widening
income disparities may not only raise welfare
and social concerns, but may also limit the drivers of growth because the opportunities created
by the process of globalization may not be fully
exploited.3 The sustainability of globalization
will also depend on maintaining broad support
across the population, which could be adversely
affected by rising inequality.
Against this background, this chapter
addresses the broad question of how globalization affects the distribution of income within
countries and the incomes of the poorest segment of the population in particular. The main

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

objectives are to (1) analyze the shifting patterns of globalization and income distribution
over the past two decades, (2) identify the main
channels through which increased trade and
financial globalization affect the distribution of
income within a country, and (3) offer policy
suggestions in light of the evidence that would
help countries take full advantage of the opportunities from globalization while also ensuring
that the benefits from globalization are shared
appropriately across the population.
This chapter aims to extend the considerable
literature on globalization and inequality along
several dimensions.4 Unlike previous studies,
which focus largely on trade globalization, this
chapter also analyzes various channels of financial globalization to offer a more comprehensive
view on the overall impact of globalization.
Moreover, the chapter aims to explain changes
in inequality over time across a broad range of
countries, rather than explain average levels of
inequality across a cross section of countries at
a common point in time. The analysis also uses
a new high-quality data set recently developed
by the World Bank, applying a more consistent
methodology than do most other studies that
rely on multiple data sources of uneven quality. However, data issues remain a concern in
any cross-country analysis of inequality, and the
results of the estimations in all such analyses
must be interpreted with some caution.
To anticipate the main conclusions, the available evidence does suggest that income inequality has risen across most countries and regions
over the past two decades, although the data
are subject to substantial limitations. Nevertheless, at the same time, average real incomes of
the poorest segments of the population have
increased across all regions and income groups.
The analysis finds that increasing trade and
financial globalization have had separately identifiable and opposite effects on income distribution. Trade liberalization and export growth

theoretical and empirical research on the distributional
effects of globalization in developing countries.

are found to be associated with lower income
inequality, whereas increased financial openness
is associated with higher inequality. However,
their combined contribution to rising inequality
has been much lower than that of technological
change, especially in developing countries. The
spread of technology is, of course, itself related
to increased globalization, but technological
progress is nevertheless seen to have a separately
identifiable effect on inequality.5 The disequalizing impact of financial openness—mainly felt
through foreign direct investment (FDI)—and
technological progress appear to be working
through similar channels by increasing the
premium on higher skills, rather than limiting
opportunities for economic advancement. Consistent with this, increased access to education is
associated with more equal income distributions
on average.
The next section reviews the evidence on
both globalization and inequality over the past
two decades, and how they have evolved across
regions and income groups. The following section discusses the channels through which trade
and financial globalization may be expected
to influence inequality within countries and
analyzes the empirical evidence to identify the
main factors explaining changes in inequality.
The concluding section offers some policy suggestions. Box 4.1 discusses in more detail the
analytical and measurement issues arising from
different methodologies used to collect and
summarize inequality data across countries and
regions. Box 4.2 looks in more detail at what
might be learned from more in-depth analyses
of individual country experiences and discusses
how the conclusions of such studies do not
easily lend themselves to generalization across
countries.6

5Although much of the existing economic literature on
globalization treats technological change as an exogenous
variable, technological progress can also be viewed as
potentially an additional channel through which globalization operates.
6See also Fishlow and Parker (1999) for a detailed
analysis of the link between globalization and inequality
in the United States.

World trade has grown five times in real
terms since 1980, and its share of world GDP
has risen from 36 percent to 55 percent over
this period (Figure 4.1).7 Trade integration
accelerated in the 1990s, as former Eastern bloc
countries integrated into the global trading
system and as developing Asia—one of the most
closed regions to trade in 1980—progressively
dismantled barriers to trade. However, it is
noteworthy that all groups of emerging market
and developing countries, when aggregated by
income group or by region, have been catching
up with or surpassing high-income countries
in their trade openness, reflecting the widespread convergence of low- and middle-income
countries’ trade systems toward the traditionally
more open trading regimes in place in advanced
economies.8
Financial globalization has also proceeded
at a very rapid pace over the past two decades.9
Total cross-border financial assets have more
than doubled, from 58 percent of global GDP
in 1990 to 131 percent in 2004. The advanced
economies continue to be the most financially
integrated, but other regions of the world have
progressively increased their cross-border asset
and liability positions (Figure 4.2). However,
de jure measures of capital account openness present a mixed picture, with the newly
industrialized Asian economies (NIEs) and
developing economies showing little evidence
of convergence to the more open capital
account regimes in advanced economies,

Of note, the share of FDI in total liabilities

17 percent of their total liabilities in 1990 to
38 percent in 2004—and far exceeds the share
of portfolio equity liabilities, which rose from
2 percent to 11 percent of total liabilities over
the same period. Reduced government borrowing needs have also contributed to changing liability structures, with the share of debt
in total liabilities falling across all emerging
market and developing country regions. Not
surprisingly, the share of international reserves
in cross-border assets has also risen, reflecting the accumulation of reserves among many
emerging market and developing countries in
recent years.

Has Income Distribution Within Countries
Become Less Equal?
Cross-country comparisons of inequality
are generally plagued by problems of poor
reliability, lack of coverage, and inconsistent
methodology.11 Some of these issues are discussed in more detail in Box 4.1. This chapter
relies on inequality data from the latest World
Bank Povcal database constructed by Chen and
Ravallion (2004, 2007) for a large number of
developing countries. This database uses a more
rigorous approach to filtering the individual
income and consumption data for differences
in quality than other commonly used databases,
which rely on more mechanical approaches

10Both de facto and de jure measures have advantages
and disadvantages, and are typically seen as complements
rather than substitutes in empirical studies. See Kose and
others (2006) for a discussion.
11Taking an alternative approach, Milanovic (2005b,
2006) and World Bank (2007) review patterns of global
income inequality, that is, income inequality across the
world’s citizens, and their relation to globalization. Such
studies typically conclude that global income inequality has declined with the increase in per capita incomes
in developing countries that globalization has fostered.
Policy implications within countries of such analysis are
less clear. A related branch of research on cross-country
income inequality focuses on the impact of globalization
on growth.

13See Deaton and Zaidi (2002) and Atkinson and
Bourguignon (2000). Most advanced and Latin American
economies construct inequality indices from income data,
whereas most African and developing Asian countries
use consumption data. World Bank (2006) illustrates
how consumption-based Gini coefficients tend to show
less inequality, in part because of government spending
programs.
14The Gini coefficient is computed as the average
difference between all pairs of incomes in a country, normalized by the mean (see Box 4.1). Other measures of
inequality include decile and quintile ratios, the Atkinson
index, and Theil’s entropy measure.

to combine data from multiple sources.12 The
Povcal database has been supplemented with
data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS)
database, which provides high-quality coverage
for advanced economies, and the resulting full
sample allows for more accurate within- and
cross-country comparisons than are available
elsewhere. Given limitations of data availability,
the analysis in this chapter uses inequality data
based on both income and expenditure surveys.
Mixing these two concepts makes a comparison of levels of inequality across countries and
regions potentially misleading.13 Given the
difficulty in comparing inequality levels across
countries, this section discusses them briefly
and focuses instead on changes, whereas the
empirical analysis relies solely on changes in
inequality to avoid the biases inherent in level
estimations.
Based on observed movements in Gini coefficients (the most widely used summary measure
of inequality), inequality has risen in all but the
low-income country aggregates over the past two
decades, although there are significant regional
and country differences (Figure 4.3).14 While
inequality has risen in developing Asia, emerging Europe, Latin America, the NIEs, and the
advanced economies over the past two decades,
it has declined in sub-Saharan Africa and the

This pattern remains broadly unchanged using
population-weighted averages, except for emerging market countries in Latin America, as a
result of the recent declines in inequality in
Brazil and Mexico. Among the largest advanced
economies, inequality appears to have declined
only in France, whereas among the major
emerging market countries, trends are more
diverse, with sharply rising inequality in China,
little change in India, and falling inequality
in Brazil, Mexico, and Russia.16 These overall
measures of inequality do not, however, capture
all country-specific characteristics of inequality within countries. As Box 4.2 illustrates, a
different method of aggregation of rural and
urban inequality in China leads to a substantially less sharp increase in overall inequality,
whereas in India there is substantial variation
in the experience of individual rural and urban
districts despite the relatively small changes at
the national level.
A more detailed picture of inequality is
revealed by examining income shares for different country groups (Figure 4.4). Overall,
changes in income shares by quintile (successive subsets with each containing 20 percent
of the population) across regions and income
levels mirror the evidence on inequality from
Gini coefficients. However, the data show that
rising Gini coefficients are explained largely
by the increasing share of the richer quintiles

15Among the CIS countries, available evidence suggests
that the sharp drop in inequality is partly a result of the
reversal of the abrupt deterioration in income distribution during the initial stages of transition. See World
Bank (2000), which suggests that inequality was substantially higher in the early 1990s in these countries.
16In a previous phase of (mainly trade) globalization,
the East Asian economies grew rapidly during 1965–89,
while income distribution either improved or did not
worsen. In addition to active government policies and
reforms such as land reforms, public housing, investments in health and rural infrastructure, and a manufacturing export-oriented growth strategy, investment in
education is cited as an important factor explaining low
average inequality (see Birdsall, Ross, and Sabot, 1995).
However, data on inequality during this phase are highly
tentative.

richest quintile at the expense of the middle quintiles, while there has been little
change in the poorest quintile.

at the expense of middle quintiles, whereas
the income share of the poorest quintile (1)
changes little. Looking at average income levels
across quintiles, per capita incomes have risen
across virtually all regions for even the poorest
quintiles (Figures 4.5 and 4.6). The exception is
Latin America, where there was a small overall
decline, driven mainly by the adverse impact of
economic and financial crises on the poor in
several countries. However, incomes have since
recovered from post-crisis lows. In fact, consistent with the evidence from the Gini coefficients, the incomes of the poorest quintile have
risen faster than those of other segments of the
population in sub-Saharan Africa and the CIS
countries, although from a very low base. Across
all regions, the evidence therefore suggests that
in an absolute sense the poor are no worse off
(except in a few post-crisis economies), and in
most cases significantly better off, during the
most recent phase of globalization.
In summary, two broad facts emerge from
the evidence. First, over the past two decades,
income growth has been positive for all quintiles
in virtually all regions and all income groups
during the recent period of globalization. At
the same time, however, income inequality has
increased mainly in middle- and high-income
countries, and less so in low-income countries.
This recent experience seems to be a clear
change in course from the general decline in
inequality in the first half of the twentieth century, and the perception that East Asia’s rapid
growth during the 1960s and 1970s was achieved
while maintaining inequality at relatively low
levels. It must be emphasized, however, that
comparison of inequality data across decades
is fraught with difficulty, in view of numerous
caveats about data accuracy and methodological
comparability.

decades can be attributed to increased globalization, and how much to other factors, such as
the spread of technology and domestic constraints on equality of opportunity. This section
first discusses the channels through which the
globalization of trade and finance could affect
the distribution of incomes within a country,
setting the stage for the empirical analysis that
follows.

Channels Through Which Globalization
Affects Inequality
The principal analytical link between trade
liberalization and income inequality provided
by economic theory is derived from the StolperSamuelson theorem: it implies that in a twocountry two-factor framework, increased trade
openness (through tariff reduction) in a developing country where low-skilled labor is abundant would result in an increase in the wages
of low-skilled workers and a reduction in the
compensation of high-skilled workers, leading
to a reduction in income inequality (see Stolper
and Samuelson, 1941). After tariffs on imports
are reduced, the price of the (importable) highskill-intensive product declines and so does the
compensation of the scarce high-skilled workers,
whereas the price of the (exportable) lowskill-intensive good for which the country has
relatively abundant factors increases and so does
the compensation of low-skilled workers. For an
advanced economy in which high-skill factors
are relatively abundant, the reverse would hold,
with an increase in openness leading to higher
inequality.
An important extension of the basic model
that weakens the dichotomy between advanced
and developing economies in terms of distributional effects is the inclusion of “noncompeting”
traded goods, that is, goods that are not produced in a country and are imported only as a
result, for example, of very large differences in
endowments across countries. Tariff reductions
would reduce the prices of these goods—and
therefore increase the effective real income of
households—without affecting wages and prices

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

Box 4.1. Measuring Inequality: Conceptual, Methodological, and Measurement Issues
Researchers on inequality employ several
different measures, guided by the availability of
underlying data and the focus of the research.1
Of these, the Gini index is a commonly used
summary measure of the income distribution of
a country.2 The Gini index captures the range
between a perfectly egalitarian distribution in
which all income is shared equally (a Gini coefficient of 0) and one where a single person has
all the income (a coefficient of 1). Gini coefficients typically range from 0.20 to 0.65.
Despite the Gini index’s widespread use,
numerous conceptual, methodological, and definitional issues make it difficult to compare Gini
indices across countries and over time.3 One
major source of variation is that some Gini indices are based on surveys of household consumption expenditure, whereas others are based on
income surveys—a difference that can change a
country’s observed Gini index on the order of
0.15 point. In general, consumption-based Gini
indices tend to show lower inequality and are
more commonly used in developing countries
in which higher rates of self-employment in
business or agriculture (where income fluctuates throughout the year) make measurement
of incomes difficult.4 Consumption-based Gini
indices are more common in Asia, sub-Saharan
Note: The main author of this box is Patrick
Hettinger.
1Measures of inequality include, in addition to the
Gini index, ratios of the average income of the richest
to poorest segments of the population, the Atkinson
index, the Theil entropy measure, and the mean logarithmic deviation of income.
n n
1 ∑
2The Gini index is defined as ––––
∑ yi – yj ,
2n2μ i=1 j=1
where μ is the mean income, yi and yj are the individually observed incomes, and n is the number of
observed incomes.
3A general discussion of the difficulties in using the
Gini index and data based on household surveys can
be found in Deaton (2003); Ravallion (2003); and
World Bank (2006).
4Among other causes, lower measures of consumptionbased inequality can result from consumption smoothing across time and greater measurement error for
incomes. See, for example, Ravallion and Chen
(1996); and Meyer and Sullivan (2006).

Africa, and, more recently, in central and
emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States, whereas income Ginis are
commonly used in advanced economies and
Latin America.5 Differences in definitions and
survey methodologies further complicate the use
of both consumption- and income-based Gini
indices. Comparability of Gini indices based on
consumption survey data can be limited as a
result of differences in definitions of consumption; variation in the number of consumption items that are separately distinguished in
surveys; whether survey participants record their
consumption or are asked to recall their consumption in an interview; changes in the length
of the recall period during which survey participants are asked to report their consumption;
different methods used to impute housing, durables, and home production consumption; inconsistencies in the treatment of seasonality and the
timing of surveys; underreporting or misleading
reports of consumption of some items; and variation in respondents within a household. Income
inequality data can also vary depending on
whether the income is pre- or post-tax; whether
and how in-kind income, imputed rents, and
home production are included; and whether all
income—including remittances, other transfers,
and property income—or only wage earnings
are captured.6
More general concerns with both types of
Gini indices are that some surveys are not
nationally representative and exclude rural populations, the military, students, or populations
living in areas that are expensive or dangerous
to survey. In addition, survey nonresponse and
underreporting of income—which occurs more
often in the high-income groups in a country—
can skew income distributions, thereby underreporting inequality. Also, whether and how

of income vary across countries. See Luxembourg

Inequality Database.

a survey adjusts for price-level differences
between urban and rural areas can significantly
alter distribution data.
Finally, there are differences between indicators of household and individual inequality.
Household inequality measures, which were
much more common before 1980, may show
changing inequality over time merely as a result
of changes in household size and composition.
Adjusting inequality indicators to a per capita
unit of analysis helps avoid this bias, and various
methods have been adopted for making this
adjustment.7
Although survey guidelines exist, they are not
consistently applied over time and across countries, so that different surveys and even different
survey rounds can produce different results.8

7For several examples of how measures are adjusted,
see World Income Inequality Database (2005).
8See Canberra Group (2001); and Deaton and Zaidi
(2002).

of other traded goods.17 If this noncompeting
good is a large share of the consumption basket
of poorer segments of society, a reduction in the
tariff on the noncompeting good would reduce
inequality in that country. More generally, in
both advanced and developing economies, if
tariffs are reduced for noncompeting goods that
are not produced in a country but are consumed particularly by the poor, it would lead to
lower inequality in both advanced and developing economies.
The implications of the Stolper-Samuelson
theorem, in particular the ameliorating effects
of trade liberalization on income inequality in
developing countries, have generally not been
verified in economy-wide studies.18 A particular
17See, for example, Davis and Mishra (2007) for an
overview of analytical and empirical approaches to the
relationship between trade, inequality, and poverty.
18See Milanovic (2005a) for a survey of recent papers
linking trade globalization to inequality, which notes that

When comparing Gini indices, meticulous attention to concepts, definitions, and the details of
survey methodology is required to improve comparability, and the World Bank’s Povcal database
goes further than other databases in doing this.9
The database was created using primary data
from nationally representative surveys with sufficiently comprehensive definitions of income
or consumption. Attempts were made to ensure
survey comparability over time within countries,
although cross-country and within-country
comparisons are still impaired because in many
cases it was not possible to correct for differences in survey methods. Finally, measures are
calculated consistently and on a per capita basis.
For the econometric analysis in this study, using
changes over time in Gini indices from this
database rather than levels can address some of
the major concerns regarding comparability of
indices across countries.

Chen and Ravallion (2004).

challenge has been to explain the increase in
skill premium between skilled and unskilled
workers observed in most developing countries. This has led to various alternative analytical approaches, including the introduction of
(1) multiple countries where poor countries may
also import low-skill-intensive goods from other
poor countries and rich countries may similarly
import high-skill-intensive goods from other rich
countries; (2) a continuum of goods, implying
that what is low-skill intensive in the advanced
economy will be relatively high-skill intensive
in a less-developed country (see Feenstra and
Hanson, 1996); and (3) intermediate imported
goods used for the skill-intensive product. However, these extensions have themselves presented
additional challenges for empirical testing, and

most papers find either no statistically significant relationship or a negative relationship between globalization and
inequality.

CHAPTER 4

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

Box 4.2. What Do Country Studies of the Impact of Globalization on Inequality Tell Us? Examples
from Mexico, China, and India
A complementary approach to the crosscountry analysis of the impact of globalization
on inequality used in this chapter is to look in
detail at particular country experiences (see
Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2007). The advantage
of country studies is that they focus on more
detailed measures of inequality (that is, wage
inequality) and at a finer level of disaggregation
geographically or by sector. In addition, they
also use more detailed data for other variables,
such as tariffs and social policies. Given that
globalization may affect inequality through
different channels and at different speeds in
different countries, country studies can provide
important insights that cannot be gained in
cross-country work and in which policies and
outcomes can be more closely related.1 The
following overview of recent studies on Mexico,
China, and India illustrates the usefulness as
well as the limitations of country studies.2
Mexico
Mexico undertook far-reaching reforms
between 1985 and 1994 that opened its economy
to trade and capital flows. Over the same period,
the earnings gap between high- and low-skilled
workers began to widen, generating a substantial body of literature that examined whether
this increasing gap was caused by the process of

Note: The main author of this box is Chris Papageorgiou, with contributions by Gordon Hanson and
Petia Topalova.
1A limitation of most of these country studies is that
they do not control explicitly for technological progress and, in some cases, for financial globalization,
both of which were found in this chapter to play a
key role. Another limitation is the use of a differencein-difference methodology that does not capture the
countrywide effect of globalization on inequality.
While liberalization may have an overall effect of
increasing or lowering inequality, this methodology
tests whether this overall effect was unequal, and
whether certain industries or regions benefited more
from globalization than others.
2Studies that focus on the experiences of Colombia,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Hong Kong SAR are
summarized in Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007).

146

opening up.3 In broad terms, researchers have
found that the patterns of trade liberalization
may have contributed to increasing the earnings gap. Hanson and Harrison (1999) find
that trade protection was initially higher in
less-skill-intensive sectors, and was reduced by
more in these sectors during reform. If these
tariff changes were passed through to changes
in prices of goods, then the logic of the StolperSamuelson theorem would imply that the relative
wage of skilled labor would have risen. Robertson
(2004) finds evidence in support of this conclusion, with the relative price of skill-intensive
goods in Mexico rising during 1987–94 and raising the relative wages of white-collar labor.
Other studies with a slightly different focus
find that although globalization may have
contributed to widening earnings inequality in
Mexico, low-skilled workers have benefited in
absolute terms as a result of the policy changes.
Nicita (2004) shows that during the 1990s, tariff
changes raised disposable income for all households, with richer households enjoying a 6 percent increase and poorer households enjoying a
2 percent increase, leading to a 3 percent reduction in the number of households in poverty. In
a related work, Hanson (2007) finds that during
the 1990s, individuals in regions more exposed to
globalization enjoyed a 10 percent gain in labor
income relative to individuals in regions less
exposed to globalization, resulting in a reduction in poverty rates in high-exposure regions of
7 percent relative to low-exposure regions.
China
The dramatic increase in trade liberalization
in China has been accompanied by a large fall
in poverty rates, but also an increase in income
inequality, with the overall Gini coefficient rising sharply from 0.28 in 1981 to 0.42 in 2004.
The observed increase in overall inequality
3In 1988, urban workers at the 90th percentile had
labor earnings that were 3.6 times those of workers at
the 10th percentile. By 2004, the ratio had grown to
4.7 times, with large fluctuations in relative earnings
around the Mexican peso crisis in 1994–95.

Statistics Bureau. The second data set consists of two
surveys of households conducted in 1988 and 1995 by
international economists and the Economics Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The study
relies on data from urban areas and rural counties
administered by cities—an administrative arrangement specific to China—but not rural counties administered directly by prefectures.
5The Theil index is an alternative to the Gini coefficient. One of the advantages of the Theil index is that
because it is the weighted sum of inequality within
subgroups, it is easier to decompose. The particular
decomposition of the Theil index used in Wei and
Wu (2007, pp. 25–26) was proposed by Shorrocks
(1980) and Mookherjee and Shorrocks (1982). More
specifically, overall inequality is given by I = Vr λr Ir +
VuλuIu + Vr λr logλr + Vuλulogλu, where Vr and Vu are the
proportions of population living in rural and urban
areas, respectively; λr and λu are the ratios of rural
and urban average incomes to the overall national
average income, respectively; and Ir and Iu are withinrural and within-urban Theil indices, respectively. The
World Bank (1997) estimates that 75 percent of the
change in the overall inequality is explained by urbanrural inequality during the period 1984–95.

is mostly attributed to growing differences
between rural and urban household incomes
and uneven growth in incomes among urban
households (see top panel of the figure, from
Lin, Zhuang, and Yarcia, forthcoming). Focusing on inequality between 1988 and 1995, Wei
and Wu (2007) also find that the aggregate
inequality numbers may obscure a more subtle
pattern of underlying changes. These authors
examine the effect of trade globalization on
Chinese income inequality using new methods
and two unique data sets on 39 urban and 40
rural Chinese regions. The first data set allows
examination of urban-rural income inequality and the second allows the examination of
within-urban and within-rural inequality.4 The
authors employ a decomposition of the Theil
index that combines the urban-rural, intraurban, and intra-rural inequalities into an
overall measure of income inequality, arguing
that their Theil decomposition approach more
accurately captures the unequal effects of the
different components of overall inequality.5

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

Box 4.2 (concluded)
Illustrating the importance of the method
of aggregation, the bottom three panels in the
figure present correlations between trade openness and urban-rural inequality, within-rural
inequality, and within-urban inequality. The
authors’ formal econometric analysis, consistent
with the correlations in the figure, reveals that
trade liberalization reduces urban-rural income
inequality, leads to a relatively small increase in
intra-urban inequality, and decreases intra-rural
inequality. More important, summing up the
three components of inequality, the authors estimate that increased openness modestly reduces
overall inequality.6
This finding contrasts with the more widespread perception that trade liberalization has
contributed to the rise in income inequality in
China. A key lesson from this exercise is that the
appropriate decomposition and measurement
of income inequality across different regions
can modify the observed effect of openness on
income inequality in China.
The Chinese experience does not necessarily
imply that the effect of trade liberalization on
income inequality suggested by this methodology would be the same in other countries, given
the diverse mechanisms through which globalization operates. Moreover, data limitations in
many countries typically do not allow for the
application of such a methodology.
India
India intensified reforms aimed at opening
up its economy in the early 1990s, through
reduction in tariffs and nontariff barriers, lowered barriers to foreign direct investment, and
liberalization of restrictive domestic regulations.
Kumar and Mishra (forthcoming) evaluate
empirically the impact of the 1991 trade liberalization in India on industry wages.7 The paper
6In related work using household survey data for
29 Chinese provinces for 1988–2001, Zhang and Wan
(2006) find that trade liberalization increases the
income share of the poor living in urban households.
7The data set combines microlevel data from the
National Sample Survey Organisation with data on
international trade protection for the years 1980–2000.

uses variations in industry wage premiums and
trade policy across industries and over time.
Industry wage premiums are defined as the
portion of individual wages that accrues to the
worker’s industry affiliation after controlling for
worker characteristics. Since different industries
employ different proportions of skilled workers, changes in wage premiums translate into
changes in the relative incomes of skilled and
unskilled workers (see Pavcnik and others, 2004;
and Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2005). The results
suggest that reductions in tariffs were associated
with increased wages within an industry, likely
reflecting productivity increases. In addition,
the study finds evidence that trade liberalization
has led to decreased wage inequality between
skilled and unskilled workers. This is consistent
with the larger tariff reductions in sectors with a
higher proportion of unskilled workers.
Other studies focus on the effect of tariff
changes on income inequality at the district
level. Topalova (2007) relates post-liberalization
variations in industrial composition across
districts to the degree of opening to foreign
trade and FDI across industries.8 Additional
research applies a difference-in-difference
methodology to investigate how consumption
across the entire income distribution varied with
the district’s exposure to a decline in protection and the liberalization of FDI. Results from
this work suggest that trade liberalization led
to an increase in inequality, especially in urban
districts, where the incomes of the richest and
those with higher education rose substantially
faster relative to households at the bottom of
the income distribution. Although the estimates
for the rural sample are not statistically significant, across all measures of inequality the point
estimates imply that a decline in tariffs is associated with an increase in inequality. Moreover,
there does not seem to be any relationship

8This study uses consumption-based data from
360 districts (those in the 15–16 largest states in
India) and for two time periods, 1987 and 1999. For
a detailed explanation of the data and estimation
method used, see Topalova (2007).

between FDI and inequality within a district in
either the rural or the urban samples.
Conclusion
This box demonstrates how country studies can take advantage of more disaggregated
and more detailed data to study the effects
of globalization on inequality. However, no
study can capture all aspects of this relationship, and each study focuses instead on some
parameters of particular interest. In the case of
Mexico, wage, rather than income, inequality
was used to capture distributional disparities
across regions. In the China example, decom-

none has been consistently established.19 This
has led to explanations for rising skill premiums
based on the notion that technological change is
inherently skill biased, attributing the observed
increases in inequality (including in advanced
economies) to exogenous technology shocks.
Any empirical estimation of the overall effects of
globalization therefore needs to account explicitly for changes in technology in countries, in
addition to standard trade-related variables.
An additional important qualification to
the implications deriving from the StolperSamuelson theorem relates to its assumption
that labor and capital are mobile within a
country but not internationally. If capital can
travel across borders, the implications of the
theorem weaken substantially. This channel
would appear to be most evident for FDI, which
is often directed at high-skill sectors in the host
economy.20 Moreover, what appears to be relatively high-skill-intensive inward FDI for a less19The level of aggregation of tariff data does not, for
example, allow for clear identification of noncompeting imports in general and noncompeting intermediate
goods in particular. Furthermore, in a multicountry
setting with more than one low-skill-abundant country,
it is unclear which goods are exportable and which are
importable.
20See Cragg and Epelbaum (1996); and Behrman,
Birdsall, and Székely (2003).

position between urban and rural inequality
was shown to be fundamental in the estimation
of the globalization-inequality relationship.
In the India study, detailed import-tariff data
across industries and districts were used as the
measure of trade openness. The results from
these case studies reveal a more intricate picture
of the globalization-inequality interrelationship that cannot be captured in cross-country
studies. The evidence broadly suggests that the
mechanisms through which globalization affects
inequality are country- and time-specific, reflecting the great heterogeneity of countries and the
nature and timing of their trade reforms.

developed country may appear to be relatively
low-skill-intensive outward FDI for the advanced
economy. An increase in FDI from advanced
economies to developing economies could thus
increase the relative demand for skilled labor
in both countries, increasing inequality in both
the advanced and the developing economy.
The empirical evidence on these channels has
provided mixed support for this view, with the
impact of FDI seen as either negative, at least in
the short run, or inconclusive.21
In addition to foreign direct investment, there
are other important channels through which
capital flows across borders, including crossborder bank lending, portfolio debt, and equity
flows. Within this broader context, some have
argued that greater capital account liberalization may increase access to financial resources
for the poor, whereas others have suggested that
by increasing the likelihood of financial crises,
greater financial openness may disproportionately hurt the poor. 22 Some recent research has
21See Behrman, Birdsall, and Székely (2003), who find
negative effects in the short term in Latin America, and
Milanovic (2005a), who suggests that the evidence from a
wide sample of countries is inconclusive.
22See Agénor (2002) for a discussion of the channels
through which financial integration may hurt the poor,
and Fallon and Lucas (2002), who find that the evidence
on the distributional effects of crises is not uniform.

found that the strength of institutions plays a
crucial role: in the context of strong institutions,
financial globalization may allow better consumption smoothing and lower volatility for the poor,
but where institutions are weak, financial access
is biased in favor of those with higher incomes
and assets and the increase in finance from tapping global and not just domestic savings may
further exacerbate inequality.23 Thus, the composition of financial flows may matter, and the net
impact may also be influenced by other factors,
such as the quality of financial sector institutions.
In summary, analytical considerations suggest
that any empirical analysis of the distributional
consequences of globalization must take into
account both trade and the various channels
through which financial globalization operates, and also account for the separate impact
of technological change. Moreover, against
the background of real-world patterns of trade
and financial flows, theory does not provide
clear guidance on whether globalization affects
inequality in advanced and developing economies differently.

An Empirical Investigation of
Globalization and Inequality
Despite common perceptions, casual observation does not suggest an obvious association
between changes in inequality across countries
and changes in the degree to which countries have globalized over the same period
(Figure 4.7). But this is perhaps not surprising,
given the multiple channels through which such
a relationship would operate and the variety
of other factors that are also relevant. This
chapter thus looks closely at cross-country data,
relating changes in inequality to a broad set of
variables that may affect income distribution,
23See Prasad and others (2007) for a discussion of
lower volatility from financial globalization. While
Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine (2007) argue that financial
development is more positive for the poorest segment of
the population, primarily through its positive effect on
overall growth, Claessens and Perotti (forthcoming) find
that the outcome can be different as most of the benefits
of financial reforms are captured by a small elite.

150

AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

including both variables that capture different
aspects of globalization and other factors that
can be important in determining how inequality
changes in countries over time.
• One key factor is the role of technology. To the
extent that technological change favors those
with higher skills and exacerbates the “skills
gap,” it could adversely affect the distribution
of income in both developing and advanced
economies by reducing the demand for lowerskill activities and increasing the premium for
higher-skill activities and returns on capital
(see, for example, Birdsall, 2005; and the
April 2007 issue of the World Economic Outlook).
Technological development is measured in this
study by the share of information and communications technology (ICT) capital in the total
capital stock, which has risen rapidly over the
past 20 years across all regions (Figure 4.8).
• A second important variable is access to
education. For a given level of technology,
greater access to education would be expected
to reduce income inequality by allowing a
greater share of the population to be engaged
in high-skill activities. Educational opportunities have tended to increase across all regions,
but with considerable cross-country variation.
• A third factor affecting income distribution is the sectoral share of employment.
In developing countries, a move away from
the agricultural sector to industry could
be expected to improve the distribution of
income by increasing the income of lowearning groups.24 In this context, greater
flexibility in labor markets that facilitates a
move away from low-return occupations to
those where opportunities are better can also
be expected to improve the distribution of
income (see Topalova, 2007).
• Another important variable that affects
inequality is financial development, measured as the ratio of private credit to GDP. As
discussed in the previous section, even though

24Similarly, increases in the relative productivity of agriculture might be expected to reduce income disparities by
increasing the income of those employed in this sector.

Figure 4.8. Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) Capital, Private Credit, Education,
and Sectoral Employment Shares
Globalization is only one of the factors that have affected inequality. Rapid
technological change, financial deepening, improvements in education, and the
shift of employment away from agriculture are other significant developments with
potentially important implications for inequality.

the rich, further exacerbating initial inequality in access to finance.
The first stage of the empirical investigation looks at the relationship between summary measures of trade and financial openness
and income inequality. This is followed by a

AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

more disaggregated analysis of the relationship
between various components of trade and financial openness and inequality. Other explanatory
variables included in the estimations are the
share of ICT in a country’s total capital stock,
credit to the private sector, the average number of years of education and its distribution,
and the share of employment in agriculture
and industry. The analysis focuses on changes
in inequality over time and controls for differences in levels across countries, using country
fixed effects.25 The model is estimated on a
panel of 51 countries (of which 31 are emerging market and developing countries) over the
period 1981–2003, with additional tests that split
the sample between advanced and developing
economies.26
The results indicate that the main factor driving the recent increase in inequality
across countries has been technological progress. Based on the benchmark model, which
is described in more detail in Appendix 4.1,
technological progress alone explains most of
the 0.45 percent average annual increase in the
Gini coefficient from the early 1980s (Table 4.1,
column b; and Figure 4.9).27 Trade and financial globalization and financial deepening
25An additional advantage of focusing on within-country
variation is to reduce the risk of omitted variable bias. The
impact of common global shocks such as business cycles
or growth spurts is excluded using time dummies.
26Since income and consumption surveys are not conducted annually, the estimations use an unbalanced panel
with observations included only for years for which actual
data are available. Moreover, given the smaller size of the
samples for advanced and developing economies, the
results on these subgroups are more tentative.
27 The results are robust to including changes in GDP
per capita as an explanatory variable. However, this variable was excluded in the reported estimations in order
to estimate the full effects of the variables of interest,
including their effect through higher overall growth.
Other possible explanatory variables (democracy,
constraints on the executive, flexibility of regulations,
real exchange rate, and terms of trade) were initially
included, but their effects were not robustly estimated.
Comprehensive data on government social spending and
transfers, migration, and remittances were not available
across all countries, although these channels may potentially have important additional effects on the observed
inequality outcomes.

Figure 4.9. Explaining Gini Coefficient Changes1,2
(Average annual percent change)
The disequalizing effect of globalization was larger in advanced economies, in part
because of outward foreign direct investment, while in developing countries, and
especially in developing Asia, technological change was the main contributor to the
rise in inequality.

contributed a further 0.1 percent a year each
to raising the Gini coefficient, offset by almost
equivalent reductions in the Gini coefficient
from increased access to education and a shift
of employment away from agriculture.28 The
small net negative impact of globalization on
inequality is a result of the opposing influences
of different components of globalization: trade
globalization has exerted an equalizing impact,
whereas financial globalization (and FDI in
particular) has been associated with widening
income disparities over the period examined in
this study (Figure 4.10).29
An analysis using more disaggregated data
and estimating the regression coefficients for
advanced and developing economies separately
suggests that the impact of globalization on
inequality varies across country groups. Among
advanced economies, globalization has contributed somewhat more than technology to the
0.6 percent average annual increase in the Gini
coefficient over the past two decades. Among
developing countries, however, technology has
been the main driving factor in the 0.3 percent
annual average increase in the Gini coefficient;
by contrast, globalization provided a small counterweight. These differences can be explained
by changes in the channels of globalization
across these two groups, with financial globaliza-

28The regression coefficient on education is imprecisely
estimated in the benchmark model, a common problem in macroeconomic studies on the effect of education. However, microeconomic studies have generally
been more successful in establishing the returns from
investment in education, particularly for countries with
lower per capita income and for primary education (see
Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004). The education variables applied in the regressions are from Barro and Lee
(2000), as explained in Appendix 4.1.
29The reported results were confirmed for robustness
in several ways. In order to address concerns that inequality may itself influence globalization variables, the exportto-GDP ratio and the ratio of the inward stock of FDI to
GDP were instrumented using their lagged value, the
export-weighted real GDP of trade partners (a measure of
the demand for the country’s exports), and an (inverse)
distance-weighted sum of advanced economies’ FDI assets
(a measure of the supply of FDI). The results proved
robust to endogeneity as well as to dropping one country
at a time from the sample.

tion having expanded much more rapidly in
advanced economies, and trade globalization
having expanded more rapidly in developing
economies.
Looking at the results in more detail, the
positive effect of trade on reducing income
inequality is particularly noticeable for agricultural exports, especially in developing countries
where agriculture still employs a large share of
the workforce (Table 4.1, column c).30 Algeria,
Brazil, Nicaragua, and Thailand are examples
of countries where rising agricultural export
shares have been associated with declining
inequality—whereas the reverse has occurred
in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Jamaica, and Sri Lanka
(Figure 4.11). This conclusion is supported by
evidence (see Table 4.1, column d) indicating that a rise in the relative productivity of
agriculture is also associated with a reduction in inequality. A shift of underemployed
agricultural workers away from agriculture to
industry and services—which would raise the
agricultural sector’s productivity relative to the
average of the economy—also tends to reduce
inequality. The net impact of tariff reduction
is also found to be positive in reducing income
inequality.
For advanced economies, imports from developing countries are associated with a reduction in inequality.31 This would be explained

greater share of their consumption than for the
richer segment.33
Financial globalization, and especially FDI,
appears to be associated with higher inequality.
While it is inward FDI that exacerbates inequality in developing countries, in advanced economies there is an additional negative effect from
outward FDI. This finding is consistent with
evidence that FDI tends to take place in more
skill- and technology-intensive sectors (from
the point of view of the host country), increasing the relative demand for skilled workers
in both advanced and developing economies
(Figure 4.12). This is, however, an average
effect over the sample period. The impact of
FDI can be expected to vary by sector and dissipate over time as workers acquire skills and
education.
The finding that investment in technological
advances has a disequalizing impact is consistent with the view that new technology, in both
advanced and developing economies, increases
the premium on skills and automates relatively
low-skill inputs (see Birdsall, 2007). Just as FDI
increases the rewards for higher-value-added
activities, technological progress also creates
greater demands for those with higher skills. In
advanced economies, the use of technology is
widespread in both manufacturing and services, raising the skills premium in a substantial
portion of the economy. Among developing
countries, the effect of technological progress is
stronger in Asia than in Latin America, possibly reflecting the greater share of technologyintensive manufacturing in Asia (Figure 4.13).
Despite the distinct and separate effect of
technology on inequality that is found in the
data, it remains important to keep in mind that
the spread of technology and increasing globalization are not independent—technological
advances have helped deepen trade and financial linkages between countries, while globalization has helped spread the use of technology.

33Income-based Gini coefficients often do not use different price deflators for rich and poor segments and are
thus typically not able to capture this effect.

AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

34There

was no evidence of a threshold effect by
income level for this result, suggesting that the type of
financial system—that is, based on relationship or arm’slength transaction—may be a more important determinant of equality of access to finance (see the September
2006 issue of the World Economic Outlook).

Residual inequality

The evidence that domestic financial deepening adversely affects inequality is consistent with
the notion that although overall financial depth
is associated with higher growth, a disproportionately larger share of financial flows accrues
to those with higher endowments and income
that can serve as collateral.34 As a result, the
already better-off segments of the population
are better able to invest in human and physical
capital and increase their income.
To gain further insight into the impact of globalization on inequality, the empirical model was
also estimated using the income shares of the
five quintiles of the population as dependent
variables (Table 4.2). Most of the results from
the preceding analysis are confirmed, although
the estimates at the quintile level are less precise
for tariff liberalization and technological progress. In line with the changes observed in the
income shares of quintiles (see Figure 4.4), the
effects on the bottom four quintiles are qualitatively similar and in the opposite direction from
that on the richest quintile.
Export growth is associated with a rise in the
income shares of the bottom four quintiles and a
decrease in the share of the fifth (that is, the richest) quintile. Similarly, a reduction in the share
of agricultural employment (which raises the
sector’s productivity of labor) is also associated
with a rise in the income share of the bottom
four quintiles, whereas it has the opposite effect
on the income share of the richest quintile. The
benefits of tariff reduction are mostly concentrated in the income shares of the three bottom
quintiles, offset by a decrease in the income share
of the top quintile. In contrast, financial globalization, technological progress, and greater financial deepening benefit mainly the income share
of the richest 20 percent of the population.
Across the whole sample of countries, technological progress is seen to be the main driver

of the fall in the income share of the bottom
quintile and the rise of the income share of the
top quintile (Figure 4.14). Globalization has
contributed only moderately to net changes in
income shares because the beneficial effects of
export growth and tariff reductions for all but
the richest quintile have substantially offset the
disequalizing impact of inward FDI. Although
the income shares of the four bottom quintiles
have declined overall, it is important to note
that the average levels of income within these
quintiles have been rising, as technological progress, financial deepening, and globalization have
been important drivers of overall growth (see
Figures 4.5 and 4.6).35 Average income levels in

the bottom four quintiles have, however, grown
at a lower rate than in the top quintile. The
important exceptions to this general pattern are
sub-Saharan Africa and the Commonwealth of
Independent States.36 In these regions, income
levels in the lower quintiles have grown faster
than for the top quintile.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Inequality has been rising in countries across
all income levels, except those classified as low
income. Underlying these trends, the income
share of the richest quintile has risen, whereas
36Available evidence suggests that rising exports and
tariff liberalization have been the major factor contributing to the reduction in inequality observed in subSaharan Africa, offset partially by the effect of technology
and, to a lesser extent, FDI (see Figures 4.9 and 4.10).

Of which:

the shares of the remaining quintiles have
declined. This chapter finds that, subject to the
limitations imposed by the availability of data,
technological progress has made the biggest
contribution to rising income inequality over
the past two decades. Globalization has had
a much smaller disequalizing impact overall,
reflecting the offsetting positive impact of trade
globalization and a negative impact from FDI.
In advanced economies, rising imports from
developing countries are associated with declining income inequality, whereas in developing
economies, both rising agricultural exports and
tariff liberalization have contributed to improving income distribution. Foreign direct investment has on average had a disequalizing impact
on the distribution of income over the sample
period, as higher FDI inflows have increased
the demand for skilled labor, whereas outward
FDI in advanced economies has reduced the
demand for relatively lower-skilled workers in
these countries. Among other factors, financial
deepening has also had a moderately negative
impact on income distribution, whereas greater
access to education and a shift in employment
from agriculture to industry and services have
supported improved distribution of income.
Thus, contrary to popular concerns, trade globalization is not found to have a negative impact
on income distribution in either developing or
advanced economies. Moreover, the positive
role found for agricultural exports in improving distributional outcomes suggests the importance of reforms in developing countries to
support growth of this sector. At the same time,
greater liberalization of access for agricultural
exports from developing countries to advanced
economies’ markets would support a more equal
distribution of income in both developing and
advanced economies.
Although FDI is associated with greater
income inequality over the period of this study,
it is associated with higher growth overall, and
the result basically reflects an increase in the
returns from acquiring higher skills. The impact
of FDI may also vary by sector. Nevertheless,
it might be expected that over a longer time

available. The contribution of each variable is computed as the average annual change in
the variable times the regression coefficient on the variable (see Appendix 4.1).
Regression coefficients are taken from Table 4.2.
2 The contribution of globalization is the sum of the contributions of the export-to-GDP
ratio, the tariff rate, and the ratio of inward FDI stock to GDP. The contribution of other
factors is the sum of the contributions of the ratio of credit to private sector to GDP,
the education variables, the sectoral employment shares, and the residual.

GLOBALIZATION AND INEQUALITY

horizon, the disequalizing effects of FDI will
dissipate as the increased demand for education
and skills is met with improved supply.37 The
appropriate policy response is therefore not to
suppress FDI or technological change, but to
make increased access to education a priority.
This would allow less-skilled and low-income
groups to capitalize on the opportunities from
both technological progress and the ongoing
process of globalization, thereby shortening the
length of time over which FDI has a disequalizing impact.
Finally, financial deepening in and of itself
increases growth, but appears to have a disequalizing impact because of the unequal access to
finance between rich and poor segments of the
population. Policy reforms aimed at broadening
access to finance, such as by improving institutions that promote pro-poor lending, could help
improve the overall distribution of income, even
as finance broadly continues to support overall
growth.
The analysis presented in this chapter suggests that there are some common factors that
can explain the broad patterns of inequality
across countries and regions. However, individual country circumstances vary. The substantial literature analyzing inequality in individual
countries underscores the need to understand
the regional and sectoral dimensions of inequality and its relationship with globalization, and
individual country circumstances with respect
to the structure of the economy. Policies will
therefore need to be calibrated to specific country circumstances to ensure that the maximum
benefits of globalization for growth and poverty
reduction can be realized.

Variable Definitions and Data Sources
This section provides further details on the
construction of the variables and the data
sources used in this chapter. The data cover 143
countries during 1980–2006, with the number of
observations varying by country and variable.

Gini Index and Quintile Income Shares
The primary source for the Gini index (also
known as the Gini coefficient) and income
share data (referring to individual inequality,
unless mentioned otherwise) is the World Bank
Povcal database. For Mexico and Poland, the
consumption-based Gini indices and quintile
income shares were extrapolated historically
for the period prior to 1992—for which only
income-based measures are available—by assuming that the changes in consumption-based
measures are identical to the observed changes
in income-based measures that are available for
that period. A similar process was applied to
Peru’s data prior to 1990, applying the changes
in the observed consumption-based measures
for earlier years to the income-based Gini index
available from 1990 onward. For Argentina
and Uruguay, the data cover only urban areas
because of the high rate of urbanization in these
two countries. For China and India, data with
full country coverage (combining urban and
rural data from the World Bank Povcal database) were provided by Shaohua Chen of the
World Bank.38
When Povcal data were not available (mainly
for advanced economies), the data from the
Luxembourg Income Study were used, as provided in the World Income Inequality Database,
Version 2.0b, May 2007 (WIDER). These data
are mostly available only until 2000. The following other sources were also used to increase coverage for advanced economies: data for Australia
are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; data
for Germany are from the Deutsches Institüt für
38The Gini indices for China and India account for
the difference in cost of living between rural and urban
areas, whereas the income shares for these two countries
do not.

the European Commission; household inequality data for Hong Kong SAR are from the Hong
Kong Census and Statistics; household inequality data for Singapore are from Ong Whee Sze
(2002); household Gini index data for Japan
are from Shirahase (2001); income share data
for Japan measuring household consumption
inequality and excluding agricultural households are from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey provided by the Japanese Statistics
Bureau (all included in WIDER); and household
inequality data for Korea were provided by Professor Kyungsoo Choi of the Korea Development
Institute.
These data were interpolated to create
regional and income group averages in the
figures, and the regressions used only actual
observations.39

Per Capita Income per Quintile
Average income for quintiles is calculated
using the quintile income-share data and real
GDP per capita (in 2000 international dollars,
chain-series) from the Penn World Tables Version 6.2, by Heston, Summers, and Aten (2006).
Quintile income shares are multiplied by the
GDP per capita variable and multiplied by 5 to
arrive at the average income per quintile, as

39The data for some advanced economies were
extended for the purpose of the charts. For Germany,
the Gini index was extended prior to 1992 using trends
in West German data. For France, the Gini index was
extended prior to 1994 using trends from LIS data. For
the United States, trends after 2000 were based on earnings data from the Current Population Survey for fulltime, year-round workers. For Great Britain, trends after
1999 were extended using data from the Institute for
Fiscal Studies. For Italy, trends after 2000 were extended
using data from Brandolini (2004). For Japan, a longer
Gini index series was used from the National Survey of
Family Income and Expenditure.

economy-wide income, and Pop is economy-wide
population.

Trade Globalization
De facto trade openness is calculated as
the sum of imports and exports of (non-oil)
goods and services over GDP. The data are
from the World Economic Outlook database
(April 2007). Sectoral trade data on agriculture,
manufacturing, and services are from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators database
(April 2007).
De jure trade openness is calculated as 100
minus the tariff rate, which is an average of the
effective tariff rate (tariff revenue/import value)
and of the average unweighted tariff rate. The
data are from a database prepared by IMF staff.
Each component of the implied 100 minus tariff
rate is interpolated linearly for countries with
data gaps less than or equal to seven missing
observations between 1980 and 2004. When data
for either component (the effective tariff rate or
the average unweighted tariff rate) are shorter
than for the other, the shorter series is extrapolated using the growth rate of the longer series.40
Finally, for countries with only one of the two
components, only the available one is used.

Financial Globalization
De facto financial openness is calculated as
the sum of total cross-border assets and liabilities over GDP. Data on financial globalization
are from the “External Wealth of Nations Mark
II” created by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006).
The components of de facto financial openness
in percent of GDP include (for both assets and
liabilities) (1) FDI, (2) portfolio equity, (3) debt,
(4) financial derivatives, and (5) total reserves
minus gold (assets only).
De jure financial openness refers to the capital account openness index (KAOPEN) from

40For some countries, longer data were available for
the ratio of trade revenue to trade value (which covaried
closely with the other two measures), and these were
used to extend the effective tariff rate and/or the average
unweighted tariff rate.

Chinn and Ito (2006). The index is based on
principal components extracted from disaggregated capital and current account restriction
measures in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.

Capital Stock and ICT Capital
Fajnzylber and Lederman (1999) is the
source of the capital stock series for the entire
economy. This data set extends the capital stock
series estimated by Nehru and Dhareshwar
(1993) by adding the annual flow of gross fixed
capital formation and assuming a 4 percent
depreciation rate of the preexisting stock of
capital. Fajnzylber and Lederman (1999) was
further updated to recent years using the same
methodology.
Jorgensen and Vu (2005) provides series on
IT investment using national expenditure data
for computer hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment. A perpetual inventory method applies varying depreciation rates
to estimate the IT capital stock. This method
assumes a geometric depreciation rate of
31.5 percent and a service life of seven years for
computer hardware, 31.5 percent and five years
for software, and 11 percent and 11 years for
telecommunications equipment.

Private Credit
Each country’s financial depth is estimated by
its ratio of credit to the private sector by deposit
money banks and other financial institutions
to GDP. The source is the Financial Structure
database prepared by Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and
Levine (2000) and revised in March 2007. Data
for China are based on IMF staff calculations.

Education
Data on educational attainment of the
population ages 15 and older are from the
Barro-Lee (2000) data set. The series used are
the average schooling years in the population,
and the share of the population with secondary and/or higher education. For the years
between 1980 and 2000, the data (available
every five years) are interpolated linearly for

162

each country, and for the years 2001–06, the
data are extrapolated linearly.

Sectoral Employment
Data on employment shares in agriculture
and industry are from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators database (April 2006).
The shares are interpolated linearly for countries with data gaps of seven or fewer missing observations between 1980 and 2005.
For Bolivia, data are from the International
Labor Organization’s LABORSTA database
for 1988–2001 and from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística for 2002–05. For Ecuador,
data for 1988–2005 are from the International
Labor Organization’s LABORSTA database.
For Morocco, data for 1999–2002 are from the
Direction de la Politique Economique Générale.
For Paraguay, data for 1991–2005 are from the
Departamento de Cuentas Nacionales y Mercado
Interno, Gerencia de Estudios Económicos. For
China, data for 1980–2004 are from the National
Bureau of Statistics. For India, data for 1980–
2004 are taken from the National Sample Survey
Organisation. For Taiwan Province of China,
data for 1980–2005 are from the CEIC database.

Aggregations by Region and Income Level
Charts showing aggregates by region and
income level use the following:
• the World Economic Outlook analytical classification, as listed in Table F of the Statistical
Appendix; and
• the classification by income from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators
database (April 2007). The economies are
divided among income groups according
to 2005 gross national income per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method.
The groups are low income, $875 or less;
lower-middle income, $876–$3,465; uppermiddle income, $3,466–$10,725; and high
income, $10,726 or more. Taiwan Province of
China is included in the high-income group.
In regional and income group averages, a
maximum number of countries was included in

each group, subject to data availability and to
the constraint that country coverage is uniform
throughout the period.41 Countries with fewer
than 1 million people in 2006 were dropped
from the sample.
In Figures 4.1 and 4.2 relative trade and financial openness are measured by taking the ratio
to the median across all countries for each year
and the ratio to maximum across all countries
in 2004 for financial openness and 2006 for
trade openness. To avoid discontinuity in
country coverage over time, it is assumed in
the calculation of the median that in the 1980s
and early 1990s, trade openness for countries in
the former Soviet Union equaled Russia’s trade
openness, and that these countries were financially closed.

Econometric Methodology
The model relates the Gini index to measures
of globalization and a number of control variables, chosen based on a review of the literature
in this area. The following equation is adopted
as the basic specification for the analysis:

41For example, in the inequality charts, the approximate population represented for each region is 93 percent in advanced economies excluding NIEs (77 percent
for income share and income per capita charts);
92 percent in NIEs (87 percent for income share and
income per capita charts); 94 percent in Latin America
and the Caribbean; 63 percent in sub-Saharan Africa;
90 percent in central and eastern Europe; 92 percent in
the Commonwealth of Independent States; 57 percent
in the Middle East and North Africa; and 94 percent in
developing Asia. The approximate population represented in each income group is as follows: 91 percent
in the high-income group (84 percent for income share
and income per capita charts); 82 percent in the uppermiddle-income group; 87 percent in the lower-middleincome group; and 79 percent in the low-income group.
For the global indicator, approximately 82 percent of the

where X and M are non-oil exports and
imports, Y is GDP, TARIFF is the average tariff
rate, A and L are cross-border financial assets
and liabilities, KAOPEN is the capital account
openness index, K ICT is ICT capital, K is capital,
CREDIT is credit to the private sector by deposit
money banks and other financial institutions,
POPSH is the share of population ages 15 and
older with secondary or higher education, H is
average years of education in the population
ages 15 and older, EAGR and EIND are employment in agriculture and industry, and E is
total employment. This summary model is
then augmented by disaggregating into finer
components the summary measures of de
facto trade and financial globalization. The
component model makes a distinction between
non-oil exports and imports for trade globalization, while allowing different effects of various
categories of financial liabilities (FDI, portfolio equity, and debt) and of the stock of FDI
assets. The latter, which is closely associated
with offshore outsourcing, may be particularly
relevant to measure the impact of globalization
on inequality in advanced economies, whereas
its value is minimal for most emerging market
and developing countries.
For the estimation, the left- and righthand-side variables are de-meaned using
country-specific means in order to focus on
within-country changes instead of cross-countrylevel differences (this is equivalent to doing a
panel estimation with fixed country effects).
Time dummies are also introduced to capture
common global shocks. The model is estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) with
heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.
Using the logarithm of the Gini index (rather
than the Gini index itself) makes this bounded
variable behave more like a normally distributed
variable and hence makes it more amenable to
OLS estimation. The robustness of the results

was also tested using a logistic transformation of
the Gini index (making the variable completely
unbounded). The sample of countries for
which all variables used in the regressions were
available consists of 51 countries, of which 20
are advanced economies and 31 are developing
economies. Based on data availability, the following countries are included:
• advanced economies: Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,
the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
States; and
• developing economies: Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico,
Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda,
Uruguay, Venezuela, and Zambia.
The results of the estimation using the full
sample of advanced and developing economies
are reported in the text. Three globalization
variables have statistically significant effects
on inequality: the ratio of non-oil exports to
GDP, the indicator of tariff liberalization, and
the ratio of FDI liabilities to GDP. The model,
including these three variables as well as all the
controls, is referred to as the benchmark model.
As described in footnote 29 of the main text,
the robustness of this specification was tested in
various ways, including by instrumenting for the
ratio of non-oil exports to GDP and the ratio of
FDI liabilities to GDP.

Additional Results: Heterogeneity Across
Country Groups
The analysis in this section explores the
possibility of heterogeneous effects of globalization, technological progress, and other variables
across country groups; the results are, however,
more tentative, because the number of observations used for identification of group-specific
effects is much smaller. The first obvious

on inequality are statistically insignificant for advanced
economies; however, the hypothesis that these coefficients
are not statistically significantly different from those for
the full sample cannot be rejected.

distinction of interest is between advanced and
developing economies, as defined in the World
Economic Outlook. The starting model is the
component model, described earlier, with an
additional complexity: two additional variables
are included that measure the share of exports
destined for developing countries and the share
of imports originating in these countries (this
variable was not significant when the full sample
was used). While maintaining common time
dummies, interaction terms between the other
regressors and a dummy for advanced economies are included to measure the difference
between the effects for advanced economies and
the estimated average effect for the full sample.
A joint test that all the differences are zero is
rejected, mostly as a result of different effects
(for advanced and developing economies) of
the ratio of FDI assets to GDP and, to a lesser
extent, of the ratio of debt liabilities to GDP
and the share of imports originating in developing countries (Table 4.3).42 While these three
variables are insignificant for the full sample
(and particularly for developing countries),
they are significantly different from zero for
advanced economies. The estimation indicates
that FDI assets increase inequality in advanced
economies, while debt and the share of imports
from developing countries contribute to reduce
it (Figure 4.15).
Another distinction of interest is between
different developing regions: the two main
developing regions represented in the sample
are developing Asia and Latin America (only a
few African and Middle Eastern countries are
included because of data limitations). Due to
the even smaller sample sizes involved for these
subgroups, the estimation starts from the benchmark model and allows a differential impact
by developing region (developing Asia, Latin
America, and other) only for the globalization

and technological progress variables. A joint test
that all differences are zero is rejected, because
of the different effect of technological progress
in developing Asia and Latin America. The
disequalizing effect of technological progress
is stronger in Asia than on average in the full
sample and weaker in Latin America (actually insignificantly different from zero) (see
Table 4.3). This may reflect the greater share of
technology-intensive manufacturing in Asia than
in Latin America.

Partial Correlations and Decompositions of Gini
Index Changes
The partial correlation between the Gini
index and a variable X is the simple correlation
between the variable X and residual inequality (that is, inequality not explained by other
regressors, or the sum of the regression residual
and the product of the variable X and its
coefficient).
The contributions of the various factors to the
change in the Gini index shown in the main text
are calculated as the average annual change in
the respective variable multiplied by the corresponding coefficient estimate. The averages
across country groups are weighted by the number of years covered for each country, so that
countries with a longer period of observation
receive more weight in these averages.
Contributions for the full sample of countries (“All countries” panel of Figures 4.9 and
4.10) are based on the estimation of the benchmark model for the full sample of countries as
reported in Table 4.1. Partial correlations and
contributions for country groups use the estimates allowing coefficient heterogeneity across
country groups as reported in Table 4.3.

THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF THE GLOBAL
BUSINESS CYCLE

World growth in recent years has been much more
rapid than at any time since the oil price surges of
the 1970s. This growth is being shared across countries to an unprecedented degree. Moreover, output
volatility in most countries and regions has significantly declined. This chapter analyzes these changes
in business cycle characteristics and finds that the
increasing stability and the associated increase in the
durability of expansions largely reflect sources that are
likely to prove persistent. In particular, improvements
in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy, as well
as in broader institutional quality, have all reduced
output volatility. The prospects for future stability
should, however, not be taken for granted. Low average volatility does not mean that the business cycle is
dead. The abrupt end to the period of strong and sustained growth in the 1960s and early 1970s provides
a useful cautionary lesson about what can happen
if policies do not adjust to tackle emerging risks in a
timely manner.

F

rom 2004 to the present, the world economy has enjoyed its strongest period of
sustained growth since the late 1960s and
early 1970s, while inflation has remained
at low levels. Not only has recent global growth
been high but the expansion has also been
broadly shared across countries. The volatility
of growth has fallen, which may seem especially
surprising because the more volatile emerging
market and developing countries account for a
rising share of the global economy.
How much of the recent performance of the
global economy is a result of good policies, solid
institutions, and structural changes, and how
much is pure “good luck”? Can policymakers be
confident that output volatility will remain low

Note: The main authors of this chapter are Martin
Sommer and Nikola Spatafora, with support from Angela
Espiritu and Allen Stack. Massimiliano Marcellino provided consultancy support.

and that the current global expansion will continue for a long time? Or is the recent stability
likely to come to an end?
This chapter aims to shed light on these
questions in two separate ways. First, it compares
the current global growth cycle with earlier
periods, including the 1960s—a previous era
of strong growth and low volatility. Second, the
chapter analyzes the sources of differences,
both across countries and over time, in business cycle characteristics such as output volatility and the length of expansions. It follows the
recent literature on the “Great Moderation” in
the U.S. economy, but extends the analysis to a
global context. Further, it focuses on determining to what extent policy actions have helped to
bring about an enduring reduction in volatility
so as to make expansions more durable.
This chapter finds that, in important ways, the
global economy has recently displayed greater
stability than observed even in the 1960s. In
particular, the volatility of output has declined
in most countries, and growth is more broadly
shared across countries than previously
observed. Further, the chapter suggests that the
increase in the durability of expansions largely
reflects sources that are likely to prove persistent, including improvements in the conduct of
monetary and fiscal policy, as well as in broader
institutional quality.
The prospects for future stability, however,
should not be taken for granted. Low average
volatility does not rule out occasional recessions.
More broadly, the abrupt end to the period
of strong and stable growth in the 1960s and
early 1970s provides a cautionary tale of what
can happen if policies do not respond to risks
and new challenges in the global economic system as they arise. The Bretton Woods system of
fixed exchange rate parities worked well for an
extended period. In the end, however, it did not
prove sufficiently resilient as imbalances from

expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in the
United States led to overheating and eventual
inflation—even before the first oil price shock
of 1973–74. The 1970s subsequently turned
out to be the decade of weakest growth in the
post–World War II period.

Figure 5.1. World Growth Has Been Strong and Stable1
World growth is very high compared with the past three decades. However, the
strength of the current expansion does not appear unusual compared with the 1950s
and 1960s. That said, the low dispersion of detrended growth across countries is
unprecedented. World output volatility has been falling since its peak during the
1970s and, for a median country, output volatility is now one-third lower than in the
1960s.

Global Business Cycles: A Historical
Perspective
The global economy is now in its fifth year
of strong expansion. As noted above, the world
growth rate is very high compared with the
past three decades. Compared with earlier
post–World War II cycles, however, the strength
of the current expansion is not unusual. During
the 1960s, world growth (expressed as growth in
purchasing power parity (PPP)-weighted GDP
per working-age person, to account for demographic shifts) averaged 3.4 percent, slightly
above the 3.2 percent outcome over the past
three years.1 That said, one feature of the current expansion is clearly unique, even compared
with the 1960s—strong growth is being shared
by most countries, as evidenced by the unusually low dispersion of growth (relative to trend)
across countries (Figure 5.1). In other words,
virtually all countries are doing well.
As with growth rates, the length of the current expansion has not reached historical highs.
The present world cycle is only half the length
of those in the 1980s and 1990s. Similarly, in the
United States, the current cyclical expansion has
not matched the long expansions of the previous two decades (Figure 5.2). In the major European economies and Japan, the length of the
current expansion stacks up well against those
1Expressed in per capita terms, current world growth
is actually higher than in the 1960s—over the past three
years, average world per capita growth was 3.6 percent,
compared with 3.3 percent during the 1960s. The comparison of per capita growth rates between the two periods
is influenced, however, by particularly strong population
growth in the 1960s and slowing population growth thereafter. Since demographic shifts are typically very slow, the
distinction between calculations using per capita and per
working-age-person terms is unimportant for the chapter’s
analysis of business cycle duration and volatility.

GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLES: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

of the recent decades, although the expansions
were on average much longer in the 1950s
and 1960s, supported by high trend growth.2
A comparison of business cycles over the past
century points to a secular increase in the length
of expansions and a decrease in the amount
of time economies spend in recessions.3 In
advanced economies, deep recessions have virtually disappeared in the post–World War II period.
That said, the 1970s represented a temporary
break from the trend of ever-longer expansions
in moderately growing advanced economies. In
part, this reflected unprecedented oil supply
disruptions and the productivity slowdown, but
in part also monetary policy mistakes.4

2In

this chapter, expansions are defined as periods of
nonnegative growth of real GDP per capita. Analogously,
recessions are defined as periods of falling real GDP per
capita. Most analysis in this chapter therefore adopts the
concept of the “classical” business cycle as discussed in,
for example, Artis, Marcellino, and Proietti (2004) and
Harding and Pagan (2001)—see Appendix 5.1 for details.
Expansions are identified using annual data and in per
capita terms to allow for broad comparisons across countries and over time. Expansions based on quarterly data
would likely be shorter for many countries. There are also
notable differences in cyclical behavior within regions:
for example, the United Kingdom has not experienced a
recession since 1991 based on this chapter’s definition of
business cycles.
3The stabilization of post–World War II business cycles
relative to the pre-war period has been attributed to a
number of factors, including higher average growth rates;
lower share of commodity-linked sectors; introduction of
deposit insurance, which reduced the number of banking
panics; and the pursuit of macroeconomic stabilization
policies—although at times policy mistakes destabilized
output (Romer, 1999). In the academic literature, there is
a vigorous debate about the quality of pre-war GDP data
and the nature of pre-war cycles; see Balke and Gordon
(1989); Diebold and Rudebusch (1992); and Romer
(1989) for a detailed discussion.
4See Romer and Romer (2002) and DeLong (1997) for
a discussion of U.S. monetary policy during the 1970s.
Broadly, monetary policy was too accommodative during
the period, partly reflecting unrealistically low estimates
of the natural rate of unemployment. The eventual
tightening of monetary policy in response to doubledigit inflation caused a recession in the early 1980s.
Orphanides (2003b) suggests that incomplete real-time
information about the economy may have increased the
likelihood of policy mistakes in the 1970s, especially in
the period of difficult-to-observe productivity slowdown.

Figure 5.2. Expansions in Historical Perspective1
(Years; current cycle includes expected outcome for 2007)
As in the case of growth, the length of the current expansion has generally not yet
reached historical highs. In China and India, long expansions driven by rapid growth
are comparable with the post–World War II experience of some European
economies, Japan, and the newly industrialized Asian economies (NIEs). In the key
economies of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, performance was mixed
during the 1980s and 1990s, but the current expansions of these economies are the
longest in three decades.

Figure 5.3. Recessions in Historical Perspective

In advanced economies, deep recessions have almost disappeared in the post–World
War II period, although advanced economies spent a considerable amount of time in
recessions during 1974–82 owing to supply shocks, productivity slowdowns, and
policy swings. In moderately growing emerging market and developing countries,
the frequency of recessions has been significantly higher than in the advanced
economies, despite some improvements over the past couple of decades.

Appendix 5.1 for details. Deep recessions are defined as recessions with a cumulative
output loss greater than 3 percent. Data for country groups refer to group medians.

174

In emerging market and developing countries, the long-term trend toward improved
business cycle dynamics has been more mixed.
In Asia, the current long expansions in China
and India are strikingly similar to the sustained
post-war expansions in western Europe, Japan,
and the newly industrialized Asian economies
(NIEs). By contrast, the four largest Latin American economies have not seen an increase in the
durability of expansions since the 1970s, owing
to recurrent fiscal and currency crises. Likewise,
the share of time these economies have spent
in recessions has not declined (Figure 5.3).
Average improvements among the four largest
African and Middle Eastern economies have
until recently been fairly modest. On the upside,
the current expansions in developing regions
are the longest in three decades.
At the country level, past expansions have
ended for a variety of reasons, including unsustainable fiscal or external imbalances, monetary
policy tightening in the face of rising inflation,
cross-country spillovers, commodity and asset
price swings, and associated financial squeezes.5
Many of the same factors also tended to slow
down world growth, especially when causing
a recession in the United States or reducing
growth in a broad group of countries. It is
important to recognize that some of the factors
triggering recessions were at times considered
“new.” For instance, the currency crises in some
Asian economies (for example, in Indonesia
and Korea in 1997) were linked to financial
and external vulnerabilities that were not well
identified beforehand and whose importance
was not well understood.6 Clearly, the task of
maintaining expansions requires policymakers to
adapt because the process of trade and financial
globalization may have generated new risks and

5See Chapter 3 in the April 2002 World Economic Outlook; Dell’Ariccia, Detragiache, and Rajan (2005); and
Fuhrer and Schuh (1998).
6Policymakers later responded to these crises through
major improvements in financial sector surveillance,
including through the IMF–World Bank Financial Sector
Assessment Programs. See Ito (2007) for a discussion of
the Asian currency crisis.

HAS THE WORLD ECONOMY BECOME MORE STABLE?

vulnerabilities—for example, the losses associated with highly leveraged investments in the
U.S. subprime mortgage market have created
distress in the banking sector in many advanced
economies, raising concerns about a possible
credit crunch (see Chapter 1). Looking beyond
the most recent market developments, the
policy debate has also focused on the potential
risks arising from global imbalances or the linkages between monetary and prudential policies
and sustained asset price booms. For example,
White (2006) suggests that successful inflation
targeting may have led to increased vulnerability
of economies to an excessive buildup of asset
prices.

Has the World Economy Become
More Stable?
One important business cycle characteristic
is output volatility. Together with the trend
growth rate, volatility determines the amount
of time that economies spend in expansions or
recessions. The volatility of global growth, as
measured by the rolling 10-year standard deviation of world GDP growth (PPP weighted), has
fallen progressively since its 1970s peak.7 The
standard deviation of world output growth over
the past 10 years has been 0.9 percent, which
is only slightly lower than during the 1960s—
another period of strong and sustained growth.
This outcome at the aggregate level, however,
masks a more substantial, one-third reduction in volatility at the country level between
the 1960s and the present—the standard deviation of median country growth declined from
3.8 percent to 2.7 percent (see Figure 5.1). The
different degrees of volatility moderation at the
world and country levels arise because growth
outcomes were less correlated across countries
in the 1960s owing to more limited trade and
financial linkages. Output fluctuations of indi-

7The 10-year window was chosen because the length of
a typical cycle in advanced economies increased to about
10 years during the 1980s and 1990s.

vidual countries therefore tended to offset one
another to a greater degree during the 1960s.8
The evolution of output volatility over time
can be broken down into several phases. In
advanced economies, volatility was high in
the 1950s, partly as a result of the boom-andbust cycle associated with the Korean War and
the rapid, but volatile, post-war reconstruction
phase in Europe and Japan (Figure 5.4; output
volatility during the 1950s is captured by the
data point for 1960). Volatility declined during the 1960s, but it rose again in the 1970s as
a result of oil supply disruptions and stop-go
macroeconomic policies. After the disinflation
of the early 1980s, volatility in advanced economies began to fall in a sustained way and is currently only about one-half of that seen during
the 1960s.
Volatility has also fallen over time in emerging
market and developing countries, although this
decline occurred much later than in advanced
economies. Looking at the performance of
developing regions by decades, output volatility varied greatly during the 1960s,9 with some
countries, such as those in Latin America,
experiencing a relatively stable period, while
others, notably China, experienced high volatility.10 Oil shocks, increases in other commodity
prices, and spillovers from advanced economies
increased output volatility in most emerging market and developing countries during
the 1970s. Unlike in the advanced economies,
however, volatility stayed high or increased further during the 1980s and much of the 1990s as
8See

Box 4.3 in the April 2007 World Economic Outlook.
limitations do not allow a comprehensive analysis
of volatility in developing countries in the 1950s. Specifically, volatility of growth cannot be reliably calculated
for many countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East
because the available GDP data are often interpolations
among infrequent benchmark estimates and, therefore,
annual growth rates tend to be smoothed. In Latin
America (for which more accurate data are available),
output volatility was higher than in advanced economies
during the decade (see Figure 5.4).
10The extremely high volatility of the Chinese economy
was, to a large extent, caused by the Great Leap Forward
economic plan and the Cultural Revolution (launched in
1958 and 1966, respectively).

Advanced economies quickly stabilized after the oil shocks of the 1970s. Their

countries were buffeted by debt crises (especially
in Latin America and Africa) and banking and
currency crises (in Asia, central and eastern
Europe, and Latin America). Some countries
also experienced high volatility during their
transition from centrally planned to market
economies.11 Despite a big decline in recent
years, the output volatility in developing economies continues to be significantly higher than
in advanced economies, partly as a result of
structural differences, such as the greater weight
of agriculture or commodity-related sectors. The
median standard deviation of annual growth
is currently 3 percent in emerging market and
developing countries compared with 1¼ percent
in advanced economies.
Volatility decompositions suggest that most of
the past changes in the volatility of world growth
can be attributed to advanced economies, especially the United States (Figure 5.5).12 That said,
falling output volatility in China contributed
noticeably to the lower volatility of world growth
during 1996–2006 compared with 1983–95.

1 Volatility in 1960 is calculated as the standard deviation of detrended growth over
1951–60, and so on. For some regions, volatility measures covering the 1950s are not
shown due to the lack of accurate data on annual growth. See Appendix 5.1 for information
on country group composition.

176

11In central and eastern Europe, deep recessions associated with the transition from centrally planned to market
economies generated very large output volatility during
the 1990s. Countries of the former Soviet Union are not
included in the analysis because many variables for these
countries are not readily available for the period prior to
the 1990s. See Chapter 2 in the April 2005 World Economic
Outlook for a detailed discussion of output volatility in
developing countries.
12Decompositions of volatility in this section are carried
out using the volatility of aggregate world growth, given
the computational difficulties of decomposing changes
in median values. As a result, the decompositions cannot fully reflect the decline in country-specific volatility
between the 1960s and today. Volatility is calculated over
four periods (1960–73, 1974–82, 1983–95, and 1996–
2006), with years 1973 and 1983 broadly representing the
main breaks in the volatility of world growth since 1960.
Owing to data limitations, world volatility is not calculated for the 1950s. The contribution of the United States
to the changes in world output volatility appears larger
than the contribution of the EU-15, because the EU-15
aggregate removes some of the country-specific volatility.
In the past, U.S. output volatility was similar to the EU-15
median (see Figure 5.4). To simplify the analysis, the
volatility decompositions are calculated using headline
rather than per capita growth. However, volatilities of
headline and per capita growth tend to be similar for
most countries.

HAS THE WORLD ECONOMY BECOME MORE STABLE?

13If the current world volatility were recalculated using
country weights from the 1960s, it would be almost the
same as the world volatility calculated using the current weights. However, if the country volatility from the
1960s were combined with the current country weights,
the standard deviation of world growth would increase
from 0.9 percent (the actual outcome for 1996–2006)
to 1.5 percent. This result reflects mostly the significant
decline of volatility in China and, to a more limited
extent, in other developing economies since the 1960s.
14See also Chapter 4 in the April 2007 World Economic
Outlook.

Figure 5.5. Decomposition of Changes in World Output
Volatility by Region1
(Variance of real GDP growth)
Volatility of world growth was particularly high during 1974–82, a period
characterized by oil supply disruptions and policy swings. At the aggregate level, the
moderation of world volatility has been fairly small compared with 1960–73,
although since then many countries have experienced significant reductions in
volatility (see Figure 5.4). Greater trade and financial integration have increased the
correlation of growth across countries, and this has largely offset the decline of
volatility at the country level. Most of the past changes in world output volatility can
be attributed to advanced economies, especially the United States.

Despite the fact that emerging market and
developing countries tend to be more volatile
than advanced economies, their growing weight
has so far not pushed world output volatility
higher, mostly because output volatility in China
is now as low as in advanced economies.13
Figure 5.5 also suggests that the comovement
(covariance) of growth across countries is an
important factor affecting volatility of world
output. The simultaneity of growth decelerations
after the oil price shocks of the 1970s illustrates
how rising covariance can at times magnify the
impact of country volatility on the volatility
of world growth. Growing trade and financial
integration of economies, especially within
regions, has also tended to strengthen crosscountry output spillovers (Box 5.1).14 In particular, the lower volatility of output in the United
States contributed a significant portion of the
decline in world volatility between the 1960–73
and 1996–2006 periods, but the greater stability
of the United States and most other advanced
economies was offset largely by the increasing correlation between country growth rates.
This increasing correlation can also be seen as
reflecting the regional nature of currency crises
in emerging markets in the late 1990s and the
global slowdown following the bursting of the
information technology bubble in 2000.
Further decompositions of world output
volatility by expenditure components show that
consumption and investment volatility have both
shifted significantly over time (Figure 5.6). The
rise in overall volatility during 1974–82 was to a
large extent due to the rise in investment volatility. This finding is intuitively appealing because

(Variance of real GDP growth)
Consumption and investment volatility have both shifted significantly over time. The
rise in overall volatility during 1974–82 was, to a large extent, due to the rise in
investment volatility, as supply disruptions, shifts in productivity trends, and policy
swings induced volatility in investment plans. The mild decline in world output
volatility from the 1960s to the present is mostly attributable to the lower volatility of
consumption.

the period was characterized by repeated supply
disruptions, shifts in productivity trends, and
policy swings, all of which induced volatility in
the expected profitability of investment plans.
Nevertheless, the decline in world output volatility from the 1960s to the present is attributable mostly to lower volatility of consumption
rather than investment. Some of this latter
result is certainly driven by the nature of events
unfolding over the past decade, including a
significant reduction of investment in post-crisis
and post-bubble economies. Indeed, volatility of
investment was somewhat lower during 1983–95
compared with the past decade. The finding,
however, suggests that any explanations for the
current output stability need to include factors
that affect consumer behavior, such as the rising
availability of financing to smooth consumption
over time.15
Looking in more detail at the United States
(Figure 5.7), the decline in output volatility
since the 1960s has indeed been driven largely
by consumer behavior (through a variety of
channels, including lower volatility of consumer
spending, residential investment, and lower
correlation between consumption and investment) and by the government.16 The role of
inventory investment in explaining the reduction in U.S. output volatility between 1960–73
and 1996–2006 is surprisingly limited,17

15Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2006) make a similar
point about consumption volatility in the context of U.S.
data. While the aggregate world data do not identify
government expenditures as the major source of output
volatility, fiscal policy in the form of, for instance, procyclical spending or excessive debt accumulation has been
a significant driver of output volatility in many countries
(see the next section). These country-specific effects,
however, disappear in the aggregate world data.
16During the 1960s, government expenditures
increased U.S. output volatility through volatile defense
spending associated with the Vietnam War.
17Several studies have highlighted the contribution of
improved inventory management techniques and lower
volatility of inventory investment to the reduction of
quarterly output volatility in the United States since the
1980s (McConnell and Perez-Quiros, 2000; and Kahn,
McConnell, and Perez-Quiros, 2002). However, the role
of inventories is greatly diminished in the annual data,
especially when considering volatility changes between

HAS THE WORLD ECONOMY BECOME MORE STABLE?

the 1960s and today. From a policy perspective, changes
in the quarterly fluctuations of inventory investment may
not have important welfare implications unless these
have a significant longer-lived impact on, for example,
consumption growth—which appears unlikely. Another
aspect influencing the interpretation of any volatility studies based on quarterly data is that components of quarterly national accounts tend to suffer from much greater
measurement error than annual data; for example, Sommer (2007) documents that measurement errors make up
a nontrivial fraction of quarterly consumption growth.

The decline in U.S. output volatility since the 1960s has been driven largely by
consumer behavior, including through lower volatility of consumer spending,
residential investment, and the lower correlation between consumption and
investment. Lower volatility of government spending also explains some of the
volatility moderation between 1960–73 and 1996–2006.

although—for the same reasons as at the world
level—the lower volatilities of inventories and
business fixed investment have contributed to
the moderation of U.S. output volatility relative
to the 1970s.
Looking forward, the performance of emerging market and developing countries will be
increasingly important for the stability of the
world economy. In 2006, these economies
accounted for over 40 percent of global GDP,
two-thirds of world GDP growth (using PPP
weights), and about one-third of world trade
(at market exchange rates). China and India
alone now account for one-fifth of the world
PPP-adjusted GDP, up from 10 percent in 1990.
The output paths of China and India have
broadly followed the output paths of other
economies that experienced rapid expansions
earlier, although China has been able to maintain extremely high growth for a longer period
of time than Japan and the NIEs (including
Korea), the previous best performers during the
growth takeoff episodes (Figure 5.8). Interestingly, the volatility trajectories of rapidly growing economies have also been similar. Initially,
these economies tended to exhibit much higher
volatility than world growth. As the economies
diversified away from volatile sectors such as
agriculture and the policy frameworks improved,
their output volatility started to converge to the
world average. But these historical comparisons
also offer some cautionary tales. Brazil and
Mexico were not able to sustain high growth
as structural rigidities became binding, and
fiscal and currency crises increased volatility
in these economies for an extended period.

growth, expansions in most NIEs did not prove
resilient to the Asian crisis and volatility sharply
increased. All these experiences suggest that
policymakers cannot take the good times for
granted and need to continuously identify and
address vulnerabilities.

(Growth takeoff begins in time t = 0 on the x-axis)
The growth paths of China and India have broadly followed the patterns of earlier
rapid expansions, although China has been able to sustain strong growth for the
longest period of time. Volatility of rapidly growing economies has tended to
converge gradually to the world average. However, unaddressed vulnerabilities can
trigger recessions or outright crises associated with large increases in volatility, such
as in Brazil, Mexico, and Korea.

What underlying factors explain the differences, both across countries and over time, in
output volatility and in the duration of expansions? And are they likely to persist? There
has been considerable analysis of the decline
in output volatility in the United States since
the 1970s (the Great Moderation debate),18
but work on other advanced economies and on
emerging market and developing countries is
more limited.19 Given the growing importance
of developing countries in the global economy,
this section looks at the broader canvas.
Specifically, the analysis considers a sample of nearly 80 countries, including both
advanced and developing economies over the
period 1970–2005, and employs a variety of
econometric techniques. It examines the determinants of the volatility of detrended output
as well as of four other closely related business
cycle characteristics: the share of output lost to
recessions and slowdowns, the average length of
expansions, the share of time spent in recessions, and the probability of economic expansion for a given country in any given year.20
In line with the existing literature, the analysis
encompasses a broad range of variables that

18See, for instance, Kim and Nelson (1999); Blanchard
and Simon (2001); and Arias, Hansen, and Ohanian
(2006). Bernanke (2004) provides an overview.
19See Dijk, Osborn, and Sensier (2002); Artis, Krolzig,
and Toro (2004); and Cecchetti, Flores-Lagunes, and
Krause (2006a). Summers (2005) provides an overview.
20See Appendix 5.1 for further details. Berg, Ostry, and
Zettelmeyer (2006), focusing on trend growth rather than
on cyclical fluctuations, use a probability model to analyze the determinants of a different but complementary
concept: the length of “growth spells” (that is, periods of
significantly higher growth than previously observed).

WHAT IS DRIVING THE MODERATION OF THE GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLE?

Box 5.1. Major Economies and Fluctuations in Global Growth
Over the past five years, the world economy
has enjoyed the highest growth since the early
1970s, despite a significant slowing of the U.S.
economy since 2006 and, earlier, a sluggish
recovery in the euro area and Japan. Some
observers have argued that the apparently
reduced spillovers could mean that the world
economy has become more robust to disturbances in major economies, partly because, with
new poles such as China and India, there are
more sources of growth to pick up the slack.
At the same time, however, the scope for
cross-country spillovers from disturbances in
major economies has increased with rapidly
rising cross-border trade and financial linkages,
which could at least partly offset these economies’ declining share of global trade growth.
Against this background, this box compares
recent patterns of business cycle comovement
for China and India with those of major industrial countries and analyzes the impact of disturbances in major economies on global growth in
a general framework.1
Turning first to the experience with international business cycle comovement, the first
table reports the extent of output correlations
between major economies and different regions
for 1960–73 (a period with limited cross-border
linkages and, unlike the 1970s and early 1980s,
no large global disturbances) and 1996–2006, a
period with rapidly rising cross-border linkages.2
Three findings stand out.
• Business cycle comovement with the new
poles indeed increased in the second period
compared with the first one. The rise is
particularly evident for China. Increased
comovement with the new poles is particularly

noticeable for countries in Latin America and
emerging Asia.
• In industrial countries, comovement with the
United States and Germany increased sharply
between 1960–73 and 1996–2006, whereas it
decreased with Japan.
• In other emerging market and developing
countries, and particularly in Latin America,
comovement with the United States and
Japan increased.
Using the correlations as rough approximations
for cross-border spillover effects of disturbances,
the results suggest that a disturbance to growth
in China could now have substantial spillover
effects on some emerging market and developing countries, although the effects on industrial
countries would be considerably smaller.
Overall, the picture that emerges is one of
increasing business cycle comovement, first,
among industrial countries and, second, among
China and emerging market economies in Latin
America and Asia. In contrast, business cycle
comovement between industrial countries and
other emerging market and developing countries has risen by less.

181

CHAPTER 5

THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF THE GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLE

Box 5.1 (concluded)
What are the main factors determining the
impact of disturbances in a major economy
on international business cycles and ultimately
global growth? Three seem particularly relevant.3 First, the size of a country’s GDP matters,
both directly, through its own impact on global
growth, and indirectly, through the impact on
other countries. For given trade shares, a larger
importer will have a greater effect on other
countries’ external demand (or, in other words,
export exposure) as a percent of GDP. In this
regard, China has now surpassed most major
industrial countries in terms of its share in
global GDP and global imports, whereas India’s
economic size is still relatively small. More generally, the total share of the largest 10 economies has remained broadly unchanged since
the early 1970s, in terms of both global GDP
and world imports.4 From this perspective, the
scope for other major economies to pick up the
slack from another one has thus not changed
significantly.
A second factor is the extent of a country’s
cross-border trade and financial linkages.
Numerous empirical studies have found that
business cycle comovement tends to rise in
tandem with trade and financial linkages.5 The
generally higher comovement among industrial
economies, for example, is partly related to
more intensive linkages among them, with other
variables, such as similarity in stages of development or per capita income, also playing a role.
Regarding the new poles, China’s trade linkages
with other emerging market and developing
countries have risen rapidly (see second table),
especially in Asia but also elsewhere, which
partly explains the rising cyclical comovement

3See Canova and Dellas (1993); and Baxter and
King (1999).
4Although the composition of this group has
remained unchanged, relative sizes within the group
have changed substantially, with those of China and
India increasing and those of major industrial countries decreasing.

(2004, 2006); and Baxter and Kouparitsas (2005).

reported in the first table.6 With their rising
trade linkages with the new poles, other emerging market and developing countries now trade
relatively less with the major industrial countries, suggesting that emerging markets have
become relatively less dependent on advanced
economies. As a share of GDP, however, the
total trade of emerging market and developing
countries with major industrial countries has
increased, partly driving the rising output correlations between these two groups.
The depth of financial linkages among
emerging market and developing economies,
and between these economies and industrial
countries, remains well below the levels found
among industrial countries. This helps explains
why, on average, business cycle comovement
among advanced economies still exceeds the
correlations for the other pairings (see first
table). Limited financial linkages notwithstanding, emerging market countries have faced common fluctuations in general external financing

6See

Moneta and Rüffer (2006).

WHAT IS DRIVING THE MODERATION OF THE GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLE?

conditions. Indeed, financial contagion and
the attendant financial crises during the late
1990s may be one factor behind the increased
business cycle comovement among emerging
market countries.7
Third, the nature of disturbances plays an
important role. Disturbances in a major economy
tend to have limited cross-border spillover effects
if they are specific to the country or if they are
transmitted primarily through trade channels.
• Regarding the reach of disturbances, past
episodes with large declines in growth across
countries at the same time were characterized
by common disturbances that were either
truly global in nature (e.g., abrupt oil price
changes) or were correlated across countries
(e.g., disinflationary policies during the early
1980s).8
• As for the limited effects of disturbances
transmitted through trade channels, the main
reason is that, except for countries in the
same region, the effects on external demand
are usually small in terms of overall demand.
In contrast, spillovers tend to be larger if
asset price and/or confidence channels are
involved. In this respect, with the continued
dominant role of the United States in global
financial markets, cross-border spillovers from
financial shocks in the United States remain a
particular concern.9

Against this backdrop, the broad decoupling
of Japan from other industrial countries in the
late 1990s is not surprising because developments in the Japanese economy at the time
were country specific—protracted adjustment
after a major asset price boom-bust cycle—with
limited apparent global financial market
impact.10 Similarly, because the current U.S.
slowdown has been driven by sector-specific
developments—primarily in housing but also
in manufacturing—with limited impact on
broader asset markets until very recently, the
spillover effects on growth in other countries
outside the region have generally remained
small so far.
In sum, the seemingly limited impact of disturbances in major economies on global growth
in the current episode to date reflects a number
of factors, including the nature of the slowdown in the United States. The new poles likely
have played a role as well, primarily through
the direct impact of their high growth rates on
global growth and their impact on commodity
prices (which has benefited many emerging
market and developing countries), but also
through their impact on growth in emerging
Asia and Latin America. Nevertheless, with
financial markets around the world now being
affected by the fallout from U.S. subprime mortgage difficulties, a broader growth slowdown
cannot be ruled out.

could explain changes in business cycle characteristics (see Appendix 5.1 for details). The
variables include the following:
• Institutional quality. Broadly understood, this
can increase a country’s capacity to reconcile
internal political differences. In turn, greater
political stability and continuity in policymaking may foster economic stability and sustainability. More specifically, weak institutions may
render adjustment to major economic shocks

10See, for example, Helbling and Bayoumi (2003);
and Stock and Watson (2005).

more difficult and, in the extreme, may
encourage coups and revolutions.21
21Institutional quality is captured here by a measure
of constraints on the political executive. Among other
advantages, this variable is available for a broad sample
of countries and for extended periods; it also seems less
prone to endogeneity problems than other indicators,
such as the ICRG risk measures. See Acemoglu and others (2003); and Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) for a
fuller discussion of this variable and of how institutions
in general may affect volatility.

Monetary policy improved substantially in advanced economies after the 1970s;
more recently, significant improvements have occurred in emerging market and
developing countries as well. Since the 1980s, the volatility of fiscal policy has
declined in most advanced economies, institutional quality has increased in most
emerging market and developing countries, and terms-of-trade volatility has
declined sharply in both advanced economies and developing countries. For all
these variables, advanced economies score more favorably than emerging market
and developing countries.

• The quality of macroeconomic policies. In part,
this is assessed through an index measuring
the success of the monetary framework in
maintaining low inflation (see Box 5.2 for
an assessment of the extent to which better
monetary policies and more flexible markets
have muted the business cycle in the United
States).22 In addition, more stable fiscal policy
can help dampen, or at least not amplify, output fluctuations; in this context, the analysis
focuses on the volatility of cyclically adjusted
government expenditures.23 As mentioned
above, external vulnerabilities have in the
past also brought expansions to a premature
end. Therefore, the impact of large current
account deficits (defined here as a deficit
exceeding 5 percent of GDP) is also analyzed.
• Structural features. For instance, a betterdeveloped financial infrastructure (measured
using the ratio of private sector credit to GDP)
may enable greater smoothing of both consumption and investment plans.24 Other structural factors, including changes in the sectoral
composition of output, improved inventory
management techniques in the wake of the
information technology revolution, more flexible labor and product markets, and a general
opening up to international trade, may have
smoothed fluctuations and reduced inflationary bottlenecks.25 Clearly, many of the above
factors are not just reducing susceptibility to
22The role of monetary policy is emphasized in Clarida,
Galí, and Gertler (2000); and Cecchetti, Flores-Lagunes,
and Krause (2006b). Importantly, globalization may
have strengthened policymakers’ incentives to maintain

As shown in Figure 5.9, the combination of a
more challenging environment and inadequacies in monetary policy frameworks helped
bring about poor inflationary performance in
the 1970s (see Box 5.2). However, monetary
policy improved substantially in advanced

in large part associated with a reduction in the magnitude of the common international shocks.” Similarly,

“good luck” in driving recent U.S. macroeconomic stability. See also Stock and Watson (2003).

all these variables, advanced economies score
more favorably than emerging market and developing countries.
More formally, both cross-sectional analysis (Table 5.1) and panel and probit regressions (Table 5.2) suggest the following broad
findings:27
• Greater institutional quality is associated with
lower volatility and less time spent in recessions. This effect is statistically significant in
the cross section.
• Financial deepening significantly dampens all
aspects of business cycle volatility in the crosssectional analysis. However, there is strong
evidence that this impact diminishes once
a country attains a certain level of financial
development. The influence of this variable, just as with institutional quality, is more

the business cycle, care should be taken in interpreting
these correlations as indicating causality, even though
instruments are employed for both institutional quality
and fiscal policy volatility.

Standard deviation of inflation

As discussed in the main text, output volatility
has declined significantly in recent years across
the main advanced economies. This box discusses how much of the lower volatility in the
United States can be attributed to, respectively,
better monetary policies, structural changes to
the economy, and smaller shocks (potentially
reflecting “good luck”). To do so, it uses a
structural model of the U.S. economy that can
statistically identify macroeconomic shocks and
structural changes, and can simulate counterfactual monetary policies that would have been
more effective at stabilizing the economy than
actual policies. This analysis also provides some
perspective on the important policy question of
whether output volatility is likely to remain low
in the future.
The main result is that sustainable improvements in monetary policy account for about
one-third of the reduction in the volatility of
U.S. output and inflation between the pre1984 and the post-1984 period. This contrasts
sharply with a study by Stock and Watson
(2003), who find that monetary policy has not
played a significant role in reducing output
variability.

represents the best possible combinations of
inflation and output volatility that could have
been achieved by the Federal Reserve during
1966–83, had it followed a monetary policy
rule that adjusted interest rates sufficiently to
stabilize inflation and output outcomes. Note

economy is used to estimate the distribution of a
set of eight macroeconomic shocks over the period
1966–83 (EF1) or 1984–2006 (EF2); the model is
documented in Juillard and others (2006). Second,
the estimated coefficients of the model’s interest
rate reaction function are replaced by optimal coefficients that minimize a weighted sum of standard
deviations of inflation and output; the functional
form of this monetary policy rule is adopted from
Orphanides (2003a). This procedure is repeated
for a variety of different relative weights of inflation
and output, and in each case the realized standard
deviations are recorded as one point on the efficiency frontier.

WHAT IS DRIVING THE MODERATION OF THE GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLE?

that this model-based frontier is downward
sloping—policymakers face a trade-off between
inflation volatility and output volatility. This
trade-off arises because when the economy
is hit by, for instance, an oil-price shock,
the Federal Reserve must decide whether
to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation
within a narrow range while temporarily tolerating a decline in output or to accept higher
inflation so as to achieve more stable output.
Similarly, the efficiency frontier EF2 represents
the best possible combinations of inflation
and output volatility that could have been
achieved by the Federal Reserve during 1984–
2006. It has shifted inward considerably relative
to EF1 (mostly reflecting smaller shocks, as
discussed below).
Crucially, the model suggests that there is a
significant difference between actual performance at point A and what could have been
achieved during 1966–83, as represented by
the set of points along EF1. This indicates that
suboptimal monetary policy played a major
role during that period in increasing both
inflation and output volatility. In contrast, over
1984–2006, U.S. monetary policy became much
more credible, adjusting the policy rate more
aggressively in response to underlying inflationary pressures.3 This achieved outcomes closer to
the efficiency frontier.
The figure examines the role of monetary
policy and other factors in reducing output
and inflation volatility. The contribution of
monetary policy to better performance of the
U.S. economy is calculated as (AB – CD)/AB,
where AB represents the total decline in volatility between 1966–83 and 1984–2006 and CD
reflects the portion of this change unrelated
to monetary policy. This calculation suggests
that around one-third of the reduction in
output volatility was a result of better monetary
policies.
3For empirical evidence on the role of monetary
policy credibility in changing the persistence of the
inflation process in OECD countries, see Laxton and
N’Diaye (2002).

Role of Structural Changes and Shocks
The inward shift of the efficiency frontier
since 1984 reflects a combination of changed
structural characteristics of the economy
and smaller shocks. To illustrate this, the
figure shows two alternative frontiers for the
1966–83 period that are generated by the model
under two different sets of assumptions. First,
the pre-1984 estimates of structural parameters
of the economy are replaced with post-1984
estimates. Clearly, changes in the structural characteristics of the economy can account for only
a small part of the estimated inward shift of the
efficiency frontier. Second, the pre-1984 model
is modified using post-1984 values for both structural parameters and the distributions of supply
shocks (e.g., productivity shocks and oil price
hikes). Unsurprisingly, the frontier EF1 shifts
mainly downward because, in the short run,
supply shocks have a stronger effect on inflation
than on output. The difference between this
frontier and the post-1984 frontier EF2 represents the contribution of demand shocks (for
instance, smaller shocks to private consumption
and investment demand, and/or greater stability in the conduct of fiscal policy). The role of
demand factors in explaining reduced output
volatility since 1984 is much larger than the role
of supply shocks. This finding is consistent with
the traditional interpretation of business cycles
as being mostly demand driven.4
Conclusions
Monetary policy has clearly improved the
economy’s performance by keeping it closer
to the efficiency frontier, and this gain is
not likely to disappear. What is less certain is
whether the frontier itself will stay where it is,
that is, whether supply and demand shocks will
continue to be small. As discussed in Chapter
1, there are a number of important risks facing
the global economy that could increase volatility
going forward.

More stable monetary and fiscal policies in advanced economies than in emerging
market and developing countries play a large part in explaining their lower volatility
and longer expansions. Much of the remaining difference reflects advanced
economies’ better institutional quality. Improvements in monetary policy and lower

difficult to detect in the panel regressions,
because financial development tends to be a
relatively slow-moving variable.
• The impact of the quality of monetary and
fiscal policy is sometimes difficult to disentangle. That said, in the cross section, better
monetary policy is associated with longer
expansions, whereas volatility in fiscal policy is
associated with output volatility. Better monetary and fiscal policies are both associated
in the panel with smaller output fluctuations.
Further, they are also associated with a higher
probability of being in an expansion.
• There is some evidence that large external deficits can bring expansions to a premature end
(in the cross section), and that periods with
lower terms-of-trade volatility tend to have lower
output volatility (in the panel).
The results imply that more stable monetary
and fiscal policies in advanced economies play
a large part in explaining lower volatility and
longer expansions in advanced economies, when
compared with emerging market and developing countries (Figure 5.10). Part of the remaining difference reflects advanced economies’
better institutional quality. Their lower termsof-trade volatility also plays a role. In a similar
vein, better monetary policy, more stable fiscal
policy, and greater trade openness in advanced
economies all help to increase their probability
of being and remaining in an expansion, relative
to emerging market and developing countries
(see Figure 5.10).
The results can also be applied to explain the
large reduction in average volatility between
the 1970s and the current decade, both for the
world as a whole and for advanced and developing economies separately. Improvements in
monetary policy account for much of the reduction in volatility over time (see Figure 5.10). A
significant portion of the remainder reflects
improved fiscal policy (in advanced economies), and trade liberalization and institutional
improvements (in emerging market and developing countries). Lower terms-of-trade volatility
than observed in the 1970s does have an important, but certainly not a dominant, role to play.

APPENDIX 5.1. DATA AND METHODS

This is consistent with the finding, expressed
in Box 5.2, that policy mistakes were an important contributor to the volatility observed in
the 1970s.28

Conclusions
The current global expansion certainly stands
out in comparison with the experience of the
past three decades, but it is not unprecedented.
In recent years, output growth has been much
more rapid than observed at any time since
the oil shocks of the 1970s. Compared with
the 1960s, however, neither the strength nor
the length of the current expansion appears
exceptional. That said, rapid growth has been
shared across countries more broadly than in
the past, and output volatility in most countries
and regions has been significantly lower than
during the 1960s.
Advanced economies in particular have
improved their performance since the 1970s,
and they have typically experienced long
expansions. Output stabilization in emerging
market and developing countries has been
more gradual and modest, with certain regions
experiencing deep and sometimes recurrent
crises. Over time, greater trade and financial
integration have increased the covariance of
growth across countries, and therefore at the
world level output volatility is only slightly lower
than in the 1960s.
This chapter finds that the increasing stability
of economies and the associated increase in the
durability of expansions largely reflect sources
that are likely to prove persistent. In particular,
improvements in the conduct of monetary and
fiscal policy, as well as in broader institutional
quality, are all robustly associated with smaller
fluctuations in output, both over time and
across countries. Reductions in terms-of-trade
28Caution is needed in interpreting these results as
indicating a small role for “good luck” in recent years. The
panel regressions involve relatively large error terms, which
may partly reflect temporary shocks. That said, the estimated equations do a very good job in matching the average business cycle characteristics for broad country groups.

volatility have played an important, but not
dominant, role.
The prospects for future stability should
nevertheless not be overstated. The process of
globalization continues to present policymakers
with new challenges, as reflected in the difficulties in managing volatile capital flows, increasing exposure of investors to developments in
overseas financial markets, and the uncertainties
associated with large global current account
imbalances. The recent return of interest rates
to more neutral levels in most major advanced
economies, the corrections of asset prices in
some countries, and the current rise in risk
premiums and tightening of credit market
conditions may also test the strength of the current expansion. Overconfidence in the ability of
the current policy framework to deliver stability
indefinitely would certainly not be warranted.
Although the business cycle has changed for the
better, policymakers must remember that it has
not disappeared.

Expansions are defined as periods of nonnegative growth of real GDP per capita.
Analogously, recessions are defined as periods
of negative growth. Most of the analysis in this

business cycle properties. Business cycle research on
advanced economies has typically used headline GDP
series to determine the timing of expansions and recessions. This chapter, however, also analyzes many emerging
market and developing countries with high population
growth rates. To ease cross-country comparisons, the
chapter therefore defines business cycles using per capita

to allow for broad comparisons across countries
and over time. Expansions based on quarterly

analysis of volatility over the past decade (in
advanced economies, the length of the typical
cycle increased to about 10 years during the
1980s and 1990s).
The change in output volatility from period B to
period A is decomposed as follows:

For the purposes of volatility decompositions,
GDP growth at time t, yt , is first expressed as
the sum of growth contributions by regions or
expenditure component, Cont:

+ ∑ stdA(Contt,i)stdA(Contt,j){corrA(Contt,i,Contt,j)

where n = 4 in the case of decomposition of
world volatility by expenditure components and
n = 7 in the cases of decomposition of world
growth by regions and decomposition of U.S.
output volatility by expenditure components.
The contributions to world growth are calculated from the data sources described below. For
the United States, the contributions to growth
are reported directly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. To simplify analysis, the volatility decompositions are not calculated on a per
capita basis—however, volatilities of headline
and per capita growth tend to be similar for
most countries.

Figures 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 are calculated using the
standard formula:

var yt = ∑ var(Contt,i) + ∑ cov(Contt,i ,Contt,j),
where var and cov denote the variance and

1974–82, 1983–95, and 1996–2006), with years
1973 and 1983 broadly representing the main
breaks in the volatility of world growth since
1960. Given data limitations, world volatility is
not calculated for the 1950s. The year 1996 was
selected as an additional breakpoint to facilitate

where std and corr are the standard deviation
and correlation operators. The first term in the
equation above is the change in the volatility of
regions or expenditure components and corresponds to “region variance” and “component
variance” in the middle and bottom panels of
Figures 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7. The second and third
terms in the equation reflect the “contribution
of covariance” in the figures. Specifically, the
second term is the contribution of covariance
to the decline in output volatility because of the
lower standard deviations of growth contributions (note that these standard deviations enter
as pairs and therefore cannot be assigned to
individual regions or expenditure components).
The third term is the contribution of covariance
to the change in output volatility that occurred
as a result of the change in the correlation
of growth contributions among regions or
expenditure components. The contribution of
covariance is split into these two terms because
changes in the volatility of components do not
necessarily have the same sign as the changes
in the correlation among components—see, for
example, the middle and bottom panels of Figure 5.5—with interesting economic implications,
as discussed in the main text.
In Figure 5.8 (“Volatility Patterns in Rapidly
Growing Economies”), the beginning of the
rapid growth period is identified as follows:
initially, the first available year is identified in

APPENDIX 5.1. DATA AND METHODS

which the five-year moving average of real GDP
growth (1) exceeds 5 percent, and (2) remains
above 5 percent for at least two years. Subsequently, the beginning of the takeoff is identified within the five-year window before this year.

Econometric Analysis
The econometric analysis (Tables 5.1 and 5.2)
considers the following dependent variables:
• output volatility: defined as the standard deviation of detrended GDP growth per capita.
Detrending is carried out using the HodrickPrescott (HP) filter;
• share of output that is lost to recessions and slowdowns: defined as the cumulative sum of all
below-trend outputs, divided by the cumulative sum of all outputs. Detrending is again
carried out using the HP filter; and
• average length of expansions; share of time spent
in recessions; whether a country is in an expansion
in any given year: expansions and recessions
are defined as described at the start of this
appendix.
Explanatory variables employed in the analysis
include the following:
• Broad institutions: measured using the “executive constraint” variable from Marshall, Jaggers, and Gurr’s Polity IV data set (2004).30
This variable is instrumented using countryand period-specific initial values. The variable
follows a seven-category scale, with higher
values denoting better checks and balances in
place on the executive branch of the government. A score of one indicates that the
executive branch has unlimited authority in
decision making; a score of seven represents
the highest possible degree of accountability
to another group of at least equal power, such
as a legislature.
• Financial development: measured using the ratio
of private sector credit by banks and other
financial institutions to GDP. Data are from
Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine’s Finan30For more details on the Polity IV database, see www.
cidcm.umd.edu/polity.

cial Development and Structure database
(2007).31 To allow for nonlinearities, regressions employ both the level and the square of
this variable; the joint coefficient presented
represents the marginal value, evaluated at
the sample mean.
• Quality of monetary policy: the index is defined
as exp[–0.005 * (inflation – 2 percent)2]. This
measure of price stability rapidly deteriorates
once inflation rises above 10 percent. For
instance, the index equals 1 when inflation
equals 2 percent, roughly ¾ when inflation
equals 10 percent, and 0.2 when inflation
equals 20 percent. The index moves only
slightly in response to short-term inflation
fluctuations, such as those stemming from oil
price changes, so long as the initial inflation
level is low. Although this variable is clearly
influenced by factors other than the quality of
monetary policy, it is nevertheless correlated
with other proxies for the quality of the institutional setup behind monetary policy, over
the more limited sample for which the latter
are available.32
• Volatility of fiscal policy: measured as the rolling 10-year standard deviation of cyclically
adjusted government expenditure to GDP,
following the country-specific, instrumentalvariable estimation procedure set out in Fatás
and Mihov (2003).33 The government expenditure data are from the World Bank’s World

31For more details on the Financial Development and
Structure database, see www.worldbank.org.
32For instance, a cross-sectional regression of the
monetary policy index on a measure of the turnover of
central bank governors yields a t-statistic of 5.5 and an
R 2 of 0.24. The analogous fixed-effects panel regression
yields a t-statistic of 4.0 and an R 2 of 0.10.
33Using government expenditures, rather than the
government balance, minimizes endogeneity concerns
that stem from difficulties in cyclical adjustment. As discussed in Fatás and Mihov (2003, p. 11), “There are both
theoretical considerations and empirical estimates that
support the idea that spending (excluding transfers) does
not react contemporaneously to the cycle. On the other
hand, there is plenty of evidence that the budget deficit
is automatically affected by changes in macroeconomic
conditions and therefore more subject to endogeneity
problems.”

equals 1 when the current account deficit
exceeds 5 percent of GDP; the indicator
equals zero otherwise. Data are from the IMF’s

of a socialist economic system. The variable
is equal to zero prior to liberalization and

the Reinhart-Rogoff coarse index of de facto
exchange rate flexibility, collapsed to a threevalue indicator (where 1 denotes a fixed or
pegged exchange rate regime, 2 denotes an
intermediate regime, and 3 denotes a free
float). The Reinhart-Rogoff classification takes
into account the existence in some economies
of dual rates or parallel markets, and it uses
the volatility of market-determined exchange
rates to statistically classify an exchange rate
regime.36

are estimated using annual data, starting in
1960.
Figure 5.10 is constructed as follows. First,
each regression is estimated using the whole
sample. Then the sample is split into advanced
economies versus emerging market and developing countries, and mean values of the dependent
and explanatory variables are calculated for each
subsample. For each explanatory variable, the
difference in its mean value across subsamples is
multiplied by the relevant coefficient (estimated
using the whole sample). This yields the contribution of the relevant explanatory variable to
the (mean) difference of the dependent variable between advanced and other economies.
Finally, and analogously, the above procedure
is repeated, but with the sample split by decade
(rather than into advanced versus other economies). This yields the contribution of each
explanatory variable to the (mean) difference of
the dependent variable between decades.

Other Data Sources
• Real GDP and its components. Data on an aggregate and per capita basis are from (1) Heston,
Summers, and Aten’s Penn World Tables Version 6.2 (2006);38 (2) the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators database (2007); (3)
the IMF’s World Economic Outlook database;
and (4) Maddison (2007).39 Data from these
sources are spliced multiplicatively together
in the order in which they are numbered
to produce the longest time series possible.
Most of the data, however, are from the Penn
World Tables, with data for 2007 based on
projections from the IMF’s World Economic
Outlook database. Data from Maddison are
available only for total GDP and GDP per
capita.40 Given the ongoing discussion about
the accuracy of pre–World War II data (see
Box 5.3), the analysis of pre-war data is con38For more details on the Penn World Tables Version

APPENDIX 5.1. DATA AND METHODS

Box 5.3. New Business Cycle Indices for Latin America: A Historical Reconstruction
Important insights into the roots of business
cycle volatility can be gained from long-run
data spanning a variety of policy regimes and
institutional settings. Yet there is a striking
dearth of systematic work along these lines
for most countries outside North America and
western Europe.
A main obstacle to this line of research
has been limited or patently unreliable
historical GDP data for developing countries. Although the work of Maddison (1995,
2003) has been useful in making long-run
data more easily accessible to macroeconomists, important deficiencies remain in the
pre–World War II data reported by Maddison.
For most developing countries, these data are
either provided only for sparse benchmark
years or compiled directly from secondary
sources relying on a very limited set of macroeconomic variables and often using disparate
methodologies to build up GDP estimates.
As discussed below, this procedure can be
misleading.
This box summarizes a new methodology for real GDP reconstruction laid out in
Aiolfi, Catão, and Timmerman (2006; ACT
henceforth), and compares the estimates
for four Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico) with those
reported by Maddison (2007). Underpinning
this new methodology is the idea that a cross
section of economic variables shares a common factor structure. That is, fluctuations in
any individual economic variables (such as
industrial production, investment, and so
on) stem from the combination of a common
factor that affects all individual economic
variables in an economy (that is, “a tide
that raises all boats”) plus an idiosyncratic
(that is, sector- or variable-specific) component. Recent time-series techniques allow a
sounder formalization of this classical factor
approach, and recent studies have used it
for forecasting purposes. ACT argue that

Note: The main author of this box is Luis Catão.

such dynamic factor models can be also
suitable for “backcasting” purposes, notably
in the reconstruction of aggregate indices
of economic activity. A critical requirement
is the availability of a broad set of variables
that is both heterogeneous enough and comprises individual series that bear a close relation to aggregate cyclical behavior. Natural
candidates include investment, government
revenues and expenditures, and sectoral
output, as well as external trade and a host
of fi nancial variables for which there are data
stretching far back in time. A main advantage
of such a methodology is its relative robustness to errors in the measurement of individual variables—a problem deemed particularly
severe in developing country statistics.
Provided that such measurement errors are
largely idiosyncratic, the resulting estimates
will be far less sensitive to the effects of such
errors than the usual procedure of adding up
sectoral output indices to estimate an aggregate GDP, where each of these individual
indices is measured with substantial idiosyncratic error.
The ACT backcasting methodology consists of three steps. First, all individual
series are made stationary by detrending—a
standard procedure in factor model estimation. Second, common factors are extracted
from the cross section of stationary series.
The third step consists of projecting the
extracted factors on real GDP by an ordinary least squares regression confined to the
period for which real GDP data are judged
to be sufficiently reliable (usually sometime
after World War II). Although the resulting
indices track actual GDP very closely over this
latter “in-sample” period (yielding very high
R 2s and t-ratios), the methodology’s reliance
on coefficient stability over a period spanning several decades could potentially be
criticized. However, Stock and Watson (2002)
show that such common factor estimates are
consistent even under temporal instability
in the individual time series, provided this
instability averages out in the construction

193

CHAPTER 5

THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF THE GLOBAL BUSINESS CYCLE

Box 5.3 (concluded)
of the factors. In addition, ACT postulate a
variety of structural stability tests and fi nd
that the respective backcasting estimates
are remarkably robust to those tests. As a
further robustness check, ACT also apply
this backcasting method to U.S. data, comparing the resulting estimates with those of
Romer (1989) and Balke and Gordon (1989),
which are viewed as reasonably reliable
gauges of U.S. pre–World War II GDP. ACT
fi nd that the proposed backcasting method
gauges well the timing and magnitude of
U.S. pre–World War II cycles, particularly
when compared with the Balke and Gordon
series.
How do these estimates differ from those
previously found in the literature, including
those reported in Maddison (1995, 2003)?
Although the average volatility of output gaps
over the time periods used in the main text is
fairly comparable across data sets, the differences can be very dramatic at other times.
Indeed, ACT show that some differences in
the interpretation of historical episodes are
startling. For instance, the Maddison- compiled
index for Brazil shows a much deeper downturn in the wake of the 1891 Barings crisis
(see figure), but this is very likely an artifact, arising because the index relies almost
exclusively on foreign trade information and
ignores indicators more tightly related to
domestic production. Conversely, Maddison’s
(2003) real GDP figures for Mexico portray
a remarkable output stability for the revolution years 1911–20, when it is well known from
a variety of other indicators and historical
narratives that output plunged during at least
the height of the revolutionary disruptions in
1914–17.
Overall, these results indicate that extending this reconstruction methodology to
other developing countries should prove
worthwhile. Such an extension should enable
us to better answer key questions about the
historical evolution of world business cycles
and the role of institutions and policy regimes
therein.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE
OUTLOOK, SEPTEMBER 2007

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive
Board’s discussion of the World Economic Outlook on September 24, 2007.

Global Prospects and Policies
Executive Directors welcomed the continued
strong growth of the global economy in the first
half of 2007, while emphasizing that downside
risks to the near-term outlook have increased
in the face of the ongoing financial market
disturbances. They expected global growth in
the period ahead to be slower than previously
forecast in the July update, although the severity of the slowdown is difficult to predict given
the uncertainties regarding the magnitude and
duration of the financial stress. Directors were
generally of the view that the global economy’s
strong fundamentals and the continued robust
growth of emerging market and other developing economies will cushion the impact of the
disturbances. In light of this, many Directors
agreed that while the situation was still evolving,
at this point the degree of the slowdown seemed
likely to be relatively modest and agreed with
the staff’s baseline forecast. However, a number
of Directors cautioned that the slowdown in
growth could be more severe.
Directors acknowledged that at the current
juncture, the global outlook remains exceptionally uncertain. A number of Directors saw
heightened risks of prolonged financial market
instability and a broad credit retrenchment, with
the possibility of further financial contagion
and declining confidence that could weaken
the global growth environment. In particular,
further downward pressure on house prices in
the United States may cause steeper declines in
residential investment and consumption growth,
with consequently more severe spillovers to the
rest of the world. In addition, the risks faced
by some countries may be compounded by the

rapid appreciation of their currencies. Some
emerging market countries with large current
account deficits could be particularly at risk
from more restricted availability of external
financing. Some Directors also stressed that the
possibility of a disorderly unwinding of global
imbalances remains an important concern. Others saw little risk of a disorderly unwinding.
Against this backdrop, Directors underscored
the importance of sound policies and continued
vigilance. They saw the task of restoring orderly
conditions in financial markets as the immediate policy priority, and generally endorsed the
actions by central banks in the major advanced
economies to address the continuing squeeze
in liquidity. At the same time, they emphasized that it is important to avoid perceptions
that central banks will automatically respond
to financial distress by taking action to curtail
losses, which could raise moral hazard and
reduce credit discipline. A number of Directors viewed the repricing of risks and tightening
of credit standards as a return toward greater
market discipline after a prolonged period of
excessive risk-taking in certain market segments.
Directors believed that an important lesson to
be learned from the financial market turbulence
is the need to ensure effective financial regulation, which will call for greater transparency and
improved awareness of financial risks.
Directors noted that a slower pace of growth
is likely to moderate pressures on capacity and
resources, which will help reduce inflationary
pressure. At the same time, tight commodities markets and rising food prices will remain
important sources of price pressures, especially
if growth continues to be strong in emerging

markets. Directors agreed that in setting the
monetary stance, central banks should focus on
achieving price stability in the medium term, and
continue to carefully assess the inflation outlook
in light of the envisaged downside risks to growth.
Looking toward the medium term, Directors underlined the importance of actions to
strengthen the foundations for sustained high
growth. Many countries will need to pursue
ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation
plans to address rising pressures on health and
social security spending. They will also need to
advance key reforms—including further liberalizing financial and service sectors in advanced
countries and improving infrastructure and the
business environment in emerging and developing countries—in order to take full advantage of
the opportunities provided by globalization and
technological advances.
Directors welcomed the analysis of the role
that better monetary and fiscal policies, stronger
institutions, and financial development have
played over the past two decades in reducing the
volatility of economic growth. Some Directors
noted that fewer exogenous shocks and the rise
of the emerging market economies may have
contributed to lower volatility. Directors emphasized, however, that the lower volatility of growth
does not mean that future stability should be
taken for granted. Policymakers will need to
stand ready to adapt to changing circumstances,
particularly in light of the increased risk of spillover effects associated with the more synchronized business cycles across countries.

Advanced Economies
Most Directors agreed that the risks to the
short-term outlook in the United States are firmly
on the downside, given the financial market
turmoil, weak housing market, softening labor
market, and declining productivity growth. They
emphasized that the current financial market turmoil could broaden, and a more protracted housing downturn could put pressure on household
finances and consumption. They accordingly
considered the downward revision in the growth

200

forecast for 2008 to be reasonable. With inflation
pressures declining and inflation expectations
remaining well anchored, Directors saw room for
monetary policy to help cushion the downside
risks to the outlook. Directors were encouraged
by the recent fiscal overperformance, while stressing that a more ambitious medium-term program
of fiscal consolidation will be needed to guarantee long-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors welcomed the relatively strong
performance of the euro area economy, but
cautioned that the balance of risks to near-term
growth has shifted to the downside because of
slowing growth in the United States and the
financial market turmoil. They noted that the
European Central Bank continues to monitor
developments closely to ensure inflation objectives are met. Directors welcomed the progress
made toward fiscal consolidation, but felt that
more ambitious efforts will be necessary given the
strength of the cyclical upswing and the looming
pressures from population aging. Directors also
noted that the euro area’s long-term prospects
will hinge on its success in accelerating productivity and employment growth, and improving
structural flexibility. Enhancing the contestability
of services markets will help boost productivity in
these sectors, while steps to strengthen incentives
to work and improve wage flexibility will be key
elements in labor and product market reforms.
Directors noted that after two quarters of very
strong growth, the Japanese economy contracted
in the second quarter of 2007, driven by a drop
in investment and weaker consumption growth.
The outlook remains mixed, as growth could be
dampened by the recent financial market turmoil and yen appreciation. Directors supported
the Bank of Japan’s accommodative monetary
stance, and suggested that monetary tightening
should await clear signs that inflation is moving decisively higher and that risks from recent
financial market volatility are waning. Directors
were encouraged by the considerable progress
made in reducing the fiscal deficit in recent
years, but urged a more ambitious fiscal agenda
to lower the public debt ratio and meet the challenge of population aging.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK, SEPTEMBER 2007

Emerging Market and Other
Developing Countries
Directors believed that large foreign exchange
inflows in emerging market and other developing countries could continue to complicate
macroeconomic management in the coming
years. They stressed that the nature of the
inflows—including their composition and
terms—and country circumstances will determine the appropriate policy response to large
capital inflows in individual cases. Many Directors agreed that fiscal restraint and increasing
exchange rate flexibility, complemented by
capital account liberalization, can be helpful
in attenuating the impact of these inflows. A
number of Directors, however, noted that fiscal
adjustment may not always be feasible or effective, and that sustained exchange rate appreciation could cause difficulties. These Directors
suggested that temporary capital controls, while
not a first-best measure, might be a practical way
to deal with capital flows in certain cases, as a
useful supplement to macroeconomic policies.
A number of Directors considered it important
to distinguish between short-term and long-term
capital flows, as the policy implications would be
different. Directors agreed that fostering financial development and strengthening financial
regulation and supervision are also important in
the face of capital inflows.
Directors expected growth in emerging
market countries in Asia to remain strong, led
by China and India. Most Directors viewed the
balance of risks as being tilted to the downside,
particularly because of the U.S. economic slowdown. Some Directors, however, believed that
the risks to growth and inflation in China are on
the upside in the absence of additional monetary tightening and more flexible exchange
rate management. Against the background of
continuing large current account surpluses in
many countries in the region, several Directors
emphasized that greater exchange rate flexibility
and measures to boost domestic demand would
help reduce the reliance on export-led growth.
Directors welcomed the favorable economic
performance and the reduced external vulner-

ability in Latin America, which reflect stronger
policy frameworks, improved debt management,
and development of domestic capital markets.
At the same time, they observed that growth
remains subject to risks arising from the close
trade and financial linkages with the United
States and the dependence on commodity
exports. They emphasized the importance of
reforms to foster investment and productivity
growth. Directors noted that in recent years
Latin American countries have experienced
large foreign exchange flows. They welcomed
the greater exchange rate flexibility in many
countries that has helped to contain inflation in
the face of these inflows.
Directors welcomed the continued rapid
economic convergence of emerging Europe,
supported by robust productivity growth, but
expressed concern about overheating in some
countries. They observed that the recent financial market turbulence has heightened concerns
about the vulnerability of some countries in the
region to reversals of capital flows, especially
given the heavy reliance on foreign-currency
borrowing and the potential for spillover effects.
In this context, Directors underscored the
importance of prudent macroeconomic policies,
structural reforms to improve economic flexibility, and vigilant bank supervision.
Directors observed that economic activity
in the Commonwealth of Independent States
continues to expand rapidly, supported by high
commodity prices and large capital inflows.
Growth prospects appear to be generally positive, although global credit retrenchment has
affected the outlook in some countries. Directors welcomed the region’s ability to attract
large inflows of foreign private capital, but
underscored that limited exchange rate flexibility in many countries has resulted in upward
price pressures. They saw a need for more flexible exchange rates, and for continued efforts to
strengthen institutions, the business climate, and
bank regulation and supervision.
Directors were encouraged by the sustained
expansion in sub-Saharan Africa, which is being
led by high commodity prices, improved policy

implementation, reforms to strengthen the business environment, and debt reduction. Growth
is expected to accelerate in a number of countries in 2008 as new oil projects come on stream.
Sustaining the growth performance and promoting export diversification will require continued
macroeconomic stability and a vibrant private
sector, supported by further trade liberalization,
improved market access for regional exports,
and fulfillment of aid commitments by advanced
economies.
In the Middle East, high oil prices have supported buoyant growth and strong external and
fiscal balances in oil-exporting countries, and
are expected to continue to do so in the near
term. At the same time, Directors noted that
resource utilization and import prices are rising,
leading to inflationary pressures in many oilexporting and oil-importing countries. The challenge for fiscal policy in oil-exporting countries
is to strike the right balance between using the
oil revenues to pursue long-term development
objectives and exercising restraint in the short
term to counterbalance strong private demand
growth. While welcoming the ongoing buildup of investment in the petroleum sector in a
number of oil-exporting countries, Directors
underscored the importance of continuing to
foster private investment in both the oil and the
non-oil sectors of these economies.

Multilateral and Other Issues
Directors welcomed the analysis of the relationship between globalization and inequality,
while noting the importance of interpreting
the results in the context of individual country
circumstances. Most Directors accepted the two
main findings of the study: first, that technological change is more important than globalization
in explaining rising inequality in many countries;
and, second, that contrary to popular belief,
trade liberalization appears to reduce inequality
while financial globalization appears to increase
it. Directors cautioned that the solution to rising
inequality would be not to restrict foreign direct

202

investment, but rather to strengthen education to
ensure that workers have the appropriate skills in
the emerging “knowledge-based” global economy. Labor market reforms will be needed to
ensure that jobs are created flexibly in the most
dynamic sectors. Also, social safety nets should be
enhanced to provide greater protection for those
who may be adversely affected by globalization,
and policies will be needed to increase the availability of finance to the poor.
Directors emphasized that multilateral action
to ensure a smooth unwinding of global imbalances remains a critical task. During the Fund’s
Multilateral Consultation, the participants indicated their policy plans that are consistent with
the strategy endorsed by the IMFC for reducing global imbalances. These comprise steps
to boost national saving in the United States,
including fiscal consolidation; further progress
on growth-enhancing reforms in Europe; further structural reforms, including fiscal consolidation, in Japan; reforms to boost domestic
demand in emerging Asia, together with greater
exchange rate flexibility in a number of surplus
countries; and increased spending consistent
with absorptive capacity and macroeconomic
stability in oil-producing countries. Full implementation of these policy plans is needed to
reduce imbalances while sustaining growth.
While Directors acknowledged that there has
been some progress toward realignment of
major world currencies, they noted the staff’s
analysis that the U.S. dollar is still overvalued
and that the yen, the renminbi, and the currencies of the oil-exporting countries are still
undervalued relative to their medium-term
fundamentals.
Directors expressed concern about the
continued lack of progress with the Doha
multilateral trade round, and the risk that this
would encourage protectionist measures. They
expressed hope that countries would find a way
to re-energize the process of multilateral trade
liberalization. Directors also agreed that global
issues such as climate change and energy security would also require a multilateral approach.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data, as well as projections. It comprises five sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2007–08 and the medium-term
scenario for 2009–12 are summarized in the
first section. The second section presents a brief
description of changes to the database and statistical tables. The third section provides a general
description of the data and of the conventions
used for calculating country group composites.
The classification of countries in the various
groups presented in the World Economic Outlook is
summarized in the fourth section.
The last, and main, section comprises the
statistical tables. Data in these tables have been
compiled on the basis of information available through end-September 2007. The figures
for 2007 and beyond are shown with the same
degree of precision as the historical figures
solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be
inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at
their average levels during the period August
22 to September 19, 2007. For 2007 and 2008,
these assumptions imply average U.S. dollar/
SDR conversion rates of 1.520 and 1.538,
U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of 1.35 and
1.37, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of
118.4 and 115.0, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$68.52 a barrel in 2007 and $75.00 a barrel in
2008.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific

policy assumptions underlying the projections
for selected advanced economies are described
in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that
the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)
on six-month U.S. dollar deposits will average
5.2 percent in 2007 and 4.4 percent in 2008,
that three-month euro deposits will average
4.0 percent in 2007 and 4.1 percent in 2008,
and that six-month Japanese yen deposits will
average 0.9 percent in 2007 and 1.1 percent in
2008.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1,
1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates
between the euro and currencies of the member
states adopting the euro are as follows.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences
between the national authorities and the IMF
staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal
projections incorporate policy measures that are
judged likely to be implemented. In cases where
the IMF staff has insufficient information to
assess the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged
structural primary balance is assumed, unless
otherwise indicated. Specific assumptions used in
some of the advanced economies follow (see also
Tables B5–B7 in the Statistical Appendix for data
on fiscal and structural balances).1
United States. The fiscal projections are based
on the administration’s FY2008 budget and
Mid-Session Review (February and July, 2007).
Adjustments are made to account for differences in macroeconomic projections as well as
staff assumptions about (1) additional defense
spending based on analysis by the Congressional Budget Office; (2) slower compression in
the growth rate of discretionary spending; and
(3) continued AMT relief beyond FY2008. The
projections also assume that proposed Medicare
savings are achieved only in part, and that personal retirement accounts are not introduced.

1The output gap is actual less potential output, as
a percent of potential output. Structural balances
are expressed as a percent of potential output. The
structural budget balance is the budgetary position
that would be observed if the level of actual output
coincided with potential output. Changes in the
structural budget balance consequently include effects
of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs, and other
noncyclical fluctuations in the budget balance. The
computations of structural budget balances are based
on IMF staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue
and expenditure elasticities (see the October 1993
World Economic Outlook, Annex I). Net debt is defined
as gross debt less financial assets of the general
government, which include assets held by the social
security insurance system. Estimates of the output gap
and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

204

Japan. The medium-term fiscal projections
assume that expenditure and revenue of the
general government (excluding social security)
are adjusted in line with the current government target to achieve primary fiscal balance
(excluding social security) by FY2011.
Germany. Projections reflect the fiscal measures announced in the 2005 government’s
coalition agreement, 2007 Stability and Growth
Pact, the 2008 budget, and 2009–2011 financial
plan for the central government. Specifically,
projections include the increase in indirect
taxes due to the VAT rate increase in 2007, as
well as a loss in direct tax revenue due to corporate income tax reform implementation in 2008.
France. The fiscal projections for 2007 are
based on the initial budget law and incorporate the impact of the July 2007 tax package.
Medium-term projections reflect the authorities’
latest official tax revenue forecast, including the
impact of the recent tax measures, but assume
different spending and nontax revenue profiles,
consistent with an unchanged policy assumption. All fiscal projections are adjusted for the
IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions.
Italy. For 2007, the deficit projection is based
on the IMF staff’s assessment of this year’s budget, adjusted for recent developments, including
the additional expenditure package adopted in
the summer of 2007. In addition, it is assumed
that revenue overperformance relative to the
official projections in the medium-term economic and budget plan of June (also known
as DPEF) would not be spent. For the medium
term, staff projects its own “current policies”
scenario, defined as a constant structural primary balance net of one-off measures.
United Kingdom. The fiscal projections are
based on information provided in the 2007
Budget Report. Additionally, the projections
incorporate the most recent statistical releases
from the Office for National Statistics, including
provisional budgetary outturns through the first
quarter of 2007.
Canada. Projections use the baseline forecast
in the 2007 Budget for FY2007/08–2008/09
and the 2006 Economic and Fiscal Update for

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

FY2009/10–2010/11. The staff forecast incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada, including provincial and territorial
budgetary outturns through the first quarter
of 2007.
Australia. The fiscal projections through the
fiscal year 2010/11 are based on the budget
published in May 2007. For the remainder of
the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies.
Austria. Fiscal figures for 2006 are based on
the authorities’ estimated outturn. Projections
for 2007 and beyond are IMF staff projections
based on current policies in place.
Brazil. The fiscal projections for 2007 are
based on the information provided in the 2007
budget and recent budget execution decrees,
with some adjustments made by the IMF staff.
For the remainder of the projection period, the
IMF staff assumes unchanged policies, except
for a further increase in public investment in
line with the authorities’ intentions.
Belgium. The projections for 2007 are based
on the information provided in the 2007 Budget Report. For 2007, the projection excludes
one-off measures not explicitly outlined in the
budget (representing 0.3 percent of GDP). For
the remainder of the projection period, the IMF
staff assumes unchanged policies.
China. Projections for 2007 are based on the
authorities’ budget released in March, with
some adjustment for the IMF staff’s definition
for overall budget balance. For 2008, IMF staff
projections assume that the deficit will be held
roughly constant at its projected 2008 level (just
under 1 percent of GDP), which is broadly in
line with the authorities’ budget plans.
Denmark. Projections for 2007 are aligned
with the latest official projections and budget.
For 2008–12, the projections incorporate the
June 2006 welfare agreement as well as key features of the prior medium-term fiscal plan.
Greece. Projections are based on the 2007
budget, the latest Stability Program, and other
forecasts provided by the authorities. According to preliminary estimates by the European
Commission, the revision of gross national

income could lead to a permanent increase of
Greece’s contribution to the EU budget of less
than ¼ percent of GDP, as well as to a one-off
payment of arrears of such a contribution of
about ¾ percent of GDP, which could accrue to
the 2007 balance. These possible contributions
are not reflected in the staff projections.
Hong Kong SAR. Fiscal projections for 2007–10
are consistent with the authorities’ mediumterm strategy as outlined in the FY2007–08 budget, with projections for 2011–12 based on the
assumptions underlying the IMF staff’s mediumterm macroeconomic scenario.
India. Projections for 2007 are based on the
authorities’ budget, with some adjustment for
the IMF staff’s assumptions. For the remainder
of the projection period, the IMF staff assumes
unchanged policies.
Korea. Projections for 2007 are based on the
authorities’ budget, with some adjustment for
the IMF staff’s assumptions. For 2008–12, projections are in line with the authorities’ budget
plans.
Mexico. Fiscal projections for 2007 build on
the authorities’ budget. Projections for 2008
and beyond are based on the IMF staff calculations in line with the Federal Government Fiscal
Responsibility Law.
Netherlands. The fiscal projections build on
the 2006 and 2007 budgets, the latest Stability
Program, and other forecasts provided by the
authorities.
New Zealand. The fiscal projections
through the fiscal year 2010/11 are based on
the 2007/08 budget released in May 2007. For
the remainder of the projection period, the
IMF staff assumes unchanged policies. The New
Zealand fiscal account switched to new GAAP
standards beginning in the 2006/07 fiscal year,
with no comparable historical data.
Portugal. Fiscal projections through 2010 are
based on the IMF staff’s assessment of the 2007
budget and the authorities’ revised projections
presented in April 2007, which updated the current Stability Program. In subsequent years, the
fiscal projections assume maintaining the primary
balance excluding age-related expenditures.

Singapore. For FY2007/08, expenditure projections are based on budget numbers, while
revenue projections reflect IMF staff estimates
of the impact of new policy measures, including an increase in the goods and services tax.
Medium-term revenue projections assume that
capital gains on fiscal reserves will be included
in investment income.
Spain. Fiscal projections through 2009
are based on the 2007 budget and the 2008
draft budget policies outlined in the authorities’ updated Stability Program 2006–09,
information from recent statistical releases,
and official announcements. In subsequent
years, the fiscal projections assume unchanged
policies.
Sweden. The fiscal projections are based on
information provided in the budget presented
on October 16, 2006. Additionally, the projections incorporate the most recent statistical
releases from Statistics Sweden, including
provisional budgetary outturns through
December 2006.
Switzerland. Projections for 2007–12 are
based on IMF staff calculations, which incorporate measures to restore balance in the

What’s New
The following changes have been made to
streamline the Statistical Appendix of the World
Economic Outlook. Starting with this issue, the
printed version of the World Economic Outlook
will carry only Part A Tables in the Statistical
Appendix section.
Part A contains Tables 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 20,
25, 26, 31, 35, 43, and 44 from the previous
issues of the World Economic Outlook; Tables 1.2
and 1.3, which used to be in the main text of
the report; and a new table on private capital
flows. Tables in Part A present summary data
for both advanced economies and emerging
market and developing countries in the categories of Output, Inflation, Financial Policies,
Foreign Trade, Current Account Transactions,
Balance of Payments and External Financing,

206

Federal accounts and strengthen social security
finances.
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country.
In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over the business cycle: official interest rates will therefore increase when economic
indicators suggest that inflation will rise above
its acceptable rate or range, and they will
decrease when indicators suggest that prospective inflation will not exceed the acceptable
rate or range, that prospective output growth
is below its potential rate, and that the margin
of slack in the economy is significant. On this
basis, the LIBOR on six-month U.S. dollar
deposits is assumed to average 5.2 percent
in 2007 and 4.4 percent in 2008 (see Table 1.1).
The projected path reflects the assumption
prevailing in financial markets that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates in late 2007 and
early 2008. The rate on three-month euro
deposits is assumed to average 4.0 percent
in 2007 and 4.1 percent in 2008. The interest rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits is
assumed to average 0.9 percent in 2007 and
1.1 percent in 2008.

Flow of Funds, and Medium-Term Baseline
Scenario.
Part B of the Statistical Appendix contains the remaining tables. The complete
Statistical Appendix, which includes both Part
A and Part B Tables, will be available only via
the Internet at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/
weo/2007/02/index.htm.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 182 countries form
the statistical basis for the World Economic Outlook (the World Economic Outlook database).
The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s
Research Department and area departments,
with the latter regularly updating country projections based on consistent global assumptions.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Although national statistical agencies are
the ultimate providers of historical data and
definitions, international organizations are also
involved in statistical issues, with the objective
of harmonizing methodologies for the national
compilation of statistics, including the analytical
frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications,
and valuation procedures used in the production of economic statistics. The World Economic
Outlook database reflects information from
both national source agencies and international
organizations.
The comprehensive revision of the standardized System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA), the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition
(BPM5), the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM), and the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) represented
important improvements in the standards of
economic statistics and analysis.3 The IMF was
actively involved in all these projects, particularly
the Balance of Payments, Monetary and Financial
Statistics, and Government Finance Statistics manuals, which reflects the IMF’s special interest in
countries’ external positions, financial sector
stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new
definitions began in earnest when the manuals
were released. However, full concordance with
the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised
country data, and hence the World Economic
Outlook estimates are still only partially adapted
to these manuals.
In line with recent improvements in standards
of reporting economic statistics, several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-baseyear method of calculating real macroeconomic

variables levels and growth by switching to a
chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth. Recent dramatic changes in the structure of these economies have obliged these
countries to revise the way in which they measure real GDP levels and growth. Switching to
the chain-weighted method of computing aggregate growth, which uses current price information, allows countries to measure GDP growth
more accurately by eliminating upward biases in
new data.4 Currently, real macroeconomic data
for Albania, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, the euro area, Finland, France, Georgia,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United
States are based on chain-weighted methodology. However, data before 1996 (Albania), 1995
(Belgium), 1995 (Cyprus), 1995 (Czech Republic), 1995 (euro area), 1991 (Germany), 2000
(Greece), 1994 (Kazakhstan), 1990 (Iceland),

(Russia), 1995 (Slovenia), and 1995 (Spain)
are based on unrevised national accounts and
subject to revision in the future.
The members of the European Union
have adopted a harmonized system for the
compilation of the national accounts, referred
to as ESA 1995. All national accounts data from
1995 onward are presented on the basis of the
new system. Revision by national authorities
of data prior to 1995 to conform to the new
system has progressed but has, in some cases,
not been completed. In such cases, historical
World Economic Outlook data have been carefully
adjusted to avoid breaks in the series. Users of
EU national accounts data prior to 1995 should
nevertheless exercise caution until such time as

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

the revision of historical data by national statistical agencies has been fully completed. See
Box 1.2, “Revisions in National Accounts Methodologies,” in the May 2000 World Economic Outlook.
Composite data for country groups in the
World Economic Outlook are either sums or
weighted averages of data for individual countries. Unless otherwise indicated, multiyear averages of growth rates are expressed as compound
annual rates of change.5 Arithmetically weighted
averages are used for all data except inflation
and money growth for the other emerging market and developing country group, for which
geometric averages are used. The following
conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange
rates, interest rates, and the growth rates of
monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP
converted to U.S. dollars at market exchange
rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the
domestic economy, whether growth rates or
ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities (PPPs) as a share of total
world or group GDP.6
• Composites for data relating to the domestic economy for the euro area (13 member
countries throughout the entire period unless
otherwise noted) are aggregates of national
source data using weights based on 1995 European currency unit (ECU) exchange rates.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment growth are weighted by labor force as a
share of group labor force.

5Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity, trade,
and commodity prices are calculated based on compound

• Composites relating to the external economy
are sums of individual country data after
conversion to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for
balance of payments data and at end-of-year
market exchange rates for debt denominated
in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages
of percentage changes for individual countries
weighted by the U.S. dollar value of exports
or imports as a share of total world or group
exports or imports (in the preceding year).
For central and eastern European countries,
external transactions in nonconvertible currencies (through 1990) are converted to U.S.
dollars at the implicit U.S. dollar/ruble conversion rates obtained from each country’s national
currency exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and
for the ruble.
All data refer to calendar years, except for
the following countries, which refer to fiscal
years: Australia (July/June), Bangladesh (July/
June), Egypt (July/June), Ethiopia (July/June),
Islamic Republic of Iran (March/February),
Mauritius (July/June), Myanmar (April/March),
Nepal (July/June), New Zealand (July/June),
Pakistan (July/June), Samoa (July/June), and
Tonga (July/June).

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the World Economic Outlook divides the world into two major
groups: advanced economies, and other emerging market and developing countries.7 Rather
than being based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, this classification has evolved over
time with the objective of facilitating analysis by
providing a reasonably meaningful organization

7As used here, the term “country” does not in all cases
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood
by international law and practice. It also covers some territorial entities that are not states, but for which statistical
data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

of data. Table A provides an overview of these
standard groups in the World Economic Outlook,
showing the number of countries in each group
and the average 2006 shares of groups in aggregate PPP-valued GDP, total exports of goods and
services, and population.
A few countries are currently not included in
these groups, either because they are not IMF
members and their economies are not monitored by the IMF or because databases have
not yet been fully developed. Because of data
limitations, group composites do not reflect
the following countries: the Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei
Darussalam, Eritrea, Iraq, Liberia, Serbia, Somalia, and Timor-Leste. Cuba and the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea are examples of
countries that are not IMF members, whereas
San Marino, among the advanced economies,
and Aruba, Marshall Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Palau, and the Republic of Montenegro, among the developing countries, are
examples of economies for which databases have
not been completed.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
The 30 advanced economies are listed in
Table B. The seven largest in terms of GDP—
the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—

210

SAR1

Major advanced
economies

constitute the subgroup of major advanced
economies, often referred to as the Group of
Seven (G-7) countries. The 13 members of the
euro area and the four newly industrialized Asian
economies are also distinguished as subgroups.
Composite data shown in the tables for the euro
area cover the current members for all years,
even though the membership has increased
over time.
In 1991 and subsequent years, data for
Germany refer to west Germany and the eastern
Länder (that is, the former German Democratic Republic). Before 1991, economic data
were not available on a unified basis or in a
consistent manner. Hence, in tables featuring data expressed as annual percent change,
these apply to west Germany in years up to
and including 1991, but to unified Germany
from 1992 onward. In general, data on national
accounts and domestic economic and financial
activity through 1990 cover west Germany only,
whereas data for the central government and
balance of payments apply to west Germany
through June 1990 and to unified Germany
thereafter.

Other Emerging Market and Developing Countries
The group of other emerging market and
developing countries (143 countries) includes
all countries that are not classified as advanced
economies.
The regional breakdowns of other emerging market and developing countries—Africa,
central and eastern Europe, Commonwealth of
Independent States, developing Asia, Middle East,
and Western Hemisphere—largely conform to the
regional breakdowns in the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics. In both classifications, Egypt
and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are included
in the Middle East region rather than in Africa.
In addition, the World Economic Outlook sometimes refers to the regional group of Middle
East and North Africa countries, also referred
to as the MENA countries, whose composition
straddles the Africa and Middle East regions.
This group is defined as the Arab League
countries plus the Islamic Republic of Iran
(see Table D).
Other emerging market and developing
countries are also classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical criteria reflect countries’ composition of export earnings and other
income from abroad; exchange rate arrangements; a distinction between net creditor and
net debtor countries; and, for the net debtor
countries, financial criteria based on external
financing sources and experience with external
debt servicing. The detailed composition of

shown in Tables E and F.
The analytical criterion, by source of export
earnings, distinguishes between categories: fuel
(Standard International Trade Classification—
SITC 3) and nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel
primary products (SITC 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68).
The financial criteria focus on net creditor
countries, net debtor countries, and heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs). Net debtor countries are

further differentiated on the basis of two additional financial criteria: by official external financing and by experience with debt servicing.8 The
HIPC group comprises the countries considered
by the IMF and the World Bank for their debt

initiative, known as the HIPC Initiative, with the
aim of reducing the external debt burdens of all
the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a
reasonably short period of time.9

8During 2001–05, 51 countries incurred external payments arrears or entered into official or commercial bank
debt-rescheduling agreements. This group of countries
is referred to as countries with arrears and/or rescheduling
during 2001–05.

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3Data for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The
figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of
new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in the recent figures.
4Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December/December
changes during the year, as is the practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
In this table, Africa excludes Zimbabwe.
2The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
3Given recent trends, it is not possible to forecast inflation with any degree of precision and consequently no projection for 2008 is shown.
4For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price indices with a broader and more up-to-date coverage are
typically used for more recent years.
5Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

Note: The methodology and specific assumptions for each country are discussed in Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix.
1Debt data refer to end of year. Debt data are not always comparable across countries.
2Percent of potential GDP.
3Beginning in 1995, the debt and debt-service obligations of the Treuhandanstalt (and of various other agencies) were taken over by the general government. This debt is
equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, and the associated debt service to ½ to 1 percent of GDP.
4Excludes one-off receipts from the sale of mobile telephone licenses (the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2000 for Germany, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2001 and 2002 for
France, and 1.2 percent of GDP in 2000 for Italy). Also excludes one-off receipts from sizable asset transactions, in particular 0.5 percent of GDP for France in 2005.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as
the sum of the U.S. dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier World Economic Outlooks, where the
composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national saving are built up from
national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current account
balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data source, which is dictated by availability, implies that
the estimates for national saving that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, error omissions and asymmetries in balance of payments statistics affect
the estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Notwithstanding these statistical
shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in saving and investment, both over time
and across regions and countries.
1Excludes Zimbabwe.
2Calculated from the data of individual euro area countries.
3Mongolia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.

Regional Economic Outlooks
These in-depth studies of the Asia and Pacific, Europe, Middle
East and Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Hemisphere regions drill down to specific regional economic and
financial developments and trends—bringing the unique
resources, experience, and perspective of the IMF to bear.
While near-term responses to exogenous shocks, policies for
growth, and the effectiveness of financial policies get centerstage examination, the reports also consider vulnerabilities
and opportunities developing in the wings.

$31.00 (academic rate: $26.00). Please visit www.imfbookstore.org/REOs
or contact publications@imf.org for further information on all REO
