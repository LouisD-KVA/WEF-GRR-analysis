76th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 26 June 2006

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 76th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2006.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 599.2 million, compared
with SDR 370.9 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the
financial year 2005/06 may be found on pages 180–2 of this Report under “Net
profit and its distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 132.4 million
in payment of a dividend of SDR 245 per share, payable in any constituent
currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs. This year’s proposed amount compares
to the dividend of SDR 235 per share paid out last year.
The Board further recommends that SDR 46.7 million be transferred to
the general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund
and the remainder – amounting to SDR 414.1 million – to the free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2005/06 will be payable to shareholders on 3 July 2006.

I. Introduction: resilience to mounting strains

This time last year, there was both satisfaction and surprise at the continuing
excellent performance of the global economy. Satisfaction, because buoyant
growth and persistently low inflation, particularly in many emerging market
economies, meant generally higher living standards and a significant reduction
in poverty. Surprise, because a whole set of imbalances, which some thought
had clear potential to eventually threaten that good performance, had still not
done so. Many key macroeconomic variables, which had exhibited substantial
and sustained deviations from historical norms, surprised by showing none of
the typical signs of reverting to the mean. Record and rising household debt
levels and a further increase in oil prices did not weigh on spending in the
United States. Nor did record high house prices collapse, anywhere. China’s
investment boom was not interrupted. The easy flow of funds to borrowers of
all types did not falter. And an unexpected further leap in what were already
unprecedented external imbalances did not lead to disorder in exchange
markets.
One year later, the same sentiments could be invoked in even greater
measure. There are still grounds for satisfaction. Not only has the good
performance continued (Chapters II and III), but there are even indications that
some aspects of the imbalances might themselves be receding. The recovery
in Japan seems firmly established, and more sustained growth in Germany,
as well as elsewhere in continental Europe, appears increasingly likely. This
reduces the dependence of the global expansion on the previous two poles of
growth, the United States and China. As a result of this broadening expansion,
trade imbalances could also be lowered. And there are still more grounds for
surprise. Over the course of the last year, other imbalances that had earlier
seemed worrying grew even larger. In particular, another year of massive
borrowing further raised debt and potential debt service levels. Yet the global
economy has powered on, regardless.
This continued strong economic growth has, however, begun to raise
concerns about global inflationary pressures. As a result, policies which had
previously contributed to extremely easy monetary conditions worldwide have
begun to be modified (Chapter IV). Significant adjustments to policy over the
last year or so include further monetary tightening in the United States and
Europe, the end of “quantitative easing” and foreign exchange intervention in
Japan, and the announced change in the exchange rate regime in China
(Chapter V). The good news, again both welcome and surprising, is that these
moves have not to date (late May) been accompanied by any severe tensions
in financial markets. The fear, thankfully unrealised, was that higher policy

BIS 76th Annual Report

rates would interact with the underlying imbalances to affect both financial
markets and spending proclivities, with a related effect on global growth and
employment.
This does not mean that there has been no response to the recent policy
restraint. A number of signs have emerged that some kind of turning point
might have been reached. Long bond rates have finally begun to rise, more
sharply since the turn of the year, and evidence has been accumulating that
other financial markets are increasingly being affected (Chapter VI). Moreover,
in the United States and a number of other countries, house price increases
(Chapter VII) and construction activity have recently become less vigorous.
Evidently, the wish of policymakers must be that this orderly deceleration will
continue, and that a smooth adjustment to a sustainable rate of growth will be
the eventual outcome. Indeed, this is the consensus forecast, as well as that
of the IMF and OECD.
Yet, even if this is the expected outcome, how sure of it can we be?
Perhaps the principal point to make is that the cycle of policy tightening
globally, as opposed to that in the United States, is not well advanced.
Moreover, it is only since early 2006 that long rates, which play a key role in
so many financial markets, have risen noticeably. More disruptive effects
could still materialise. The recent historical experiences of Japan, Germany
and Southeast Asia all indicate that costly economic downturns are possible,
even after long periods of exceptional performance. The same examples also
suggest that long periods of price stability are no guarantee of future robust
growth.
Prudent policymakers today should still be thinking about remaining risks,
and how they might respond to them. In advance, what steps might they take
to minimise both the likelihood of difficulties and the scale of the losses
that could be incurred should they arise? During and after the emergence of
problems, what could be done to reduce the collateral damage? The Conclusion
of this Annual Report addresses these forward-looking and more normative
issues.
Constraining our capacity to assess both emerging problems and potential
solutions is the continuing process of structural change in the global economy.
New technology and the opening-up of previously closed economies to crossborder influences are all profoundly affecting the real economy. The inflation
mechanism has also changed, perhaps dramatically. The financial sector too
has felt the combined impact of globalisation, consolidation and the increased
influence of market forces. The good news is that central bankers seem well
aware of these changes and the uncertainties they create. Existing policy
frameworks were increasingly questioned last year, and signs emerged that
they were being significantly adapted in response. Change is begetting change,
which is no bad thing.

Meeting the challenges of recent success
The strong economic growth during the period under review was shared
by all major geographical areas. The impetus for this expansion had largely

4

BIS 76th Annual Report

originated in the United States and Asia, and first benefited others that
exported to these regions. Higher demand led in turn to substantial increases
in energy and other commodity prices. Through both volume and price effects,
this benefited emerging markets more generally, including, for the third year
in a row, Africa. In spite of being on the negative side of this same price shift,
Japan and continental Europe also showed clearer signs of recovery.
Notwithstanding this welcome vigour at the aggregate level, the pattern
of spending in some of the fastest-growing countries continued to be highly
unusual. In the United States and a number of other countries, private
consumption has been strikingly high, as has private residential investment.
Both have been buoyed by easy credit conditions, rising house prices and a
well developed financial capacity to extract housing equity. The associated
effect has been a continuing very low rate of household saving (indeed, sharply
negative in some countries) and a further increase in household debt. In
contrast, in China it is the level of fixed investment that has been strikingly
high. Here, too, easy credit conditions have played a prime role, as has
political influence over loans for projects that might not meet normal credit risk
criteria. Foreign direct investment has also been a significant factor, with much
of the output intended for foreign markets. To oversimplify, the upshot of these
unusual patterns is that the English-speaking countries have become the global
pole accounting for increases in the consumption of tradables, while Asia, with
China at the centre, has become the global pole of their increased production.
Elsewhere in the world, the most striking deviation from more normal
spending patterns has been the persistently low rate of corporate investment,
against the background of a continuing high level of household saving. The
persistence of low investment in so many countries is particularly puzzling
given generally high levels of measured profits and what still seem to be very
accommodative financing conditions. Plausible explanations for this weakness
could include hesitancy in the wake of earlier excesses as well as hurdle rates
that are too high for a low interest rate world. The influence of such factors
should diminish with time. A more fundamental explanation might be doubt
about the profitability of investments looking forward. One reason might be a
concern that past profit growth was largely due to non-repeatable factors:
falling interest rates, tax breaks and cost cutting. Another might be the
conviction that current elevated levels of household spending in countries like
the United States are not sustainable. And still another might be fears about
future competition, from China and India in particular.
An international implication of the fact that the United States and a
number of other countries save so little relative to domestic investment, while
other countries save so much, is that external imbalances have grown to record
levels. The US current account deficit at the end of 2005 was equivalent
to 6 1/2% of the country’s GDP, despite the net investment income account
having remained stubbornly positive until very recently. Almost every region
of the world has contributed to the offsetting surplus, but China, Japan and
recently the oil exporters have contributed the most.
If robust global demand remained a source of satisfaction last year, so too
did global inflation performance. While higher energy prices generally lifted

BIS 76th Annual Report

headline inflation, there was little pass-through to underlying measures of
inflation. In most jurisdictions, wages and benefits remained generally well
under control. Moreover, productivity increases tended to be higher in countries
with faster-rising wage bills, like the United States, implying offsetting effects
on unit labour costs. The fact that profits as a share of factor incomes hit
record levels globally in 2005, in spite of higher commodity prices, also has
favourable implications. New cost pressures could, for a time, be contained by
margin compression.
But, as with the aggregate demand data, looking beneath the surface
reveals latent issues that warrant attention. First, the data may not be reliably
measuring the underlying inflation trends, already made difficult to identify by
massive shifts in relative prices in recent years. For example, in most countries
the costs of housing services have been rising sharply, but these tend to be
either badly measured or even ignored in the calculation of consumer price
indices. Second, the concept of “core” inflation is based on the exclusion of
volatile price components, but the price of excluded energy has now been
trending upwards for over three years. It is the reality of consumers facing
higher costs for energy and housing services that could still pass through to
wage settlements. Third, in many countries the effects of higher energy prices
have been muted by regulatory constraints and fiscal subsidies, but these will
have to be removed over time. And finally, as the global economy moves closer
to full capacity, rising inflationary pressures might be expected.
The growing concern in recent quarters with the need for “vigilance”
against potential inflationary pressures was reinforced against the backdrop of
many years of highly accommodative monetary and credit conditions. Real
policy rates in the United States and the euro area had been negative for some
years, and well below potential rates of growth since the beginning of this
decade. Monetary and credit aggregates tell much the same story. All have
shown sharp increases in recent years, and most accelerated in the period
under review. A similar pattern is discernible in emerging market economies,
reflecting domestic tendencies towards more rapid credit creation and the
effects on domestic liquidity of large capital inflows. The subsequent reflow of
funds to the industrial countries, in the form of foreign exchange reserves,
completes the process by which the official sector has increased liquidity
globally.
Movements in other financial variables over the last fiscal year also
indicated the influence of continuing easy monetary conditions. Perhaps the
most important development, given its impact on a wide range of other
markets, was the protracted refusal of the long bond rate in the United States
to rise in response to sizeable increases in the federal funds rate accompanied
by continued strong economic growth. Indeed, after earlier persistent declines
in the long rate, it was only in March 2006 that its level returned to that
prevailing when the Federal Reserve began to tighten in June 2004. Bond rates
in other industrial countries traced out similar movements, albeit at the lower
levels justified by weaker economic numbers. On the one hand, a number of
studies seemed to indicate the influence of massive purchases of long-term
bonds by foreign central banks, primarily in US dollars, and by pension funds

6

BIS 76th Annual Report

and insurance companies seeking to hedge their long-term liabilities. On the
other hand, the possibility that the market was simply pricing in the increased
likelihood of an extended economic recession, perhaps in response to current
excesses, could not be ruled out completely.
Developments in other financial markets, however, seemed less supportive
of these more pessimistic interpretations. Indeed, the prices of almost all
longer-term financial assets have been consistently strong. Spreads on highyield corporate bonds tightened back close to cyclical lows. The spreads on
sovereign bonds fell even further to reach record lows, which have essentially
been maintained to date. With the exception of the US markets, global equity
prices showed at least steady gains almost everywhere in 2005, while gains in
Japan and many emerging market economies bordered on the spectacular.
And, as noted, house prices continued to advance in most countries. Finally,
and also consistent with optimistic forecasts, the cost of insuring against
expected volatility (as derived from option prices) has also been unusually
cheap in recent quarters.
It is not hard to find specific factors in each of these markets to support
an upbeat view about the future. For example, corporate bond defaults have,
in recent years, been exceptionally low. Moreover, many sovereigns have
benefited from better domestic policies, better external positions and less
macroeconomic volatility in the industrial countries. Yet the fact that all these
long-term asset prices were rising simultaneously also leads naturally to
consideration of the possibility of a common cause. To varying degrees, they
may all be manifestations of the extended period of easy credit conditions just
referred to. Indeed, this interpretation of developments in financial markets is
given further credence by the recent behaviour of commodity prices in general,
and oil and gold prices in particular. The almost uninterrupted upward trend
in all these prices began around the middle of 2003, when policy rates in the
main industrial countries reached their lowest level in this cycle.
While their precise motivations clearly differed somewhat, the central
banks in almost all the larger industrial economies tightened policy in the
period under review. This process continued to be most advanced in the United
States, where each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee resulted in
a 25 basis point rise to a level of 5% by the middle of May 2006. While the
Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of core inflation remained well under
control, headline inflation peaked around 41/2 % in 2005 under the particular
influence of higher energy prices. Moreover, reductions in measures of
domestic excess capacity indicated the potential for further inflationary
pressures, as did the continued and rapid increase in house prices. The ECB
also raised rates twice, in spite of relatively higher levels of excess capacity,
with concerns being expressed about developments in both of the pillars
supporting the ECB’s policy strategy: higher oil prices pushed up headline
inflation, further reinforcing the need for vigilance against subsequent wage
increases, while credit growth, especially in the form of household mortgages,
accelerated sharply.
Even in Japan, where the authorities had for years been focusing on the
need to eliminate deflationary tendencies, emerging signs that the policy had

7

finally succeeded led the Bank of Japan to conclude that it could begin to
carefully remove its policy of “quantitative easing”. However, the Bank of Japan
also made it clear that this was quite distinct from a decision to raise shortterm policy rates. As with the “measured” increases in policy rates in the
United States, this was designed to avoid any disruptive unwinding of the
financial exposures built up during the long period of extremely low Japanese
interest rates. Elsewhere in the industrial world, monetary policy was also
tightened cautiously for very similar reasons.
This tightening process had an unwelcome side effect. In response to the
fact that policy rates rose more in the United States than elsewhere, the dollar
actually strengthened materially on an effective basis during most of 2005
before subsequently falling back somewhat. This confounded the expectations
of those who had focused on the growing, indeed unsustainable, size of the US
external deficit. Moreover, the strengthening of the dollar perhaps contributed
to making the deficit larger than would otherwise have been the case. Imports
rose sharply as a share of GDP, and only partly as a result of higher oil prices.
In other industrial economies, weaker currencies helped reduce the generally
negative effects on current account balances of higher commodity prices and
deteriorating terms of trade.
The strengthening of the dollar, in association with higher policy rates in
the United States, might also have been expected to reduce the flow of capital
to emerging market economies. This in turn would cause their currencies
to weaken. But, again confounding expectations, most such currencies
strengthened, some significantly, over much of the period under review. In
part, this was due to improved trade balances, related to commodity gains and
better domestic policies, but capital inflows in a wide variety of forms also rose
to sharply higher levels. Apparently, as US rates rose, the funding for “carry
trade” purchases supporting such inflows simply shifted to other industrial
countries with lower interest rates.
Emerging market economies reacted to these pressures with various
combinations of exchange rate appreciation, exchange rate intervention and
easier domestic monetary policy. There was generally a greater willingness
than hitherto to accept stronger currencies. Yet, other than in Latin America,
real interest rates in many emerging markets were kept close to zero
throughout much of the period under review, a situation very similar to that
seen in most of the industrial countries. As for recourse to intervention, the
level of reserves held by emerging market countries rose to record levels,
albeit more slowly. While virtually every country showed some gains, those
recorded by China were huge.
Between February and mid-May 2006, as the pattern of stronger growth
and monetary tightening in the industrial countries became more generalised,
signs began to emerge of a change in the financial climate. Of perhaps greatest
significance, long bond rates moved up sharply in the United States, as they
also did in Europe and Japan. In addition, the dollar began to weaken once
more, indeed at an accelerating pace from April onwards, while the yen and
euro strengthened. High-yield currencies like the New Zealand dollar, the
Hungarian forint and the Icelandic króna, previously much favoured by

8

BIS 76th Annual Report

speculators, fell sharply as attention refocused on both domestic imbalances
(such as rapidly rising house prices and low private saving rates) and
associated large external deficits. Stock markets in the Middle East, a region
which had benefited greatly from higher energy prices, fell even more
dramatically as regional investors reined in their earlier exuberance. Equity
markets in many other emerging market economies also fell back in May as
foreign investors withdrew. Whether these events foretell a more widespread
and longer-lasting return to more cautious behaviour on the part of investors
remains an open question. Many false predictions of such a change have
been made in the recent past, albeit not against the background of a global
tightening of monetary policy.

Structural change and policy regime shifts
Production processes in the global economy have become significantly more
integrated over time, particularly since the early 1990s. This has implied both
higher levels of global productivity and massive increases in the effective
supply of global labour. Together, these factors have continued to put direct
downward pressure on the prices of traded goods and services, although
perhaps less so in 2005 than in previous years. But there have also been
continuing indirect effects, with attendant implications for wage and price
setting behaviour. Not only has foreign labour become increasingly available to
deal with bottleneck problems, but threats to move whole factories to lowercost jurisdictions have become increasingly credible. Last year, merger and
acquisition activity further contributed to these longer-term trends, particularly
in Europe. Moreover, what became distinctly more noticeable last year were
the efforts of enterprises from emerging market countries to seek control over
companies in other emerging markets, as well as in industrial countries. This
marks a significant and politically more sensitive phase in the globalisation
process.
As the year wore on, there were growing signs of resistance to all these
forces. In the United States, the rising bilateral trade deficit with China led to an
intensification of the political pressure for an increase in the exchange value
of the renminbi. The slight revaluation in July 2005, and the associated
announcement of a new framework based on an exchange rate basket, were
seen by many in the United States as less than adequate. As a result, a
number of bills were introduced in the US Congress threatening to impose
punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. Political forces in the United States also
showed strong resistance to attempts by first Chinese and then Middle Eastern
companies to buy controlling stakes in certain US interests. In Europe, the
resistance took the form of measures to impede the liberalisation of service
industries within the European Union and to prevent cross-border takeovers,
particularly in the financial and energy sectors. In France, widespread protests
in opposition to measures to liberalise labour markets further attested to the
uncertainties and fears generated by the globalisation process.
Ongoing structural change also characterised global financial markets
in the period under review. One welcome development was the increased

BIS 76th Annual Report

9

capacity of borrowers in emerging market countries to issue bonds, sometimes
of quite long maturity, denominated in local currencies. Indeed, in the course of
the year, this seemed to develop into a new asset class of interest to pension
funds and many others. On the face of it, this development appears to refute
the doctrine of “original sin”, according to which countries with a history of bad
macroeconomic performance would never again be offered such borrowing
opportunities. Of course, it could also be asked whether this renewed access
will prove to be only a temporary by-product of easy monetary conditions and
an enhanced appetite for risk.
Another notable development was the continued spectacular growth in
markets for the transfer of credit risk, in particular various forms of structured
debt obligations backed by a widening range of risky assets, including
commercial property. Again, this constitutes a significant step towards making
markets more complete and efficient, even if it also implies attendant risks.
A private sector working group on these markets, which reported last year,
drew particular attention to frequent shortcomings in the supporting legal
documentation and to other operational risks. Supervisory authorities in
New York and London, where most of these markets operate, immediately
responded with forceful steps to encourage improvements.
The work of central bankers has been affected, for better and for worse,
by these structural developments. In particular, positive supply side shocks,
including the effects of globalisation on labour markets, have made it easier
than it would otherwise have been to maintain inflation at low levels. Less
helpfully, this development may also have led to a certain complacency that the
war against inflation has been won for good. Moreover, more complete and
generally more efficient financial markets seem to have experienced occasional
phases when risk has been underpriced and credit has grown excessively.
This combination of easy money and low risk premia could eventually lead to
future inflation, or financial imbalances, or both.
Over the last few years, central banks have shown a greater willingness
to factor such concerns into their policy frameworks. Central bankers have
been making increasingly frequent reference to the need to raise policy rates
back towards more “normal” or “neutral” levels. More formally, the Bank of
Japan has announced that its future policy moves will be guided by two
“perspectives”: the prospects for near-term inflation and the need to avoid
longer-term problems of the sort that emerged in the late 1980s. The ECB’s
two-pillar approach also seems to have been evolving in a similar direction. All
of these changes have been supported by a growing body of empirical research
indicating that, when it comes to ensuring longer-term macroeconomic
stability, money, credit and financial conditions might still matter after all.

II. The global economy

Highlights
The world economy grew strongly in 2005 but inflation remained subdued
despite a further jump in oil and non-oil commodity prices. While the United
States and China led the global expansion in early 2005, the recovery gained
breadth in the course of the year, extending to Japan and continental Europe.
Global growth and inflation outcomes last year exceeded the optimistic
forecasts of early 2005 despite headwinds from changes in the macroeconomic
environment. First, inflationary pressures remained muted even as commodity
prices rose further in the third consecutive year of buoyant world growth. Second,
the US economy retained considerable strength despite the energy price hike
and hurricane-related disruptions. Third, global financing conditions continued
to be very supportive to growth, notwithstanding the progressive removal of
monetary accommodation in the United States and, albeit less advanced, in the
euro area. Finally, financial markets stayed calm despite the further massive
and unexpected deterioration of the US current account balance during 2005.
Although the US external deficit exceeded forecasts by about $100 billion in
2005, the dollar appreciated in real effective terms during the year.

The consensus forecast for 2006 is for a continuation of firm growth and
low inflation worldwide (Table II.1). Strong business confidence and low or
declining unemployment support this optimism about the near-term outlook
for growth. However, several features of the current global upswing are less
positive: fiscal deficits are large; household saving seems unsustainably low
in a number of advanced economies; corporate investment levels remain low;
and global current account imbalances have reached unprecedented levels. At
the same time, the inflation outlook has become more uncertain as oil prices
have risen to new record highs and output gaps are narrowing or even closing
in many countries.

Overview of the global economy
Continued buoyant growth and low inflation
World GDP growth in 2005 exceeded 4% for the third consecutive year, making
this the strongest upswing since the early 1970s. While output in the Americas
and Europe grew slightly less than in 2004, growth in Asia strengthened
further. China’s economic expansion continued unabated and the long-awaited
revival of Japan added to the region’s dynamism, not least because of the
substantial complementarities of trade structures between Japan and emerging
Asia. Overall, emerging Asia accounted for more than half of last year’s
increase in global output (Graph II.1).
Rapid demand growth (especially in emerging Asia) supported a further
rise in commodity prices in 2005, although capacity constraints in oil production
and refining accentuated price pressures. Spot prices for crude oil hit $70 a
barrel in late August 2005, an increase of about 60% from the beginning of the
year. The steady increase in real oil prices over the past two years contrasts
sharply with the supply-driven oil price shocks in the 1970s, when part of the

initial spike was reversed relatively quickly. The price of base metals and other
commodities also rose in tandem with oil prices (Graph II.2).
The global economy proved remarkably resilient to the further sharp rise in
energy prices. The net oil imports of OECD countries amounted to about 11/2% of
their GDP. This is 1/2 percentage point more than in 2004, but only about half of that
in the 1970s. While the economic expansion in oil-importing countries remained
intact, substantial terms-of-trade gains boosted growth in oil- and commodityexporting emerging economies in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.
Stubbornly subdued inflation cushioned the impact of high energy prices
on aggregate demand in oil-importing countries. Consumer price inflation rose
only moderately from the levels observed in 2004. Second-round effects were
largely absent, as wage moderation continued and corporate pricing power was
limited. Longer-term inflation expectations remained firmly anchored. Against
this backdrop, the central banks of the United States and, subsequently, the
euro area and Japan pursued strategies of a gradual removal of monetary
accommodation (see Chapter IV).
Persistently easy financing conditions worldwide provided another
counterweight to the effect of rising energy prices on economic growth. Real
short- and long-term interest rates in the major currency areas stayed well
below long-term averages. Associated with this development, low risk premia
supported asset values across the board: house prices boomed in many
countries (see Chapter VII), and equity prices increased to multi-year highs
virtually everywhere (see Chapter VI). Unusually tight credit spreads went hand
in hand with an acceleration of credit growth, to rates comparable to those
observed in the late 1990s.

Signs of a more balanced economic expansion
The United States and China remained the main engines of global growth in
early 2005. At the same time, buoyant US consumer spending and a

continuation of very strong investment in China helped the euro area and the
emerging Asian economies to overcome a weakening related to inventory
adjustment in manufacturing. Indeed, exports picked up in Europe in the first
half of 2005 and later in the rest of Asia, including in the previously lagging
high-tech sectors.
The global expansion broadened as the year progressed. While the US
economy retained considerable momentum and China continued to grow
apace, strengthening domestic demand supported a recovery in continental
Europe. Against the backdrop of buoyant profit growth, firming business
sentiment and, more recently, rising capacity utilisation, the euro area recorded
the strongest increase in business spending since 2000. Yet private consumption
failed to recover. Growth differentials among the large euro area economies
remained considerable, ranging from rapid economic expansion in Spain to
below average growth in France and Germany, and stagnation in Italy.
Rising domestic demand bolstered confidence that the recovery in Japan
was firmly established. Vigorous business spending and the turnaround in
credit growth suggested that the process of balance sheet adjustment in
the corporate and financial sectors had finally run its course (Graph II.3).
Private consumption rebounded on the back of improving labour market
conditions. Domestic demand firmed in many emerging Asian economies
(see Chapter III).
The economic expansion also became more balanced across components
of aggregate demand. Corporate investment finally picked up in many
advanced economies. In 2005, its contribution to domestic demand growth was
comparable to earlier upswings in the United States and Japan but somewhat
lower than in the second half of the 1990s in the euro area. Spending by
private households – including residential investment – accounted for about
67% of total GDP growth in OECD countries, compared to more than 80% in the
first half of the current decade. The recent decline is attributable to decelerating
residential investment and a softening of private consumption following

patterns

The consensus expectation for 2006 is for global growth to again exceed 4%
and for moderate inflation to continue. Indeed, the economic environment
appears favourable in many respects. Business sentiment has picked up
globally, which bodes well for a further strengthening of corporate investment.
Labour markets have firmed in the United States and Japan, and there are
signs of improvement in the euro area. In Asia, a strong autonomous growth
momentum seems to be gathering. Economic growth is also expected to
accelerate in Latin America and remain strong in central and eastern Europe.
However, there are also downside risks. Leaving aside potentially
catastrophic events such as an avian flu pandemic or a geopolitical crisis,
several questions can be raised as to the sustainability of current
macroeconomic trends over the medium term.
The configuration of key macroeconomic variables is highly unusual
(Table II.2). First, oil prices have risen to new record highs and are, in real
terms, about twice their long-term average. At some point, inflation pressures
might grow, especially since output gaps are narrowing or even closing in
many economies. Second, real long-term interest rates remain very low,
notwithstanding the increase since the beginning of 2006. Neither the reasons
behind historically low real interest rates nor the macroeconomic implications
of a sharp increase after a long period of low rates are well understood. Third,
while US corporations are net savers, measured household saving in the
United States turned negative last year. Finally, external current account
deficits have widened to unprecedented levels. The combined current account
position of countries with an external deficit amounts to more than 2 1/2 % of
world GDP, with much of this outcome accounted for by the United States.

Inflation and wage setting behaviour in the global economy
Global inflation trends
Global inflation remained low and stable in the period under review despite
continued strong economic growth and rising energy prices (Graph II.4).
Headline consumer price inflation in the United States rose to 4 3/4% last autumn
as petrol prices peaked after the hurricanes, but fell back towards the end of the
year. Headline CPI inflation in other advanced industrial countries also trended
higher during the past year or so, but was still low by historical standards.
Consumer price inflation moderated in Latin America and remained relatively
stable in central and eastern Europe. Inflation trends in emerging Asia diverged:
while inflation in China declined, despite continuing rapid economic growth,
several other countries recorded rising inflation rates (see Chapter III).
Core inflation rates stayed largely unchanged in the United States and
Europe, resulting in a particularly wide gap between headline and core inflation
in the third quarter of 2005. In Japan, inflation excluding fresh food crept up to
1/2 % around the turn of the year. Core inflation in emerging market economies
was broadly stable.
That headline inflation failed to follow the upward movement of energy
prices contrasts sharply with the wage-price spirals that characterised the
1970s. However, it is consistent with the more recent trend of declining inflation
persistence. From 1970 to 1989 in the G7 countries, more than 80% of the
price increases in the previous six months persisted into the following month.
This ratio dropped to less than 50% in the United States after the 1990s, and
fell likewise in Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. The evidence is more
mixed in the euro area. The degree of inflation persistence is also reported to
have declined in many emerging economies.
Another global trend that has remained intact is the lower international
dispersion of inflation rates worldwide. By 2005, inflation rates in advanced
economies had converged to a range of about 0 to 3%, compared to a range

Table II.3

of about 20 percentage points in 1980. Coefficients of variation of inflation rates
declined from 1.2 in the mid-1980s to less than 0.5 in 2005. Among emerging
markets, successful macroeconomic stabilisation efforts have also reduced the
dispersion of inflation rates since the mid-1990s.
The forces behind these long-term trends in the inflation process are not
entirely clear. The lion’s share of the decline in the level and variability of
inflation rates can be explained by a common factor (Table II.3). However, this
measure arguably captures quite distinct economic causes. One element has
been changes in the conduct of monetary policy. From this angle, common
global inflation trends are the result of a simultaneous shift in domestic
economic policies in many countries. Another, truly global, factor is the growing
international integration of the markets for goods and factors of production,
together with a shift in supply-demand conditions at the global level. In this
regard, the economic opening of China, India and the former Soviet bloc, but
also the growing economic strength of Asia and Latin America, have played a
key role. The apparently greater significance of global measures of economic
slack as drivers of domestic inflation is an indication of the increasingly global
character of the inflation process (see Chapter IV).
Large movements in relative prices at the global level, over the past five
years or so, lend support to the view that changes in the real economy have
affected global inflation dynamics. On the one hand, commodity prices have
risen by more than 30% (Graph II.5). This increase has coincided with booming
demand for commodities, raw materials and energy from emerging economies:
non-OECD countries accounted for about two thirds of the 20% growth in
global oil demand from 1995 to 2005. On the other hand, the supply of
manufactured goods has soared through exports from these newly integrated
emerging economies. For instance, export volumes of developing Asian
economies increased by about 15% per year in 2000–05. During this period,

the prices of imported consumer durables fell by 5% in the major industrial
countries while the prices of many non-tradable goods continued to rise.
These shifts in relative prices contrast starkly with the patterns observed
during the oil price shock in the late 1970s. From 1978 to 1981, the prices of
goods, services and commodities in the G3 increased more or less uniformly
in the order of 25–35%.

Wage setting behaviour and globalisation
The secular decline in inflation has gone hand in hand with great restraint in
nominal wage growth. Increases in unit labour costs have moderated in tandem
with nominal wages, and wage shares in the total economy have fallen by 5%
over the past three decades or so (Graph II.6).

Secular restraint

growth …

Globalisation has
affected wage
setting …

… through greater
labour mobility …

Undoubtedly, several factors have played a role in this process. Many
observers have argued that the greater credibility of monetary policy, achieved
through a more active response to inflationary shocks, contained wage
increases by providing a firmer anchor for inflation expectations (see Chapter IV).
Moreover, higher labour productivity growth, thanks to capital deepening and
technological progress, has also helped to limit increases in unit labour costs.
Finally, coupled with lower union density and more decentralised collective
bargaining, the deregulation of domestic labour markets over the past decade
or so has tended to reduce the bargaining power of some groups of workers.
At the same time, the influence of the globalisation process should not be
underestimated. The integration of emerging market economies into the global
production process has, by some estimates, effectively doubled the supply of
active workers engaged in the global economy. This, together with other
aspects of globalisation, has arguably influenced labour market policies and
wage setting behaviour in advanced industrial countries. At least three
channels seem to have played a role in this process.
First, increased international labour mobility has helped to ease supply
constraints in domestic labour markets. This seems to have mitigated upward
pressures on wages, especially for low-skilled workers (Graph II.7). The
awareness that a growing number of jobs are exposed to competition from
immigrants could exert a significant influence on wages in countries where
labour can easily move across borders. For instance, in the United States
the influx of immigrants, which increased the supply of working males by
11% between 1980 and 2000, is estimated to have slowed wage growth by
3 percentage points. In western Europe, the average annual ratio of immigrants
to population has essentially doubled since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.

The effect of cross-border labour mobility on wages within Europe may have
increased further after the EU enlargement in 2004. For instance, in the United
Kingdom significant declines in workers’ overtime payments were observed
in 2005 in those industries in which non-UK nationals accounted for a large
proportion of the workforce.
Second, the relocation of production – actual or threatened – has curtailed
the bargaining power of workers and trade unions in many industrial countries.
The rapid growth of trade in material inputs, such as parts and components, is
an indication of the growing vertical integration of production processes at the
global level. The growth rate of world trade in parts and components averaged
9% during the period 1990–2000, compared with 6 1/2 % for world trade growth
as a whole. In the United States, the share of imported material inputs rose
from 12% of total imports in 1992 to 17% in 2000. While the effect to date has
mostly been felt in the manufacturing sector, higher-skilled and higher-wage
jobs in the services sectors are becoming more and more contestable. The
impact of relocating production facilities is visible in Japan, where industries
that have actively pursued strategies of relocating production have tended
to reduce wage shares more aggressively (Graph II.7, right-hand panel). In
Germany, large firms have been able to negotiate real wage cuts in exchange
for giving up plans to relocate production.
Finally, the opening of markets for goods and, increasingly, services to
international competition has intensified competitive pressures on producers
in advanced industrial countries. The greater contestability in goods markets
has forced dominant domestic firms to step up their efforts to cut costs. The
reduction of wage bills has been a key element in strategies aimed at curtailing
the cost advantage enjoyed by producers in newly globalising countries such as
China and India. Indeed, wage shares have on average fallen more in industries
that have faced higher import penetration, such as apparel (Graph II.8).

questions

The consensus expectation is that inflation will remain low and stable in
2006, although the outlook has become more uncertain recently. Several
indicators point to growing inflation risks from rising resource utilisation.
Domestic output gaps are narrowing or even closing in many countries and
capacity utilisation in manufacturing in the G3 is above long-term averages.
Yet it is hard to gauge how much slack is actually left in the major advanced
economies. For instance, the rate of unemployment that can be sustained
without causing inflationary pressure may have declined as a result of
changes in labour market participation or structural reforms. Perhaps even
more importantly, globalisation might have lessened the responsiveness of
wages to domestic output gaps, thus reducing the likelihood of inflationary
pressures.
Against this background, one key question is whether low inflation for
traded goods will persist despite continued increases in raw material and
energy prices. The acceleration in producer prices in the major advanced
economies in the course of 2005 is a clear indication that pipeline pressures
have intensified. Hence, much depends on whether (or when) firms regain
pricing power at the consumer level and whether increases in wage costs will
remain contained. Here, various indicators send different signals.
Foreign direct investment in emerging market economies has remained
strong, which may be a sign that the process of production relocation has not
run its course. Import penetration has kept rising, which indicates continued
downward pressures on domestic prices and wages. Nominal wage increases
in the major industrial economies have so far remained well below historical
norms and this, together with expected solid gains in labour productivity,
should help to hold the growth of unit labour costs in check.
At the same time, the prices of imported consumer durables and core
consumer goods prices seem to have stopped declining. Little is understood
about wage and price formation and labour markets in the newly globalising
emerging economies. Anecdotal evidence, such as double digit increases in
labour costs in China for certain manufacturing workers in coastal areas, points
to diminishing economic slack. Simultaneously, rising resource utilisation and
persistently strong upward pressure on commodity prices may indicate that
the output gap is narrowing even at the global level.

Global saving grew in 2005 to 22% of GDP. This is about 11/2 percentage

average for the 1990s (Table II.4). Higher saving in the emerging economies
continued to drive the recent increase. Oil-exporting emerging economies
accounted for a growing share of global saving in 2005; their saving rates
rose by 4 percentage points. Saving patterns in emerging Asia diverged.

Table II.4

strong profit growth of Chinese corporations suggests that the increase
in 2005 might primarily reflect higher corporate saving. This would imply
that household saving rates were largely unchanged at the very high level of
about one quarter of GDP. In contrast, saving rates in the rest of emerging
Asia declined. In central and eastern Europe and Latin America, they were
broadly stable.
National saving rates in the advanced industrial economies were
unchanged, leaving rates well below the average for the past decade. But
differences across countries were considerable. On the one hand, in Germany
precautionary motives may have contributed to a further rise in the household
saving rate. On the other hand, household saving rates fell markedly in the
United States and Spain, where housing wealth rose sharply in 2005. At the
same time, the corporate sector in the United States and other advanced
economies remained a net saver. To the extent that higher corporate saving
has increased the value of claims on the corporate sector in the past few years,
lower household saving might be viewed as a response to rising corporate
saving. Notwithstanding such effects, in the United States both the household
saving rate, which turned negative by most measures in 2005, and the national
saving rate appear unsustainably low.

Shift towards

Investment rates picked up somewhat in 2005 in developed countries
and were stable overall in emerging market economies. Again, patterns in
emerging Asia diverged. In China, the national investment rate rose by another
percentage point. Investment rates in other emerging Asian economies
remained broadly unchanged, leaving gross fixed capital formation at much
lower levels than before the Asian crisis.
Investment activity in the advanced economies shifted from residential
towards corporate fixed capital formation. Residential investment growth in
OECD countries moderated to 31/2 %, compared to 61/2 % in 2004. Corporate
capital spending remained firm in the United States and picked up in a number
of other economies, including Japan and the Nordic countries, commodity
exporters such as Australia and Canada, and parts of the euro area, including
Belgium and Germany. By contrast, corporate investment remained relatively
weak in the United Kingdom and declined in Italy.

Corporate profits and investment
Further rise in
corporate profits

Corporate profits increased further in 2005 and appear to have reached historical
highs as a percentage of global GDP. The forces behind the boom in corporate
profits in recent years seem to be of a global nature, although sector-specific
developments have also played their part. Operating margins have risen across
non-financial sectors during the past few years (Table II.5). This increase lifted
operating margins in many industries above the levels of the second half of
the 1990s. Especially in commodity-related sectors, margins are now much
higher. While pricing power in many sectors remained limited, a substantial
and broad-based decline in labour costs supported higher operating margins.
The fact that profits have risen even more during the current upswing is to an

important degree attributable to much lower interest expenses, another global
development.
Record profits, high cash levels and low interest rates have not prompted
record corporate investment. Corporate fixed capital formation recovered in
2005 and, in real terms, grew in advanced economies broadly in line with
previous cycles. But the relatively weak investment in the early phase of the
current upswing seems to have led to a cumulative shortfall in capital
formation. Indeed, corporate investment as a share of GDP remained low in
the G3 economies by past standards (Graph II.9). The fact that, in most of the
sectors shown in Table II.5, fixed assets accounted for a significantly smaller
share of all corporate assets in 2004–05 than in the second half of the 1990s
confirms the notion of relative investment weakness.
That nominal investment/GDP ratios are still low in most advanced
economies remains a puzzle. Part of the explanation could be the fall in the
relative price of business fixed investment. For instance, in Japan and the
United States the relative price of capital goods has declined by between 25
and 40% since 1980. This would lead to lower nominal investment rates to the
extent that the relative price effect is not offset by capital deepening.
Changes in the structure of economic activity could be another factor
behind lower measured investment. Intangible assets, such as brand values
and business processes, apparently play a larger role in production now than
in the previous decade. However, such investments might not be well captured
statistically. In addition, the globalisation of production processes could have
lowered investment rates in advanced economies. Indeed, foreign direct
investment has been strong, especially in China, but it is not clear whether
this is a substitute for investment in the home country. In the case of US
multinational firms, vertical international integration seems to involve a
combination of higher domestic and foreign investment instead of a simple
relocation of domestic production.

High hurdle rates of investment relative to expected returns may have
deterred corporate management from expanding capacity in some sectors.
One element behind this could be shareholder demands for high returns.
Another possible factor is doubts about the sustainability of the boom in
specific markets that are keeping expected returns on investment low. Indeed,
investment in the oil industry seems to have been relatively weak globally,
despite the sharp increase in profits in this sector in the past few years.
Related to this, it is not clear how quickly the legacy of past overinvestment
is fading. On the one hand, investment in some IT sectors has rebounded in
the past two years. More generally, the balance sheet deleveraging that
occurred as a reaction to difficult financing conditions associated with the 2001
equity market collapse and the subsequent tightening of corporate governance
seems to have run its course. Debt/equity ratios have fallen in the major
advanced economies (Graph II.10). On the other hand, the global boom in
leveraged buyouts in 2005 indicates a greater interest in buying existing fixed
assets than in creating new ones.

Notwithstanding somewhat slower growth in 2005, residential investment

residential investment as a share of GDP was about 9%, almost 3 percentage
points higher than the average of the previous 10 years. Germany and Japan,
in contrast, are notable exceptions to the picture of above average residential
investment rates in advanced economies.

Table II.6

Residential construction remained the main factor behind the most recent
upswing in the US construction sector, which continued into early 2006. The
Spanish construction sector is currently in its 13th consecutive year of
expansion. This growth has been driven (as well as financed) to a considerable
extent by external sources, mainly retiring baby boomers from northern Europe
buying second homes on the Mediterranean coast.
Over the past two decades, the construction sector (including residential
and commercial construction) in the major industrial economies went through
several cycles. Periods of strong activity tended to be fairly long, with upswings
in the sample of countries shown in Table II.6 lasting from four to 10 years or
more. During these periods, the construction sector easily contributed 10–15%
to the overall growth of GDP, accounted for up to 10% of the total output of
the economy at the peak of the cycle, and employed up to 13% of the total
workforce. In the United States, for instance, the construction sector expanded
on average by 8 1/2 % per year during the 1983–86 boom, contributing 9% to the
growth of GDP during that period. The 1990s construction boom was less
pronounced, although in terms of employment the sector’s role increased
somewhat. Construction booms also have positive effects on related industries
such as real estate and leasing services. During 1983–86, for example, the
share of these services grew by 0.7% of GDP in the United States.
Just as the upswings in the construction industry tended to be long, so the
downswings were also often protracted and severe. In Germany, Japan, Spain
and the United States, real output in the construction sector contracted by
13–21% during the major downturns of the past three decades, and sectoral
employment declined by up to 20%.
The most recent downturns in Germany and Japan were particularly
severe. In Germany, sectoral output and employment both contracted by 30%
between 1994 and 2004. Only in the course of 2005 were there tentative signs
of a revival in building activity. Likewise, the construction industry in Japan

has yet to recover after the bursting of the property bubble in 1990. Real output
in the construction sector also declined by almost 30% between 1990 and 2003.
Employment did increase slightly, however, as many construction workers
were engaged in public sector projects that formed part of expansionary
fiscal policies during the 1990s. Even so, the effects of the downturn on
macroeconomic aggregates such as private consumption were clearly felt, as
construction workers’ wages were cut significantly.
A slowdown in housing market activity and lower house price inflation
would also imply less support for consumer expenditure through other
channels. First, housing wealth grows more slowly (or even declines). Second,
and related to this, the capacity to liquefy housing equity through borrowing
against housing collateral diminishes. Australia, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom have experienced episodes of slowing house price inflation. In
all three cases, this coincided with a substantial weakening of real consumption
growth (Graph II.11).
However, at least in Australia and the United Kingdom, the impact of
slowing house price increases on consumption has been weaker than many had
expected. Indeed, in both countries changes in real house prices in the first half
of the current decade accounted for less of the fluctuation in real consumption
than during the previous 25 years. One explanation might be that households,
to some degree, anticipated a correction in sharply rising house prices.
Another could be that, in the more recent environment of solid growth and
low unemployment, households in Australia and the United Kingdom revised
spending plans down to a lesser degree than, for instance, Dutch households
during the economic downturn in 2001–03. Finally, while house prices levelled off
in Australia and the United Kingdom, they did not fall significantly in real terms.
The possible effect of slowing housing market activity on aggregate
demand remains subject to considerable uncertainty. The current housing
boom has been unusual in terms of its duration, size and the international
co-movement of prices. House prices have risen sharply not only in many
advanced, but also in many emerging economies, including China and Korea.

Moreover, the current boom has coincided with a secular change in financing
possibilities in many countries. On the supply side, a wider array of loan
contracts has been offered to house owners. Consequently, borrowing against
housing collateral has become cheaper and more readily available, which
has allowed new categories of households to enter the housing market. In
particular, sub-prime lending has increased significantly in countries where it
is allowed. However, low interest rates have thus far kept the debt service
burden in check, despite rising debt levels (Graph II.10).

Fiscal policy
Although the public finance outturns in 2005 were generally better than
expected a year ago, fiscal deficits in many advanced economies remained
high. Reflecting favourable cyclical developments, headline deficits were
reduced by about 1% of GDP in the United States and Japan and by about
1/2 percentage point in the euro area (Table II.7). Structural budget deficits,
which remove cyclical effects from headline deficit figures, also declined,
but in many countries remained at levels that indicate the need for further
fundamental fiscal adjustment.
The improvement in the US headline fiscal position came as a result of
strong revenue growth, with corporate income tax receipts increasing
particularly sharply, and relatively tight controls on non-discretionary spending.
The deficit is expected to remain more or less unchanged in 2006, reflecting
less buoyant revenue growth as well as the costs of post-hurricane rebuilding
and ongoing military operations overseas.
In the euro area, modest real growth helped improve revenue ratios
slightly, while expenditure ratios stayed broadly stable. Yet deficits remained

Prospects for fiscal

remain uncertain

above the 3% reference value in four euro area countries (including Germany
and Italy), while in France they were close to that threshold. Budget plans for
2006 imply basically no fiscal tightening in the euro area, in an environment
in which economic activity is projected to accelerate towards potential.
In Japan, the headline deficit declined faster than expected, from over
8% of GDP in 2002–03 to slightly above 5% in 2005. The improvement
reflected stronger than expected corporate and income tax revenues and
some expenditure savings in the supplementary budget. In cyclically adjusted
terms, the deficit dropped below 5% of GDP. However, a decade of high
deficits has left Japan with gross public debt of over 170% of GDP, by far the
highest among the major industrial economies. Net debt is substantially
lower but, at around 85% of GDP, is still far higher than in most other
advanced economies.
Beyond 2006, in many cases it remains uncertain whether there will be
major progress towards fiscal consolidation. In the United States, the
authorities have announced their intention to bring the federal deficit down
to about 11/2 % of GDP by 2009, although specific policy changes to achieve
this objective have yet to be confirmed. In the euro area, fiscal tightening is
intended at only a measured pace. A key issue is how strictly the revised
Stability and Growth Pact will be enforced. While views on this differ,
most policymakers argue that the new rules have weakened the “corrective
arm” of the pact (ie the excessive deficit procedure) and will provide for
somewhat greater flexibility in the use of fiscal policy. Germany plans to
reduce its deficit to below 3% of GDP in 2007, largely through a 3 percentage
point increase in the VAT rate. In Japan, the authorities have decided to bring
forward the target date for achieving primary balance by one year to fiscal
year 2011. Again, however, specific policies to achieve this target have yet to
be elaborated.

United States and the euro area since 2001, and in Japan since the late 1980s.
In fact, in the most recent period of rapid expansion in the euro area, structural
budget deficits increased (Graph II.12). In the United States, structural budget
deficits declined during the latest period of strong growth (2002–05), but much
less than in the 1990s expansion.
The persistence of large budget deficits even in an environment of strong
global growth and low interest rates has raised concerns about the long-term
sustainability of public finances in the major industrial countries. These
concerns are aggravated by looming budgetary pressures due to expenditures
required to sustain an ageing population, and the associated prospect of
lower potential growth.
Population ageing will increasingly affect fiscal sustainability over the
coming decades. Public spending on old-age pensions is forecast to rise in the
countries shown in Table II.7, by almost 3% of GDP on average by 2050. However,
the projected increase in pension spending varies considerably across countries;

relative to 2000, the ratio of old-age pensions to GDP would decrease in Italy
and the United Kingdom, but would go up by 8 percentage points in Spain.
Public spending on health and long-term care looks set to increase
massively. OECD projections suggest that, in the absence of policy action,
public spending on these items in the major industrial countries shown in
Table II.7 could surge from an average 7% of GDP in 2005 to 13% in 2050.
Moreover, in contrast to pensions, the predicted rise in health and longterm care spending is fairly uniform across countries. Even in a scenario
that embodies the assumed effects of policies to curb the growth of these
expenditures, average spending on health and long-term care would still go
up by 31/2 percentage points, to reach 10 1/2 % of GDP on average by 2050.
These projections all assume relatively favourable macroeconomic
conditions. Slower than expected growth of national income would quicken
the pace of deterioration in underlying fiscal positions. The euro area and
Japan would also have to expect a significant fall in the average potential GDP
growth rate, if the effect of population ageing is not offset by later retirement
and accelerated productivity growth. This in turn underscores the need for
structural reforms. The United States may be in a more favourable position in
this respect. It is expected to be less affected by the slowdown in population
growth and has exhibited consistently stronger productivity growth over the
past decade.
The seriousness of the public debt problem has to some degree been
masked by the low level of long-term interest rates. Government net interest
payments declined by 0.6 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2005
in the United States, and by 0.8 percentage points in the euro area. In Japan,
debt servicing costs fell by 0.2 percentage points of GDP over this period,
despite a massive increase in public debt. A sharper than expected rise in longterm interest rates would thus complicate the choices that fiscal policymakers
must make to set public finances on a sustainable path. In this regard, the
United States is in a less favourable position than other countries because of
the low national saving rate.

Changing

surpluses

Global current account imbalances continued to widen in 2005. The external
payment deficit of the United States reached $800 billion in 2005, or 61/2% of
GDP, an increase of almost $140 billion within one year (Table II.8). While the
euro area recorded broadly neutral external payments, the current account
positions of individual member countries widened sharply: Germany’s surplus
rose to more than $110 billion (4% of GDP) at the same time as Spain’s deficit
jumped to almost $85 billion (71/2% of GDP). The Japanese surplus remained
large, at about $170 billion or 31/2% of GDP. Several smaller European economies,
such as Norway and Switzerland, also ran large surpluses.
Higher energy prices were again a key factor explaining widening external
imbalances in 2005. The oil trade balance of advanced oil-importing countries
deteriorated in the order of 11/2 % of their GDP. In the case of the United States,
net energy imports increased by $70 billion last year, almost the same amount
as the total increase in merchandise exports; energy now accounts for one
third of the US trade deficit.
Higher energy prices also led to a major shift in the composition of
external surpluses. The collective surplus of oil-exporting countries grew to
about $420 billion in 2005, compared to less than $90 billion in 2002 before oil

prices had started to rise. High oil prices had an even stronger impact on
oil-importing emerging economies, which typically have a higher oil intensity
of output. For instance, China’s oil trade balance deteriorated by 4% of GDP
between 2002 and 2005. Even so, the aggregate current account surplus of oilimporting emerging economies continued to expand, reaching $170 billion in
2005, compared with about $90 billion in 2002. China’s external payments
surplus jumped to $160 billion (7% of GDP) on the back of unabated export
growth and a marked slowdown in import growth. Latin America as a whole
also recorded a growing surplus as a number of countries benefited from both
rising commodity prices and a higher volume of exports (see Chapter III).

Global rebalancing and oil revenue recycling
The traditional forces that might favour external adjustment provided little
support to, or even worked against, global rebalancing in the period under
review. The US dollar appreciated by 4% in real effective terms in the course
of 2005 while the yen depreciated (see Chapter V). Emerging Asian currencies
appreciated moderately, but insufficiently to trigger a substantial change in trade
flows. Appreciating real effective exchange rates contributed to persistently
high external deficits in Australia (6% of GDP) and New Zealand (9% of GDP).
The growth differential between the United States and other major advanced
economies, though narrowing in the course of the year, remained significant
and supportive of the dollar. Finally, low long-term real interest rates continued
to underpin strong household demand growth (including residential investment)
in the United States and elsewhere.
In addition, external adjustment to the current oil price shock might take
longer than in the late 1970s. At that time, the large current account surpluses
of oil exporters were reversed within a few years. Fearful of rising inflation
and inflation expectations, monetary authorities tightened policy sharply. This
led to a recession in oil-importing economies, and in turn to a collapse in
oil demand. This time, however, contained overall inflation has allowed the
monetary response to be much more moderate. Accordingly, global growth
and oil demand have remained strong.
Oil-exporting countries apparently spent a smaller proportion of oil
revenues on imports in 2005 than in the previous two years, and less than at
the time of the previous oil shocks. In 2005, the trade surplus of oil exporters
jumped to more than $450 billion, equivalent to more than half of total oil
revenues (Graph II.13). The primarily oil-exporting emerging economies,
which accounted for the lion’s share of this increase, spent only about half
of the rise in oil receipts on additional imports of goods and services. The
comparable figure in 2003 and 2004, and on average during the previous oil
shocks, had been about three quarters. Identifying and exploiting domestic
investment opportunities in oil-exporting countries may take time – in fact,
more time than effecting a real transfer of resources primarily through higher
consumption expenditures, as was the case in the 1970s.
The way in which oil-exporting countries spend their receipts could also
have an impact on the effectiveness of external adjustment mechanisms.
European countries have probably been main beneficiaries of additional

demand for imports in oil-exporting countries since 2003. China has also
succeeded in increasing its export share, while the United States has suffered
a significant loss. However, the limited data available suggest that much of the
increased surpluses of oil exporters continues to be invested in US securities,
although there has been a significant diversification across asset classes.
These now include a larger proportion of corporate and agency bonds as
well as equities (see Chapter VI). Notwithstanding greater diversification, the
growing size of oil exporters’ investments might still have provided support to
the dollar and helped to keep US long-term interest rates low.

III. Issues in emerging market economies

Highlights
The expansion which has been under way in emerging market economies
since 2002 consolidated further in the period under review. Strong growth in
many countries was accompanied by increasing export values and large current
account surpluses. This permitted a sizeable reduction in external debt burdens
and a further significant build-up of foreign currency reserves. Fiscal positions
also improved, and balance sheet positions strengthened. Partly reflecting
these factors, consumer and investor confidence remained buoyant. In contrast
with previous experience, domestic demand proved remarkably resilient to
higher oil prices even in oil-importing countries.
External conditions have been unusually favourable to emerging market
economies in the current cycle. These include strong global demand, large
terms-of-trade improvements for many countries and much easier external
financing. One major question is whether the authorities in emerging markets
have adequately exploited these favourable circumstances to secure lasting
improvements in fiscal positions. A second question concerns imbalances that
might raise inflation risks or lead to unsustainable increases in asset prices.
While inflation has, so far, remained well contained in many countries,
prospects are uncertain in the light of volatile commodity prices and very low
or negative real short-term interest rates. A bout of turbulence in financial
markets in May 2006 has added to this uncertainty. A major challenge for the
monetary authorities in many countries is how to avoid policy mistakes that
might put macroeconomic and financial stability at risk.

Macroeconomic overview
Growth was robust in all regions last year (Table III.1). Moreover, in China
revised GDP figures reveal that previous growth rates had been significantly
underestimated. Growth accelerated in India; Korea successfully emerged from
the 2003 credit card debacle; and much of Southeast Asia continued to grow at
a strong rate. In Latin America, notwithstanding some slowdown, the expansion
remained intact, and industrial output rebounded in Brazil and Mexico in early
2006. Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru all continued to see above trend
growth. The expansion also remained strong in central and eastern Europe,
although Hungary and Turkey had to deal with increased market volatility
following the financial turbulence which began in Iceland in the early part of
2006. Growth was robust in much of the Middle East and Africa under the
influence of higher commodity prices, especially oil.

Table III.1

Pattern of demand
External demand
remained
important …

External demand continued to play an important role in a number of countries
(Graph III.1). In general, demand for emerging market exports remained very
strong while improved terms of trade played a special role in commodityexporting countries. Moreover, the export performance of Asian economies
was helped in particular by an end to the inventory-led slowdown in the
electronics sector which had begun in 2004. Compared to earlier downturns,
firms have been relatively quick this time in reducing their excess inventories.
In addition, the slowdown in the global demand for high-tech products proved
to be only temporary. The combined effects of these developments were
reflected in strong exports and large current account surpluses in many
countries.
Nevertheless, the contribution of external demand to growth varied across
countries. The contribution rose particularly sharply in China last year and
remained substantial in Hong Kong SAR, Korea and Singapore. This was also
true in several central European economies, notably the Czech Republic and
Poland, which saw a significant improvement in their trade balances. By
contrast, the contribution of net external demand declined in several oilimporting Asian economies and Latin America.

In all regions, growth was supported by strong household spending.
Robust private consumption was supplemented, in many countries, by increased
spending on residential construction. Two factors played an important role.
First, household spending and consumer confidence were boosted by
rising incomes, falling unemployment and high asset prices. In China, for
instance, household spending was underpinned by robust growth in both
urban and rural incomes (of 91/2% and 6%, respectively, in real per capita
terms in 2005). A rebound in agricultural income and improved household
balance sheets, respectively, played a similar role in India and Korea. In
Hong Kong, the recovery was associated with a rebound in asset prices. In
Latin America, similar income and wealth effects were supported by large
improvements in the terms of trade (see the next section). In Argentina and
Chile, private consumption was driven last year by strong increases in real

wages, which also played a role in several central and eastern European
economies. In the Czech Republic, the demand for consumer durables picked
up on the back of strong household income. In Turkey, household spending
on consumer durables continued to rise against a background of declining
inflation and interest rates.
Second, a rapid expansion in bank lending provided a further boost to
household spending. This has been reflected in a sharply rising ratio of
outstanding household credit to GDP in many countries over the past few years
(Graph III.2). A major factor boosting such credit has been the low borrowing
costs associated with continuing easy monetary policies (see the section on
monetary policy). Other contributing factors have been a decline in inflation, a
progressive deregulation of credit markets, tax rebates to home buyers and farreaching financial innovations attracting an increasing number of households
to mortgage markets.
In Brazil, lending to households surged last year (by 37%) following the
introduction of a payroll guarantee scheme that effectively protects banks
against default risk. In Saudi Arabia, a rapidly growing young population, and
the fact that banks can now recover their debts by attaching wage payments,
contributed to a similar rate of credit expansion.
In contrast to robust household spending, non-residential investment –
particularly capital spending by the corporate sector – remained relatively
weak (Table III.2) in most regions. This was especially true in Asia, where nonresidential investment as a percentage of GDP either continued to fall or remained
far below the levels seen prior to the 1997–98 Asian financial crises. China has

been a major exception to this trend. In India, strong profits and rising equity
prices have also been associated with a revival of investment more generally.
The fact that non-residential investment in several parts of Asia has been
weak despite strong profits and improved balance sheets has surprised many
observers. Nevertheless, various indicators suggest that some of the previous
constraints on corporate spending have eased over the past several years. For
example, firms have substantially lowered their leverage ratios since the
1997–98 crises. In Korea, the debt/equity ratio was cut by about two thirds to
111% between 1998 and 2005. Moreover, excess capacity has been substantially
reduced or eliminated, and the flow of bank credit to the corporate sector has
improved. Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, for instance, saw substantial
increases in non-residential investment last year.
In Latin America, the picture was more mixed, with investment being
particularly volatile in Brazil. After recording an annual rate of over 10% in
2004, real investment growth in Brazil fell to 2% in 2005. In Mexico, the recent
weakness in non-residential investment has been associated with a loss in
the competitiveness of the export sector. For instance, Mexico’s share in US
imports declined by about 11/2 percentage points between 2001 and 2005. By
contrast, non-residential capital spending has rebounded in Argentina over the
past two years. In central and eastern Europe, investment ratios have fallen
over the past five years, partly reflecting weak non-residential investment.

Rising inflation pressures
Strong growth and rising commodity prices put upward pressure on prices in
all regions. Nevertheless, despite these pressures inflation remained well
contained in most countries last year (Table III. 3). In China, output growth was
particularly strong but was associated with very low measured inflation. In India
and Korea, headline inflation softened towards the end of last year, after rising
significantly in 2004. In several countries in Asia, inflation movements were
affected by the timing of the withdrawal of oil subsidies. As for Latin America,
inflation was on a downward path in Brazil and Mexico in much of the second
half of 2005. In Chile, underlying inflation remained subdued, although headline
inflation did rise towards the end of 2005. In contrast, Argentina and Venezuela
continued to experience relatively high rates of inflation. In central Europe,
inflation declined in most countries last year, reflecting not only exchange rate
appreciation but also increased competition at the retail level. Turkey’s inflation
fell again last year, continuing a longer-term trend.

Inflation low but
pressures rising

Outlook and risks
Forecasts for 2006 are for continued strong growth or even an acceleration in
most emerging market economies. Nevertheless, most countries are expected
to remain in current account surplus, and inflation is forecast to remain
moderate. Such forecasts are evidently not without some risks.
First, the continued dependence of a large number of countries on exportdriven growth means that they are exposed to volatility in major industrial
economies, as well as in China. Countries that have received a substantial
degree of external financing might also be subject to changes in investor

sentiment. Second, there are some risks from credit-financed household
spending. A too rapid expansion in housing demand might lead to overheating
in the property market, particularly in Asia. Property prices have been rising
in Asia over the past two years, although in several cases (eg Hong Kong,
Singapore and Thailand) they are recovering from a previous downturn. Korea
faced a major challenge in the real estate market last year as property prices
rose sharply in some cities in the first half of 2005. In response, the authorities
introduced a package of stabilisation measures (including higher taxation,
restrictions on mortgage lending for speculative purposes, and additional land
allocation for construction) to cool the real estate market. South Africa has
seen a major upturn in the property market, with residential property prices
increasing by 50% in the past two years.
A third source of vulnerability is that banks in many countries, particularly
in central Europe, have shifted a large part of their risks to the household
sector through lending at variable interest rates or in foreign currency. It is
difficult to assess whether households would be able to withstand unexpected
shocks that could quickly increase their debt burdens. Furthermore, the
experience of Korea in 2003 has demonstrated that the rapid expansion of

household debt, even when denominated in local currency, can generate
significant volatility in consumption and adversely affect future growth.

Two major external challenges
Two important developments over recent years have been large shifts in the
terms of trade of emerging market economies and continued strong demand
for emerging market assets. Such developments have major implications, not
only for growth, but also for the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies.

Shifts in the terms of trade
Swings in relative prices since 2002 have been associated with large termsof-trade movements in emerging market economies. For example, oil prices
in dollar terms almost doubled between 2001 and early 2006, after falling
sharply in the 1990s. Prices of industrial metals and certain agricultural raw
materials also increased rapidly during the same period. At the same time,
world manufacturing prices have strengthened only modestly. As a result,
commodity-exporting countries have seen some of the largest improvements
to their terms of trade in recent years (Graph III.3, left-hand panel). By contrast,
countries with a significant concentration of exports in manufactures or
services, and large oil import requirements, have suffered substantial termsof-trade losses.
The impact of terms-of-trade changes has also varied across commodityexporting countries. Strong terms-of-trade improvements have been associated
with higher current account surpluses in several Latin American countries
(Graph III.3, right-hand panel). Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela
have all benefited from large increases in the prices of their main commodity
exports. Gains from higher export prices have also been substantial in other
regions, particularly oil-exporting economies like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Graph III.4

At the same time, many countries with improved terms of trade have
also benefited from a large increase in export volumes. This has applied not
only to commodity exports, but also to a broad spectrum of manufactures
and services. For example, while the export prices of Argentina’s primary
commodities fell by 9% last year, this was more than offset by a 27% rise in
export volumes. Nevertheless, in some other commodity-exporting countries,
increased imports and other payments far exceeded export growth, resulting
in a net deterioration of the current account. This was the case in South Africa,
which saw a record current account deficit of over 4% of GDP last year.
There is some evidence to suggest that the adverse impact of terms-oftrade losses on commodity-importing countries has been more limited than
expected, notably in Asia, where dependence on oil tends to be rather high.
Despite a major deceleration last year, export growth remained strong in most
of Asia (Graph III.4), helping to offset terms-of-trade losses. In effect, part of
the additional revenues of oil-exporting countries was recycled back to the
Asian region through the trade sector. Indeed, the exports of Asia (excluding
Japan) to oil-exporting countries rose by 27% during the first half of 2005. The
net result was that many Asian economies continued to enjoy large current
account surpluses.
One question concerns the sustainability of the recent shift in the terms of
trade, against the historical background of the high volatility of commodity
prices. On the one hand, it is possible that strong global growth will lead to yet
further increases in the demand for commodities. The continued buoyancy of
the Chinese economy points in this direction. Last year, China accounted for
over 57% of the incremental demand for aluminium, 60% of that for copper
and over 30% of that for oil. Such a trend could be reinforced in the future by
a major expansion of Indian demand for oil and other commodities. On the
other hand, past experience suggests that the prices of non-oil commodities
have been more volatile and have a stronger tendency to revert to the mean
than does the price of oil. This may be partly due to differences in market
structure, given that the cartelised structure of the oil market facilitates control

of supply. In contrast, in other markets (especially those for agricultural
commodities), supply conditions are more responsive to price levels. Higher
real prices of commodities could still dampen future demand, especially when
technological innovation leads to more efficient use of commodity inputs.

Strong demand for emerging market assets
The demand for emerging market assets strengthened during the period under
review. Net private capital flows reached about $254 billion in 2005, distinctly
up from 2004 (Table III.4), and well above the levels prevailing in 1998–2002.
Sizeable flows appear to have continued in the first quarter of 2006,
although there has been some recent volatility.
Net capital flows to central Europe and Latin America increased
significantly in 2005, although net private flows to Asia halved. Portfolio
investment and other private flows explain most of the changes in private
capital flows by region. In Asia, net portfolio investment reversed direction,
resulting in outflows in 2005 (at least partly reflecting substantial gross
outflows) while other private flows (which include cross-border bank lending)
also fell.
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) is still the most important component
of net capital flows and reached $212 billion in 2005, a moderate increase from
2004. Its regional distribution in 2005 was also similar to that a year earlier:
$72 billion to Asia, $51 billion to Latin America and $41 billion to central and
eastern Europe, with the remainder distributed evenly between Africa and the
Middle East. In some cases, gross inflows were larger than net inflows, reflecting
growing FDI outflows from emerging economies. Several multinational firms
based in emerging economies now have large positions abroad. For example,
in 2004 the FDI stock abroad exceeded $100 billion for both Singapore (104%
of GDP) and Russia (18%), and amounted to $69 billion for Brazil (11.5%) and
$32–38 billion for China (2.4%), South Africa (18%) and Korea (4.7%).
Net inflows differ considerably across regions and economies. In central
and eastern Europe, where economic integration with the rest of Europe
continued to advance, net inflows exceeded 6% of GDP. By contrast, they were
much lower in Latin America. Only a small group of countries had relatively
large current account deficits and a corresponding need for large capital
inflows: Hungary, South Africa and Turkey stood out in this regard. Other
countries with current account deficits are India, Mexico and Poland.
Under current conditions, it remains unclear how far increased capital
flows to emerging market economies reflect easy conditions in developed
financial markets (so-called “push” factors), due to developments in policy or
market sentiment. Earlier fears that monetary policy tightening in the United
States would lead to shifts out of emerging market assets proved unfounded,
at least prior to May 2006, when equity prices in many countries fell sharply.
Indeed, sovereign bond spreads continued to fall even as US policy rates were
steadily increased during 2004 and 2005 (Graph III.5, panel A). Sovereign
spreads for several Latin American borrowers have narrowed. Central and
eastern Europe has also registered sustained improvements. The sovereign
spreads of crisis-hit Asian countries, which rose to an average of 830 basis

points in the wake of the crisis, have now fallen, but are still above those of
mid-1997 (Graph III.5, panel B). Nevertheless, it remains to be seen what the
effects of concerted monetary tightening in the major industrial countries
might be.
Still with regard to “push” factors, a number of explanations could be
offered for declining sovereign spreads. One is the growing diversification of
portfolios to include emerging market securities. Another is that conditions
in developed bond markets remain highly liquid. This held down yields on

long-term US bonds during 2005, encouraging a search for yield. While
this effect has diminished in 2006 with the rise in US long-term rates, it is
noteworthy that the spread on US high-yield bonds stabilised towards the
end of the period under review while that for emerging market bonds continued
to fall (Graph III.5, panel A). Such a development cannot then be attributed
solely to global financial conditions but must also reflect investors’ assessment
that the underlying risks in holding emerging market debt have changed for
the better (for additional perspective, see Chapter VI).
Turning to the “pull” factors driving capital inflows, economic fundamentals
have improved in four key ways in this decade. The first is that economic
reforms and deeper integration with the world economy have lifted growth rates
in most countries relative to those in the major developed market economies
(Graph III.5, panel C). The effects of EU accession by countries in central and
eastern Europe, an increased trade orientation in Latin America and the
growing integration of China and India into the global economy have stimulated
growth in the countries concerned and have also boosted demand for goods
produced by other emerging market economies.
The second improvement is that current account surpluses have enabled
several countries to reduce their net external indebtedness. Foreign reserves
have increased and external debt has been repaid, with a particular focus on
official or restructured debt. In some cases, external debt has been reduced by
drawing on foreign reserves. For example, Russia cleared its debt to the IMF
and paid $15 billion to the Paris Club of official creditor countries last year. In
December 2005, Brazil paid off $15.5 billion owed to the IMF and Paris Club
debt of $2.6 billion; in April 2006, it paid off its Brady bond debt (albeit partly
funded by new external debt). Argentina has also repaid its outstanding debt
to the international financial institutions (Graph III.5, panel D). In April 2006,
Nigeria became the first African country to eliminate its Paris Club debt,
totalling $30 billion; $12.4 billion was repaid and the remaining debt was
forgiven. An important domestic counterpart of growing current account
surpluses and external debt repayment has been significant increases in
national saving rates. One notable example is that the saving rate in Latin
America as a whole rose to 22% of GDP in 2005, compared with around 17%
of GDP in the early 2000s.
A third improvement is that currency mismatches have been reduced
(Graph III.5, panel E). The currency of denomination of international bank
lending has progressively shifted towards the use of local currencies.
Governments and other borrowers in capital markets have reduced their
reliance on foreign currency debt as they have issued more domestic paper.
According to BIS statistics, the total amount outstanding of domestic bonds and
notes issued by borrowers in Latin America rose from $228 billion in 2000 to
$379 billion in 2005; external debt securities fell by $17 billion over the same
period. The proportion of exchange rate-indexed debt in domestic debt markets
has declined in a number of important cases. For example, in Brazil the share
of such indexed debt in total public debt fell from 37% in 2002 to 2.3% by the
first quarter of 2006. Domestic debt markets have also deepened, with
international trading of domestic debt instruments rising sharply. Significantly,

BIS 76th Annual Report

45

there also appears to have been a gradual extension of the maturity structure
of domestic government debt in some countries. The greater depth of local
currency debt markets offers global investors new means of considerably
improving returns. Because domestic bond yields in emerging markets appear
to respond more to domestic factors, and have comparatively low correlations
with yields in developed markets or in other emerging markets, such paper
also offers diversification opportunities.
A fourth change is that the financial positions both of the non-financial
corporate sector and of banks have strengthened in recent years. Corporate
leverage ratios have fallen, and there has been a significant and broad-based
improvement in banking systems. Banks’ returns on assets have grown, and
a number of indicators suggest that the quality of banks’ balance sheets has
risen. Another simple indicator is that the ratio of bank stock price indices to
overall stock indices – which fell sharply during the crises of the late 1990s –
has recovered (Graph III.5, panel F).
In short, current account surpluses and reduced net external indebtedness,
combined with substantial improvements in growth, national balance sheet
positions and banking systems, have supported a strong revival of foreign
demand for emerging market assets. At the same time, it must be recognised
that new conditions pose certain risks. While domestic bond market
development can impose discipline on fiscal authorities by signalling market
concerns about inappropriate policies, it could in some cases increase the
temptation to resort to inflationary financing. Moreover, the changing exposures
of domestic investors could influence financial stability. On the one hand, the
increase in local institutional investors is beneficial for market development
and the diversification of risks. On the other hand, there is evidence that
holdings of domestic government bonds in some countries are concentrated
in the portfolios of banks, exposing them to significant interest rate risk.

… and improved

But risks remain

Fiscal policy
The improvements in the terms of trade and the easy availability of financing
for emerging market economies, as well as the robust economic performance
of the global economy, raise the question of whether these countries have
taken adequate advantage of these favourable conditions to improve their fiscal
positions, and in particular to reduce their public debt. Debt reduction should
be a priority in emerging market economies since most of them appear to
be “debt intolerant”. That is, levels of debt that are readily maintained by
developed countries appear to leave emerging markets still exposed to
possible financial stress.

How much fiscal adjustment?
Fiscal positions have moved towards surplus in recent years; the improvement
in the median headline balance in the sample (Graph III.6) was 2.3 percentage
points of GDP between 2002 and 2005. Changes among oil exporters have
been particularly large, while those in Asia have been more limited than in
other regions in the past two years. In the sample of countries in the graph,

budget surpluses have generally been maintained by countries with already
low debt ratios (eg Chile, Korea and Thailand), and particularly by oil exporters
(eg Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela). Nevertheless, most emerging
market economies still have significant fiscal deficits, with the median being
1.6% in 2005.
The median interest payment in emerging market economies has fallen,
in some regions considerably. Interest rate declines have been particularly
dramatic in Argentina and Turkey. In general, countries have taken advantage
of easier financing conditions by issuing new debt on better terms. In some
cases, this has facilitated the prepayment or buyback of existing higher-cost
public debt. In others, countries have been able to prefinance their debt
requirements at the lower rates that have prevailed in recent quarters. It is
estimated that emerging market borrowers had met nearly half of their 2006
financing needs by the end of January 2006.
The trend in primary balances (which exclude interest payments) is perhaps
a better guide for assessing the durability of recent fiscal developments
(Graph III.6, centre panel). The primary surplus has increased sharply among oil
exporters, but has also risen in other regions. To illustrate, in Russia and Saudi
Arabia the primary balance over 2004–05 averaged around 8% and 16% of GDP
respectively. Primary balances were also large (ranging from around 2 to 7%
of GDP) in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Turkey. In contrast, a primary deficit can
still be observed in India, although this too has been falling over time.

Issues in revenue and expenditure adjustment
Some of the recent improvement in primary balances reflects temporary or
cyclical factors, raising concerns that a significant reversal in fiscal positions
might occur once unusually favourable global economic and financial
conditions end. While reliable and comparable estimates of structural balances

durability of fiscal adjustment in some heavily indebted emerging market
economies can be obtained by reviewing the extent to which measures are
being adopted to permanently reduce expenditures and raise revenues. Ideally,
such measures would be designed to minimise distortions that could reduce
economic welfare and growth potential.
Many emerging economies find it very difficult to reduce expenditures.
One problem is fixed claims on budgetary resources, including interest
payments on debt, high government wage or pension bills or generous social
security benefits. These are challenges confronting Brazil and Turkey, among
others. In countries like China and India, and also in oil-exporting countries,
increases in revenue associated with rapid economic growth or oil price
windfalls have created pressures to increase wage bills or social spending.
Apart from hampering expenditure reduction, this limits the scope for needed
spending to improve the quality of the civil service or to support priority sectors
such as health, education and infrastructure. As can be seen in Graph III.7,
there has been some tendency for expenditures to rise recently in the emerging
market economies.
The fiscal impact of increases in spending has recently been partly
alleviated by the higher revenue/GDP ratios that are apparent in all regions,
particularly, of course, among oil exporters (Graph III.7, left-hand panel).
The median revenue ratio has risen about 2 percentage points this decade,
to 27.1% of GDP in 2005 (compared to a median ratio of 38% in a set of
developed countries). These revenue gains have in many cases not been
matched by increases in primary expenditures.
One concern is that, despite recent increases, government revenue ratios
are still comparatively low in a number of emerging economies. For example,
revenues are about 18–20% of GDP in India and the Philippines, significantly

below the average of 29% in the United States, where taxes are low compared
to other developed countries.
Another concern is that increases might be reversed in the event of a
cyclical downturn, unless structural reforms are implemented that could bring
about permanent improvements in the fiscal position. In this regard, progress
has been mixed. In the Philippines, for example, a recent extension of the
coverage of value added tax is expected to boost revenues significantly.
Nonetheless, securing fiscal improvements will probably require limiting any
subsequent growth in expenditures. In India, a Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management Law enacted in 2003 has set the goal of balancing the
current (excluding investment) budget by 2008. There has been some progress
in broadening the services tax base. In Turkey, there is a recognised need to
expand the tax base to include the large informal sector and to widen the
coverage of personal and corporate income taxes. These measures, however,
will also take time. In some countries, relatively large revenue/GDP ratios have
been achieved. However, this has often involved the use of highly distortionary
taxes, such as those on financial transactions. A recent study of the use of
such taxes in Brazil reveals that shifting to a less distortionary system could
enhance economic growth without reducing revenues.

Issues raised by commodity price increases

Revenue windfalls
must be saved

Since 2003, sharp increases in commodity prices have posed two major fiscal
challenges. First, a number of oil-importing countries, particularly in Asia,
have had to decide what to do about subsidies designed to reduce the cost
of energy. Rising oil prices have increased the cost of such subsidies and
have exacerbated the distortions that arise from shielding consumers (and
sometimes firms) from price changes. In some cases, subsidy costs have
largely been shifted to public oil companies which are not allowed to raise
retail prices. Such artificially low prices have led to shortages, tempted local
oil companies to sell abroad and encouraged smuggling. Countries have
responded by lifting these subsidies. For example, Thailand ended fuel
subsidies in 2005, while India and Indonesia reduced them significantly,
causing a jump in fuel prices. As discussed below, the rising costs of fiscal
subsidies and efforts to reduce them have complicated the conduct of
monetary policy by sharply increasing headline inflation.
Second, producers should respond with prudence to the fiscal impact of
commodity price windfalls that cannot be sustained. Because high prices are
likely to be temporary, efforts have to be made to limit expenditure increases in
response since these are more likely to be of a permanent nature. This would
also mitigate undesirable procyclicality in government spending. Moreover, in
the case of oil and other non-renewable commodities, the non-commodity
primary deficit should be set so that part of the earnings from commodities
can be invested in financial assets. The return on these assets can then fund
spending once the commodity has been exhausted. Stabilisation funds taking in
the revenue from commodity price windfalls operate in a number of countries,
including Chile and Russia. In 2005, Mexico also enacted legislation that would
use oil price windfalls to fund investment spending by state-owned enterprises,

BIS 76th Annual Report

49

particularly the oil company, Pemex, and to enlarge substantially an oil
stabilisation fund. However, efforts to establish or operate such funds have
posed challenges in a number of countries. For example, in Venezuela a
macroeconomic stabilisation fund was significantly depleted after a major oil
production strike in 2002. While oil revenue windfalls have partly been used
to accumulate reserves and pay down debt, the fund has not been recently
replenished. Instead, significant amounts of resources are being allocated to
finance current spending.
The fiscal issues raised by such windfalls are illustrated by the recent
experience of Russia, which has dramatically improved its net financial asset
position. Russia’s gross public debt has fallen sharply, from 96% of GDP in
1999 to a projected 14% in 2005. In part, this reflected prepayment of debt,
notably to the IMF and the Paris Club last year. In addition, an oil stabilisation
fund, established in 2004, had accumulated $43 billion by the end of 2005.
Primary surpluses have also risen, from 2.7% of GDP in 2002 to close to 8.7%
in 2005. While large primary surpluses have alleviated pressures on aggregate
demand arising from the windfall, fiscal policy has recently eased considerably.
Proposals for spending a higher proportion of the oil windfall, including through
public sector wage and pension increases, and more infrastructure spending,
raise concerns about exacerbating inflationary pressures. High oil prices could
also weaken the drive for microeconomic reforms, including improvements to
tax administration.

Russia has lowered
its debt

Debt reduction and sustainability
Emerging market economies have generally experienced declines in public
debt ratios in recent years (Graph III.7, right-hand panel). Debt reductions have
been particularly significant in Indonesia, Russia, Turkey and Brazil, and also
in Argentina following the 2005 debt exchange. In contrast, public debt ratios
have remained flat or stable in Asia.
Nevertheless, public debt/GDP ratios in emerging market economies still
have a median value of around 46%, which is high enough to raise concerns
about debt sustainability. Debt ratios are significantly above that median in
India, Argentina, the Philippines, Brazil and Turkey, but below in a number of
Asian economies (eg Korea and Thailand), oil exporters and Chile. Reported
debt ratios are comparatively low in China but fiscal consolidation remains a
priority. Moreover, there are potentially large contingent liabilities in the
financial system and agreed social and development goals will prove costly.
The cases of Turkey and Brazil illustrate some of the challenges posed by
high public debt ratios. In both these countries, economic growth and policy
developments have contributed to large primary surpluses (7% and nearly 5%
of GDP respectively in 2005), while lower interest rates and exchange rate
appreciation have contributed to significant reductions in debt service payments
and debt ratios in this decade. The debt ratio in Turkey fell from a recent peak
of 107% to 73% of GDP in 2005, while in Brazil it fell from 65% to 52%. In both
countries, projections indicate that further debt ratio reductions could occur if
the recent fiscal stance is maintained, assuming there are no sharp slowdowns
in growth or increases in interest rates. But under different assumptions, say

50

BIS 76th Annual Report

Public debt ratios
are down but still
high …

… posing special
challenges

Fiscal deficits in
India are lower

if economic growth and interest rates were set at their historical averages, then
the debt dynamics would become less favourable. The public debt positions
of both Turkey and Brazil are sensitive to shocks to interest rates because the
proportion of short-maturity or interest rate-linked debt remains significant. In
both countries, economic resilience could thus be enhanced by maintaining
policies that have already contributed to debt reduction and strengthened
credibility.
In India, achieving long-run debt sustainability also poses challenges,
although the risks are attenuated by the fact that the government does not
borrow in foreign currency and that banks hold a large proportion of the public
debt without trading it. While there have been significant reductions in the
headline general fiscal deficit in recent years, a projected rate of 7.7% of GDP
in 2005/06 (from 10% of GDP in 2002/03) remains too high.

Monetary and exchange rate policy

Risks of higher
inflation

In the context of robust global demand, the two main shocks affecting emerging
market economies in this period – a further broadly based rise in commodity
prices and an increased demand for emerging market assets – were supportive
of growth. However, both of these developments shift the balance of risks
towards higher inflation, posing challenges for monetary policy. Higher
commodity prices tend to boost inflation directly, for both commodity exporters
and importers, and exporters also receive a large boost to income. Increased
foreign demand for emerging market assets also tends to stimulate aggregate
demand and could be inflationary by loosening financial constraints. The
margin of spare capacity has narrowed; in some cases, labour markets have
tightened. Although inflation has generally remained low, sharp rises have
been recorded in some countries and inflation risks have become increasingly
apparent.

Implications of relative price shocks
Relative price
shocks complicate
policy

High commodity
prices but stable
expectations

The first issue complicating the conduct of monetary policy is the assessment
of relative price shocks. Commodity prices have risen at the same time that
international prices of manufactures have strengthened only modestly (Graph
III.8, left-hand panel). If the commodity shock was expected to reverse, it would
not generally be seen as a major threat to underlying inflation. But longerlasting relative price changes are more of a problem, as is well illustrated by
recent experience. The rise in commodity prices has created a gap between
core and headline inflation that has persisted over an extended period (Graph
III.8, right-hand panel). This raises the question of whether monetary authorities
should assign greater weight to movements in core or headline inflation in
assessing inflation risks and formulating policy.
Two contrasting points need to be considered. First, higher commodity
prices are proving to be remarkably durable (apparently reflecting a continued
strengthening in demand), have already raised headline inflation and could at
some point affect inflation expectations. Second, in spite of this, there are still
no clear signs of higher inflation expectations and associated wage pressures

in a significant number of emerging market economies. There appear to be
structural changes in pricing behaviour in emerging market economies similar
to those observed in developed economies (see Chapter II). In effect, the prices
of goods and services (including wages) seem to have become less prone to
disturbances from specific price shocks, or even swings in capacity utilisation.
These considerations have conflicting implications for policy. On the one
hand, persistent commodity price increases would seem to argue for leaning
against expectations by focusing on headline inflation. On the other hand, if
behaviour has changed significantly, this argues for a more restrained policy
response based on the presumption that headline inflation will in fact fall back
to core levels.
Assessing whether core inflation will rise to headline or headline will fall
to core is complicated. A judgment must be made about the permanent nature
of the commodity price shock, as well as of the changes in the pricing process
that seem to have anchored core prices to date. Concerning this second issue,
China is key, as its inflation is very low even though growth is high enough to
put pressure on global commodity prices. One explanation could be substantial
productivity growth in the manufacturing sector. This could well be a longerlasting phenomenon that will have persistent effects on wages and prices both
in China and elsewhere.
However, China has in the past experienced bouts of inflation after long
periods of rapid growth. Moreover, it may be that inflation in China is actually
rising already but this is masked because the measured price index takes
insufficient account of inflation in services. Finally, inflation pressures already
appear to be significant in a number of emerging market economies.
Against this background of uncertainty, relative price shocks over the
past few years have elicited different policy responses, with a broad tendency
towards tightening. Some commodity producers have focused on headline
rather than core inflation. Policy interest rates in Brazil, Chile and Mexico were

increased comparatively early in the process, preventing erosion in (ex ante)
real interest rates as inflation forecasts edged up (Graph III.9). In contrast, the
real interest rate in Russia has drifted downwards.
In some Asian countries, monetary policy initially focused on core rather
than headline inflation, because policymakers assumed that commodity price
shocks were temporary with little risk of spillover into expectations. However,
policy rates were subsequently raised sharply as the shocks began to look
longer-lasting. In a number of oil-importing countries (eg India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand), subsidies for energy consumers initially weakened
the effects of higher oil prices on the domestic price. However, with commodity
price shocks lasting longer than anticipated, drastic cuts in energy subsidies
were forced in a number of countries by mounting costs (up to 31/2% of GDP
in 2005 in Indonesia’s case). Interest rates were also increased in response to
the risk that inflation expectations might otherwise be affected.
In Indonesia, interest rates were rising ahead of the jump in inflation
associated with the more recent cuts in energy subsidies, but the sharp rise in
measured inflation fed into expectations regardless. A bout of instability
occurred in the currency and domestic bond markets as higher policy rates
triggered withdrawals from mutual funds holding government bonds.
Conditions then stabilised, and the rupiah has since recovered. In Thailand,
where the real rate was negative but inflation had been low, the authorities
increased interest rates rapidly as the spillover to expectations became evident
and inflation rose. In the Philippines, where the real interest rate was higher,
the monetary authorities took longer to raise policy rates in spite of rising
inflation in 2004 due to the influence of supply side factors; inflation stabilised
with increases in the policy rates in 2005 but rose again in 2006.

Responding to exchange rate appreciation pressures
Appreciation
pressures pose
dilemma

The exchange rate often comes under strong upward pressure in countries
where demand is growing strongly, the current account is in surplus (thanks
to terms-of-trade gains) and capital inflows are buoyant. This creates a

BIS 76th Annual Report

53

dilemma for the monetary authorities, who have the option of either allowing
the exchange rate to appreciate, or of trying to prevent appreciation by easing
monetary policy or through intervening in the foreign exchange market.
Allowing the exchange rate to appreciate could mitigate inflation risks,
attenuate the price and income effects of higher commodity prices for
exporters, and reduce pressures on capacity for countries experiencing strong
demand. It could also alleviate the tendency for financial conditions to loosen
in countries experiencing large capital inflows. However, very large or rapid
exchange rate appreciation can raise concerns about the adverse effects on
competitiveness.
Preventing appreciation by easing monetary policy or by intervening in
the foreign exchange market can pose other challenges. For inflation targeting
regimes, an easier monetary policy would only be appropriate if exchange
rate appreciation were expected to lower inflation below target. But this is less
likely to be true if the appreciation is an equilibrating response to expansionary
capital inflows and positive terms-of-trade shocks. Monetary easing under
such conditions could exacerbate inflation risks.
If the exchange rate pressure is judged temporary (eg because certain
capital inflows are expected to reverse or the terms of trade subsequently to
revert to lower levels), sterilised forex intervention might be preferable to easier
monetary policy as a way of preventing an appreciation. Problems build up,
however, the longer intervention is sustained because it then becomes harder
to sterilise, again resulting in an unwanted easing of domestic financial
conditions and a thrust to higher inflation. Moreover, even when fully
sterilised, large-scale intervention could distort domestic financial markets
given the size of the debt issuance required for full sterilisation.

Policy responses and regimes
The resolution of the policy dilemma cited above has varied considerably across
countries and to some extent has depended on how each country’s monetary
policy regime has influenced responses to nominal exchange rate movements.
Some countries, typically those with inflation targeting regimes, have opted for
greater exchange rate flexibility. For example, among commodity exporters
where appreciation pressures would be anticipated due to terms-of-trade gains,
Brazil and Chile experienced significant nominal exchange rate appreciation
between the beginning of 2005 and early 2006. This has been reflected in
significant real effective exchange rate appreciation (Graph III.10). In contrast,
other countries have opted for greater stability in nominal exchange rates,
including Argentina and Russia, which maintain what might be described as
hybrid monetary regimes, and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which have pegged
exchange rates. However, except for Saudi Arabia, real exchange rates have
still appreciated in these countries because of higher inflation. In Russia, the
authorities have acknowledged the need to allow further nominal exchange
rate appreciation in order to counter growing liquidity and to dampen excess
demand.
The authorities in China, and in much of the rest of Asia, have intervened
on a massive scale for several years to moderate appreciation. Continued

heavy intervention took China’s reserves to $875 billion by the end of April
2006. Oil exporters have added substantially to the stock of foreign financial
assets held as official reserves (Table III.5). Elsewhere, the rate of accumulation
of international reserves appears to have slowed from the heady pace recorded
in 2003 and 2004. The extent of sterilisation has varied, but one way of gauging
its potential impact on local financial markets is to measure reserves against
outstanding public debt securities. Where this ratio is large, as in Asia, the
possible distorting effects on domestic financial intermediation deserve close
examination.
A number of countries have begun to use other instruments to help resolve
the policy dilemma cited above. In the Baltic and southeastern European
states, the authorities have resorted to direct instruments, such as increased
reserve requirements and tighter prudential limits. In order to meet the

Maastricht criteria and adhere to ERM II protocols, these countries are
attempting to control inflation and maintain exchange rate stability. However,
the use of direct instruments in these countries raises questions about possible
inefficiencies and costs to the financial system.
While the foregoing has focused on responses to appreciation pressures,
some countries experienced episodes of significant pressures for depreciation
in 2005 or the first quarter of 2006. For example, the Indonesian rupiah
depreciated by 11% against the US dollar in August 2005 due to uncertainty
about the fiscal burden of energy subsidies in the light of higher oil prices; the
rupiah subsequently recovered. The Hungarian forint depreciated between
February and early April 2006, also due to concerns about the fiscal and current
account positions.

Depreciation
pressures

Consequences of policy responses
One question of interest is whether differences in monetary policy regimes, and
in the attention paid to the exchange rate, can be shown to matter in terms of
inflationary outcomes.
As summarised in Table III.6, the answer is mixed. Inflation targeting
regimes, in which the exchange rate has been allowed to float relatively freely,
have typically delivered a moderate rate of inflation. Within this group, Korea
shows few signs of consumer price inflation, while previously high inflation
rates in Brazil and Turkey have successfully been lowered towards target.
Inflation has fallen to within the target range for the first time since it was
introduced in Mexico, and is in the target range in Chile. Both countries
allowed the exchange rate to adjust and increased policy rates early. Similar
outcomes have been observed in Colombia and Peru, which are also inflation
targeting commodity producers.

However, median inflation for countries with fixed exchange rate regimes
was even lower than for inflation targeting regimes. Both China and Saudi
Arabia present interesting puzzles because consumer price inflation in both
economies has remained very low in spite of rapid growth and signs of ample
liquidity. Nevertheless, pegging does not always guarantee low inflation; a
case in point is Venezuela, which maintains a fixed exchange rate and has
experienced double digit inflation.
Inflation was highest in countries with hybrid regimes which have not fully
adopted inflation targeting or have no explicit nominal anchor. Some of these
countries appear to attach a high weight to exchange rate stability, judging by
the small change in the median nominal exchange rate. Compared to inflation
targeters, countries with hybrid regimes have also experienced greater liquidity.
Among the countries in the hybrid group, inflation was in double digits
in Argentina and Russia, where the nominal exchange rate was relatively
stable. Their experience suggests that there are indeed risks associated
with resisting appreciation in response to external shocks. In these countries,
producer price inflation measures also show significant inflation rates in the

BIS 76th Annual Report

57

pipeline. Administrative price agreements or controls mask a potentially more
serious inflation problem.
In spite of the steps towards tightening taken lately in some countries,
recent external shocks and policy responses have been associated with
generally easy financial conditions in emerging market economies. This can
be seen in continued low real interest rates notwithstanding robust economic
activity and significant increases in broad money (Graph III.11). But equity
prices, which had risen sharply, fell steeply in May 2006 in several countries.
The main conclusion is that inflation risks in the emerging markets, while
hard to read at present, have increased. Recent experience has also
underlined how monetary policy can have implications for the financial system.
Prolonged large-scale intervention or monetary easing to hold the exchange
rate down can affect the structure of balance sheets in the private sector
(especially banks), lower real interest rates, raise credit growth and encourage
debt accumulation. The effects of the resulting imbalances, whether on inflation
or growth, will take time to unfold fully but will become more significant the
longer monetary stimulus is allowed to continue.

IV. Monetary policy in the advanced industrial
economies

Highlights
Monetary policy in the main industrial countries remained generally
accommodative during the period under review, even as economies
strengthened and prospects brightened. Nonetheless, with evidence emerging
that the risks to price stability had edged up, central banks took steps to reduce
the degree of policy stimulus. The Federal Reserve continued to raise its policy
rate at a measured pace throughout the period, to a level considered broadly
consistent with long-term sustainable growth and price stability. The ECB
began lifting its policy rate at the end of 2005 from its previous historically low
level. A key concern for these central banks was whether the pace of tightening
was appropriate in the light of high energy prices, rising resource utilisation and
buoyant housing markets. The Bank of Japan, given accumulating evidence of
a cessation of deflation, announced in March 2006 the end of its long-standing
policy of quantitative easing. Looking forward, it envisaged a return to the use
of more conventional policy instruments. However, monetary policy remained
supportive of the nascent economic revival as the policy rate target was kept at
zero and the real rate turned negative.
For the smaller advanced industrial economies, the policy challenges were
more varied, given the more complex mix of domestic and external forces at
work. The Bank of Canada, Central Bank of Norway, Sveriges Riksbank and
Swiss National Bank reduced the degree of accommodation by raising policy
rates from fairly low levels. Other countries, being at a more advanced stage
in the business cycle, saw only minor policy adjustments. The Reserve Bank
of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised, and the Bank of
England lowered, their respective policy rates by a modest amount.
Even as upside risks arising from inflation pressures grew, many central
banks took comfort from a continuing low level of underlying inflation and well
anchored inflation expectations. They attributed this in part to increased global
competition and its moderating influence on wages and prices. The final
section of this chapter considers some of the challenges for monetary policy
arising from greater global economic and financial integration (“globalisation”).

During the period under review, the Federal Reserve continued to reduce the
degree of policy accommodation. The federal funds rate target was raised by
25 basis points at each meeting of its policy committee, to 5% in May 2006
(Graph IV.1). The latest move was the 16th consecutive increase in this tightening
cycle, which had begun in June 2004 with the rate at 1%. The hallmark of this cycle

was that each rate move was effectively preannounced. By late 2005, however,
committee members indicated less certainty about the policy outlook.
The quiescence of underlying inflation was another remarkable
characteristic of this tightening phase. Headline PCE inflation continued to
move up, reaching 4% year over year, as the effects of higher energy and
commodity prices continued to work their way through. Nonetheless, core
inflation remained low and stable near 2%. Towards the end of the period,
however, evidence of strong underlying growth, a modest rise in long-term
inflation expectations and higher resource utilisation – especially in labour
markets – heightened the committee’s vigilance with respect to inflation risks.
The Federal Reserve’s communication strategy has played a major role in
guiding markets during this tightening phase. As the policy committee began to
see a possible end to the tightening, it adjusted its forward-looking statements
about the likely trajectory of policy rates and the possibility of a pause. Notably,
in December 2005 the well publicised use of the adjective “measured”,
employed since mid-2004 to describe the likely pace of further rate increases,
was dropped. The committee expressed the view that, after the removal of a
significant degree of accommodation, future policy settings would need to
become more sensitive to the arrival of economic data. Moreover, subsequent
cumulative policy moves were unlikely to be large. Markets absorbed this
linguistic adjustment with only modest reactions.
Despite its favourable assessments of how the current policy tightening
cycle had been orchestrated, the committee debated the possibility both of
falling behind and of getting ahead of the curve. By late 2005, when the
committee stopped characterising policy as accommodative, some members
began to argue that policy rates might already have reached a level consistent

with output growing at potential, once the lags generally associated with the
monetary policy transmission mechanism had been taken fully into account.
Yet subsequent policy rate moves indicated that a majority of the committee
continued to have concerns about inflation risks.
High house prices and household debt burdens were identified as major
sources of risk to future growth prospects, even as evidence emerged that the
US housing market was cooling off. An important question for the Federal
Reserve was whether such developments required a more restrictive monetary
policy response than in the past, given that houses might have become
significantly overvalued. Reviewing the issue, the policy committee agreed that,
in principle, house price developments should be taken into account if they
threatened the core goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.
Nevertheless, it also concluded that responding to possible mispricings at this
juncture was not likely to contribute, on balance, to achieving its primary policy
objectives. Uncertainties associated with judging the appropriate value and
likely direction of such asset prices were deemed generally too large for the
Federal Reserve to be able to act with confidence.
The flattening of the yield curve also became a policy concern, as yield
spreads fell to levels last seen in the 2001 recession. In the past, such a
configuration of the term structure had provided a fairly reliable signal of
imminent recession (Graph IV.2, left-hand panel). This time, however, the
dynamics driving the spread seemed to be different in at least two important
ways. First, the Federal Reserve appeared to have kept a lid on inflation pressures
and hence had dampened expectations of a policy rate overshoot (Graph IV.2,
right-hand panel). Second, nominal long-term interest rates had stayed
remarkably stable in comparison with past periods of tightening, although
they did rise noticeably towards the end of the period under review. This implied
that the degree of policy tightening associated with the inversion had been

less than normal. Taken together, these developments called into question the
continued reliability of this indicator (see Chapter IV of the 75th Annual Report).
As for the policy implications of the flattening yield curve, they would depend
on the factors thought to be behind the changing dynamics. Unfortunately,
these were still difficult to assess with confidence (see Chapter VI).

Euro area
Despite two increases in the policy rate, monetary policy in the euro area
remained very accommodative during the period under review. The first 25
basis point rise in December 2005 came after 21/2 years of the policy rate being
maintained at the historically low level of 2%. Largely in response to evidence
of growing risks to price stability, the ECB again raised rates by 25 basis points
in March 2006, leaving the policy rate at 2.5% at the end of the period (Graph
IV.3). The ECB’s decisions reflected assessments based on its two-pillar monetary
policy framework, one pillar focused on price stability in the short term, and
the other on the longer-term price trends based on its monetary analysis.
As regards the former, economic growth in the euro area was judged to
have gained traction throughout the period, despite some quarter-to-quarter
volatility. This, along with a rise in headline HICP inflation above 2%, the
upper end of the ECB’s preferred range, suggested that the extent of policy
accommodation had become increasingly inconsistent with the preservation of
price stability. The ECB also expressed concerns that high, and possibly rising,
oil prices might still pass through to consumer prices. This, in turn, raised the
possibility that such relative price developments might feed through to wage
settlements, leading to second-round effects. Part of this concern reflected the
ECB’s emphasis on headline inflation, as core HICP inflation was low and
declining and inflation expectations appeared to be well anchored.
The ECB’s concerns were reinforced when considering monetary
developments. M3 continued to grow at a rate far above the reference rate

considered consistent with medium- and long-term price stability (Graph IV.4).
Earlier in this decade, M3 had also grown rapidly, but a large part of this
had been attributed to technical factors. In particular, euro area residents had
been adjusting their portfolios away from equities to money, revealing
their preference for safe, more liquid assets. But even as these technical
adjustments subsided, M3 continued to grow very robustly. Indeed, the growth
rate of M3 adjusted for portfolio shifts reached new highs in the past year, at
roughly twice the reference growth rate.
Complementing the worrying signals from M3, credit growth to the private
sector remained strong, especially mortgage lending to households. Continuing
low interest rates were thought to have contributed to the momentum in the
housing market, resulting in some exceptional rates of price appreciation (see
Chapter VII). Indeed, France, Ireland, Italy and Spain continued to record double
digit annual rates of appreciation. The ECB’s own calculations showed that house
price overvaluation in the euro area had not been greater in the previous 20 years.
In view of the interplay of asset prices, credit growth and monetary stability,
as highlighted in the ECB’s policy framework, these developments were seen
as pointing to longer-term risks to price stability and economic activity.
The ECB also saw external developments as a potential source of
concern. In particular, the unwinding of global imbalances was perceived as a
low-probability but potentially large downside risk to euro area economic
activity. The potential knock-on effects for price stability, therefore, needed to
be assessed along with the upside risks to inflation from the monetary analysis.
The ECB relied heavily on its communication strategy to clarify its
decision-making process, particularly as expectations firmed of an imminent
turning point in the policy cycle. However, the ECB was circumspect about

BIS 76th Annual Report

63

offering explicit forward-looking statements on the direction of policy rates. At
several press conferences, officials emphasised that the Governing Council did
not take decisions ex ante on future policy rate moves, and was therefore not in
a position to preannounce a sequence of rate hikes. This was in sharp contrast
to recent efforts by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan to offer more
guidance, albeit qualitatively, about the likely direction of policy rates at
subsequent policy meetings. The ECB was concerned that such statements
might be misconstrued as committing it to a specific course. In addition, with
fewer “excesses” evident in euro area financial markets than in the United
States or Japan, such explicit guidance arguably implied fewer potential
benefits. Even so, given the ECB’s leitmotif of upside risks to price stability,
markets expected further rate hikes this year and next.

Japan
The Bank of Japan maintained a very easy policy stance as it waited for firmer
evidence that deflationary forces were waning. During most of the period, the
Bank continued its quantitative easing policy, which it had adopted under
exceptional circumstances in 2001. Accordingly, it set an operational target for
banks’ outstanding current account balances held at the Bank of Japan. This
target, which remained unchanged in 2005 and early 2006 at ¥30–35 trillion,
was significantly in excess of what was needed to ensure that the overnight
rate stayed at virtually zero (Graph IV.5). At its inception, the quantitative easing
framework had been intended primarily to avoid the possibility of a deflationary
spiral in the context of fragility in the financial sector. By this criterion, the
Bank of Japan concluded earlier this year that the policy had been a success.
In March 2006, the central bank ended its quantitative easing policy
and returned to a more normal operational framework of targeting the
(uncollateralised) overnight rate. At the time of the policy shift, the Bank of
Japan emphasised its intention to keep its new target at 0% for a period of

time, even though the stage was being set for a withdrawal of excess reserves
from the banking system. Indeed, the decline in excess reserves held at the
Bank of Japan since then has been rapid. Even so, with deflation subsiding
and inflation eventually rising during the period, the resulting real policy rate
fell to lows not seen for many years. The Bank of Japan recognised that this
would provide additional monetary policy stimulus to support the gathering
momentum in economic activity.
Underlying the decision to shift policy was increased optimism about
improvements in the monetary policy transmission channel. Admittedly, some
doubts had lingered; the Bank of Japan’s target range for current account
balances translated into only modest improvements in M2 and private sector
credit growth. But the accumulating evidence of a return to economic and
financial normality helped to tip the balance towards adopting the more
conventional monetary policy framework.
The Bank of Japan also announced two other key elements of its new
policy framework. First, the Bank clarified its views on price stability, defining it
qualitatively as a situation where households and businesses can make
economic decisions without concern about fluctuations in the general price
level. Operationally, the Policy Board interpreted this to be an approximate
inflation range of 0–2%. Greater clarity about its inflation objectives was
expected to help orient price and wage behaviour in support of its policy goals.
Naturally, given Japan’s deflation experience, questions were raised about the
lower bound of the range. The Bank of Japan stated that it would review the
range regularly, recognising the possibility that, in the future, a wider safety
margin against the risk of declining prices might be necessary.
Second, the Bank of Japan outlined its “two-perspective” approach to the
conduct of monetary policy. The first perspective emphasised an evaluation of
the stance of policy in the light of expected developments in economic activity
and inflation over a one- to two-year horizon. The second perspective was
meant to address longer-term risks that might require more flexibility in the
conduct of policy. Experience had illustrated that short-run inflation control
alone was not sufficient to preclude wide swings in asset prices and significant

changes in the financial environment that could threaten sustainable growth
and price stability over longer horizons.
While the Bank of Japan announced that the new framework was not
likely to lead to any abrupt changes in short-term interest rates, markets reacted
by bidding up long rates (Graph IV.6); moreover, increases were seen in both
public and private sector debt markets. The movements in part reflected
official statements that policy rates would eventually experience a “gradual
adjustment”, after a period of remaining effectively zero, as well as a reevaluation by the market of the economy’s improving prospects.

Inflation targeting countries
During the period under review, many central banks in advanced industrial
countries with explicit numerical objectives for inflation raised policy rates. In
some cases, this seemed to reflect the fact that headline inflation moved
higher, owing in large part to energy prices. However, underlying inflation
generally remained low (Graph IV.7), and in some countries was well below
inflation objectives.
These central banks saw themselves facing a set of common policy risks.
First, uncertainties about the path and impact of energy prices raised upside risks
to price stability, especially if second-round effects began to take hold. Second,
central banks grew concerned about the downside risks associated with possible
fallout from an unexpected slowdown in two key drivers of global economic
activity – China and the United States. The potential adverse implications of
large and growing global external imbalances formed a backdrop to these
downside concerns (see Chapter V). Third, already high house valuations
continued to rise to levels that looked increasingly unsustainable, raising the
likelihood of a boom-bust scenario materialising. While the slower pace of
appreciation in Australia and the United Kingdom was welcome, the persistent
upward trend in the household debt/income ratio remained worrisome,
especially with the prospect of further policy tightening in some countries.
There were, of course, differences amongst these economies. Increases
in rates were comparatively larger amongst those central banks whose policy
rates had been near historical lows at the beginning of the period under review.
The Bank of Canada, for instance, raised its overnight rate by the largest
amount, taking it from 2.5% in September 2005 to 4% in April 2006 in six
consecutive increases. With the economy operating near full capacity, and
inflation running in the upper half of its target range, it was thought necessary
to begin normalising policy rates, despite the significant appreciation of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar and low underlying inflation.
The Central Bank of Norway and Sveriges Riksbank also raised rates, but
by more modest amounts. The former increased its sight deposit rate three
times, by 25 basis points each time, reaching 2.5% by March 2006. This
reflected an upturn in the Norwegian economy that was deemed to require a
somewhat less expansionary policy stance. Even though underlying inflation
remained well below its target, headline inflation edged up. In addition, the
Norwegian central bank began publishing in November 2005 an official path
for future policy rates. This followed the example set by the Reserve Bank of

information about the likely direction of policy. While the Central Bank of
Norway expected the new practice to enhance monetary policy predictability
and effectiveness in anchoring inflation expectations, it also noted some
concerns. In particular, if such projections were misinterpreted as implicit
commitments, this would complicate the conduct of policy. The Swedish central
bank boosted its rate to 2% in two 25 basis point moves, as robust growth in
household consumption, corporate investment and external demand became
evident. At the same time, underlying and headline inflation remained just

under the lower end of the inflation target range during most of the period.
Cost pressures also appeared to remain moderate.
The Swiss National Bank, with the lowest initial policy setting amongst these
countries, raised the range for its policy rate by 50 basis points to 0.75–1.75%.
The economic recovery in Switzerland was seen to be firming, driven by robust
global demand, an improved employment situation, stronger corporate investment
and solid private consumption. However, inflation remained low and stable.
Central banks in countries at a more advanced stage of the business
cycle, and where policy had already been tightened significantly, made only
minor adjustments to policy rates. The Bank of England was the only central
bank to reduce its policy rate, with a 25 basis point cut in August to 4.5%,
where it has since remained. The rate reduction was triggered by concerns
about below trend GDP growth and a weakening in labour market conditions
that had the potential to push inflation below the target level.
Similar to trends observed in a number of the other inflation targeting
countries, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its policy rate, by 25 basis
points to 5.75% in May. Growth was expected to slow slightly while the level of
capacity utilisation remained high. Underlying inflation remained moderate, in
large part due to disinflationary impulses coming from stronger economic ties
with China, even as headline inflation stayed near the upper end of its inflation
range for much of the period. In New Zealand, economic growth slowed from
a high rate as business activity softened and the housing market also showed
signs of cooling. Inflation nonetheless moved above target, as price increases
and cost pressures remained persistent. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised
its official cash rate by 25 basis points in both October and December to reach
7.25%, the highest policy rate amongst these advanced industrial countries.
The experience of the Antipodean economies underscored a policy
dilemma common to commodity-rich countries facing a combination of surging
asset prices and high commodity prices. On the one hand, higher policy rates
could help to alleviate domestic sources of overheating. Yet this response
would tend to attract global capital flows, not least through carry trades (see
Chapter V), appreciate the currency and, possibly, aggravate current account
problems. This raised the prospect of potentially destabilising financial inflows.
Recent experience in New Zealand illustrates just how disruptive it can be
when these inflows reverse. On the other hand, keeping policy rates lower
could feed already ebullient asset prices, thereby increasing the likelihood of
domestic boom-bust behaviour.
Other global forces also weighed on policy decisions in a number of
countries. One concern was that unexpectedly persistent downward pressure
on inflation from global competition in consumer goods and services, despite
high energy and commodity prices, might cause some tendency to undershoot
inflation objectives (Graph IV.8). These positive supply side developments
largely reflected a notable shift in import patterns, with China and some newly
industrialised countries in central and eastern Europe supplying a rapidly
increasing volume of low-cost imports of manufactured goods.
Such global forces have allowed policy rates to remain lower than
otherwise, but have arguably aggravated domestic concerns about rising

asset prices and levels of indebtedness, suggesting a further need to raise
policy rates. At the same time, tightening could increase the likelihood of
undershooting the inflation objective. Indeed, with inflation running at the low
end of their inflation targets, the Central Bank of Norway and Sveriges
Riksbank have already been facing such a policy dilemma for some time.

Globalisation and monetary policy
Globalisation
complicates the
conduct of
monetary policy

As central banks became more attentive to emerging domestic signs of
upside risks to price stability during the period under review, they looked to
global developments as a possible source of countervailing pressure to keep
inflation low and stable. Indeed, since the second half of the 1990s at least,
central banks have become increasingly alert to the potential implications
for domestic macroeconomic developments, and inflation in particular, of
the process of greater real and financial integration in the world economy
(“globalisation”). It was earlier in the 1990s that the integration of China,
India and the former Soviet bloc into the global economy began in earnest,
adding significantly to the underlying momentum of globalisation. Could this
process be helping to moderate inflationary forces and to keep inflation under
tighter control? And what new challenges could it still pose for monetary
policymaking?
This section explores these issues in more detail. It examines, in turn, how
globalisation may have strengthened central banks’ incentives and ability to
deliver price stability, how it may have been altering the information content
of traditional guideposts for monetary policy settings, and how it may
have influenced the monetary policy transmission mechanism and central
banks’ room for manoeuvre. The section concludes by considering potential
challenges and risks ahead, together with possible policy responses.

Globalisation, central bank incentives and price stability
A remarkable feature of the global disinflation record over the last couple of
decades has been its breadth (Graph IV.9). There is no doubt that central
banks’ determination to fight inflation, following the lessons learnt during the
Great Inflation era, has been the main factor behind this trend (see the 75th
Annual Report). Yet the striking similarity across countries, despite wide
differences in monetary policy frameworks, exchange rate regimes and the
configuration of other economic forces impinging on these economies,
suggests that other common forces may also have played an important role.
Globalisation is a natural candidate.
There are various ways in which globalisation could have helped central
banks to reduce inflation and keep it low. Some of them are direct. For
example, increased global competition in goods, services and factor input
markets and greater cross-border investment (Graph IV.10) have surely
affected the process of wage and price formation and, consequently, inflation
dynamics in the industrialised countries (see Chapter II). Others are more
indirect and involve rather subtle, yet arguably more lasting, effects which
operate largely by enhancing central bank incentives to achieve and maintain
price stability. At least five such channels can be singled out.
First, globalisation may have significantly lowered the costs of disinflation
and hence helped to speed it up. Globalisation has involved a series of
favourable supply side developments in low-cost production centres around
the globe that yielded a contemporaneous reduction in price pressures and
an expansion of output. By accommodating these effects while resisting
unfavourable ones, central banks could thus opportunistically cut the output
and employment costs of the fight against inflation.
Second, while better monetary policy management has surely supported
greater output stability across many economies (Graph IV.11), globalisation
may also have played its part. Globalisation has expanded the range of options
through which businesses and investors can diversify country-specific risks. In
addition, global supply chains have helped to reduce the bite of country-

specific capacity constraints. To the extent that globalisation has smoothed
the business cycle, it has also naturally supported the central banks’ focus on
maintaining price stability.
Third, globalisation may have imposed greater discipline on policymakers.
Economic and financial integration has naturally tended to increase the costs
of slower progress towards good macroeconomic performance in general and
price stability in particular. Good performance has meant more global
resources flowing in and supporting growth; poor performance has meant
resources flowing out, at times in a rapid and destabilising way. Indeed, past
economic and financial crises exemplify the ability of global markets to levy
particularly harsh penalties on countries judged to have unsound policies.
Fourth, globalisation may have made central banks more willing to tolerate
very low inflation rates. This is because globalisation has also lowered the

costs associated with deflation. Intensifying global competition has contributed
to making factor input and final goods markets more efficient. It has also
strengthened incentives for institutional reforms that promote market flexibility,
especially those making wages and prices more flexible downwards. Hence, it
has made modest deflation less worrisome, in large part because profits can
be maintained in such circumstances. Indeed, the Bank of Japan has recently
emphasised the degree of market flexibility as a critical criterion for determining
the range of inflation outturns consistent with price stability.
Finally, globalisation may have contributed to bolstering central bank
credibility. By increasing the speed of disinflation and helping to offset other
inflationary forces through the above mechanisms, globalisation may have
boosted public confidence in the inflation-fighting credentials of central banks.
This, in turn, may have enhanced central bank control of the inflation process,
by helping to align the expectations of consumers, workers and investors with
those of the central bank in a self-reinforcing way. Arguably, this virtuous circle
has played a part in anchoring inflation expectations more firmly.
Of course, this and the other mechanisms could also work in the opposite
direction if resistance to globalisation were to strengthen in a material way.
While this is still a possibility, the trend towards greater global integration has
thus far remained in place.

Globalisation and traditional monetary policy guideposts
It stands to reason that the pervasive influence of globalisation on domestic
economies might have had a significant impact on the traditional guideposts of
monetary policy. Central banks rely on these indicators to assess inflationary
pressures and to set the stance of monetary policy. They include, in particular,
measures of domestic economic slack, such as output and unemployment rate
gaps, and the natural rate of interest.
As regards measures of economic slack, it appears that inflation has
become less sensitive to traditional measures of domestic resource utilisation.
In other words, empirical Phillips curves – considered by many to be the
workhorse of monetary policymaking – seem to have become flatter in most
economies (Graph IV.12). Explanations for this have centred on fundamental
changes in the basic monetary policy framework. Much greater emphasis is
now placed on price stability and well anchored inflation expectations.
A complementary view is that, in a globalised world, global measures of
economic slack could have gained significance in determining inflation, at the
expense of purely domestic measures. This is not to say that the impact of
domestic slack on inflation no longer matters, but rather that it can only be
properly assessed from a more global perspective. While the transformation
is far from complete, a global perspective would certainly help to account for
the moderate wage and price pressures seen of late in a number of industrial
countries. Simultaneously, the influence of globalisation could also help to
explain the high price of certain factor inputs that are traded extensively in
international markets, such as oil and other commodities (see Chapter III).
Further, there is some statistical evidence supporting the view that, over
time, global measures of slack have become more important as drivers of

domestic inflation. Notably, the correlation between domestic goods and
services inflation and measures of global output gaps has been positive and
growing for advanced industrial countries, even as the sensitivity of domestic
inflation to domestic output gaps has declined (Graph IV.13). The influence of
global factors has also been evident further upstream in the production process,
in the strong bivariate correlation between global input prices and inflation
(same graph). The empirical record confirms that these two sets of correlations
have become apparent over the past decade, at the same time as global

economic integration has deepened. While it may be too soon to say precisely
how globalisation is changing all such relationships, the fact that it does have
implications for the dynamics of domestic inflation seems increasingly clear.
And, looking forward, this influence might be expected to grow further as long
as globalisation trends persist.
The consequences of globalisation for the non-accelerating inflation
rate of unemployment (NAIRU) in advanced industrial countries are more
ambiguous. On the one hand, stiffer import competition has tended to provide
incentives for reallocating labour to sectors with a comparative advantage. This
process would tend to raise the NAIRU given higher labour market churning
associated with job creation and destruction. On the other hand, labour market
contestability and migration have probably acted as countervailing forces
because labour has become more quiescent and less demanding in the face
of increased competition (see Chapter II). On balance, the recent empirical
evidence suggests that contestability and migration, at least so far, may be the
dominant forces in advanced industrial countries, thereby contributing to
lowering the NAIRU (Graph IV.14). At the same time, the net impact on
individual countries is likely to have varied depending on differences in the
way domestic labour markets have adjusted to the globalisation process.
Globalisation could also be expected to raise the long-run natural rate of
interest. The long-run natural rate can be defined as the level of the policy rate
consistent with sustainable output growth at potential and hence long-term price
stability in the steady state, ie eschewing cyclical effects. This concept has gained
prominence in the current policy context, as central banks have been gradually
reducing the strong monetary stimulus associated with historically low rates. The
reason for expecting a higher long-run natural rate is that greater economic and
financial integration should promote more efficient use of labour and capital,
thereby boosting long-run productivity growth and therefore economic growth
potential. The major expansion of the global labour force also points in the
same direction, as it should contribute to lifting the marginal return on capital.
At the same time, the usefulness of estimates of the long-run natural rate
of interest, as a guide to short-run policy, is complicated by two considerations:

one empirical and the other conceptual. The principal empirical problem is that
financial globalisation might also be expected to have a downward effect on
risk premia. If globalisation has resulted, on balance, in a better allocation of
risk, premia for market interest rates would tend to fall, especially for longerterm instruments. The variation in the premia would, in turn, complicate
inferences about the natural rate for those central banks that use longer-term
interest rates to estimate the natural rate, as is the convention. Moreover, other
factors driving risk premia might also be at work, which could further
complicate assessments. In such cases, the implications for the longer-run
natural rate would depend on whether the recent declines were thought to be
temporary or permanent, and whether they were thought to affect policy rates
and longer-term interest rates differentially (see Chapter VI).
Second, while in qualitative terms the long-run natural rate (abstracting
from risk premia considerations) could be expected to rise, the impact on the
cyclically adjusted natural rate is less clear. For instance, if the growth of
supply, on balance, outstrips demand in the short run, the cyclically adjusted
natural rate would be expected to decline. This implies a tension between the
initial impact and the eventual direction in which policy rates might be expected
to gravitate over the medium run.

Globalisation, the transmission mechanism and the policy room for manoeuvre
Financial

… and constrained
central banks’ room
for manoeuvre

As regards the transmission mechanism from policy rates to aggregate demand
and the room for manoeuvre in setting policy rates, it is the financial dimension
of globalisation that is arguably more relevant. While the effects of financial
globalisation are of older vintage, they have also been very much in evidence
in recent years.
Financial globalisation has undoubtedly increased the role of global factors
in influencing domestic asset prices, thereby weakening the link between
policy rates and rates of return on various asset classes and hence expenditures.
Admittedly, the impact of policy rates through expectations of future policy on
inflation may have been strengthened, at least to the extent that globalisation
may have helped central banks to gain credibility. However, in an integrated
global financial market, risk premia are bound to reflect common influences
more strongly, especially on assets having longer maturities. Changes in global
investors’ appetite for risk and asset class preferences were very prominent
in the period under review. Moreover, they affected both government and
corporate securities and even real estate (see Chapters VI and VII).
Financial globalisation might also have constrained somewhat the
independent room for manoeuvre of national monetary policies. To be sure,
under flexible exchange rates, central banks ultimately retain the freedom to
determine national inflation rates. But the greater sensitivity of capital flows to
perceived yield differentials makes it harder to calibrate domestic interest rates
and can exacerbate policy trade-offs, particularly between internal and external
balances. The recent experience of countries where interest rates have been
comparatively high by international standards, and hence have been the target
of carry trades, is a case in point (see Chapter V). All else equal, exchange rate
considerations increase the implicit costs of keeping rates away from those

that prevail in global capital markets. At a more strategic level, financial
globalisation has not only put capital flow issues at the forefront of policy
deliberations but has also had implications for the sustainability of various
types of exchange rate regimes.

Challenges, risks and possible policy responses
The above analysis indicates that, while globalisation has helped central
banks to lower inflation and keep it low, it has also raised new challenges that
merit attention. More muted inflation outturns than might have been expected
at this stage in the business cycle, and persistent interest rate “conundrums”,
are just some of the recent symptoms of what might be a substantially new
policy environment shaped by global forces. A key issue for policymakers is
whether the old rules of the game have been altered so much as to compromise
their ability to achieve the goals of policy. The more immediate challenges
arise from the heightened influence of global factors on domestic inflation
determination and the risks of potential deflationary episodes.
A first challenge relates to the need to incorporate global factors in the
assessment of near-term inflationary pressures. Focusing solely on measures
of domestic slack can lead policy astray, depending on how far such measures
are representative of more global conditions. Near-term inflation pressures
would be underestimated if global conditions were tighter than domestic ones,
and overestimated if global slack truly offset domestic tightness. At the current
policy juncture, for instance, such considerations could help to explain why
rising rates of domestic capacity utilisation have nonetheless coincided with
surprisingly quiescent inflation in individual advanced industrial countries.
However, if spare global capacity were to disappear, these countries might
suddenly find themselves facing significant inflationary pressures.
A second challenge relates more closely to the need to incorporate global
factors in the assessment of more medium-term prospects and hence of the
cumulative effect of policies over time (Graph IV.15). When judged against

… and
understanding the
nature of possible
deflation pressures

traditional estimates of long-run natural rates, policy rates have been unusually
low for an unusually long time. And this has occurred precisely at a time when
one might expect such natural rates to have increased, owing to the favourable
impact of globalisation on long-run growth potential. The question is whether
such protracted deviations might not have undesirable implications for the
longer term, by contributing to the build-up of imbalances that could have
disruptive consequences at some point. In particular, unusually low policy
rates across much of the globe have gone hand in hand with an unusually
strong expansion in monetary and credit aggregates as well as a protracted
boom in asset prices, especially in residential real estate markets.
The monetary policies of both the G10 and the emerging market economies
have contributed to this. Given financial globalisation, accommodative
monetary policies in advanced industrial countries have led to downward
pressure on their currencies and, consequently, upward pressure on currencies
elsewhere. In an attempt to resist this, emerging market economies have
frequently kept interest rates low, even in cases where domestic factors might
otherwise justify higher rates. Moreover, efforts to prevent foreign exchange rate
appreciation have simultaneously led to a rapid increase in foreign reserves
(see Chapter V) and in monetary and credit aggregates (Graph IV.16). As
discussed in Chapter III, the risk is that inflationary pressures might re-emerge
with a vengeance and/or that the unwinding of the financial imbalances could
undermine economic activity and contribute to unwelcome disinflation.
All this points to a third challenge relating to the nature of deflation risks.
In a low-inflation environment, globalisation has arguably put a premium on
understanding the forces behind any deflationary pressures that might emerge
from time to time. Downward price pressures arising from favourable global
supply developments would raise the likelihood of a falling general price level

(“deflation”). However, as emphasised in the 73rd Annual Report, supply sidedriven deflations are more likely to be accompanied by continuing output
growth, real wage gains, buoyant asset prices, and strong household and
corporate balance sheets, all else equal. The costs of such deflationary episodes
would obviously be far smaller than those associated with demand-driven
deflations. Against this background, there is a risk that central banks could
find themselves unintentionally leaning excessively against the threat of such
“good”, or at least “benign”, deflations. Such leaning could therefore contribute
to the emergence of the cumulative boom-bust disequilibria noted above.
Paradoxically, it could even sow the seeds of “bad” deflations, which might
be eventually associated with a disorderly unwinding of financial imbalances.
How could central banks mitigate the policy challenges raised by the
increased relevance of global factors in domestic outcomes? Possible
responses relate to monitoring, analysis and multilateral actions.
Central banks could put greater emphasis on monitoring external
developments, as part of their regular assessment of the policy environment,
with the aim of identifying potential sources of global problems earlier in the
pipeline. To facilitate this, they might put greater weight on sectoral data by
market segment than is currently done. This would reflect the growing
importance of global linkages amongst product lines and, a fortiori, global
inflationary pressures that could arise from more globalised input markets. In
addition, stronger emphasis on improving the speed of reporting and accuracy
of real-time data would bring many potential benefits, especially with respect
to tracking global slack.
The greater emphasis on the global perspective also calls for the
strengthening of analytical efforts to understand the behaviour of the
increasingly globally integrated economy. A key desideratum is to further
deepen existing international models of the business cycle and inflation. One
way to achieve this would be to extend analytical frameworks to capture more
accurately the spillovers across national borders, the limitations of current
exchange rate regimes in ensuring the independence of domestic inflation
outturns over relatively long periods, and the dynamics of contestability in
labour, capital, goods and services markets. More ambitiously, it would be
worth exploring more “top-down” approaches, in which the dynamics of the
global economy are not derived purely from the “bottom-up” aggregation of
individual countries’ behaviour. Another key desideratum is a better integration
and more systematic interpretation of the real and financial determinants of
global business fluctuations. Such efforts would help to illuminate the global
dimensions of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the associated
monetary policy challenges.
Finally, the increasing impact of globalisation on domestic inflation
naturally implies that additional benefits might be gained from paying greater
attention to joint policy forums and multilateral responses. To the extent that
global factors are playing a more important role, country-specific policy
reactions might prove insufficient to produce desirable outcomes. This puts a
premium on forming a multilateral consensus on diagnoses, potential solutions
and, if possible, implementation strategies.

Highlights
The broad appreciation of the US dollar, the stability of the euro and the overall
downward trend of the yen were the salient developments in foreign exchange
markets over most of 2005. Until December, the dollar appreciated markedly
against the euro, the yen and a number of other floating currencies, in
particular the pound sterling and the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Its
trend vis-à-vis emerging market currencies was less uniform. Asian currencies
remained fairly stable or depreciated, while some Latin American currencies
strengthened. Starting in December 2005, the upward trend of the US dollar
reversed.
As in previous years, three main factors underpinned exchange rate
developments during the period under review. First, against the background of
a further normalisation of policy rates in the major economies, but still ample
global liquidity, interest rate differentials continued to be a major determinant
of exchange rate movements. The search for yield often took the form of carry
trades. Second, the current account deficit and net international liabilities of the
United States rose further but attracted less attention than during the period
2002–04. In spite of the growing debt burden, net income remained positive
for most of 2005, reducing pressure for an immediate correction. The chapter
explores trends and determinants of net income in the United States and other
industrial countries and discusses possible implications for the sustainability of
external imbalances. Third, continuing reserve accumulation in China limited
the dollar’s depreciation against the renminbi. By contrast, reserves grew more
slowly in other emerging market countries in Asia. The change in China’s
exchange rate policy introduced in July 2005 received much attention, but by
mid-May 2006 it had had only a modest impact on foreign exchange markets.
Foreign exchange markets were characterised by strong activity and
generally low volatility. However, some smaller markets experienced sharp
increases in volatility, particularly in 2006.

Developments in foreign exchange markets
Broad appreciation
of the dollar
between February
and end-November
2005 …

The period under review can be divided into two distinct phases. During the
first, from February to end-November 2005, the dollar generally appreciated. It
gained 5% in nominal effective terms and some 10% and 15% against the euro
and the yen respectively (Graph V.1). It also appreciated against other floating
currencies, in particular the Australian and New Zealand dollars and most
European currencies outside the euro area, notably sterling (Graph V.2). In
contrast, the Canadian dollar appreciated by 5% against the US dollar, breaking

the pattern of broad synchronicity with the Australian and New Zealand dollars
observed in the past.
Up to December 2005, the euro remained roughly stable in nominal
effective terms. It tended to appreciate against the yen, while its performance
vis-à-vis other European currencies was mixed. It gained with respect to the
Swedish krona, showed no clear trend vis-à-vis the Swiss franc and lost some
ground against sterling and the Norwegian krone. The yen trended broadly
downwards. It depreciated significantly against the dollar and the euro, as well
as most emerging market currencies in Asia.
The behaviour of the currencies of emerging economies was less uniform.
While several of them – in particular the Thai baht, the New Taiwan dollar
and the Indonesian rupiah – depreciated substantially against the US dollar
(Graph V.3), many Latin American currencies strengthened. Trends in the
South African rand and currencies of eastern European countries were less
clear-cut.
In the second phase, between December 2005 and mid-May 2006, the
dollar lost some ground against a number of currencies. It depreciated by
around 9% against the yen, and by 10% against the euro and sterling. The yen
ended its broad downward trend. As suggested by risk reversals, this was
accompanied by a shift in investors’ bias against future dollar strength
(Graph V.1). The euro tended to strengthen against a number of currencies and
in nominal effective terms. The Canadian dollar continued its broad-based rally.

euro. In contrast, emerging market currencies in Asia generally – and the won,
rupiah, baht, Philippine peso and Singapore dollar in particular – tended to
strengthen appreciably against the dollar and to a lesser extent against the yen.
In evaluating the current levels of the main exchange rates from a longer-term
perspective, it is worth noting that in real effective terms the dollar and the euro
remain close to their long-term averages, while sterling is still about 10% above
(Graph V.4). In contrast, the Swedish krona, the yen and a number of emerging
market currencies in Asia are more than 10% below their historical averages.

Foreign exchange market conditions
Volatility and activity were somewhat similar across these two main phases
of exchange rate movement. From January to November 2005, against a
background of ample global liquidity, foreign exchange markets were fairly
calm and turnover was high. The implied volatility of the main exchange rates
was lower than in previous years and tended to decline (Graph V.1). Starting in
December, there was an increase in volatility in some markets, most notably
the yen/dollar and the yen/euro markets, indicating a rise in uncertainty. As
discussed below, this higher uncertainty about the yen was triggered by
speculation over the ending of Japan’s policy of quantitative easing and
its potential implications for financial markets, in particular for the funding of
carry trades. In some smaller markets, the increase in uncertainty led to sharp
depreciations, with some spillover to other currencies.
The high level of activity continued to reflect a large volume of funds
from investors searching for yield across a broad range of currencies. This
search also contributed to upward pressure on prices in commodity markets,
which have been influenced by burgeoning inflows of investable funds on the
back of strong global demand. Annualised increases in broad commodity
price indices since the beginning of 2002 have been almost 10%, and the price
rises for some commodities, such as gold, even greater. Gold prices increased
at an annualised rate of around 14% between mid-2001 and September 2005.
By mid-May 2006, gold prices had risen to 25-year highs of $726 per troy
ounce, a 60% rate of growth since September.

Trends in official reserves
Reserve
accumulation
continues

Central banks continued to accumulate sizeable amounts of official foreign
exchange reserves (Table V.1). Unlike previous years, when several Asian
central banks had contributed to the large build-up in reserves, 80% of the
increase in Asia in 2005 was concentrated in China. Chinese reserves expanded
by another $200 billion, with holdings by end-2005 exceeding $800 billion,
or 20% of world reserves. Oil exporters also accumulated reserves at a fast
pace. The largest increase was seen in Russia. In contrast, the pace of reserve
accumulation slowed in most other economies, particularly India, Korea,
Malaysia and Taiwan (China).

Exchange rate movements: determinants
Once again, three main factors appeared to underpin exchange rate movements
during the period under review. First, domestic growth prospects and interest
rate differentials seemed to influence the main currencies, as well as a number
of emerging market ones. Second, the widening external imbalance of the
United States at times weighed on the dollar, although its influence was
felt much less than in previous years. Finally, exchange rate policies and
intervention practices in emerging market countries, particularly in Asia, while
differing somewhat from the past, continued to shape the behaviour of their
currencies.

Three main factors
behind exchange
rate movements

Growth and interest rate differentials
Growth and interest rate differentials – both actual and expected – seem to
have been the main drivers of exchange rate movements over the past year.
Although there is no evidence of a robust statistical link between current or
expected interest rate differentials and exchange rate movements over long
time spans, there is evidence of a positive correlation for certain currency
pairs during the two phases in the period under review.
In particular, the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the yen
during most of 2005 reflected the positive impact of the further tightening by
the Federal Reserve on interest rate differentials. Similarly, after several years
of strong appreciation, a number of currencies – in particular sterling, the
Australian and New Zealand dollars and the Swedish krona – weakened
against the dollar when interest rate differentials moved in favour of the United
States. In contrast, with its interest rate differential remaining relatively stable,
the Canadian dollar appreciated against the US dollar.

favoured the dollar

In December, the
prospect of rising
Japanese rates
attracted attention

Changes in interest rate differentials might have had an even stronger
dampening effect on the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and the
Canadian dollar might not have strengthened, had these currencies not
benefited from high commodity prices (Graph V.5). Commodity price rises also
put upward pressure on currencies of other commodity-exporting countries
such as Chile and South Africa.
Starting in December 2005, the partial reversal of the dollar’s earlier
appreciating trend against the euro and the yen coincided with a change in
perceptions about the monetary policy cycles in the main economies. In
particular, market participants started to expect rising policy rates in the euro
area and Japan.
The prospect of rising Japanese rates and the possibility of a related
appreciation of the yen attracted particular attention, especially in the context
of carry trades. These trades involve borrowing in a low-yielding currency and
investing in a high-yielding one, and are predicated on an expectation that the
high-yielding currency will not depreciate enough to offset the interest rate
advantage. As in previous years, carry trades were used by different types of
international investors in their search for yield and provided an important
mechanism through which interest rates and exchange rates were linked.
Market commentary pointed to the yen and the Swiss franc as two major
funding currencies in 2005, while the dollar switched from being a funding
currency to a target currency as the tightening cycle of the Federal Reserve
progressed. During this period, as US interest rates moved up steadily,
borrowing in yen and investing in dollar-denominated assets appeared to be
increasingly attractive. This is clearly the message provided by Sharpe ratios,

which adjust excess returns by their volatility (Graph V.6). Market sources also
suggested that short yen positions started to be unwound towards the end of
the year.
The effect of the reversal of carry trade positions on exchange rate
volatility is hard to predict and depends, inter alia, on the speed with which
these positions are closed. In some cases, the gradual unwinding of carry
trades caused visible changes in exchange rates without a sizeable impact on
short-term volatility. The slow decline of the Australian dollar that started in
March 2005, when carry trades targeting that currency became less attractive,
is a case in point. In other instances, carry trades were unwound suddenly,
causing sharp exchange rate movements and spillovers – albeit short-lived –
across markets. Around early December 2005, an appreciation of the yen
against the US dollar triggered a rapid closing of long positions in the Brazilian
real and the New Zealand dollar and a drop in their value. The price of gold
was also affected. An even more striking example of a disorderly correction
following the unwinding of carry trades was the sharp fall of the Icelandic
króna in February 2006, following one rating agency’s change in the outlook
for Iceland’s sovereign rating. The unwinding of positions involving the króna
caused a 10% depreciation of the currency within two days. While such an
event would not normally influence other foreign exchange markets, it spilled
over within hours to the high-yielding currencies of Australia, Brazil, Hungary,
New Zealand and South Africa, all affected by carry trades.

The US external imbalance
The US external imbalance widened further in 2005. The current account deficit
for the first time reached 6.4% of GDP and the net foreign asset position is
likely to have exceeded –25% (Graph V.7). In addition, net income on the US
net foreign asset position, which had been consistently positive since the
mid-1980s, was negative in the second and fourth quarters of 2005.

The US external
imbalance came
back into focus
in 2006

Market participants continued to react to data releases showing
unexpectedly large increases in the US current account deficit, and at times
also to very sizeable revisions of these data. However, the US external position
overall attracted less attention than in previous years. This was also reflected
in the fact that, during most of 2005, there was no reduction in the willingness
of the private sector to finance the current account deficit. This was suggested
by a shift in the composition of financial flows into the United States towards
private flows. In particular, the shares of portfolio debt and foreign direct
investment (FDI) rose significantly. In contrast, the share of financial inflows
attributable to official reserves fell visibly.
In early 2006, however, the US external imbalance came back into market
participants’ focus. This took place as new data showed the US trade deficit
reaching record highs and discussions about China’s exchange rate policy
moved into the spotlight. It also appeared that external imbalances began to
matter for other currencies: the selling pressure that hit the Icelandic króna at
the end of February and in early March mostly spilled over to currencies of
other countries with large current account deficits.

Exchange rate policies in Asia
Intervention in Asia
still a factor

Reserve accumulation by a number of central banks, particularly in Asia,
continued to influence exchange rates. However, compared to previous years,
the more marked appreciation of a number of Asian currencies against the US
dollar indicates that heightened upward pressure from foreign exchange
markets was not fully offset by reserve accumulation, which generally occurred
at a slower pace than hitherto (Table V.1).
The People’s Bank of China in July 2005 announced some potentially
important changes in its exchange rate regime. The three main elements were:
an immediate 2% revaluation of the renminbi against the dollar; a continuation
of the managed float regime, whereby the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate
within a ±0.3% band around a daily announced central parity; and the
introduction of a reference basket of currencies, although details of weights,
parities and band width were not released. No changes in existing capital
controls were initially announced.
Since the beginning of 2006, the Chinese monetary authorities have
announced a number of measures to develop the infrastructure of the domestic
foreign exchange market. The primary objective has been to help avoid
disorderly fluctuations of the renminbi once it is allowed to float more freely.
These changes are being implemented gradually. First, 13 Chinese and foreign
banks have been authorised as market-makers in the renminbi spot market.
Second, market-making and over-the-counter (OTC) trading systems have been
officially introduced. These two measures allow market-makers and other
qualified participants in the onshore renminbi spot market to trade directly with
each other rather than only through a centralised matching system, although
that system will continue to operate in parallel. The new OTC system will still
operate within the China Foreign Exchange Trade System under the auspices of
the central bank. Such expanded trading could lead to greater exchange rate
flexibility. Third, the renminbi’s central parity is now set as a weighted average

of the collected quotes of the market-makers before the trading of the same
business day, rather than based on the closing price of the previous trading
day. Through the removal of any possible crawling peg-type mechanism, the
renminbi/dollar spot rate may now move significantly from one trading day to
the next. Finally, the authorities have allowed domestic financial institutions,
including banks, insurance companies and fund management firms, to invest in
overseas securities under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme.
The effect of the initial changes in July differed across currencies. It was
very limited on the main currencies. The only visible reaction was the 2%
appreciation of the yen against the dollar in the first few hours after the
announcement. In contrast, the changes had wider implications within the
Asian region. The most immediate consequence was the move by the
Malaysian authorities from a US dollar peg to a managed float for the ringgit.
In addition, most Asian emerging market currencies appreciated by 2% against
the US dollar.
Pressure on the renminbi eased in the months following the regime
change, and the renminbi/dollar exchange rate remained very stable for several
months. Only in early 2006 were there signs that the monetary authorities in
China were allowing the renminbi to appreciate following renewed upward
pressure (Graph V.8). Between the beginning of 2006 and mid-May, the currency
gained about 1% against the dollar.

Net income and the sustainability of the US external position
Despite the steady deterioration in the US current account and international
investment position since the early 1990s, the US net income balance has
been consistently in surplus and relatively stable as a share of GDP, although
deficits have been reported in two of the past four quarters (Graph V.7). The
fact that the United States has continued to run a net income surplus, while
accumulating foreign liabilities faster than foreign assets, has been highlighted
as an indication that the country’s external position is more sustainable than

88

BIS 76th Annual Report

it might at first appear. What follows explores this question in more detail,
bringing to bear the experiences of a range of industrialised countries to cast
further light on the US situation.

Trends and determinants of net income
The net income
balance can be
broken down into a
composition effect
and a return effect

The United States
is long equity and
short debt …

… but this does not
guarantee a net
income surplus

In an accounting sense, the US net income balance can be broken down into
a composition effect and a return effect. The composition effect mainly arises
because a relatively large share of foreign assets is made up of higher-risk,
high-yielding FDI, while a relatively large share of foreign liabilities is made up
of lower-risk, low-yielding portfolio debt (Table V.2). The return effect arises
because there has been a large and persistent yield differential between US
direct investment abroad and FDI in the United States.
The pattern of being long net equity assets and short net debt assets, which
underlies the composition effect, has been a feature of the US external position
for some time, although there have been important differences in the trends
of these stock variables (Graph V.7). The stock of net FDI assets has averaged
around 5% of GDP for the past three decades, albeit with significant swings
around this average, mostly relating to changes in FDI in the United States.
Offsetting this has been a sharp increase in the rate at which net portfolio debt
liabilities have accumulated since the mid-1990s. As will be discussed below,
the evolution of these trends is likely to be important looking forward.
The cross-country experience suggests that this “venture capitalist” profile
of being long net equity and short net debt is associated with consistent net
income surpluses in several countries, in particular France, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom and the United States (Graph V.9). Interestingly, the
United Kingdom and the United States are the only two countries to have
consistently run a net income surplus in combination with a current account
deficit over this period. However, this profile is neither sufficient, nor
necessary, for running a net income surplus. Hence, the composition effect
alone is unlikely to be able to explain the stability of the US net income surplus.

It is not sufficient because a number of venture capitalist countries, for example
Canada and Italy, have consistently run net income deficits. It is not necessary
because there are a number of countries, such as Japan and Switzerland,
which have consistently run net income surpluses with long net debt positions.
It has been argued that the United States gains a return advantage in
terms of a low income yield on some of its liabilities because they provide
liquidity and insurance services that are valuable to the purchaser. This
argument is particularly applicable to portfolio debt and other investment.
However, the yield differentials between assets and liabilities for these asset
classes are typically quite small (Table V.2).
For the United States, the return effect largely captures the differential
between income yields on US direct investment abroad and yields on FDI in
the United States. The income yield on US-owned direct investment abroad
has been on average around 5 percentage points higher than the income yield
on foreign-owned direct investment in the United States since the 1970s
(Graph V.10).
The importance of having a yield advantage in FDI is also apparent for a
number of other countries with net income surpluses. France, the Netherlands,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom also had a positive difference between
the income yields on their FDI assets and liabilities on average between 2000
and 2004 (Table V.3). For France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, these
differentials have been consistently positive since the early 1990s, averaging
1, 2 and 4 percentage points respectively. Interestingly, net income receipts on

Four main
explanations for
this differential:

riskier US direct
investment
abroad …

… “dark matter” …

FDI made the largest positive contribution to the net income balance in all
these countries over the past five years.
Four main explanations have been put forward as to why US residents’
direct investment abroad generates a higher income yield than FDI in the
United States: US direct investment abroad is riskier than FDI in the United
States; US FDI assets are bundled with relatively more knowledge-based
assets that, while unmeasured, still generate income, eg intellectual property
and branding (“dark matter”); the average age of FDI in the United States is
relatively low; and companies have tax incentives to minimise the income
reported by US affiliates.
There is little evidence that the United States earns a risk premium on its
FDI assets because they are located in places that are riskier than the United
States. One reason is that most FDI flows occur between the United States
and other countries with similarly high credit ratings: over 50% of US direct
investment abroad is in Europe, with a further 15% going to Australia, Canada
and Japan. In the reverse direction, over 70% of FDI in the United States
comes from Europe. Moreover, the United States does not appear to earn a
higher yield on assets located in countries with a lower sovereign debt rating.
In addition, the income yield on US direct investment abroad does not appear
to be more volatile, and therefore more risky, than the income yield on FDI in
the United States.
The dark matter explanation has received a lot of attention recently and
also addresses the question of why the yield on US direct investment abroad
should be high. However, the international evidence suggests that the more
relevant question is why foreigners earn such a low yield in the United States
(Table V.3). The yield on US direct investment abroad is indeed on the high
side compared with yields earned by other countries. This is reinforced by
taking into account that some countries measure FDI stocks at book rather
than market value, which typically leads to an overestimation of yields. All the
same, what stands out more clearly in the international comparison is that the

1 FDI assets and liabilities are reported at book value rather than market value. Based on national data
for France, Sweden and the United States, the ratio of market to book value lies in the range
of 11/4 to 13/4, suggesting that the income yields for assets and liabilities for these countries could be
overstated by a factor in this range. 2 Stocks valued at current cost. 3 2002–04.

Table V.3

main anomaly is the comparatively low income yield on FDI in the United
States, even when these measurement issues are factored in. This point is
confirmed by micro evidence, which shows that returns for foreigners investing
in the United States are also low compared with returns to local investment
by US firms.
There are several pieces of evidence which support the view that the
income generated by new investments increases over time, and that FDI in the
United States is relatively young compared with US direct investment abroad.
Evidence from firm-level data suggests that the earnings of foreign-controlled
firms rise to levels closer to those of US domestic firms over time, reflecting
a broader positive relationship between earnings and the age of investment
found in micro-level studies. In addition, it has been well documented that, at
least until the 1980s, the stock of US direct investment abroad was older than
the corresponding stock of FDI in the United States (Graph V.11). This can partly
be explained by US investment in Europe following the Second World War. The
rapid increase in net additions to the stock of FDI in the United States over the
1980s suggests that the average age of this stock could have fallen. Consistent
with this, the yield differential does appear to have widened over this period.

Since the 1980s, the stocks of assets and liabilities have been growing at
roughly comparable rates, which suggests that the average maturity of FDI
in the United States should be converging to that of the stock of US direct
investment abroad. This would imply that the yield gap should be closing
gradually. While the yield differential has fallen to close to its historical
average, there is no indication of an ongoing decline, which suggests that
relative age can only be part of any explanation of the yield differential.
Moreover, there does not seem to be a robust relationship between income
yields and the maturity of the FDI stocks using cross-country data.
Corporate tax rates could provide foreign-owned firms in the United States
with incentives to shift profits out of the United States and therefore report low
income flows from FDI in the United States. The profits of a foreign-owned US
affiliate could be shifted to the foreign parent, for example, by paying elevated
prices for imports from the parent firm, or charging the parent firm low prices
for its exports. The use of transfer pricing between affiliated companies in
this way would lower the reported income flows to the owners of FDI in the
United States, and increase the value of intra-firm trade in goods and services.
Therefore, there would be no net effect on the current account.
In a number of respects, this fourth hypothesis does appear to be part of
the explanation. While there is little direct evidence that transfer pricing is
used to minimise taxes, anecdotal evidence suggests that this does occur.
Moreover, there are incentives for foreign-owned firms in the United States to
shift profits to their foreign parent, and these appear to have grown over time.
While the average corporate tax rate across industrialised countries has been
falling steadily since the late 1980s, the US corporate tax rate has been roughly
constant and is now one of the highest. On a bilateral basis, differences in
corporate tax rates can be very large and are widely recognised as one of the
factors underlying the rapid increase in FDI inflows to countries such as
Ireland. Finally, there is evidence that reported reinvested earnings, which are
an important component of income for US direct investment abroad but not
for FDI in the United States, are influenced by tax considerations.

In summary, although yields on US direct investment abroad are high, the
US advantage on FDI is primarily related to the fact that foreigners appear to
earn low yields on their direct investment in the United States. The two most
promising explanations for these low yields are that FDI in the United States
is relatively young and that foreign parents have tax incentives to minimise
income reported in the United States. However, there are insufficient data to
quantify the relative importance of these two factors.

The sustainability of the US external balance
How likely is it that the negative impact of a large trade deficit on the US
external position will be offset by a net income surplus and positive valuation
effects going forward? Two negative quarterly net income balances in 2005
suggest that the US external position may be close to the point where the
income received from assets is no longer sufficient to offset income payments
made. More generally, the answer to this question depends on the evolution
of the stocks of foreign assets and liabilities, the evolution of income yields,
and the extent to which exchange rate and asset price movements generate

Note: The assumption that stocks of assets and liabilities grow in line with nominal GDP ensures that
the ratio of these stocks to GDP is constant, ceteris paribus. However, this assumption does not ensure
that the net asset position is equal to the last period’s net asset position plus the current account
balance and any valuation effects, which is an accounting identity. To ensure that this identity holds,
the difference between the net foreign asset positions generated by the baseline assumption and the
accounting relationship in each period is added to the baseline net foreign asset position. In particular,
the difference is allocated to the four classes of liabilities in proportion to their share in total liabilities
in 2004. A different allocation would lead to a different evolution of the net income balance.

valuation effects. The sensitivity of the net asset position and the net income
balance to each of these factors will be discussed in turn, using five scenarios.
As a benchmark for the analysis, it is assumed in scenario 1 that the trade
balance, current transfers and compensation of employees remain constant as
a share of GDP at their 2005 values, and that income yields do not change
(Table V.4). US nominal GDP is assumed to grow by 5.5% per year, which is
close to average growth over the past 10 years. The stocks of foreign assets
and liabilities are assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP. In addition,
adjustments are made to ensure that changes in the net asset position are
consistent with the value of the current account balance in each period. Under
scenario 1, the aggregate net foreign liability position increases from less than
25% of GDP in 2004 to over 50% by 2010 (Graph V.12). The net income
balance shifts into deficit from 2006 onwards and is –0.7% of GDP by 2010.
Scenario 2 tests the sensitivity of the US external position to an
improvement in the trade deficit, which dominates the current account deficit.
It assumes that the trade deficit falls from 5.8% to 3% of GDP in 2006 and
remains at this lower level. This change has a first-order effect: compared to
the first scenario, the net foreign liability position deteriorates less rapidly, and
is still less than 40% of GDP by 2010. There is also an improvement in the net
income balance, which reaches –0.3% of GDP by 2010.
The third scenario considers the sensitivity of the external position to
changes in income yields arising from changes in interest rates. During periods
of lower than average official interest rates, income payments tend to grow
less rapidly than the stock of portfolio debt liabilities (Graph V.13). During a
tightening cycle, such as that starting in mid-2004 in the United States, income
yields on these asset classes are likely to increase. In addition, looking forward,
the downward pressure on income yields from strong demand by Asian central
banks for safe liquid assets could be expected to fade.
Under this scenario, compared to scenario 1, the income yields for both
debt assets and liabilities are allowed to increase by 0.4 percentage points per

year until 2010. This is based on the historical correlation between US interest
rates and yields on portfolio debt liabilities, and the increases seen in the
federal funds rate to date. The results suggest that a rise in the yield on debt
has a significant negative effect on the net income balance, leading to a deficit
of 1.6% of GDP by 2010 compared with a deficit of 0.7% under scenario 1, and
to a further deterioration in the net foreign asset position.
Scenario 4 illustrates the effect of a change in the path of income yields
on FDI. The analysis above suggests that there are two factors which could be
important for FDI yields going forward. The first is that the stock of FDI in the
United States is maturing and this may be associated with an increase in the
income yield on these liabilities. The second is that corporate tax rates in the
United States have become increasingly high relative to those in the rest of the
industrialised world. This suggests that the incentives to shift profits out of the
United States are, if anything, growing, and this could have an offsetting
negative effect on the yields of FDI in the United States. Given that the
analysis above does not provide an unambiguous indication of the likely path
of FDI yields, it is assumed in an adverse scenario that yields on FDI steadily
converge to around 6%, which is the midpoint between yields on assets and
liabilities in 2005 and close to the average yield on US FDI assets between
2000 and 2004. This generates deteriorations in the net income balance
and the net foreign asset position that are similar to those yielded by the
assumptions underlying scenario 3.
The fifth scenario considers the sensitivity of the US external position to
valuation effects. Unlike the external liabilities of many other countries, US
external liabilities are almost entirely denominated in domestic currency,
whereas two thirds of US assets abroad are denominated in foreign currency.
Around one quarter of these foreign currency assets are denominated in euros,
a quarter in other European currencies such as sterling and the Swiss franc,
and another quarter in Canadian dollars, Caribbean currencies and the yen.
This currency mismatch between assets and liabilities, combined with the
degree of leverage in the external position, means that exchange rate

Valuation effects
may also be
important

movements can be an important source of valuation effects. Historically,
valuation effects have been positive for the United States, with the result that
the net foreign asset position has deteriorated by less than the current account
balance alone would suggest.
Under scenario 5, it is assumed that, because of a valuation effect, foreign
assets as a percentage of GDP increase by 10% in 2006. In the absence of
precise estimates, there are at least two possible proxies that provide some
idea of the possible magnitude of exchange rate movements that could result
in a valuation effect of this size. First, the fact that two thirds of assets are
denominated in foreign currencies suggests that a uniform 15% depreciation of
the US dollar against these currencies would be consistent with the assumed
valuation effect, ceteris paribus. Second, historical correlations suggest that a
10% increase in assets would be associated with a depreciation of the US
nominal effective exchange rate of around 25%.
Scenario 5 demonstrates that a positive valuation effect has a significant
one-off positive impact on the US external position compared with scenario 1.
Although it is deteriorating at a more rapid pace, by 2010 the net income
balance is roughly in line with where it would be under scenario 2, which
assumes that the trade deficit improves to 3% of GDP. However, by 2010, the
net asset position under scenario 5 deteriorates significantly further than under
scenario 2. Scenario 5a demonstrates the impact of consecutive 10% valuation
effects in both 2006 and 2007. The consequences of this assumption are
significant enough to ensure that the net income balance remains in surplus
until 2010, and that the ratio of net foreign assets to GDP only deteriorates by
10 percentage points between 2006 and 2010.
In summary, the most important change required for an improvement in
the US external position would be an improvement in the trade balance, which
would result in a slower deterioration in the net asset position. Positive
valuation effects associated with a dollar depreciation could also be important,
but would have a one-off impact. As such, unless they are repeated, they
would simply postpone rather than permanently offset the deterioration in the
external position. Changes in income yields also have a significant effect on
the income balance and the net foreign asset position. However, given the
historical relationship between interest rates and income yields on debt, these
effects are likely to lead to a further deterioration rather than an improvement
in the external position.

VI. Financial markets

Highlights
Conditions in the major financial markets remained calm and accommodative
for much of 2005 and early 2006, reflecting the surprisingly strong performance
of the world economy and still abundant liquidity. The tightening of monetary
policy in the advanced industrial countries resulted only gradually in higher
long-term yields. During most of the period under review, higher interest rates
had little discernible impact on the prices of other assets, although in mid-May
2006 a reassessment of risks led to increased volatility and sharp falls in equity
and emerging markets.
Equity prices and credit spreads, in Japan and Europe especially, benefited
from upward revisions to the growth outlook in 2005 and early 2006. Robust
economic activity in the face of flattening yield curves led many market
participants to conclude that the information content of the slope of the yield
curve might have diminished, and that factors other than the long-term
growth outlook might be weighing on long-term yields.
Another source of support for equity markets was changes in firms’ capital
structure. Last year saw an impressive pickup in dividend payouts, share
buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. Credit spreads remained stable
despite signs that the releveraging of the corporate sector had begun.
Investors’ high appetite for risk helped to keep spreads down. This was
especially evident in emerging markets, where the tightening of spreads in
2005 and early 2006 appeared to proceed more rapidly than the improvement,
admittedly sizeable, in fundamentals.

Long-term yields remained low
Government bond yields in developed countries continued to trade at
remarkably low levels during 2005. This was so despite the ongoing US rate
hikes by the Federal Reserve, signs of an imminent tightening of monetary
policy in the euro area and increased speculation about the end of quantitative
easing in Japan (see Chapter IV).
Long-term yields in the G3 finally rose steadily from mid-January 2006
(Graph VI.1). At the time, concerns dissipated about possible weakness in the
growth outlook and expectations were revised upwards regarding the pace and
amplitude of prospective monetary tightening. Indeed, 2006 growth forecasts
were scaled up for the euro area in the first quarter of the year, and quite
sharply so for Japan (Graph VI.2). Increasingly hawkish rhetoric from the G3
central banks lent further momentum to the sell-off in bonds. From 18 January
to 19 May, 10-year US Treasury and German bund rates rose by around 80 basis
points, and Japanese government bond yields by around 50.

Rising policy rates and low long-term bond yields resulted in a marked
flattening of the US yield curve during much of the period under review. In the
past, an inversion of the yield curve had proved to be a relatively robust
indicator of an imminent recession or sharp slowdown (see Chapter IV). This
time, however, most market participants interpreted the negative slope of the
US term structure not as a sign of a macroeconomic slowdown but as the
result of independent factors weighing on long-term yields (see below). From
around 30 basis points at end-June 2005, the spread between two-year and
10-year rates declined to close to zero by early January 2006.
Factors related to the growth outlook that did lower US yields were only
temporary. These included, notably, Hurricane Katrina in late August. At that
time, two-year rates declined by nearly 40 basis points over the course of three
days, and longer-term rates by around half as much, as market participants

revised sharply downwards their assessment of the likelihood of rate increases
by the Federal Reserve. However, as the hurricane had a much smaller impact
on growth and the resulting policy stance than initially foreseen, within a month
rates on both the long and short end were back where they had been before
the storm.
A flattening of the term structure was observed in other markets as well,
but was by no means universal. For instance, the yield curve flattened in the euro
area in 2005, though continuing low policy rates prevented it from inverting
(Graph VI.3). In Japan, by contrast, the curvature of the term structure
increased, as policy rates remained close to zero but medium-term rates rose
in line with accumulating evidence that deflationary pressures were ebbing
and speculation that a tightening cycle would be well under way in a few
years’ time.

Subdued inflation expectations
Long-term yields remained low in 2005 in part due to long-term inflation
expectations. These were contained despite the generally good economic
growth and continuing increase in energy prices during the period under
review. To be sure, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and sharp rises in the
prices of refined petroleum products in autumn 2005, analysts’ short-term
forecasts of inflation moved noticeably higher, particularly in the United States
(Graph VI.2). However, measures of inflation compensation derived from
nominal and real forward bond yields remained subdued at longer maturities,
in part reflecting the continued high credibility of monetary policy (see
Chapter IV).
Even when nominal yields rose markedly in early 2006, shifts in inflation
expectations were not the dominant factor. Comparing the yields on nominal
and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, nearly two thirds of the increase in
US 10-year nominal yields between mid-January and mid-May can be
accounted for by higher real rates, rather than higher inflation compensation.

In the case of the euro area, nearly nine tenths of the rise in 10-year nominal
yields in early 2006 was due to increased real rates.
The rather limited effect of changing inflation expectations on long-term
yields is also confirmed by other pieces of evidence. In particular, on a highfrequency basis, unexpected price index readings tended to have less of
an impact on long-term yields than other data “surprises”. For instance, the
largest single daily increase in US 10-year yields (14 basis points) followed
an unexpectedly upbeat report on manufacturing released by the Institute
for Supply Management in combination with signs of improving consumer
confidence on 1 July 2005. Similarly, some of the largest downward daily
moves in yields tended to be associated with negative growth surprises.

Low volatilities and term premia
Lower term premia
may explain
flattening curves

Low long-term yields and flattening curves may also have reflected lower risk
premia for holding long-term instruments. Yield curves at a given point in time
incorporate risk premia – often referred to as term premia – that drive a wedge
between forward rates across maturities and the path of short rates expected
by market participants. A decline in these premia might capture either reduced
perceptions of risk about the longer-term course of short rates or an increased
appetite on the part of investors to bear that risk, or both.
There is indeed some prima facie evidence consistent with a role for
decreasing term premia over the past few years. Not least, implied volatilities
on long-term rates have generally been declining since mid-2003, and by early
2006 were at very low levels for the United States and the euro area, in line
with observed movements in historical volatility over the period (Graph VI.4).
An exception was Japan, where both realised and implied volatilities increased
modestly starting in 2005, along with expectations of higher economic growth

and the associated end of quantitative easing. Even there, however, both still
remained well below the levels reached during the sharp bond market sell-off
of 2003.
Modern models of the term structure of interest rates offer techniques to
distinguish the component in bond yields due to term premia from that due to
expectations about future short-term interest rates. Updated estimates from a
recent study published by the Federal Reserve Board suggest that term premia
on 10-year US dollar bonds declined by around 100 basis points between the
time the Federal Reserve began to raise rates in mid-2004 and the end of 2005
(Graph VI.4). This was followed by only a modest correction in early 2006. A
similar study at the ECB estimates a decline in term premia for 10-year euro rates
of a roughly similar magnitude. Both studies find term premia decreases to be
more pronounced for longer maturities, and thus consistent with curve flattening
observed over the period. Admittedly, estimates of term premia have their
limitations, including great uncertainty about their accuracy, and high sensitivity
of the estimates to sample size and time period. Even so, most other studies also
suggest that some decline in term premia has taken place over the last few years.
Term premia might have declined due to greater perceived stability in
macroeconomic fundamentals, such as inflation and growth, and thus lower
perceived risks in holding long-dated securities. The decline in historical
volatility for longer-term interest rates, mentioned above, is consistent with a
moderation in risks. Greater transparency and credibility of monetary policy,
particularly to the extent this reflects permanent changes in operating
procedures, may well have been an important part of the story.
Structural demand factors might also have played a role. These include
purchases of long-term bonds by pension funds and insurance companies, as
well as the build-up of reserves by central banks in East Asia and several oilexporting countries. The degree to which demand factors such as these might
be contributing to low long-term rates has important implications for the
conduct of monetary policy (see Chapter IV).

Institutional demand factors: pension funds and insurance companies
Advances in risk management and changes in the accounting and regulatory
frameworks in many countries have encouraged pension funds and insurance
companies to reduce the duration mismatch between their assets and liabilities
(see Chapter VII) over the past few years.
Although the size of the bond holdings of pension funds and insurance
companies relative to the total amount of bonds outstanding has remained
strikingly stable (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel), the decline in the spread
between 30-year bonds and 10-year bonds in many advanced economies
suggests that the composition of these portfolios may have shifted towards
longer-dated assets (Graph VI.5, centre panel). This shift appears to have been
particularly large in the United Kingdom, where term spreads have been
negative for some time. This is consistent with reports that strict minimum
funding requirements and the implementation of the accounting standard FRS
17 have resulted in large purchases of very long-term bonds by UK pension
funds as yields have declined, triggering further declines in yields.

Graph VI.5

Nevertheless, it is not clear how far the UK experience can be generalised
to other countries, given remaining differences in the regulatory and accounting
frameworks as well as in the funding levels of pension funds. In the
Netherlands, for instance, the average pension fund increased the duration of
its assets from five to six and a half years after reforms were enacted in
autumn 2004 (Graph VI.5, right-hand panel), although there was substantial
variation across funds. Some funds almost doubled the duration of their
assets, while others left it almost unchanged. This may be related to the fact
that funding levels of the Dutch pension sector tend to be well above the
mandatory floor, which gives funds considerable flexibility in managing their
interest rate risk.
There were also signs during the period under review that the trend
towards a more market-oriented framework might have been losing some
momentum. A postponement of full implementation of the Dutch pension
reform to 2007 may have contributed to a modest decline of half a year in
the average duration of pension fund assets in that country. In the United
States, a reform of minimum funding requirements was passed by Congress
in late 2005. However, the reform was considerably less strict than the initial
proposal, and may have contributed to a rebound of the spread between
30- and 10-year Treasuries in early 2006, as traders who had speculated on
additional buying pressure from pension funds reportedly unwound their
positions in long-term bonds. Also limiting the incentives for pension funds to
purchase long-term bonds in early 2006 were increases in equity prices and
bond yields, which at least temporarily improved the funding position of
many pension funds.

Foreign demand factors: Asian reserves and petrodollars

Treasuries and other US quasi-government securities, largely as a result of
intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Indeed, there is ample anecdotal
evidence that financial markets respond to news that might signal changes in
official preferences for US dollar securities. For example, 10-year dollar yields
rose by nearly 10 basis points within a few hours of the announcement of the
renminbi revaluation on 21 July 2005, as speculators anticipated significantly
lower demand for US securities.
Even though the accumulation of reserves by Japan slowed considerably
in 2005, China and other major emerging economies in Asia-Pacific continued
to experience strong reserve growth well into 2006 (see Chapter V). Much of this
was invested in US securities. As shown in the left-hand panel of Graph VI.6,
preliminary data based on the US TIC survey indicate that holdings of US
long-term securities by residents (both official and private) of Asian countries
(excluding Japan) grew strongly in 2005. The combined holdings of these
investors increased to an estimated $1.25 trillion by early 2006, from just over
$800 billion at end-2004.
The reinvestment of export revenues by oil-exporting countries has also
been cited as a source of demand for US securities. Estimated net oil revenues
for the major oil exporters (OPEC members plus Mexico, Norway and Russia)
reached $676 billion in 2005, and are forecast at almost $750 billion for 2006.
A portion of these revenues has been directly invested in US securities. Estimates
based on the TIC data indicate that oil exporters channelled roughly 20%, or
$200 billion, of their cumulative oil revenues between June 2002 and June 2005
($1.2 trillion) into short- and long-term US securities. While the accumulation
of US long-term securities grew strongly until 2004, it rose by only $33 billion
in 2005, or 8% of cumulative oil revenues during the year.
The estimates of investment in US dollar securities by Asian investors and
oil-exporting countries discussed above, however, almost certainly underestimate

their total exposure. These investors often purchase securities via third parties
in London or other financial centres outside the United States. To be sure, the
TIC benchmark surveys attempt to reallocate these third-party purchases to
the residence of the ultimate purchaser. This usually results in large drops in
the estimated holdings of US long-term securities by residents of the United
Kingdom and, at times, jumps in the estimated holdings of Asian investors
(Graph VI.6). However, these investors’ exposure to US securities may be even
larger than that estimated in the benchmark surveys to the extent that they
place funds in hedge funds or other investment vehicles which invest in US
securities.

Equity markets shrugged off rate increases
Rising equity
prices …

The rally in global equity markets which had begun in early 2003 continued
apace during most of the period under review. After a modest performance in
2004, markets around the world posted double digit gains in 2005. Many markets
rose still further in the early part of 2006 before falling back in mid-May. The
largest increases were recorded in emerging markets. Eastern European
markets rose by 55% in local currency terms in 2005 and a further 15% over the
first five months of 2006, notwithstanding a sharp fall in mid-May (Graph VI.7).
In major markets, too, prices soared. Japanese equity markets jumped by 44%
in 2005 before price increases moderated in the early part of 2006. The US
market underperformed most others, rising by only 4% between early 2005
and mid-May 2006.

Macroeconomic outlook underpinned equity gains
… reflecting robust
economic growth

The rise in equity prices was underpinned by the unexpectedly robust
performance of the world economy (see Chapter II). In Japan and the euro
area, the improved economic outlook prompted investors to revise upwards

their earnings expectations. Additional impetus was provided in Japan by
hopes of structural reform and the widespread view that the banks’ nonperforming loan problems had largely been resolved. In emerging markets,
too, earnings forecasts were revised upwards. In many emerging markets,
investor confidence was bolstered by high commodity prices. Indeed, the
highest equity price gains were recorded by oil exporters such as Russia,
where prices have more than doubled over the past year.
Rising emerging market equity prices coincided with massive inflows of
foreign capital (see Chapter III). However, there was no clear relationship
between the size of foreign portfolio investment and stock market performance
during the period, across either regions or countries. The cross-sectional
correlation between portfolio investment flows and monthly local currency
returns was close to zero, irrespective of whether inflows are measured in
absolute terms or as a proportion of the host country’s market capitalisation.
A possible reason for this weak relationship is that ample demand for emerging
market equities met high supply. Consistent with this explanation, corporations
in emerging Asia announced international equity issues totalling $57 billion in
2005, up from $34 billion in the previous year.
In the United States, macroeconomic conditions were less supportive
of equity prices than elsewhere. Solid economic growth had been widely
anticipated and so was already incorporated into valuations. The tightening of
monetary policy probably contributed to the underperformance of US equities,
although its impact was mitigated by the fact that the tightening had been
largely anticipated and that higher policy rates only gradually fed through to
higher long-term yields. Unusually severe hurricanes on the US Gulf coast
unsettled markets in September 2005, but prices rebounded when it became
clear that the impact on US economic growth was only transitory.

Low correlation of
capital flows and
returns

Releveraging and mergers accelerated
Changes in firms’ capital structure were another source of support for equity
markets. Whereas between 2001 and 2004 firms had directed their cash flows
towards strengthening their balance sheets, more recently they shifted their
focus to returning cash to shareholders through dividend payouts, share
buybacks and acquisitions. In 2004-05, dividends paid by S&P 500 companies
increased at their fastest rate in more than a decade. Share buybacks
increased faster still; S&P 500 companies spent almost $350 billion purchasing
their own shares in 2005 (Graph VI.8). As a result of buybacks and acquisitions,
the total amount of equity retired by US firms reached a record high of $300
billion in 2005.
European and Japanese companies raised their dividends even more
rapidly than US firms. The high rates of dividend growth may have helped to
underpin investors’ confidence by signalling that management expected high
rates of earnings growth to be maintained. European and Japanese firms also
engaged in share buybacks, although not on the same scale as their US
counterparts.
In addition to their signalling effect, higher dividends and share buybacks
supported equity prices by releveraging companies’ balance sheets. To the

LBOs rose to their
highest level since
the 1980s

extent that dividends and share repurchases increase a firm’s debt/equity ratio,
they boost returns on equity. Prior to 2004, the majority of shares repurchased
by companies were reissued to employees exercising stock options. Therefore,
they had no impact on firms’ capital structure. Increasingly, however, firms
have used buybacks to reduce their share count and return cash to shareholders.
Similarly, the payment of special dividends has become a popular way for
private equity investors to recoup their investment. In the past, private equity
investors had typically sold their stake in a company through an initial public
offering (IPO) of shares. Investor demand for IPOs, however, was relatively
weak in 2005: returns on the first day of trading were about 10%, compared to
over 20% on average since 1990. Accordingly, private equity investors turned
to debt markets to fund large dividend payments out of the retained earnings
of their ventures (see Chapter VII).
Releveraging was further boosted by a surge in leveraged buyouts
(LBOs). Debt-financed takeover bids by private equity investors soared in 2005
to levels not seen since the LBO wave in the late 1980s (Graph VI.8). In
contrast to the 1980s, the recent increase in buyout activity was not limited to
the United States; more than half of all deals involved non-US targets, mainly
in Europe but also in Asia. Especially notable was the surge in LBOs in
Germany and Japan, where obstacles to changes in corporate control, such as
cross-shareholdings among firms, have gradually been removed. For example,
whereas in 1992 about 50% of all shares listed in Japan were held by related
companies, by 2004 that percentage had halved.
The pickup in LBO activity was part of a larger increase in mergers and
acquisitions (M&As). Acquisitions totalling $3.2 trillion were announced in 2005,
up almost 30% from 2004 and the highest level since 2000 (Graph VI.9). LBOs
accounted for about 9% of all deals, much higher than in 2000, albeit far below
the peak of 22% in 1988. The increase in M&As was broadly spread around the

globe. Slightly less than half of all deals involved US targets, and another
quarter were European targets. Companies based in emerging markets were
more active than ever before, buying firms in major and other emerging
markets.
Equity investors responded more positively to the latest wave of dealmaking than they had to previous ones. In 2005, both the target’s and the
acquirer’s share prices tended to increase following the announcement of a
takeover. This contrasts with historical experience, namely that any gains
in shareholder value resulting from mergers were captured mainly by the
shareholders of the target company.
The relatively positive reaction of investors partly reflected the smaller
share of deals financed in whole or in part with equity. In the United States,
about 30% of recent deals were paid for with shares, compared to about 70%
during the previous M&A boom in 1998–2000. In Europe and Asia, the
proportion of deals paid for with shares was even lower. The right-hand
panel of Graph VI.9 plots the average “abnormal” return for the stock price of
acquiring companies on the day an acquisition is announced, ie the return after
controlling for the stock’s sensitivity to market-wide price movements. Mergers
financed with cash consistently perform better than mergers financed with
equity: the abnormal return is higher in any given period. This seems to be
because the tendency to overpay for the target is lessened when mergers are
financed with cash.
More strikingly, for both cash- and equity-financed deals, abnormal returns
for the equity price of acquiring firms were higher in 2004–06 than in previous
years; investors were more receptive than they had been in the past to all
types of acquisitions. In 1998–2000 abnormal returns on cash deals were
about zero and on equity deals were significantly negative. By contrast, in

Conflicting signals about valuations
By some measures,
valuations were not
unusually high

Implied volatility
stayed low …

One possible explanation for investors’ more positive view of acquisitions is
that market valuations seemed low by some, albeit not all, measures. In
markets around the world, recent price increases have been outpaced by
upward revisions to earnings forecasts. The S&P 500 was trading at 15 times
short-term earnings forecasts in 2005, slightly below its 1988–2004 average of
16 (Graph VI.10). Euro area markets were trading at 13, compared to their
historical average of 16. In emerging equity markets, too, price/earnings (P/E)
multiples were well below their earlier levels. Therefore, the risk of overpaying
for acquisitions might have been perceived to be lower than in the past.
In most markets, investors seemed comfortable with valuations and the
outlook for returns. Implied volatility in equity index options remained very
low. For example, for the S&P 500 it fluctuated around 12% for much of 2005 and
the early part of 2006, close to the previous lows reached in 1995 (Graph VI.10).
The most noticeable increase during the period occurred in mid-May 2006,
when stock markets around the world fell sharply.
Of course, there were exceptions. In Japan, P/E ratios increased sharply in
the second half of 2005, from 15 to 19, as prices soared. In addition, volatility
as implied by options on the Nikkei index more than doubled between June
and December 2005, from around 10% to 25%, suggesting that uncertainty
about the future direction of equity prices rose in tandem with valuations.
In Middle Eastern markets, local investors flush with oil revenues drove
valuations to spectacular highs. Even after prices had plummeted by about

These exceptions aside, it is unclear whether investors’ apparent
confidence in the outlook for market returns reflected a heightened willingness
to bear risks or perceptions of continued low risks; both factors influence
measures of implied volatility. For much of the past year, estimates of risk
appetite in equity markets, derived by comparing the distribution of expected
returns implied by option prices with the distribution of historical returns,
were relatively high. However, if investors’ appetite for equity risk was high,
then it is puzzling why valuations appeared to remain relatively low.
One possible answer to this puzzle is that valuations were in fact higher
than indicated by multiples based on short-term earnings forecasts. In 2005,
returns on equity and profits as a share of GDP were close to their historical
highs, at least in the United States (Graph VI.11). If profitability were to revert
to some longer-term trend, then equities would look expensive. Taking a 10year trailing average of earnings to smooth out cyclical variation, P/E multiples
for US equities in late 2005 were well above their long-term average: about 26,
compared to 19 over the 1962–2005 period.
There are signs that analysts were more sceptical than in the past about
the sustainability of short-term gains in profitability. The right-hand panel of
Graph VI.11 plots analysts’ one-year-ahead forecasts of the growth of operating
earnings against the actual growth of earnings for the S&P 500 over the past
20 years. In only four years out of the past 20 did actual earnings growth
exceed forecast growth – and three of those years were the period 2003–05.
In other words, analysts who have historically been overly optimistic about the
strength of corporate earnings have, since 2003, been overly pessimistic. If this
pessimism were shared by investors, it would be consistent with expectations
that profitability will eventually revert to its longer-term trend.
Looking forward, some scepticism about the strength of earnings would
appear to be justified. The downside risks to the outlook for corporate earnings

Troubles of auto
companies

Despite the accelerated pace of leveraged buyouts and other shareholderfriendly actions, corporate bond and credit default swap spreads in 2005 and
early 2006 stayed close to their cyclical lows (Graph VI.12). The long rally in
credit markets came to an end in the second quarter of 2005, when a series of
negative corporate announcements, including the downgrade of General
Motors and Ford to below investment grade, triggered a modest sell-off. While
corporate spreads never fully recovered from the sell-off, they did not move
sharply wider either. Spreads on investment grade corporate debt inched
higher in late 2005 and early 2006 to levels comparable to those reached
during the sell-off. Yet, at 83 basis points in mid-May 2006, spreads on A-rated
corporate bonds denominated in US dollars were still within 20 basis points of
their cyclical low. Meanwhile, spreads on speculative grade corporate bonds
were more than 100 basis points below their May 2005 high and only 40 basis
points above their March 2005 low.
Some companies did face markedly higher financing costs. The troubles
of US automobile firms worsened in 2005, as they struggled both to contain
legacy costs arising from pension and health insurance schemes and to adapt
their business strategy to increasing competition. Following a brief rally in
mid-2005, Ford and General Motors saw their spreads widen in late 2005
to levels well above those at the peak of the earlier sell-off. So, too, did US
auto suppliers such as Delphi and Dana, both of which eventually declared
bankruptcy. Almost 5% of rated auto firms defaulted in 2005, a higher share
than in any other sector.

In addition, creditors repriced the debt of companies targeted in leveraged
buyouts or otherwise under pressure to releverage. For example, credit default
swaps on US forest products firm Georgia-Pacific jumped by about 250 basis
points in mid-November 2005 following a bid to buy out existing shareholders.
Investors seemed especially sensitive to the possibility of releveraging by
investment grade issuers, given that such issuers are by definition in a better
position than speculative grade ones to service additional debt.

Divergent appetites for different risks
It was this greater sensitivity to credit event risk that lay behind the modest
widening of investment grade credit spreads. Investors seemed worried about
the impact of dividend increases, share buybacks, mergers and leveraged
buyouts on individual companies. Yet, at the same time, they seemed unfazed
about the impact of such activities on the creditworthiness of the corporate
sector as a whole.
Investors’ appetite for credit risk apparently never quite recovered from
the turmoil in corporate bond and credit default swap (CDS) markets in the
second quarter of 2005. An estimate of risk appetite in credit markets is plotted
in the left-hand panel of Graph VI.13. This estimate corresponds to the ratio
of default probabilities derived from credit spreads to those derived from
underlying balance sheet information, for a sample of investment grade
companies. It suggests that the compensation demanded by investors for
bearing credit risk rose noticeably in April and May 2005 – albeit from an
exceptionally low level – and remained relatively high thereafter.
Measures of discrimination in corporate bond markets show a similar
reversal. The right-hand panel of Graph VI.13 illustrates the distribution of

Investment grade

opposite directions

A-rated corporate bond spreads. Spreads were clustered together very closely
in March 2005, before the sell-off. They have since become more dispersed, and
in April 2006 the distribution of spreads was close to its long-term average.
Strictly speaking, the indicators plotted in Graph VI.13 combine two
different types of risk premia: compensation for bearing systematic risk and
compensation for bearing credit event risk. The former is driven largely by
changes in macroeconomic conditions. The latter, also known as jump-todefault risk, reflects aversion to uncertainty about the timing and severity of
default losses on individual credit exposures. In equity markets, investors tend
not to demand compensation for bearing such idiosyncratic risks because, in
a well diversified portfolio, the variability of some assets will be offset by that
of others. In credit markets, by contrast, premia for seemingly firm-specific
risks appear to account for a significant proportion of credit spreads. This may
be because events at one firm have a contagion effect by signalling an increase
in default risk at other firms. Alternatively, it may be because corporate bond
portfolios are inherently difficult to diversify.
While it is difficult to decompose the estimated risk premium, anecdotal
evidence suggests that the increase in 2005 and early 2006 was more likely to
have been driven by a weaker appetite for credit event risk than by a change
in investors’ appetite for systematic risk. First, equity market indicators, such as
implied volatilities, do not suggest a decline in investors’ appetite for systematic
risk (see above). In principle, appetite for such risk should be similar across
asset classes, given its dependency on economy-wide developments.
Second, spread movements across different rating categories are
suggestive of a divergence in investors’ appetite for different types of risk. As
the credit quality of a bond declines, its return behaves increasingly like an
equity return. Therefore, systematic risk tends to explain a larger proportion of
returns on high-yield bonds than on high-grade bonds. Consistent with a weak
appetite for credit event risk and a high appetite for systematic risk, speculative
grade corporate bonds have outperformed investment grade bonds over the
past year. In the first quarter of 2006, high-yield spreads tightened by about
40 basis points even as investment grade spreads remained unchanged
(Graph VI.12). Moreover, investment grade firms have come under increasing
pressure from creditors to include change of control covenants in their bond
issues, to limit losses to existing bondholders in the event of a leveraged
buyout. At the same time, private equity funds have raised substantial
amounts on favourable terms to finance such buyouts (see Chapter VII).

Corporate balance sheets remained strong

Corporate leverage
ratios were low in

The divergence in investors’ appetite for different types of risk reflects, at least
in part, the strength of corporate balance sheets at the current juncture. The
accelerated pace of shareholder-friendly actions slowed the improvement in
corporate credit quality in 2005, but it did not reverse it.
In the United States, the ratio of net debt to cash flows declined in 2005
to its lowest level since the mid-1990s (Graph VI.14). This was despite a sharp
pickup in borrowing by non-financial corporations, partly driven by investment
and working capital needs, but also to finance acquisitions. In aggregate,

BIS 76th Annual Report

113

however, this additional debt was more than offset by the exceptionally rapid
growth of earnings. Furthermore, US companies continued to add to their
cash reserves, although at a slower pace than in previous years.
Euro area firms were slower than US firms to rebuild their balance sheets;
in 2005 leverage ratios were still close to their cyclical highs. Nevertheless, the
ratio of net debt to cash flows declined in 2005 for the second consecutive
year. As in the United States, profit growth underpinned the decline. German
firms in particular were able to raise their profit margins despite the modest
pace of economic growth. By contrast, Italian firms struggled to maintain their
profit margins.
In Japan, leverage ratios declined to their lowest levels in over two
decades. In contrast to previous years, when debt reduction had been the
main driver of declines in the net debt/cash flow ratio, an acceleration in
the growth rate of earnings was responsible for most of the decline in 2005.
This acceleration was driven by domestically oriented firms, whose profits
were boosted by the recovery in domestic demand. Debt repayments again
exceeded new borrowing, but by the smallest margin since the mid-1990s.
More and more firms elected to increase capital spending or build up their
cash reserves instead of further paying down their debt.
Looking forward, indications of pressure on corporate credit quality
are emerging. As mentioned earlier, corporate borrowing is accelerating.
Furthermore, downgrades of non-financial corporations edged upwards as a
percentage of all rating actions in 2005, not only in the United States but also
in Europe and Japan (Graph VI.15).
Nevertheless, owing to the strength of balance sheets for the corporate
sector as a whole, most market participants expect the turn in the credit cycle

to be gradual. Indeed, for the past year default rates have defied most analysts’
expectations of an increase and instead edged downwards. Fewer rated
issuers defaulted in the year to March 2006 than at any time since mid-1997
(Graph VI.15). Moreover, forward-looking estimates of default rates, calculated
by Moody’s KMV based on balance sheet information and equity price volatility,
remained near their cyclical lows in early 2006.

Vulnerability of credit markets to a repricing
Credit conditions

imbalances …

… an accelerated

… or developments
in structured
finance markets

If the credit cycle were to turn more quickly than presently expected, it could
lead to a rapid deterioration in corporate financing conditions. This would be
especially so in the event that the adjustment of existing macroeconomic
imbalances, such as the US current account deficit, resulted in weaker
economic growth (see Chapter II).
Even if growth remains robust, credit quality and therefore credit
conditions could be undermined by an accelerated pace of releveraging. M&A
activity continued to increase in the early months of 2006. LBOs became ever
larger and more leveraged. And it remained unclear what firms intended to do
with the substantial amount of cash they have accumulated in recent years:
invest it in profitable projects or return it to shareholders.
Developments in the market for structured products represent a further
vulnerability for credit conditions. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities
markets are among the largest, fastest-growing segments of global securities
markets. Moreover, recent years have seen a tremendous increase in the
range of new products and securitisation techniques. However, the performance
of many of these new products has yet to be tested during an economic
downturn. In the event that investors incur losses on these products in excess
of what they anticipate, it could trigger a repricing of risk across all markets.
One source of unanticipated losses could be modelling errors. The pricing
of structured products depends on quantitative models to a far greater extent

BIS 76th Annual Report

115

than does the pricing of corporate bonds. These models often incorporate
assumptions to simplify calculations. While these assumptions might have
seemingly benign consequences for estimates of expected losses when market
conditions are favourable, they could have costly consequences should
conditions deteriorate.
Unanticipated losses could also arise from shortcomings in risk
management. While expected losses are similar for like-rated corporate bonds
and structured products, uncertainty about the size and severity of losses is
greater for structured products. For example, the concentration of exposures
can have a significant impact on the distribution of structured products’
possible outcomes. Credit ratings do not capture the full distribution, and so
over-reliance on rating agency assessments could lead holders of structured
credit products to underestimate the risks to which they are exposed. The
credit ratings of structured finance securities tend to change less frequently
than those of corporate securities, but when they are downgraded they fall
further. According to Moody’s, the magnitude of downgrades averaged almost
four notches for structured finance securities over the 1984 –2004 period,
compared to less than two for corporate securities.
To illustrate the vulnerabilities posed by structured products, consider the
US mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market. It is the largest bond market in
the world, with outstandings of close to $6 trillion at the end of 2005, equivalent
to almost 50% of US GDP. Growth in recent years has been driven by the
securitisation of mortgage loans to borrowers not classified as prime; about
40% of MBS issuance in 2005 was backed by such loans, up from 10% in the
late 1990s. Pricing of mortgage pools is often based on the average credit
score (ie rating) of the underlying credits. Due to the non-linear relationship
between default rates and credit scores, the default probability associated with
the average credit score tends to underpredict the average default probability
calculated from the full distribution of scores. Losses from such underprediction
are not likely to be large in buoyant housing markets, but may increase sharply
in weaker markets. As a result, MBS investors may find themselves exposed
to losses in excess of what they had expected.
Furthermore, whereas historically the prepayment risk embedded in US
MBSs was influenced mainly by changes in interest rates, the prepayment risk
embedded in mortgage loans to rapidly growing borrower classes has become
increasingly sensitive to changes in the credit score of the borrower and
changes in house prices. For example, as house prices rise, the loan-to-value
ratio falls and so a borrower might choose to refinance in order to benefit
from lower mortgage costs. This further complicates the assessment and
management of the risks to which MBS holders are exposed.

Emerging market spreads at historical lows
Asset prices across emerging markets made impressive gains in 2005 and into
2006, even as monetary conditions tightened in several major developed
countries. The rally which started in mid-year pushed spreads on sovereign
bonds to historical lows, beyond the levels reached in 1997, prior to the Asian

financial crisis. This reduction in spreads was concentrated on bonds with the
highest yields, continuing the trend evident for the past few years.
Investors’ enthusiasm for emerging market assets stemmed in part from
perceptions about the strength of fundamentals. Improvements in recent years
in external positions, financial systems and fiscal and monetary policies have
made many emerging markets more resilient to shocks, thereby reducing the
risks associated with emerging market investments (see Chapter III). Indeed,
in 2005, sovereign rating upgrades by Moody’s outnumbered downgrades by
a ratio of about 3:1.
At the same time, spreads on emerging market bonds appear to be
somewhat lower than fundamentals, if measured by sovereign credit ratings,
would suggest. The JPMorgan Chase EMBI Global Diversified index of sovereign
spreads fell below 200 basis points in March and April 2006, about 100 basis
points below the previous record low reached in mid-1997, before widening
somewhat in May. Yet sovereign credit quality, as measured by credit ratings,
was not as high as it had been in 1997, notwithstanding the significant
improvement since 2001. Even within individual rating classes, spreads in early
2006 tightened beyond their previous lows in 1997 (Graph VI.16, left-hand and
centre panels).
The dispersion of spreads relative to ratings also suggests that demand
for emerging market assets might be leading investors to discriminate less
among borrowers than in the recent past. In early 2006, while sovereign
spreads clustered together more closely than ever before, sovereign ratings
remained widely dispersed, implying that there were significant differences
in the creditworthiness of the borrowers in the index not captured in the
distribution of spreads (Graph VI.16, right-hand panel).

An alternative view of the discrepancies in the mean and variation of
ratings relative to spreads is that they simply reflect changes in the criteria
used by the agencies to assign ratings. Since the Asian financial crisis, rating
agencies are widely reported to have placed more emphasis on liquidity risk
and the strength of financial systems, which may have led them to become
effectively stricter in their assignment of ratings. If so, the divergence between
ratings and spreads does not necessarily mean that the market’s assessment of
fundamentals in emerging markets is more optimistic compared with the past.
There is some statistical evidence to suggest that rating criteria may
indeed have tightened. Graph VI.17 shows the (average) actual ratings and
(average) predicted ratings based on a panel regression of sovereign ratings
on a set of economic variables for a relatively large sample of emerging market
economies. The model predicts average ratings of foreign currency sovereign
debt quite well during the 1995–2001 period. However, predicted ratings in the
out-of-sample window, 2002–05, tend to be higher than actual average ratings
during this period. For the entire sample of countries, the model suggests
that, by 2005, the average rating on foreign currency sovereign debt would
have approached BBB, about one notch higher than the actual average level,
closer to BBB–. At the same time, different model specifications yield less clear
results. For example, if those countries that maintained an investment grade
rating throughout the 1995–2005 period are excluded from the regression, the
difference in actual and predicted ratings is no longer evident.
Even taking such a tightening of rating criteria at face value, the change
would not be sufficient to account for the whole of the spread compression. The

centre panel of Graph VI.17 links spreads to fundamentals directly, bypassing
ratings. Predicted spreads in the 2002–05 period are higher – by about 90 basis
points at the end of 2005 – than average actual spreads across the sample of
countries. Yet, as shown in the right-hand panel, changes in criteria used by
rating agencies account for, at most, around half of this.
On balance, comparisons of emerging market spreads across time and
with credit ratings suggest that both an improvement in fundamentals –
perhaps beyond what is reflected in sovereign ratings – and an increase in
investors’ appetite for risk have helped to drive spreads to their current low
levels. To the extent that, by early 2006, spreads had tightened beyond levels
indicated by economic fundamentals, this suggests that emerging markets
were becoming more vulnerable to a repricing.

VII. The financial sector

Highlights
There was little change in the general picture of the financial sector in industrial
economies during the period under review. Positive performance in most lines
of business continued. Profitability was helped by growth in the demand for
credit and for other services related to capital market activities, by the abundant
supply of liquidity and by the very favourable credit environment. In those
cases where risks materialised, institutions were able to withstand them.
Capital cushions appear sufficient to absorb the impact of possible adverse
developments in the immediate future.
The potential sources of vulnerability remain inextricably linked to future
macroeconomic developments and the pace of adjustment of financial
imbalances. Signs suggesting a slowdown in certain types of activity and
increasing risks in others did emerge. Institutions remain exposed to common
risks associated with a likely return of interest rates to more normal levels and
a potential turn in the credit cycle. Bank exposures to real estate risk have
intensified and the possibility of a decline in credit growth could put pressure
on bank profits.
Overall, the coming years are likely to be more challenging for the
financial sector than the recent past. This puts a premium on proper risk
management and on preparations to deal with expected and unexpected
sources of strain. Risk management from the perspective of the financial system
as a whole depends critically on the quality of information available to market
participants regarding the financial condition of peers and counterparties.
A smooth interface between financial reporting standards, financial risk
management practices in individual firms and the prudential framework can
be a source of strength for the financial system. The last section of this
chapter explores these issues in some detail.

The performance of the financial sector
The generally positive performance of financial firms continued during the year
under review. With few exceptions, profitability remained high and sectors
facing adverse circumstances were able to confront them without undue
strain. The continuing intensification of competitive pressures, however, led to
a further compression of margins, compensated for by rapid growth in business
volumes. This growth could be vulnerable to shifts in the macroeconomic
environment.

… and credit
demand

Banks in most regions posted strong performance, extending the trend of the
past several years. Net interest margins narrowed further, reflecting competitive
pressures and flattening yield curves, notably in the United States. The growth
of interest revenue was thus driven by rapid loan extension compensating
for narrower margins. The return on assets changed little, largely as a result
of falling operating costs and minimal provisioning expenses, while the
contribution of non-interest income remained stable (Table VII.1).
US banks reported record earnings in 2005, with return on assets and
return on equity only slightly below their historical peak in 2003. Major
European banks also witnessed strong returns, although intertemporal
comparisons are complicated by the fact that most accounts were reported for
the first time under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). While
there was an impact on reported figures, including net interest margins,
impaired loans and capital, the transition does not appear to have imparted
undue volatility to financial statements.
The retail business remained central to banks’ good financial performance.
In many countries, mortgages dominated loan growth. In France and Spain,
the rapid pace of mortgage lending boosted revenue against the backdrop of
buoyant housing markets. In addition, asset management and the sale of
pension and insurance products contributed to non-interest income. The
continued expansion of the retail business showed few signs of abating, and
may well advance further in countries where personal indebtedness remains
relatively low, such as Italy.
Credit growth proceeded at various speeds in different countries,
conveying a mixed overall picture (Graph VII.1). Countries with weak credit

growth saw some improvement, while others, including Australia, Canada and
the United Kingdom, experienced a modest slowing. The euro area’s robust
credit growth rate of 11% conceals substantial differences among countries.
Whereas lending in Germany remained almost flat, the acceleration of lending
was great enough to strain deposit funding in Spain, where banks benefited
from solid growth both at home and in Latin America. Lending to businesses
gained momentum on both sides of the Atlantic. Lending standards vis-à-vis
firms eased, while those vis-à-vis households were reported to be broadly
unchanged. In the United States, the rate of growth of corporate lending
reached the pace of mortgage lending, while consumer lending slowed.
On the cost side, banks continued to reap the benefits from past
restructuring and rationalisation, while the favourable credit environment helped
further reduce the ratio of non-performing loans, especially on commercial
loans and mortgages. Correspondingly, loan loss provisions drifted towards
historically low levels in a number of countries as banks were not affected by
any major credit events. Indeed, no US bank failures have been recorded since
2004, the longest period without a failure in more than 70 years. Diversification
across locations and business lines helped banks overcome various challenges,
including natural disasters, litigation and the flattening yield curve. US credit
losses were largely confined to consumer loans, especially credit cards. Changes
in bankruptcy laws can only partly account for the surge in personal bankruptcy
filings in late 2005, given that consumer finances appear generally stretched.
The credit cycle appears to have turned already in the United Kingdom. Higher
interest rates and utility bills, coupled with the cooling housing market, strained
highly indebted UK consumers. The number of personal bankruptcies rose, and
with it the arrears and provisions banks recorded for personal loans, including
credit cards. But UK banks’ profitability, cost efficiency and diversification are
expected to allow them to cope with any likely deterioration.
The easing of credit-related costs was a source of strength in Japan.
Having posted the best performance in recent memory, Japanese banks left
more than a decade of weakness behind them. Falling loan loss charges
helped place net income firmly in positive territory. The improved condition of

corporates further eased the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs). The
ratio of NPLs to total assets for major banks continued to decline. Retained
earnings also improved the quality of their capital base, with the share of public
funds in Tier 1 capital receding to below 20%. The return to profitability was
enhanced by unrealised gains on equity holdings, which are expected to
outweigh potential losses in bond portfolios in the event of rising interest rates
(see Chapter IV). Most importantly, the broad economic recovery carries the
prospect of a resumption of profitable lending, as loan growth turned positive
for the first time since 1994.
The pursuit of growth through retail banking activities and the promise of
cost efficiencies associated with greater size have maintained interest in
consolidation within the banking sector. The previous wave of domestic
consolidation among larger banks in the United States left room for small and
medium-sized deals focused on achieving better geographical diversification.
The changes in the European competitive landscape were more diverse. The
integration of smaller domestic retail banks into cooperative networks
proceeded further in France and Germany. The number of larger cross-border
transactions, however, was a novelty. Italian banks were key participants in
many cases, either as targets or acquirers, but a number of deals involved
banks on the periphery of the euro area.

Investment banking
M&A activity
boosted profits

Investment banks enjoyed a year of exceptional performance. Return on equity
was in the range of 15–30%, reflecting unusually high profits across a range of
business lines. In addition to traditional investment banking revenues, many
houses succeeded in generating sizeable trading profits. An important driver
of the former was the boom in mergers and acquisitions (Graph VII.2; see
Chapter VI). M&A activity contributed to both the advisory business and the
bond underwriting business needed to finance the deals. Analysts expect

activity to remain strong in view of the level of corporate profits and the pipeline
of potential deals, where size and tolerance for leverage appear to be rising.
The fees earned in underwriting and M&A advisory services were
concentrated among the top-tier investment banks. The same houses also
financed larger positions through repo borrowing than had been the case in
previous years. Buoyant trading in commodities and energy-related securities,
as well as business linked to the activities of private equity funds, provided
important new sources of revenue. Investment banks also benefited from other
business lines, including underwriting credit products and offering broking
services to hedge funds. The industry is in the process of expansion and is
actively recruiting staff, reversing much of the downsizing that took place early
in the decade.

Expansion

Hedge funds
Following a period of rapid growth during the first half of this decade, the hedge
fund sector during the past year experienced the downside of success. There
was a decline in financial performance and a slowdown in new investments,
while the interest of institutional investors elicited further changes in operating
frameworks.
Performance slipped across the range of hedge fund investment styles
during 2005. This arguably reflected an increasingly crowded field, with many
managers seeking to exploit a limited set of profitable investment opportunities
(Graph VII.3). A further sign of this crowding was the narrowing of the
performance range across a variety of investment strategies.
Mirroring this lacklustre performance, investor interest, as measured by
the rate of inflows into the sector, also cooled. For the first time since the
LTCM episode, the sector witnessed net outflows for several months during

attrition.
Despite the slowdown in performance, signs that hedge funds have
become an acceptable investment option for mainstream institutional investors
multiplied. Ties between the sector and more established firms engaged in
asset management or private banking services continued to deepen, with many
such firms including hedge fund investments in the portfolio of products offered
to clients. In many cases this involved the outright purchase of existing fundsof-funds operations by those players. The secular narrowing of the range of
volatility recorded in individual fund returns over recent years is another
consequence of the influx of institutional money in the sector, as it has implied
more exacting requirements for risk management, reporting and consistency
in investment strategy.

Private equity

Private equity fund
structures …

… reward risktaking

The past few years have witnessed major growth in the activity of private equity
funds. This increase has manifested itself both in their fund-raising activities
and in their involvement in corporate control transactions. A number of factors
can account for this intensified interest in private equity investments, including
investor disappointment with public equity markets after the collapse of the
technology bubble, the low-yield environment and extremely favourable
liquidity conditions. At the same time, this boom in activity has raised some
concerns about its potential financial stability implications, given the important
role of leverage in private equity investment strategies.
Private equity funds are investor pools that specialise in providing equity
financing to high-risk and information-intensive companies. There are two main
types of funds. The first provides financing to companies that have no access
to publicly traded equity markets, such as new entrepreneurial ventures with
high growth potential but no established track record, or medium-sized firms
requiring financing to overcome financial distress, alter their capital structure
or acquire another company. The second type specialises in buyouts of public
companies which are subsequently delisted. Typically, buyouts are partly
financed with debt, substantially raising balance sheet leverage at the acquired
company. Financial benefits come in the form of dividends over the medium
term and from the receipts of the eventual sale of the company, either in the
private market or through an initial public offering.
Private equity funds are organised in the form of limited partnerships, and
partners’ incentive structures resemble those of other aggressive investment
vehicles such as hedge funds. The transactions in which the funds participate
put a premium on financial acumen, managerial skills and entrepreneurship,
since the partners are actively involved in the management of the companies
in which the fund invests. Partners are rewarded by generous fee structures
and performance-related pay, as well as by the expectation of sharing with
outside investors a high targeted internal rate of return on invested assets.
The funds raise financing from high net worth individuals and a variety of
institutional investors, such as pension funds and endowments, as well as
from other financial or non-financial firms.

There has been a very significant increase in the size of the private equity
sector since the late 1990s. A period of rapid growth in the assets under
management for all categories of funds during the technology investment boom
was followed by a mild and temporary slowdown before growth resumed in
the last two years (Graph VII.4). Even though the majority of funds operate in
the United States, European funds have grown more strongly recently. Buyout
funds have historically represented the majority of private equity sector assets.
A slight decline in their overall share around the peak of the internet investment
bubble has reversed itself on the heels of the recent resurgence of corporate
M&A transactions (see Chapter VI).
Over the past two years funds raised globally have surged, reaching
$240 billion in 2005, a figure surpassed only in 2000, the peak year of the
technology sector boom (Graph VII.5). Cash payouts to investors have also
followed a similar pattern, albeit displaying more pronounced volatility. There

is anecdotal evidence, however, that individual funds may currently favour a
more accelerated schedule of distributions to investors and partners over a
backloading of payouts in line with the revenues from the eventual disposal
of their investments. The high average rates of return on private equity funds
explain the interest of outside investors, despite the associated volatility and
relative illiquidity (Graph VII.5, right-hand panel).
Cycles in the activity of private equity funds are related to the availability
and cost of financing as well as the general trends in corporate balance sheets.
Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are encouraged by low interest rates, and usually
target companies with underperforming shares due to a conservative capital
structure. The previous periods of heightened LBO activity coincided with
market innovations, such as the boom of junk bonds in the late 1980s and the
internet venture capital boom of the late 1990s. Low financing costs and more
relaxed attitudes towards risk and leverage also seem to be important drivers
in the current cycle. The recent surge in the volume of LBO-related international
syndicated loans has been impressive, with facilities exceeding $240 billion in
2005, in their majority arranged on behalf of European borrowers (Graph VII.6).
Just as significant has been the decline in the credit quality of these facilities.
About 80% of all loans associated with LBOs are characterised as high-yield
facilities, more than six times the corresponding share in the overall syndicated
loan market.

Insurance companies

Life insurers built
on strength

Favourable financial market conditions boosted the performance of life insurance
companies in 2005. By contrast, the year 2005 was the costliest ever for the
non-life and reinsurance sectors, mainly owing to large claims related to natural
catastrophes.
The financial strength of life insurers continued to improve. Positive stock
market performance led to better investment results and improved capital
buffers (Graph VII.7). Japanese life insurers increased their solvency margins,
as premium income rose, the number of policy cancellations declined and the

rising stock market generated unrealised capital gains. With-profits unit-linked
insurance products gained popularity in the United Kingdom and France on the
back of improved expectations of stock market returns. However, low long-term
interest rates still burdened some European life insurers with the legacy of high
guaranteed rates, so that solvency pressures did not disappear entirely.
Strong competition, improved capitalisation and the pursuit of operating
efficiency encouraged consolidation in the life sector. In Europe, over the
past two years, this trend mainly took the form of small-scale mergers and
acquisitions. By contrast, major US financial and non-financial groups spun
off their life insurance arms or sold them to other insurers.
A potential risk faced by life insurers stems from the slow pace at which
projected increases in longevity risk are being incorporated into balance sheet
valuations. In addition, risk transfer mechanisms for this type of risk have yet
to mature. Demand for longevity bonds remains limited, as does the capacity
of the reinsurance sector to underwrite this risk.
The non-life insurance sector faced record claims in 2005, expected to be
about double the amount in 2004. Three Caribbean hurricanes accounted for
the majority of global insured losses. As a result, US property and casualty
insurers suffered their largest catastrophe losses, relative to the size of the
industry, since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Despite the ensuing
decline in underwriting profits, the US non-life sector proved resilient, helped
by growth in investment income and risk transfer to the reinsurance sector.
Strong investment income and sufficient diversification helped most
reinsurers to cope with the elevated catastrophe claims of last year. However,
a number of Bermuda-based specialist reinsurers suffered a deterioration of
their capital and rating downgrades. An upward trend in insured losses, owing
to the increased severity of storms, higher population density and a boom in
coastal area property values, presents a continuing challenge to the sector.
The European insurance sector faces a number of challenges associated
with changes in the institutional framework. Progress in the Solvency II project

continued with active discussion between officials and the sector in the period
under review. The project is likely to increase the industry’s focus on risk
management. In terms of implementation, the new regulatory framework
regarding solvency requirements for European insurance companies will interact
with the proposed changes in financial reporting standards. The adoption of
IASB standards in Europe started in 2005, and its impact remains unclear. The
current stage of implementation can lead to earnings volatility, as the extension
of the fair value attribution principle to further categories of insurance company
assets might not be matched by existing valuation principles applied to liabilities.
In anticipation of the possible full implementation of fair value accounting for
liabilities as well, insurance companies have focused on matching assets and
liabilities by investing more in long-term bonds and reducing their exposure
to equities (see Chapter VI).

Pension funds
Underfunding of

Changes in the
regulatory
framework …

… may affect asset
allocation …

… and fund
structure

A series of developments affecting corporate pension funds have attracted
the attention of analysts and regulators in recent years. Funding levels have
deteriorated as a result of the low-yield investment environment that prevailed
in the early years of this decade. Low returns on asset portfolios were reinforced
by the inflating effect of low discount rates on the value of liabilities. The
impact of this constellation of factors was compounded by the fact that many
sponsors had taken advantage of the very favourable investment environment
during the second half of the 1990s to reduce contribution levels on the basis
of optimistic extrapolations of exceedingly high levels of return.
A number of important changes in the institutional framework that governs
occupational pension schemes are expected to have a lasting influence on
their profile and investment behaviour. In a number of jurisdictions, new
regulations are being implemented that reduce the permissible level of pension
plan underfunding before the sponsor is required to increase contributions. In
addition, new accounting standards move towards greater use of current
market valuations for assets and liabilities related to post-employment benefits.
This restricts sponsors’ discretion to use projected returns for assets and to
smooth over time the discount rates for liabilities.
The immediate effect of these changes has been an increased awareness
among companies and their external stakeholders of the magnitude of the
issues related to unfunded pension liabilities. The new standards emphasise
the importance of sound risk management as regards these liabilities, and
should improve the transparency of links between pension plan performance
and company earnings. They appear to have also affected investment
decisions by the plans. Increased portfolio allocations to longer-term fixed
income securities are seen as an attempt to immunise the volatility of pension
liabilities resulting from changes in the level of interest rates (see Chapter VI).
These structural changes are likely to accelerate the shift away from
defined benefit towards defined contribution plans, which has been under way
in many countries for some time. Questions posed relate to the implications
of these changes for the demand for various asset classes and for market
dynamics. A more general issue is whether these changes will have a broader

effect on financing patterns in the economy and the types of investment
favoured by the markets.

Vulnerabilities
Looking forward, the main sources of vulnerability relate to the speed with
which the current environment of abundant liquidity may change. This could
have implications for the sustainability of the balance sheet positions of
households and firms, were a reversal in liquidity conditions to bring about
abrupt changes in asset prices, with attendant effects on the soundness of

Persistent high levels of overall bank profitability in recent years against a
backdrop of a favourable economic environment raise the question of their
long-term sustainability. The issue is particularly important in the light of
possible increases in interest rates or less favourable capital market conditions.
Developments affecting interest margins and credit risk are likely to generate
more uncertainty about future bank performance in the years ahead. Net
interest margins in many countries have trended downwards since the 1990s,
reflecting in part the intensification of competitive pressures. Meanwhile, fee
revenue associated with increased retail banking activity has contributed to an
upward trend in non-interest income. Together with these secular movements,
the components of banks’ profits have fluctuated depending on cyclical
changes in income, credit and the interest rate environment.
The historical relationships between components of bank profitability and
overall macroeconomic indicators can provide some guidance as to the
potential risks to bank profits associated with future economic developments
(Table VII.2). Typically, interest margin income responds positively to higher

interest rates and a steeper yield curve, as bank lending rates adjust faster
than those applied on their liabilities (Table VII.2, left-hand panel). North
American and UK banks’ margins seem to be less sensitive to yield curve
gyrations than those of their continental European counterparts. A likely
explanation could be the stronger competition for traditional bank products in
North America and the prevalence of floating rate lending in the United
Kingdom. Higher interest rates and a slowdown in economic activity are
associated with higher credit costs, typically with some lag (Table VII.2, righthand panel).
These past patterns could serve as the basis for outlining the potential
impact on bank profits from likely macroeconomic developments in the
coming years. Higher interest rates will probably bolster net interest margins,
especially in continental European countries, while a flattening of the yield
curve will have an offsetting influence. At the same time, though, rising interest
rates may also lead to higher loan loss provisioning expenses, offsetting some
of the possible gains on interest revenue. Provisioning expenses typically rise
in an economic slowdown, a prospect that could entail difficulties across
business lines.
Moreover, following a period of generous loan pricing, the spreads built
into banks’ loan books may not fully compensate for higher provisioning
expenses once credit quality deteriorates. Recent developments in the
syndicated loan market suggest that the pricing of loans is now becoming more
risk-sensitive, reverting towards values closer to the average over the credit
cycle (Graph VII.8). However, as the stock of loans arranged over the 2002–04
period enter the phase in their life cycle when higher default incidence is
typically observed, their particularly low spreads may weigh on bank earnings.
These considerations suggest caution in projecting current performance to the
near future.

Exposure to property markets
Property-related activity represents a rapidly growing component of banks’
business and profits at the current juncture. The rate of growth of propertyrelated lending has outpaced that of corporate or consumer lending in many
countries. This raises the risk of potential problems arising either from an
overextension in the commercial property market or from a cooling in the
residential property segment. Indeed, the latter has been showing signs of
slowdown after many years of exceptional growth.
In most countries, the commercial real estate sector has recovered from
weak fundamentals. In particular, vacancy rates have declined and property
prices have bounced back compared to 2004 (Table VII.3). At the same time,
commercial real estate exposures have grown rapidly relative to capital and
assets in many countries. In the United States, for instance, commercial real
estate lending has increased by 80% during the past five years, and now
represents 13.5% of commercial banks’ total assets, matching the level at the
peak of the previous cycle in 1988. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, nearly 40%
of banks’ lending to non-financial firms goes to real estate companies, up from
about 20% five years ago. Even Japanese banks witnessed an extraordinary
44% jump in new loans to real estate companies in the third quarter of 2005 to
¥2.7 trillion, a growth rate reminiscent of the boom in the latter half of the 1980s.

Commercial real

… and more
concentrated

A possible
softening in
housing markets …

In the United States, commercial real estate lending is highly concentrated
in certain groups of banks. Increases have been most remarkable among
small and medium-sized banks, for which commercial real estate lending now
accounts for approximately 30% of total assets. By contrast, the exposure of
large banks is rather modest, with an average ratio of 8.6%.
The high exposure to the commercial real estate market could represent
a potential threat to financial stability, in particular given the high degree of
concentration of exposures. The low interest rate environment over recent
years has reduced borrowers’ loan payments and boosted cash flows,
contributing to record low default rates on commercial real estate loans. Were
interest rates to rise, loan quality might well deteriorate. Indeed, regulators in
the United States and Japan have already expressed concerns about some
banks’ lending standards for commercial property loans.
Despite some similarities with the early 1990s, however, the current
situation is unlikely to lead to similar strains. First, the commercial property
cycle was at a peak in the previous episode but is currently rising from a cyclical
bottom, suggesting a low risk of widespread defaults among borrowers in the
event of a price decline. Second, the continuing growth of publicly traded real
estate securities markets allows part of the associated credit risk to be spread
more widely across investors, and has arguably had a tempering influence on
commercial real estate cycles.
On the residential side, the demand for housing finance has been cooling
in some countries but remains robust in others, mirroring mixed developments

in house prices (Table VII.4). In the United Kingdom and Australia, house
prices increased slightly during 2005, while Germany and Japan, which have
not recovered from the previous cycle, experienced further price declines (see
Chapter II). By contrast, in most other European countries, housing markets
remained buoyant. The same was also true for the US market for most of the
year, even though since the end of 2005 there have been indications of an
impending weakening, as signalled by a slowdown in mortgage applications
and in sales of existing homes.
The characteristics of housing finance have recently changed in a number
of countries. Relaxation of lending standards due to competition and greater
reliance on securitisation has contributed to a significant increase in lending to
more risky households. US subprime mortgage originations in 2005 rose to
seven times their 2000 volume. Mortgages to borrowers with a poor credit
history have also expanded significantly in the United Kingdom. Moreover,
mortgage products with flexible repayment options have increased several
times over. About one third of total US mortgage originations in 2005 had
interest-only options, compared to 1.5% in 2001.
The pace of developments in house prices and interest rates is likely to
determine the impact of the expected adjustment in those countries where
residential real estate valuations appear more stretched. Lenders seem
sufficiently buffered against the direct impact of increased delinquency rates,
which could result were the expiration of grace periods in earlier mortgages with
flexible repayment contracts to coincide with higher interest rates. However,
the indirect effect on banks from a potential economic slowdown, as a result
of a contraction in consumer spending and construction activity, is likely to be
more sizeable even if it remains more difficult to gauge (see Chapter II). This risk
is more pronounced for economies where mortgage debt is at higher levels.

Financial reporting and financial risk management
A number of developments in the period under review focused attention on the
influence that financial reporting standards exert on decision-making by firms
and investors. Market observers debated the likely impact on earnings volatility
and equity valuations of EU listed companies in the first year of implementation
of international accounting standards. Similar debates surrounded the
introduction of a number of new standards in the United States. Finally, as
noted earlier, the implementation of new rules for pension plan accounting in
a number of jurisdictions was thought likely to have a significant impact on
the asset allocation decisions and risk-taking choices of employer-sponsored
pension schemes.
Broadly speaking, these developments implied a shift towards greater
reliance on market-based and away from historical cost valuations for balance
sheet and income accounting. Discussions between accounting standard
setters and users focused on the possible impact on how businesses manage
their risks. From the perspective of financial stability, the debate related to the
economy-wide implications for the availability and use of risk capital as well
as for the dynamics of asset prices.

prices …

These issues revolve around the two main economic functions of financial
reporting, namely to provide information about the performance of employed
resources and to facilitate their governance. Management of resources
depends on proper and reliable measurement of inputs and ultimate results.
Outside stakeholders, such as investors and regulators, rely on accurate and
representative financial reports by the firm in forming an independent
assessment of its current condition and future prospects as well as of how its
performance compares to that of its peers and competitors. Moreover, formal
intervention rules for the transfer of control over resources are typically based
on accounting information. A case in point relates to the respective control
rights of equity and debt holders in the event of default. Similarly, regulatory
intervention rules are also conditioned on accounting valuations of assets and
liabilities of the firm and on associated measures of risk.
There is a two-way relationship between accounting rules and behaviour.
Accounting returns act as a focal point for outside stakeholders, including
regulators, wishing to gauge the performance of a firm. As such, they inevitably
condition the decisions of management. Conversely, the nexus of incentives
that influences management behaviour also affects their attitude towards risk.
The collective impact of changes and behaviour can in turn influence market
prices and valuations. This is particularly true for those items in financial
reports that include more forward-looking elements and assessments of risk.
The measurement of value is not an unambiguous scientific exercise, as it
often entails judgment regarding future developments and the assessment of
risk/reward trade-offs associated with a specific item. However, the capacity of
financial reports’ measures of value to reflect the available information has
been enhanced as a result of complementary developments over the past
three decades: the expansion of markets for risk transfer instruments and
advances in risk measurement technology.
Markets for risk transfer have developed in both depth and breadth,
expanding enormously the range of instruments available to facilitate the
tailoring of financial risk to the specific needs and circumstances of individual
market participants. Derivatives markets have blossomed, with the latest
additions being those for the transfer of credit risk. Securitisation structures
have increasingly been used to repackage and reallocate financial risk (see
Chapter VI). Importantly, from the perspective of financial reporting, these
innovations have generated readily observable market prices for an ever finer
grid of risk classes. This has markedly improved the pricing of items that had
hitherto been difficult to value.
Helpful as they might be in providing forward-looking valuations, market
prices have a major shortcoming, namely their relative opacity as to the drivers
of value. Observed prices contain risk premia that are directly related to market
participants’ views about the risk to future cash flows and their attitude towards
risk-taking. Disentangling the relative influence of these two drivers of premia
at a given point in time is a highly judgmental exercise, not least because they
both vary over time (see Chapter VI). Risk assessments are subject to revisions
in the light of new information. Investors’ effective risk attitudes can be affected
by market conditions, the availability and cost of external funding and recent

BIS 76th Annual Report

135

performance. Hence, market price variability can reflect, at least in part,
temporary shifts in risk appetite as opposed to fundamental shifts in expected
cash flows. More importantly, changes in market prices may feed back to
the effective risk attitude of investors and lead to a more persistent impact on
valuations.
Complementing the deepening of markets for risk transfer, advances in
risk measurement technology have also contributed to the accuracy of
valuations for complex and illiquid balance sheet items (“marking to model”).
Innovations in the pricing of derivative securities have transferred successfully
to other contexts, such as the valuation of credit risk and of embedded options
in financial contracts. New modelling techniques provide valuable tools for
firm-wide risk measurement and management. Increasingly, investment and
hedging decisions are supported by asset and liability analysis based on
forward-looking models of value and risk, calibrated on observed prices but
often extrapolated to cover a broader range of instruments. Regardless of their
sophistication, the validity of models depends critically on the validity of the
assumptions on which they rest. Moreover, model-implied valuations are not
immune to the influence of the same time-varying factors as market prices,
since they are based on historical relationships between observed prices and
are typically calibrated to reflect recent movements in those prices. Despite
these shortcomings, however, risk models offer the promise of achieving a
better understanding of the drivers of risk, as they lend themselves more
readily to the identification and analysis of risk premia.
Different valuation principles rely variously on historical cost, market
prices, models and internal assessments of value. By adopting different
perspectives, they strike a different balance between desirable aspects of
financial reports, namely accuracy, verifiability, reliability and comparability. For
example, historical cost accounting produces highly predictable assessments
of value over time that are tightly linked to easily identifiable past events. By
contrast, valuation principles that depend on forward-looking assessments of
value may be more responsive to current developments at the expense of
potentially greater variation in values over time. The contrast is clearest in the
case of financial securities for which daily fluctuations in market prices can at
times lead to significant unrealised gains or losses if the portfolio is reported on
the basis of historical acquisition costs. Moreover, while some principles allow
the valuation of specific asset or liability items to depend on firm-specific inputs
(eg own assessment of future benefits, discount rates based on portfolio
characteristics, synergies with other assets), others such as fair value and
historical cost seek to generate values that would be identical, regardless of
the specific context. The greater relevance of values generated under the
former principle from the viewpoint of internal decision-making comes at
the cost of relatively greater dependence on internal models built around
potentially opaque assumptions. The debate regarding the accounting for
demand deposit liabilities of banks is a case in point.
Accounting standards strive to provide a reporting framework which is
neutral with respect to economic decisions. However, as noted above, the
choice of valuation principle has important implications for behaviour at the

micro as well as at the macro level, especially as it relates to the treatment of
risk information.
The treatment of risk information in reporting standards has a significant
influence on the governance of economic resources. The degree to which
forward-looking assessments of value and risk are embedded in valuations
influences the effectiveness of transfer of control rules included in the law or
bilateral contracts. An obvious example is the paradoxical situation that can
arise if the market value of an entity’s liabilities is used to determine
bankruptcy. In this case the deterioration in creditworthiness will generally
increase the value of the firm since it will lead to a reduction in the value of
its liabilities. Another example is given by the different implications of loan
provisioning based on demonstrated signs of distress in individual loans, or on
assessments of expected loss for a loan portfolio. While the former approach
depends on backward-looking manifestations of risk, the latter involves forwardlooking assessments of risk informed by the analysis of past experience. The
nature of the adopted approach will influence reported income and capital
for the bank over the business cycle and also condition the assessment of
prudential authorities as to its soundness.
The importance of these influences is further magnified when examined
from a systemic perspective, where the endogenous character of risk is more
evident. Behaviour that is rational from the point of view of an individual firm,
which perceives market prices as invariant to its actions, can lead to inefficient
aggregate outcomes when the compounded effect of individual actions feeds
back to market conditions. One such example is the recent compression of
rates at the longer end of the UK gilt yield curve as a result of the increased
demand from pension funds attempting to hedge the risk of low discount rates
on the mark to market values of their liabilities (see above and Chapter VI).
Likewise, the procyclical variation of loan provisions based on point-in-time
credit risk assessments can result in lending behaviour that amplifies business
cycle volatility and increases financial system vulnerability.
In sum, an analysis of the interaction between financial reporting, on the
one hand, and risk measurement and management, on the other, highlights
three main messages. The first is that valuations are not unique. Value is often
dependent on the perspective from which it is measured. The value contribution
of the same item may differ depending on the context. Moreover, even when
performed from the same perspective, valuations are subject to variations due
to time-varying risk premia driven by shifting investor risk attitudes that may
be only indirectly related to changes in expectations about cash flows. These
issues are magnified in the case of complex instruments for which there are
no deep and liquid markets. This is precisely when accounting is most relevant.
The second message is the key role played by assessments of risk. The
link between risk measurement and valuations is explicit when models are
used in deriving values; it is implicit when relying directly on market prices.
Moreover, risk measurement and management practices have an indirect
influence on reported values as they influence behaviour and asset prices. To
the extent that accounting standards affect behaviour towards risk, they also
influence valuations.

BIS 76th Annual Report

137

The final message is that a valuation approach that is best suited for one
purpose might present complications for another. Given the multiplicity of
external uses of financial reports, this issue can lead to tensions, including
among policymakers with different objectives. These are discussed below.

… and different
perspectives

Financial reporting and prudential policy
The discussion above suggests a number of issues pertaining to financial
reporting standards which are relevant from a prudential policy perspective.
These relate both to the information content of reports and to the prudential
governance of financial firms.
A first point to make is that the information content of reported accounts
could be enhanced by the inclusion of more systematic information about risk
and uncertainty. Existing standards, regardless of the degree to which they
incorporate forward-looking information, are predominantly focused on giving
point estimates of current value and income. This could be supplemented by
two additional types of information. The first could refer to estimates of the
range of potential future variation of value and income (“risk information”).
Examples of such statistical summary measures include value-at-risk as well
as the outcomes of stress tests and other sensitivity analyses. The second
type could refer to measures of the uncertainty embedded in the assumptions
of the valuation methodology (“measurement error information”). Clearly the
importance of this latter type of information is directly related to the extent to
which assumptions and models are used in the assessment of the point
estimates. Thus enhanced, financial reports would give users the opportunity to
form a more rounded view of the condition and prospects of the firm and avoid
a false sense of precision. They would also facilitate comparisons across firms,
for example by investors seeking to optimise their portfolios or by regulators
in the context of financial stability.
A second implication for policy is the importance of seeking consistency
between the treatment of accounting valuations and sound risk management
principles. An example of the tensions that can arise in this context is the
different treatment of demand deposits for financial reporting and for the cash
and risk management of banks. Accounting standards treat deposit liabilities
on the basis of their contractual maturity. By contrast, from a bank treasury
perspective, in terms of liquidity management and the associated hedging
strategy, they are treated as having a longer effective maturity, which is more
in line with the historical behavioural patterns of depositors.
A third and more general implication is that there is room for reconciling
the policy objectives of prudential authorities and financial reporting standard
setters based on a clearer understanding of their different perspectives. Under
this approach, reporting standards would focus on providing an unbiased
picture of the current financial condition of the firm and the associated risk
profile, while regulatory and supervisory instruments would focus on
encouraging prudent behaviour based on that picture. In practice, such a
decoupling would include redesigning capital and liquidity cushion requirements
on the basis of accounting returns free of intentional conservatism, applying
“prudential filters” to accounting figures that incorporate risk information,

and defining new triggers for regulatory intervention in the case of manifest
strain.
Progress has been made in all three directions in recent years. Quantitative
financial risk disclosures, such as value-at-risk measures for securities portfolios,
have already been included in regulatory reporting requirements of financial
firms for which this type of risk has been more important. Accounting standard
setters, too, have been paying more attention to risk disclosures that are
consistent with, but arguably less ambitious than, those of prudential authorities.
The prescriptions of IFRS 7 are a case in point. In addition, the classification
of items being valued on a fair value basis into categories indicating different
degrees of estimate reliability, coupled with rough estimates of the measurement
sensitivity to underlying assumptions, is an example of progress in providing
measurement error information. And the close cooperation between accounting
standard setters and prudential authorities in the development of standards
on provisioning, the fair value option and the measurement of insurance
liabilities are but the latest examples of the value added by a greater focus on
risk management.
Regardless of the substantial progress made to date, the way forward
needs to be based on a longer-term strategy which recognises the need to
cooperate at all intermediate stages. Given the complexity of the issues and
the multiplicity of stakeholders in this process, a decoupling of objectives and
recalibration of policy instruments can only be a long-term goal. Over the
medium term, progress can only be deliberately incremental, and appropriate
safeguards should always be in place to avoid inadvertently compromising the
fundamental objective of financial stability. The continuing dialogue between
accounting standard setters and prudential authorities augurs well for further
progress in this direction.

VIII. Conclusion: coping with risks, today and
tomorrow

Everyone would hope that, by this time next year, we will be as satisfied with
the performance of the global economy as we are today. The consensus
forecast and those of the IMF and OECD point in this direction, reflecting the
expectation that recent more balanced growth among the industrial countries
will continue and that domestic demand will play an even larger role in
emerging market economies. Further good news is that global inflation is
forecast to remain generally subdued. Financial markets seem to have shared
this optimism. Indeed, low levels of volatility, at least until very recently, even
seemed to imply an unusual degree of certainty about such an outcome. The
markets, moreover, seem to have viewed recent moves to tighten monetary
policy in many of the advanced industrial countries as appropriate, and likely
to be growth-sustaining, rather than the opposite.

What risks do we currently run?
Hopefully, the markets are right in their relatively optimistic assessment. Yet
tightening credit conditions after such a long period of ease still allows for
two kinds of error. First, it could be that monetary policy should have been
tightened more, and earlier. One reason for believing this might be that
underlying inflationary pressures are already well embedded. Another
possibility is that relatively easy policies have continued to allow the build-up of
a host of financial “imbalances” that are becoming increasingly dangerous as
time passes. Both of these considerations would seem to call for more resolute
monetary tightening. The second possible error is closely related: these
imbalances might already have grown so large that monetary tightening could
cause them to unwind, with negative effects on global growth and employment.
This would argue for a more measured monetary response. Given significant
uncertainty, and even overt disagreement among analysts as to the likelihood
of either outcome, the only thing that is clear is that the coming year will not
be an easy one for policymakers.
What grounds are there for believing that inflationary pressures might be
greater than is currently thought? One obvious observation is that both the
United States and Japan are judged by their own authorities to be close to full
capacity, a traditional cause for concern. The United States, moreover, faces
the risk of further substantial dollar depreciation, which could exacerbate such
pressures. In addition, the global economy continues to grow exceptionally
strongly, perhaps generating a dynamic that will prove hard to control. House

prices almost everywhere have been rising rapidly, and the prices of energy
and other commodities have hit record levels. Wages in parts of China and
some other emerging market economies have also been trending upwards,
and Asia as a whole seems to be facing increasing inflationary risks.
Again, there are considerable uncertainties. To be more pessimistic, if the
global disinflationary effects of lower-priced goods from emerging economies
have been underestimated, then the consequences of the waning of this
influence could also be unexpected. In addition, there is a great deal of
uncertainty as to whether the world has hit a “tipping point” in its capacity to
supply more oil and commodities, with the implication that prices might stay
higher for longer than has historically been the case. To be more optimistic,
there are still many lower-cost jurisdictions in the emerging market economies,
not least central and western China, and production will eventually move there
as well. And advancing technology could well compensate for the increased
difficulty of finding new reserves of commodities. Yet both of these adjustment
processes will take time. Given current levels of global demand, the risk would
be continuing inflationary pressures in the interim. Moreover, to the extent that
the credibility of central bankers has been enhanced by the earlier, fortuitous
circumstances, this credibility could also be tested. It would, of course, need to
be vigorously defended.
What grounds are there for believing that “imbalances” pose a threat to
the optimistic view looking forward? It is not hard to identify a large number
of significant and sustained deviations from historical norms in important
macroeconomic variables. However, concerns about disruptive reversions to
more “normal” values have to be qualified to the extent that such deviations
can be explained and justified as being of a lasting nature. Unfortunately,
recourse to such “fundamentals” does not seem adequate to explain either the
extent or the duration of the unusual circumstances currently being observed.
This leaves room for a complementary explanation: these phenomena might
be linked to there having been such abundant global liquidity over such a
long period.
Perhaps the most important example of “fundamentals” failing to
adequately explain financial market developments is the long-term bond market
in the United States. As policy rates rose, the long rate fell, a development
once famously described as a conundrum. More recently, the maintenance of
spreads on emerging market sovereign debt at very low levels, even as long
rates have moved up, might be explained in terms of generally better domestic
performance. Yet the sharp narrowing of the dispersion of yields between better
and much worse performers remains a puzzle. Surging equity and house prices,
almost globally, seem hard to reconcile with wide differences in domestic
growth prospects. The explosion in merger and acquisition activity, particularly
in Europe, also seems difficult to rationalise: what evidence is there of a sudden
improvement in the prospects for adding value through restructuring, particularly
since there still appears to be relatively little appetite for new investment?
And, finally, the strength of the dollar until very recently, in the face of a
record US external deficit and unprecedented household debt accumulation,
remains hard to explain. On close examination, fashionable arguments

BIS 76th Annual Report

141

based on the presumed existence of “dark matter”, an informal “marriage of
convenience” between debtors and creditors, and the “inherent attractiveness”
of highly productive US assets all fail to convince that current global
imbalances are sustainable. To explain the dollar’s resilience, recourse must
again be had to short-term interest rate differentials, in particular the continuing
low rates outside the United States. Once more, monetary conditions contribute
to solving a puzzle.
Given the complexity of the situation and the limits of our knowledge, it is
extremely difficult to predict how all this might unfold. On the one hand, it
is easy to argue, indeed it is the consensus view, that an orderly rebalancing
is still the most likely outcome. By way of example, consider today’s global
current account imbalances. In principle, were the dollar to fall and increase
foreign demand for US-made goods, US interest rates could rise to temper
domestic demand just enough to avoid either rising unemployment or rising
inflation. If, in turn, domestic demand elsewhere were growing just fast enough
to replace that previously emanating from the United States, then global growth
and inflation would not be affected either. On the other hand, it is also easy to
identify forces that might make various processes of rebalancing less smooth.
Some of these could imply the end will be a “bang” of market turbulence,
others a “whimper” of slow growth for an extended period. Should the
expected smooth adjustment not materialise, the alternative might well be a
combination of the two.
Those concerned about a “bang” of market turbulence need both a trigger
and grounds for believing that price movements in various markets might get
out of hand. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of candidates for either. As to
the trigger, global monetary tightening might well be the catalyst. While the
process of tightening has begun, and without incident, concerted monetary
tightening is still as much a prospect as a reality. Another trigger might be
further protectionist legislation, particularly pertaining to China or Middle East
oil exporters. This could easily interfere with the smooth financing of the US
current account deficit since these countries are currently the biggest
purchasers of US dollar liabilities. And yet another possibility might be the
sudden failure, or recourse to legal protection, of a large firm with major
financial interests. These possibilities noted, it must also be recognised that
the triggers for most of the financial crises observed over the last few decades
were almost wholly unexpected.
There are, moreover, several market-specific reasons for concern about a
degree of disorder should a process of price adjustment towards more normal
levels begin. In the main industrial countries, there are many new participants
in financial markets and many new financial products, of increasing complexity
and opacity. Market liquidity in this environment has yet to be put to the test.
The fact that carry trade speculation seems to have intensified in recent years
also implies the potential for crowded trades that could, in the limit, lead to an
interactive deterioration of market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. We have
in fact seen such interactions before. Similar problems could also occur in
emerging market economies, and indeed might already have begun, given the
sheer magnitude of capital inflows over the last year or so.

142

BIS 76th Annual Report

Turning to the major currency markets, there are also grounds for concern that exchange rate movements could be large and potentially disorderly.
The first point to make is that the underlying trade adjustment could prove
quite protracted. Even reducing the US current account deficit to 3% of GDP
might require millions of workers to move from the non-tradable to the tradable
sectors. This will not be accomplished overnight. Moreover, with US imports
more than one and a half times exports, and with the United States still
growing much faster than many other economies, a substantial increase in US
competitiveness will be needed to improve the current account. The fact that
exporters to the United States were able to cut costs in the face of past dollar
depreciation, thus preserving margins and reducing pass-through, could, if
repeated, be a further impediment to US current account adjustment. And, of
course, the longer adjustment is delayed, the greater the external debt build-up
and the larger the prospective debt servicing requirement. Indeed, while the
US net investment income account has recorded inflows until quite recently,
simple arithmetic implies substantial further deterioration in the future.
Both private and public sector purchasers of US dollar liabilities might, at
some point, lose patience in such a situation. The foreign private sector holds
the bulk of dollar-denominated US liabilities, and even moderate covering
could have big effects on currency values. As for public sector holdings, while
these are much more likely to display stable behaviour, prospective strains
can still be identified. Even modest declines in the dollar could lead to heavy
capital losses for large reserve holders, and this might become a matter of some
political sensitivity. Moreover, reserves are now flowing more to energyexporting countries for which pure risk-return considerations might weigh
more heavily in investment decisions. The likelihood that perceived changes
in official behaviour might reinforce changes on the private side also seems
consequential.
The upshot of all these considerations is that markets “priced to perfection”
retain a significant potential for reversion to more normal levels. Moreover,
given the interrelationships among all these markets, both domestic and
international, there is a reasonable likelihood that if one market were to come
under significant stress, it would spill over to others. Consider, for example, a
sharp fall in the value of the dollar. One possibility, in this environment, is that
the risk premium for holding US dollar-denominated assets might rise. One
likely manifestation of this would be higher long-term interest rates, which
would, in turn, have an impact on other markets, including that for housing.
Another example has to do with the still relatively low cost of purchasing
protection against market volatility. Were such costs to rise significantly, as
some markets came under stress, virtually all markets would be affected.
While many would doubtless dispute the likelihood of a sudden market
“bang”, the possibility also remains of a real side “whimper”. That is, the
various imbalances referred to above might well work themselves off gradually,
but in a way that weighed heavily on global spending over a long period. Not
least is the potential for record low household saving ratios to rebound in many
countries, particularly in the United States. This could be a spontaneous
precautionary response to higher debt levels, or to fears among baby boomers

BIS 76th Annual Report

143

that earlier pension commitments, both private and public, were less likely to
be fully honoured. Alternatively, it could be a reaction to rising interest rates,
market stress and uncertainties about future asset values. The fact that house
prices have risen to such high levels in so many countries, and that this
“wealth” effect does seem to have encouraged more spending, increases the
likelihood of such an outcome. The reality is that, for a country as a whole, the
wealth associated with house price increases is in very large part illusory.
Being a relative price shift, its benefits to gainers are largely offset by the costs
to losers. When the losers finally begin to adjust in response, it will generate
significant economic headwinds.
Other kinds of imbalances have the potential for similar mischief. In China,
the principal concern must be that misallocated capital will eventually manifest
itself in falling profits, and that this will feed back on the banking system, the
fiscal authorities and the prospects for growth more generally. After a long
period of credit-fuelled expansion, this would be the classic denouement.
Indeed, this was very much the path followed earlier by Japan. Moreover, such
an outturn might have even more severe effects on the industrial countries
than is currently thought. In such circumstances, China’s already formidable
and fast-growing manufacturing potential would surely be directed still more
towards export markets. Were this to occur, just at the time that other countries
were retrenching, the resulting interactions – economic, political and social –
would present a great challenge for both the public and private sectors.
We are, of course, currently not in a situation in which we have to confront
such problems, and the likelihood of their occurring remains low. The
consensus forecast is still the best bet. Yet the potential economic costs,
should such risks materialise, would seem great enough to warrant some
reflections on how policymakers might best respond. Such reflections do not
constitute a forecast, but rather an exercise in prudence. There is nothing
inconsistent in expecting the best but planning for the worst, particularly if the
costs of the unexpected might well be high.

How might current risks be reduced?
Today we face not only the normal uncertainties associated with responding
to incipient inflationary pressures, but also concern about various financial
imbalances, both internal and external. These imbalances are the by-product
of a decade or more of robust increases in global supply, lagging domestic
demand in large economies other than the United States, and an over-reliance
on easy monetary policies to reduce output gaps. Understanding how we got
to where we are is crucial in choosing policies to reduce current risks.
Increased supply has largely arisen from the re-entry into the global
framework of previously closed economies, supported by improved
communications and technology everywhere. To this must be added ongoing
increases in productivity growth, in the United States in particular. Continuing
deregulation of markets, for both goods and factor inputs in the industrial
countries, constitutes another explanation for the positive supply shocks seen
over the last decade or so.

144

BIS 76th Annual Report

As for lagging demand, we have observed in Asia the high saving rates
typical of people faced with the massive uncertainties of structural change, but
also the effects of the time needed to adapt spending habits to rapidly rising
income levels. The latter problem also confronts governments in countries
exporting oil and other commodities. In the industrial countries, two structural
deficiencies can also be identified. The first has been the long-standing failure
of Germany and Japan to recover fully from the stresses imposed by
reunification and the bubble period respectively. In neither case was the nettle
of structural change quickly or fully grasped. The second deficiency has been
the protracted failure of fiscal policy almost everywhere to resolve the problems
associated with the excesses of the 1970s and early 1980s. The industrial
countries, bar Japan, were subsequently left with little room for fiscal
manoeuvre in downturns, and now even Japan finds itself in the same
situation. For many countries, particularly in Europe, this problem would long
since have been overcome had they tightened fiscal policy much more
aggressively in those years when the economy was growing robustly.
Against this background, monetary policy was left to address not only the
secular trend of deficient demand, but also periodic crises associated with
disturbances in the financial system. To date, policymakers have managed the
task remarkably well. Growth has been held up and inflation has been held
down. Yet, over time, unwelcome side effects have also become increasingly
apparent. Whenever shocks have threatened growth, lower interest rates have
encouraged spending, as intended, but this has increasingly been associated
with a progressive build-up of debt, first corporate but now also household. The
growing liberalisation of financial systems has reinforced this transmission
mechanism, with the countries most sophisticated in financial matters being
allowed to run large current account deficits as well. In effect, the successful
countercyclical use of monetary policy in each instance has made subsequent
tightening more risky, and subsequent easing less likely to work.
What can still be done to reduce the risks we face in the continuing global
upswing? The first and obvious point is that global monetary policies need help
if disruptive changes in interest rates and exchange rates are to be avoided.
In particular, they need help from those specific policies that have been so
deficient in the past, namely fiscal policy and structural reforms.
Fiscal policy should be generally tightened in both the industrial countries
and the emerging markets. This will also help restore the room for manoeuvre
looking forward. The need for fiscal restraint is particularly great in the United
States, as well as those other countries facing both high government and
current account deficits. A credible, medium-term package of fiscal restraint in
deficit countries would also reassure foreign creditors that their longer-term
interests are being protected. Indirectly, it would also be a welcome source of
support for an orderly adjustment of the US dollar.
Given the size of global trade imbalances, structural changes aimed at
facilitating the transfer of resources between the tradable and non-tradable
sectors would seem highly desirable. This would also help reduce the need for
large movements in nominal exchange rates that could prove disruptive.
Revitalising the traded goods sector in the United States will be challenging

BIS 76th Annual Report

145

since, for some products, the industrial base has been much reduced.
Nevertheless, the renowned flexibility of the US economy gives grounds for
optimism. In addition, current tax subsidies could be reduced to restrain activity
in housing, an archetypal non-traded good, and some form of consumption
tax could help raise the household saving rate, which lies at the heart of the
US current account deficit. Elsewhere, steps need to be taken to encourage
the consumption and production of non-tradables. In many countries, most
strikingly China but also Germany and Japan, there remains too great a
reliance on export-led growth. Government regulations and other incentives
that work in this direction need to be rethought, particularly since rapidly ageing
populations in all three countries put a premium on increasing productivity in
the domestic services sector.
The appropriate path for global monetary policy in the current
circumstances should also be towards tightening. Whether one is more
concerned with rising inflationary pressures in the short term, or with the threat
from imbalances to sustained growth over time, both sets of indicators point
in the same direction. That said, different countries are facing different degrees
of pressure from these two sources. For example, in continental Europe levels
of excess capacity are still higher, and financial imbalances less in evidence,
than in the United States and a number of inflation targeting industrial
countries, where the more advanced degree of tightening consequently appears
appropriate. This conclusion is further reinforced by their respective external
positions. Countries with external deficits need less domestic spending, and
higher interest rates are one way to achieve this.
This general recommendation having been made, choosing the contours
of that tightening path will not be easy. Not the least of the problems to be
faced is exactly which inflation measure to use in gauging underlying inflation
trends, and here opinions vary widely. At the heart of the problem in the
industrial countries has been a major and sustained shift in relative prices, with
house and energy prices rising sharply and prices of manufactured goods
being much more subdued. Should policymakers assume that currently higher
headline inflation will, over time, recede to core levels, or the opposite?
Emerging market countries face similar problems, made worse by the relative
importance of another volatile component, food. In such a world, perhaps the
only conclusion to draw is that policymakers should put even more emphasis
on longer-term inflation trends rather than focusing narrowly on achieving
shorter-term quantitative targets.
Another complication is that the guideposts used by central banks to set
interest rates are also being shifted. As globalisation proceeds, indicators of
global slack are likely to become increasingly useful complements to more
traditional domestic measures of inflationary pressures. At the same time,
reflecting growing concerns about the effect of financial imbalances on both
growth and inflation, more attention needs to be paid to such financial
measures. There has been, in addition, a growing recognition that economic
processes might well have non-linear characteristics; sticky inflation expectations
could become unstuck, seemingly benign imbalances could suddenly result in
a sell-off in financial markets, and so on. Finally, in a more globalised world,

146

BIS 76th Annual Report

what other policymakers are doing takes on greater importance. Were there to
be a simultaneous and significant tightening in all the major financial centres,
it might produce a disinflationary result substantially greater than the sum of
its parts. Thus, while monetary restraint seems desirable almost everywhere,
it will have to be done in a careful and measured way.
How monetary policy is conducted in most countries will also be
influenced to some degree by the external imbalances problem, and how it
eventually affects exchange rates. One concern that has been raised
repeatedly is that this process might turn disorderly, particularly in the main
currency markets where the bulk of trading is carried out. The probability of
such an outcome would be reduced if the burden of upward currency
adjustment were to be broadly shared in line with the size of current account
surpluses. In particular, this implies that Asian currencies must appreciate
further. Fortunately, there are some signs that Asian central banks recognise
this, not least the fact that many of them have scaled back their interventions in
the foreign exchange markets. China, however, remains an important exception
in that it accumulated a further $200 billion plus of reserves in the course of
2005. In China, as elsewhere in Asia, greater currency flexibility might also
allow more scope for monetary tightening. This would be welcome given
general concerns about domestic overheating, as well as worries about
investment misallocations in the case of China.
Observing the policies in place, or even credibly promised, it would clearly
be a mistake to say that the risks associated with external adjustment have been
effectively eliminated. Many of the main protagonists are still focused almost
exclusively on domestic priorities, some economic and some political, the upshot
being that external imbalances are still expected to widen further. What is
needed in the light of all this is a cooperative solution through which, for the
common good, the main countries would each make domestic compromises
in return for similar compromises made by others. Most of the policies
required are not hard to identify and have already been alluded to above.
The real problem is that of implementation. As a prerequisite, all of the
major players need first to recognise that the ultimate costs of inaction are
likely to be much greater than the costs of a cooperative solution. A sharply
lower dollar could raise inflation in the United States and threaten the balance
sheets and growth prospects of European and Asian creditors. And it could
aggravate already undesirable protectionist tendencies worldwide. Recognition
of these possibilities should foster a more cooperative spirit which, with a little
luck, might suffice to guide us around the pitfalls which still lie ahead.

What to do if risks materialise?
It is impossible to predict where and when the risks implicit in current
imbalances might materialise. Nevertheless, as described above, two kinds of
scenario seem reasonable. The first would be a short, sharp shock affecting
international financial markets. The second would be an extended period of
slow global growth as imbalances gradually unwind. In reality, elements of
both scenarios could emerge together.

BIS 76th Annual Report

147

Consider first a discrete event which, if it occurred, would disrupt
financial markets. What might be done in advance to prepare for such an
eventuality? One important step would be to ensure the integrity of domestic
lines of communication among core financial firms, their supervisors, the
central bank and the operators of systemically critical parts of the financial
infrastructure. Another would be to ensure similar openness at the international
level. Current discussions on “home-host” issues between regulators in different
countries are moving this dialogue forward, as are various memoranda of
understanding on who will do what, and when. International “war games” to
simulate stressful incidents requiring a public sector response have already
been carried out in a number of European forums and have yielded useful
lessons. At the global level, the Financial Stability Forum, which brings
together central bankers, regulators and treasury officials from many large
economies as well as representatives of the international financial institutions
and specialised committees, has already made a material contribution to
crisis prevention. Presumably, it could play a useful role in crisis management
and resolution as well.
However, many improvements are still possible and desirable. National
legislation which impedes international sharing of time-critical information
remains an important obstacle to crisis management. And perhaps even more
important, there is no agreement about international burden-sharing in the
event of trouble. Whether it be deposit insurance, emergency liquidity facilities
or the restructuring of an internationally active bank, the ultimate costs could
be substantial. Without prior agreement about the allocation of such costs,
effective crisis management could easily be hampered by national authorities
acting in response to what they see as their own national interests.
In principle, the readiness of financial institutions to deal with such
problems could also be assessed in advance. Stress testing is now almost
universal in financial firms, which is highly desirable. Yet stress tests are
based on simplifying assumptions that necessarily fail to match the complexity
of real world events. Firms should recognise such limitations as they try to
ensure their preparedness for prospective difficulties and the adequacy of
their capital. Perhaps most importantly, financial firms should consider the
implications for market dynamics of other institutions reacting in the same way
to given shocks, perhaps even reflecting regulatory advice, and should prepare
themselves accordingly. Regulators, too, might reflect on this possibility. At
the least, there should be more sharing of the results of such tests among
counterparties and regulators.
Making such preparations in advance of trouble would complement the
wide variety of other measures which have been taken over the years to
improve the underlying health of financial institutions, markets, and payment
and settlement systems. A more recent suggestion that merits greater attention
is the possibility of setting up “off the shelf banks” in advance of difficulties.
The idea is to establish a legal entity that would be able to assume, at very
short notice, the vital functions of a failed financial institution and thus mitigate
the knock-on effects of closure. This would be another way to limit regulatory
forbearance, which has often been a problem in the past.

148

BIS 76th Annual Report

What might policy do in the thick of a crisis? The traditional response
would be to inject liquidity to targeted institutions. However, this raises some
questions in a rapidly changing world. One is the issue of who should be
supported in a more market-driven financial system: domestic banks only, or
also foreign banks, regulated financial institutions, special purpose vehicles
issuing asset-backed securities, or others still? Another is the question of
appropriate collateral, in particular the legality of accepting cross-border paper
and the possibility that the value of collateral might be seriously reduced in a
crisis. A third issue is whether a set of conditions should be agreed in advance
to determine whether liquidity support would be provided. Whereas not very
long ago it used to be standard to speak of the need for “constructive
ambiguity” to avoid moral hazard, there is now increasing talk in central
banking circles of “constructive clarity”. This really comes down to encouraging
banks themselves to take all reasonable steps to ensure their soundness, if
they wish to be able to turn to the authorities for support in extremis.
In a more market-driven world, it is in fact more likely that generalised
infusions of liquidity and lower interest rates would be the chosen policy
response to any serious financial incident. Indeed, we have observed this
reaction a number of times in the recent past. One complication could be
divergent movements across countries which could entail undesired exchange
rate movements. Better communication among central banks as to how they
might react to shocks would seem part of the solution in this case. Another set
of problems can arise when interest rates are kept low for an extended period,
well beyond the time required to restore more normal functioning to markets.
These latter issues are better addressed in the context of the second set of
potential problems, related to a potentially long period of slow global growth,
possibly but not necessarily accompanied by distress in the financial system.
What would be the appropriate policy response were headwinds to
threaten future growth prospects? An analysis of the historical record indicates
that four factors can interact to produce truly bad outcomes. First, real interest
rates can remain too high to reflate the economy, all the more so when nominal
rates hit the zero lower bound and prices are falling. Second, real wages can
rise and profits fall. This outcome is again made more likely if nominal wages
are sticky downwards and prices are falling. Third, high levels of indebtedness
can impose onerous debt service burdens which cut into spending. Fourth,
weakness in the real economy can feed back on the financial system, leading
in turn to credit restrictions and still further downward impetus to spending.
The question then becomes how policy might be used to help short-circuit
each of these channels, recognising that each recommended policy is likely to
have a downside as well as an upside.
In a potential future downturn, it would seem perfectly natural to reduce
interest rates to stimulate aggregate demand. However, given the high debt
levels built up in response to earlier easing, this approach might not work
smoothly. In Japan, unprecedented monetary and fiscal easing did not suffice
to turn the economy around in the 1990s. In the United States, despite similarly
unprecedented easing after 2001, the subsequent upturn was among the
weakest in the postwar period, particularly in fixed investment and employment.

BIS 76th Annual Report

149

It must also be recognised that very low nominal interest rates can also
have substantial negative side effects, not least on aggregate supply. After
a period of excessive spending, low borrowing costs can allow “zombie
companies” to roll over debts and survive, as they did in Japan, to the
detriment of the more healthy. They also provide strong encouragement to
merger and acquisition activity, even though the historical record shows this is
more likely to destroy value than create it. Low rates also constitute a transfer
from creditors to debtors, which reduces saving and capital formation over time
and eventually becomes a threat to higher living standards. The negative side
effects of low interest rates on financial markets also need to be taken into
account. The search for yield can lead to serious distortions, and the potential
for future instability, as investors both purchase inherently riskier assets and
use increased leverage to do so. Moreover, finding an “exit strategy” from such
policies is not easy. We are currently experiencing such difficulties, and they
will be even worse the next time around if debt levels rise further.
Such considerations imply that, if a sustained period of weak global
growth were to occur, a policy of monetary and fiscal easing should be
complemented by other, more structural measures. Given that sustained
corporate profitability is a necessary condition for a revival of investment
spending, measures to restrain wages and increase productivity have their
attractions. Again, however, there are downsides. First, as with easier
monetary policy, they might not work. In Japan, wage growth was very
restrained for years, but investment stubbornly failed to recover until quite
recently. Second, paying lower wages to fewer workers initially implies a
smaller wage bill, and therefore less household income and spending. In
Japan, household spending was cushioned from these effects by a large
decline in the household saving rate. This might be less likely in a future
downturn in countries where the saving rate is already very low, as it currently
is in the United States.
Dealing directly with the overhang of debt can also make a contribution
to avoiding longer-term problems. Indeed, the trend towards securitisation of
debt, together with new instruments for credit risk transfer, could already be
increasing the incidence of corporate bankruptcies as opposed to “orderly
workouts” orchestrated by friendly banks. An early determination that a
debtor is effectively insolvent, and an early resolution, are suggestions
that have a great deal to recommend them. In this fashion, much uncertainty
can be removed from the system. Moreover, putting processes in place to
ensure maximisation of the value of the remaining assets has obvious appeal.
If, in so doing, production capacity could also be removed from industries
where profits have been pushed down to very low levels, this too would help
redress supply side imbalances built up earlier.
As with the other policy responses just discussed, explicit debt reduction
also has its downsides. The first and most obvious is moral hazard, though
bankruptcy laws can be designed to help reduce this. The second problem is
that an early and explicit recognition that debts cannot be serviced could
feed back on the health of the banking system. In current circumstances in
the industrial countries, with debt having been so widely securitised, this

150

BIS 76th Annual Report

would seem to be less of a problem. However, property loans and loans to
households could still be an eventual source of disruption. Moreover, for the
banking systems in emerging market countries, widespread debt relief or
recourse to bankruptcy procedures could still threaten the solvency of individual
institutions and perhaps the viability of the system as whole.
This challenge accepted, it also presents an opportunity. To the extent
that losses are borne by the banking system, and explicitly recognised as
losses, the by-products of earlier excesses are consolidated and can be more
easily addressed. In particular, the banking system can be recapitalised and
steps can be taken to ensure that banks will operate profitably in the future.
Such a restored system could then play its full part in financing renewed
expansion. The experience of the Nordic countries, faced with such problems
at the end of the 1980s, shows what might be done given the requisite
political will.

Can we avoid similar risks in the future?
No one today would question the substantial economic benefits associated
with reducing inflation from the high levels it reached in the 1970s. Yet, with
the passage of time, it is all too easy to forget how difficult that task looked in
prospect. Policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s were generally of the view
that the unemployment costs of reducing inflation would be both large and
long-lasting, substantially outweighing the benefits. They were wrong. New
analytical insights highlighted the role of inflation expectations, and how
credible policies could ratchet those expectations down, and keep them down,
at a much lower cost than initially expected. The generally excellent economic
performance of the industrial countries over the last 20 to 30 years confirms
the wisdom of those who decided to put that insight to the test.
However, it would also fly in the face of historical fact to contend that a
climate of low inflation is sufficient to avoid all macroeconomic problems. In
recent decades, we have witnessed all sorts of disruptive incidents related in
part to the removal of constraints in previously repressed financial systems.
Consider the Mexican financial crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis of 1997, the
Russian debt default and the events surrounding the failure of LTCM in 1998,
and the stock market crash of 2001. None of these events was preceded to any
significant degree by overt inflation. Looking further back in history, neither in
the United States during the 1920s nor in Japan during the 1980s were strong
inflationary pressures apparent. Evidently, low inflation, while highly desirable,
has not always been sufficient to ensure good economic performance.
In a similar vein, recent evidence also confirms that not all incidents of
falling prices lead to serious macroeconomic problems. The source of the price
decline matters. Increases in productivity and global competition over the last
few years have reduced pricing power, but profit shares have actually risen
nonetheless. This evidence also concurs with longer historical studies which
reveal many periods where deflation and rapid growth coexisted easily. Indeed,
such studies show that the appalling experience of the Great Depression in
the United States was effectively unique.

Taken together, these considerations imply that the current conventional
approach to the pursuit of price stability might need refinement. The risk is
that, given a forecast which shows inflation to be well under control, over the
one- to two-year forecast horizon normally used by central banks, policy rates
might be maintained at very low levels relative to expected rates of return on
investment. Positive supply shocks increase this risk by both keeping inflation
down and raising the spirits of economic agents. This in turn would be expected
to prompt entrepreneurs to increase their recourse to credit in order to
purchase financial assets and invest in physical capital and commodities.
Similarly, low policy rates and hence borrowing costs could induce consumers
to bring purchases forward in time, including the acquisition of houses and
consumer durables. To a significant degree, of course, the effects of such
processes on spending and job creation could be deemed highly welcome.
But beyond a certain point danger lurks, as rising asset prices both encourage
more speculation and provide the collateral for the related borrowing. All of the
historical episodes of “boom and bust” noted above share these dynamic
characteristics in very significant measure.
To reflect such possibilities, the Keynesian analytical framework, which
remains the workhorse in the stable of most central bankers, needs modification.
A much richer set of indicators is now needed to guide the setting of interest
rates, in particular indicators of financial imbalances, both internal and external.
Over longer time periods, such imbalances can pose an even greater and
more dangerous threat to price stability, on the downside, than shorterterm and more conventional inflationary “pressures” such as output gaps.
Recognising this fact implies that we should lengthen the horizon over which
we assess the success of monetary policy in stabilising prices, in order to see
its full effects. Raising interest rates in some circumstances might temporarily
push inflation below desired levels, but this might still be preferable to a
boom-bust scenario in which the eventual undershooting of the inflation target
is both larger and more lasting. Alternatively, there could be scope for reducing
this trade-off dilemma by using other instruments, of a more regulatory
nature, to help reduce the build-up of credit-financed imbalances in the first
place. Such suggestions would, however, require a significant change in both
the regulatory culture and the nature of the relationship between central
banks and other public agencies.

Organisation, governance and activities

This chapter provides an overview of the internal organisation and governance
of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). It also reviews the activities of
the Bank, and of the international groups it hosts, over the past year. These
activities focus on the promotion of cooperation among central banks and other
financial authorities, and on the provision of financial services to central bank
customers.

Organisation and governance of the Bank

The Bank, its management and shareholders
The BIS is an international organisation that fosters international monetary and
financial cooperation and serves as a bank for central banks. Its head office is
in Basel, Switzerland, and it has two representative offices, one in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China and one
in Mexico City. The Bank currently employs 554 staff from 49 countries.
The BIS fulfils its mandate by acting as:
• a forum to promote discussion and facilitate decision-making among central
banks and to support dialogue with other authorities with responsibility
for financial stability;
• a centre for economic and monetary research;
• a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
• an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The Bank also hosts the secretariats of a number of committees and
organisations that seek to promote financial stability:
• The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on the
Global Financial System, the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems and the Markets Committee have been established by the
Governors of the G10 central banks over the past 40 years. They enjoy a
significant degree of autonomy in setting their agendas and structuring
their activities.
• The Financial Stability Forum, the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors and the International Association of Deposit Insurers are
independent organisations that do not directly report to the BIS or its
member central banks.
Details of the role and recent activities of these committees and
organisations are provided below.
The Bank has three main departments: the Monetary and Economic
Department, the Banking Department and the General Secretariat. These are
supplemented by the Legal Service, the Compliance, Internal Audit and Risk

BIS 76th Annual Report

155

Control units, and the Financial Stability Institute, which fosters the
dissemination of standards and best practices to financial system supervisors
worldwide.
There are three main bodies for governing and administering the Bank:
• the General Meeting of member central banks. Fifty-five central banks or
monetary authorities currently have rights of voting and representation at
General Meetings. The Annual General Meeting is held within four months
of the end of the Bank’s financial year, 31 March. In 2005, 110 central
banks took part, including 84 at Governor level. Delegates from 21
international institutions also attended;
• the Board of Directors, currently comprising 17 members. Its main tasks
include determining the strategic and policy direction of the Bank and
supervising the Bank’s Management. The Board is assisted by the Audit
Committee and the Consultative Committee, composed of selected
Directors; and
• the Executive Committee, chaired by the General Manager and comprising
the Deputy General Manager, the Heads of Department and other officers
of similar rank appointed by the Board. The Executive Committee advises
the General Manager on all important matters affecting the Bank as a
whole.
An Extraordinary General Meeting held in conjunction with the Bank’s
2005 Annual General Meeting decided to revise the BIS Statutes to streamline
the governance of the Bank. This followed a review undertaken by the Bank
the previous year to enhance the transparency of its operations and structure.
As a result, the position of President of the BIS was abolished, effective
27 June 2005. The positions of Chairman of the Board and President had
been vested in one person since 1948. The review also recognised terms of
reference for the Executive Committee as an advisory committee to the General
Manager, and Charters for the Board of Directors and several operational
committees were drawn up.
Member central banks, Directors and senior officials, and recent changes
in the composition of the Board and Management are listed at the end of this
chapter.

Promotion of international financial and monetary cooperation:
direct contributions of the BIS during 2005/06
In early 2006, the BIS announced initiatives to deepen relationships with its
strategic partners in Asia following an intensive consultation process with BIS
member central banks in the region. The initiatives comprise a three-year
research programme on monetary and financial issues in Asia and the Pacific,
an expansion of the work of the Financial Stability Institute in the region,
and an extension of banking services from the BIS Representative Office in
Hong Kong SAR.

Regular consultations on monetary and financial matters
Every two months, the Governors and other senior officials of the BIS member
central banks convene for a series of meetings to discuss current economic
and financial developments and the outlook for the world economy and financial
markets. They also exchange views and experiences on issues of special

BIS 76th Annual Report

157

and topical interest to central banks. These bimonthly meetings are one of
the most important ways in which the Bank promotes cooperation within
the central banking community. In addition, the Bank organises various other
meetings, on a regular or an ad hoc basis, for senior central bank officials.
In a number of these meetings, other financial authorities, the private financial
sector and the academic community are invited to contribute to the dialogue.
The Global Economy Meeting, which brings together the Governors of key
industrial and emerging market economies, monitors economic and financial
developments and assesses the risks and opportunities in the world economy
and financial markets. The meetings of Governors of the G10 countries
and those of Governors of key emerging market economies often explore
conjunctural themes that are of special relevance to the respective groups of
economies. The G10 Governors also discuss issues pertaining to the work of
the permanent central bank committees hosted by the Bank.
Because not all central banks are directly involved in the work of the
committees and other organisations hosted by the Bank, a periodic Review
Meeting for Governors briefs them on the activities of these specialised
groupings. On occasion, the Review Meeting also explores a topic of direct
importance to this group of central banks. In 2005/06 Governors discussed:
• recent developments in the oil market;
• foreign exchange market issues;
• Basel II and issues of home and host country supervision;
• the revised Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision;
• housing finance; and
• the relationship between the central bank and the government.
Finally, issues of a more structural nature and of general interest to all
BIS member central banks were discussed in the All Governors Meetings:
• central banks and financial stability: objectives, instruments and
accountability;
• the effects of globalisation on wage and price formation. What has
changed and does it matter?;
• credit markets, complex financial products and risk management;
• issues and prospects of ERM II and accession to the euro area; and
• the measurement of inflation for monetary policy.
In analysing issues related to financial stability, Governors attach
importance to dialogue with heads of supervisory agencies, other financial
authorities and senior executives from the private financial sector. The Bank
regularly organises informal discussions among public and private sector
representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting and
maintaining a sound and well functioning financial system.
Other meetings organised for senior central bankers on a less frequent
basis include:
• the biannual central bank economists meeting, which in October 2005
examined the evolution of the inflation process;
• the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, which
are not only held in Basel but are also hosted by a number of central
banks in Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America; and

158

BIS 76th Annual Report

•

the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies, for
which this year’s theme was progress in the banking system in emerging
economies.

Other areas of central bank cooperation promoted by the BIS
Research activities
In addition to providing background material for meetings of senior central
bankers and secretariat services to committees, the BIS contributes to
international monetary and financial cooperation by carrying out its own
research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks and, increasingly,
financial supervisory authorities. This work finds its way into the Bank’s regular
publications, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review and the
BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as external professional
publications. Most of the Bank’s research is published on its website
(www.bis.org).
In line with the Bank’s mission, the long-term focus of the research is on
monetary and financial stability issues. Themes receiving special attention
during the period under review included:
• changes in the inflation process, in particular the linkages between
inflation and globalisation as well as the role of the exchange rate;
• the measurement and pricing of credit risk, notably as reflected in new
financial instruments such as credit derivatives;
• the measurement of risk appetite and its impact on the pricing of financial
assets;
• trends in international banking;
• coordination between monetary and prudential policies; and
• the nexus between risk management, accounting and prudential
regulation.
As part of its research activities, the BIS also organises conferences and
workshops, typically bringing together senior policymakers, academics and
market participants. In June 2005, in the broader context of the Bank’s
celebrations marking its 75th anniversary, the Fourth BIS Annual Conference
addressed the past and future of central bank cooperation. In November a
high-level workshop was devoted to an analysis of the relationship between
accounting, risk management and prudential regulation.

Cooperation in the statistical area
A major development in the statistical area was the decision by the BIS in
January 2006 to provide the Secretariat of the Irving Fisher Committee on
Central Bank Statistics (IFC). This is a global forum of users and compilers of
statistics at central banks, which has operated informally since 1997 under the
auspices of the International Statistical Institute (ISI). The Committee is
currently chaired by Jan Smets, Director at the National Bank of Belgium and
alternate BIS Board member. In April 2005 the Committee organised a number
of meetings at the 55th ISI Session in Sydney. It also co-sponsored a workshop

BIS 76th Annual Report

159

with the Bank of Canada in June 2005 on “Data requirements for analysing
the stability and vulnerability of mature financial systems”. In April 2006
it organised a workshop on “CPI measurement: central bank views and
concerns”, which was attended by most of the central banks represented at the
BIS Global Economy Meeting. Preparations are under way for the Third IFC
Conference, to be held at the BIS at the end of August 2006 on the topic of
“Measuring the financial position of the household sector”. Information on
the IFC, including on the governance of the Committee and the papers from
its various meetings, is available at www.ifcommittee.org.
BIS support for the IFC reflects the fact that statistical data and related
methodological issues are becoming increasingly important to central banks,
from the perspective of both monetary and financial stability. Hosting the IFC
Secretariat is also a natural extension of other services that the BIS provides
to the central bank statistical community, including the BIS Data Bank and the
collection of various international financial statistics.
Four central banks officially became new participants in the BIS Data
Bank last year: those of Argentina, Brazil, China and India. This brings the total
number of contributors to 39, almost all of which are BIS shareholding central
banks. Moreover, those BIS shareholding central banks that do not participate
in the Data Bank were invited to begin reporting a limited number of key
economic indicators to the BIS as a contribution to the background statistical
material prepared for the BIS bimonthly meetings.
In October 2005, 35 central banks participated in the biennial Meeting of
Experts on (BIS) International Financial Statistics, which reviewed a number
of analytical and technical issues related to these statistics. Last year, the
reporting framework was extended for the consolidated banking statistics (to
provide more information on ultimate risk exposures, including off-balance
sheet data) as well as for the OTC derivatives statistics (to include data on
credit default swaps). Data from Korea were included in the BIS locational
banking statistics, and information from Croatia and Pakistan was added
to the domestic securities statistics. At the end of 2005, the BIS also decided
to release preliminary data for its international banking statistics a number
of weeks before their official publication in the BIS Quarterly Review. In
addition, preparations started for the next Triennial Central Bank Survey
of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, to be carried out in 2007,
in which the central banks of more than 50 countries are expected to
participate.
The BIS worked very closely last year with the IMF, OECD and World
Bank, in the context of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Finance Statistics,
to establish a new Joint External Debt Hub. This web-based facility
(www.jedh.org), launched in March 2006, brings together improved data from
creditor and market sources on external debt components with external debt
data available from national statistical agencies.
The Joint External Debt Hub makes full use of the technical standards,
content-oriented guidelines and implementation tools developed by the
Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) initiative. On behalf of the
central banks participating in its statistical activities, the BIS contributes

160

BIS 76th Annual Report

to SDMX together with the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United
Nations and the World Bank. By end-March 2006, all major building blocks
of SDMX had been released at www.sdmx.org. These include a number of
technical specifications, which have been approved by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). Preliminary discussions with XBRL
International, provider of a similar standards framework for accounting
information, have confirmed the potential for making the frameworks for
exchanging statistical and accounting data interoperable, and further work
in this direction is expected. The BIS will chair the SDMX Sponsors Committee
in 2006–07.

Central bank governance
The Bank has been conducting activities in the area of central bank governance
for more than a decade. Throughout this period, it has been guided by the
objective of meeting the growing needs of central banks for timely and accurate
information and well focused analysis. In May 2005, these activities were
formalised with the approval by the Governors of BIS shareholder central
banks of a charter establishing the Central Bank Governance Forum. The
purpose of the Forum is to foster the good governance of central banks as
public policy institutions. The Governance Forum consists of the Central Bank
Governance Group and the Central Bank Governance Network. Secretariat
support is provided by the BIS.
The Governance Group comprises Governors from a broadly based and
representative group of central banks. Its members discuss topical issues of
central bank governance. They also invite Governors from other central banks
to participate in their discussions whenever the topic at hand is of particular
relevance to those central banks. During the past year, the Group considered a
range of issues, including freedom of information legislation and central banks,
the role of the Governor as chairperson of major boards and committees of the
central bank, and the relationship between the central bank and government.
In keeping with the advice of the Governance Group, the BIS accords priority
to addressing governance questions that are critical for the effective operation
of independent and accountable monetary authorities.
The Governance Network spans more than 45 major central banks and
monetary authorities around the world. Members contribute actively to efforts
by sharing information on central banks’ approaches to institutional and
organisational matters. This collegial approach enables the collection of
information on mandates, powers, operations and accountability arrangements
that can be used by central banks to strengthen their institutions.

Group of Computer Experts of the G10 central banks
In last year’s two meetings of the Group of Computer Experts and the two
convened for its Working Party on Security Issues, discussions focused
primarily on IT governance, business continuity planning, protection of internal
systems from external threats, and mobile computing or remote access.
Group members benefited from sharing with their peer organisations the
experience gained with various models for internal IT governance, achieving

BIS 76th Annual Report

161

an appropriate balance between innovation and standardisation, and the
underlying reasons for the failure of many IT governance models.
Business continuity planning received additional priority, given the need
for increased preparations for a possible avian flu pandemic, which would
primarily affect human resource availability (including dependencies on
external services) rather than IT systems.
Security threats, while still significant, resulted in marginally fewer
disruptions than in previous years, probably due to the increase in available
industry tools and measures for detecting and eradicating these threats,
particularly viruses. Solutions against spam e-mail are now also more widely
deployed, reducing the effects of this nuisance threat. Mobile computing and
its associated risks continue to be an area requiring constant attention, driven
by both business expectations and market developments.
Other topics covered at the Group’s meetings included service sourcing
models, the benefits of internal IT audits, and compliance with nominal industry
IT standards (such as ITIL).

Internal Audit
Since 1986, G10 central bank auditors have met regularly to share experience
and knowledge in their area of expertise, and to address new issues and
challenges. The main topics for discussion usually derive from international
internal auditing standards and the continuous need to improve controls over
the risks faced by central banks. Twice a year, the BIS’s Internal Audit unit
organises and hosts the meetings of the G10 Working Party on IT Audit
Methodologies.
In June 2005, the BIS participated in the 19th Annual Plenary Conference
of G10 Heads of Internal Audit, hosted by the Bank of Japan and covering in
particular: the role of internal audit in the ethics and ethical awareness of an
organisation; the implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; auditing corporate
governance; the role of internal audit in IT governance; and auditing business
continuity management (for the last topic, the BIS coordinated the work of a
G10 task force).
Following several meetings of internal audit heads from Asia-Pacific
central banks and monetary authorities, BIS Internal Audit has established a
contact and information sharing network with these institutions.

Cooperation with regional central bank groupings
The Group of Coordinators of Technical Cooperation and Training, set up in
the early 1990s to coordinate central bank technical assistance to former
planned economies, held its annual meeting in St Petersburg in June 2005,
with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as host. The meeting
confirmed that the nature of technical cooperation amongst central banks
is changing in a number of ways. Instead of traditional forms of technical
assistance, training activities are becoming more important, as are various
forms of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. In addition, many of the
erstwhile recipients of technical assistance in eastern Europe are now
engaged in technical cooperation with CIS states and the Balkans. Technical

162

BIS 76th Annual Report

cooperation is also being strengthened with central banks in other regions, in
particular Asia.
The BIS continued to support various regional central bank groups by
organising occasional joint events or contributing speakers to their meetings.
Last year, that included:
• the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN);
• the Centro de Estudios Monetarios Latinoamericanos (CEMLA);
• central banks from eastern Europe and the CIS, through the Joint Vienna
Institute;
• the Centre Africain d’Études Supérieures en Gestion (CESAG), which is
sponsored by, amongst others, the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO); and
• the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa (MEFMI).

Communications
The Bank’s 75th anniversary in 2005 provided additional opportunities for
disseminating information about the role of the BIS since 1930 in seeking to
promote international financial cooperation:
• An exhibition (“this is the biz”), inaugurated by Chairman of the Board
Nout Wellink on the occasion of the 75th Annual General Meeting, opened
for two weeks in July 2005 and was visited by some 6,000 members of
the general public. Besides a range of documentation and contemporary
illustrations, the exhibition included a filmed interview sequence with
central bank Governors and used multimedia to tell the story of the BIS
and explain its current functions.
• The complete series of BIS Annual Reports was published on DVD, in the
Bank’s four official languages, providing convenient, searchable access
to Annual Report content since 1930. The DVD is available for further
distribution to libraries and researchers.
In January 2006, the BIS launched a revamped website, providing
enhanced access to research by central banks and public speeches by leading
central bankers. By May 2006, participation in the web-based Central Bank
Research Hub, first launched in 2004, had increased to 40 institutions.

Representative Offices
The Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (Asian Office) and that for
the Americas (Americas Office) serve as platforms for BIS activities in their
respective regions. The Offices aim to strengthen relations between the BIS and
central banks and supervisory authorities in the regions, on the one hand, and
to promote cooperation within each region, on the other. To these ends, the
Offices organise meetings, foster the exchange of information and data, and
contribute to the Bank’s financial and economic research on the regions. Last
year, this contribution focused on bond market development, regional currency
markets and the management of foreign exchange reserves, resulting in a number
of publications.

BIS 76th Annual Report

163

The Offices also help to deliver BIS banking services in the two regions
through regular visits to reserve managers of central banks and meetings at
both technical and managerial levels.

Asia-Pacific
The regional treasury dealing room in the Asian Office further enhances
banking services to regional customers through its daily trading activities,
in support of which two back office staff members were transferred from head
office. This dealing room is also taking the lead in managing new Australian
dollar products as well as the Bank’s own investments in Asian currencies.
The BIS contributed as fund administrator to the establishment and partial
public listing of funds under the second Asian Bond Fund (ABF2) initiative
of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP). The
11 EMEAP member central banks have invested international reserves in
domestic currency bonds issued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign borrowers
in eight EMEAP economies. During the period under review, the BIS supported
the transition to a public fund for the ABF Pan-Asia Bond Index Fund and
the first ever exchange-traded bond funds for Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia,
Singapore and Thailand. In addition, the manager of the ABF1 was transferred
to the Asian Office, and economists there continued to support these initiatives
with research on Asian bond markets.
Two meetings of the Asian Consultative Council (ACC) responded to BIS
Management proposals to strengthen the relationship between Asian
shareholding central banks and the Bank. These proposals envisage a threeyear research programme, entailing a substantial commitment of staff, a
widening of banking services and enhanced work by the Financial Stability
Institute supported by a full-time FSI staff member in the Asian Office. The
ACC’s June 2005 meeting in Basel discussed the broad outline of a new Asian
strategy, and the meeting the following February in Shanghai endorsed specific
proposals. On the latter occasion, the ACC forwarded to the BIS Board a
record of its discussion of Asian central banks’ role in the BIS, which had
begun at an earlier ACC retreat. Immediately following the February meeting,
the Asian central bank Governors met with several Governors from outside
Asia for their eighth Special Meeting to review the economic outlook and the
development of corporate bond markets.
The Asian Office organised or helped to organise several meetings on
monetary policy, financial development and financial stability:
• a meeting on securities regulation for banking supervisors in conjunction
with the Financial Stability Institute (May 2005);
• the 10th and 11th meetings of the EMEAP Forum on foreign exchange
and other financial markets (June and December 2005);
• a meeting on Asian monetary integration with the Hong Kong Institute
for Monetary Research (HKIMR) (October 2005);
• a meeting for central bank reserve managers at the Reserve Bank of
Australia in Sydney (October 2005);
• a meeting on Asian monetary policy objectives and implementation with
the HKIMR (November 2005);

164

•

a meeting on the development of corporate bond markets with the
People’s Bank of China in Kunming (November 2005); and
the fourth meeting of central bank experts on monetary policy operating
procedures (March 2006).

The Americas
The focus of activity for the Americas Office during its third year of operation
was on expanding its contacts with central banks in the region and cooperating
more closely with regional central banking and supervisory authorities. The
Office also hosted or supported a series of high-level meetings in Mexico City
and elsewhere, sometimes jointly with regional central banks and other
institutions. Noteworthy regional activities furthering the Bank’s goals were:
• a regional consultative meeting on the CPSS report General guidance
for national payment system development, held in cooperation with the
Central Bank of the Dominican Republic and the Consejo Monetario
Centroamericano, in the Dominican Republic (August 2005);
a
joint seminar organised by the FSI and the Association of Supervisors of
•
Banks of the Americas (ASBA) for bank supervisors on “Credit risk under
Basel II”, in Mexico (September 2005);
• a seminar on “Living with mobile international capital flows” at CEMLA,
in Mexico (September 2005);
• a meeting of the Working Party on Monetary Policy in Latin America, in
Argentina (October 2005);
• a joint seminar organised by the FSI and CEMLA for bank supervisors on the
“Supervisory review process under Basel II”, in Argentina (November 2005);
• a high-level meeting on “Evolving banking systems: challenges and
implications for monetary policy and financial stability”, with a particular
emphasis on small open economies, in Jamaica (January 2006);
• a joint seminar organised by the FSI and ASBA on “Validation of IRB
systems in Basel II”, in Peru (February 2006);
• a regional workshop of the CGFS Working Group on financial stability
and local currency bond markets, in Mexico (March 2006); and
• the creation of a virtual secure communication space for central bank
lawyers in Latin America on the Bank’s eBIS platform.

Financial Stability Institute
The mandate of the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) is to assist financial
sector authorities in strengthening their financial systems and to promote
financial stability globally. The FSI follows a two-pronged approach designed
to disseminate standards and sound practices primarily to the banking and
insurance supervision sectors.
The first prong of the FSI approach is the long-standing series of highlevel meetings, seminars and conferences both in Basel and at venues around
the world. In 2005, the FSI organised a total of 51 events on a broad range of
financial sector supervision topics. More than 1,700 representatives of central
banks and banking and insurance supervisory agencies participated. These

BIS 76th Annual Report

165

events promote information sharing, the identification of issues and the
strengthening of cross-border supervisory contacts. The FSI is also continuing
its series of high-level meetings to foster information exchange among heads of
supervision in the various regions with regard to Basel II implementation issues
and plans. These meetings have also included representatives of commercial
banks, thereby helping the supervisory community to stay informed about
banks’ implementation challenges.
The second prong is FSI Connect, an online information and learning
resource for banking supervisors. FSI Connect currently includes more than
100 tutorials covering a wide range of topics for supervisors at all levels of
experience and expertise, and new topics are added periodically. In addition,
approximately 40 tutorials related to capital and Basel II are being translated
into French and Spanish. This will enable FSI Connect to reach a wider
audience of banking supervisors globally. More than 120 central banks and
supervisory authorities from approximately 105 jurisdictions currently subscribe
to FSI Connect, representing nearly 8,000 users.

Promotion of financial stability through the permanent committees

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, chaired by Jaime Caruana,
Governor of the Bank of Spain, strives to strengthen banking supervisory
frameworks and to promote risk management best practices in the banking
industry. With effect from 1 July 2006, Jaime Caruana will be succeeded as
Chairman by Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank.

Implementation of the revised capital framework (“Basel II”)
Following public consultation and in close collaboration with the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), in July 2005 the Committee
released some refinements to the treatment of trading activities under Basel II.
Additionally, the Committee issued the results of a study on the impact of the
Basel II capital framework on regulatory capital requirements. This study had
been carried out by banks in most member countries and a number of nonmember countries in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result of the study, the
Committee confirmed the 1.06% “scaling factor” to be applied to banks’ internal
credit rating assessments under the new Basel framework.
Consistent cross-border implementation of Basel II remains one of the
key areas of focus for the Committee. In that regard, the Committee’s Accord
Implementation Group (AIG) has continued to encourage collaboration and
consistency. Members of the AIG regularly share experiences as they work
with fellow supervisors to establish practical implementation strategies
tailored to internationally active banks’ operations. To assist this process,
the AIG, in conjunction with non-Committee member countries, finalised in
June 2006 a guidance paper on effective home-host information sharing
under Basel II. The Committee has also published its views on the validation
of low-default portfolios, the use of vendor products and operational risk.

BIS 76th Annual Report

Corporate governance for banks
Corporate governance has continued to attract considerable international
attention in the light of a number of high-profile breakdowns in governance
processes, which led the OECD to publish revised corporate governance
principles in 2004. In February 2006, the Basel Committee issued an updated
and significantly revised version of its 1999 document Enhancing corporate
governance for banking organisations, which recognises the banking industry’s
unique characteristics.

Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision
In April 2006, the Committee issued for public comment two revised and
updated documents, Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the
associated Core Principles Methodology. The Principles were originally
published by the Committee in September 1997, and since that time they have
been used by countries and external assessors as a benchmark for the
quality of national supervisory systems. The Methodology, first issued in 1999,
is designed to improve objectivity and comparability in the assessment of
different countries’ compliance with the Core Principles. Since 1997, significant
changes have occurred in banking regulation, much experience has been
gained with implementing the Core Principles in individual countries, and new
regulatory issues have emerged. A wide range of users and experts have been
involved in drafting the revised versions.

Accounting and auditing
Over the past year, the Committee’s efforts have focused on contributing to
the development of international accounting and auditing standards. Highlevel dialogue with standard setters and industry leaders in these areas is
helping the Committee to gain well informed perspectives and heighten
sensitivity towards supervisory concerns over accounting and auditing issues
early in the standards development process.
The Committee has formulated specific guidance addressing prudential
concerns for banks electing to adopt the recently issued International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) fair value option for valuing financial
instruments. A paper was published providing guidance on sound credit risk
assessment and valuation for loans, which considers how common data and
processes can be used for credit risk assessment, accounting and capital
adequacy purposes. Finally, the Committee has submitted comments addressing
revised international auditing standards and has contributed to the development
of audit oversight bodies.

Increasing the involvement of non-member countries in the Basel Committee
process
Since May 2006, the Committee’s agendas, action points and working
documents have also been distributed to the chairs of the regional supervisory
groups for circulation within the groups at their discretion. The Committee is
closely involved in the organisation of the next International Conference of
Banking Supervisors, which will take place in Mexico in October 2006. In

BIS 76th Annual Report

167

addition, it has materially increased the amount of information about its
activities on the BIS public website.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) meets four times a
year, and is mandated to monitor developments in global financial markets
and report to the central bank Governors of the G10 countries. The members
of the CGFS also undertake coordinated longer-term projects by forming study
groups or working groups that address topics of particular interest in the area
of financial market developments. The members of the CGFS include senior
officials from G10 central banks and the ECB, and representatives of a number
of central banks from major economies and financial centres.

Monitoring discussions
The Committee’s monitoring discussions, which focused on macroeconomic
and financial market developments during the past year, covered the following
issues:
• implications for the global economy arising from a turn in the credit cycle
and from rising commodity prices;
• implications of the widespread tightening of monetary policy for banks in
emerging market economies;
• the build-up of foreign exchange reserves in many emerging economies
and its domestic implications;
• the decline in long-term bond yields, the role of pension funds in that
process and its implications;
• the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the global reinsurance industry;
• the compression of emerging market yield spreads and identification of
factors that might have played a role;
• the sources and implications of the recent rise in merger and acquisition
activity; and
• the reasons for the weakness of corporate investment in a number of
economies.

Working groups and other projects
In January 2006 the Committee published a report on Housing finance in the
global financial market, from a working group that studied structural factors
influencing the supply of and demand for housing finance. The working group’s
main conclusions were as follows: first, the developments in the housing
finance market have led to an improved allocation and pricing of credit that
has enhanced financial and macroeconomic stability; second, stress tests
conducted by central banks and others indicate that the current level of debt is
affordable and that the majority of borrowers would be able to absorb plausible
declines in house prices and higher interest rates; finally, the fact that housing
loans are increasingly funded in capital markets may result in stronger links
between global financial market developments and domestic housing markets
than observed in the past.

The CGFS is currently working on the following projects:
organising a workshop with market participants to discuss the structural
changes taking place in credit markets, and to understand the supply and
demand factors driving these developments;
a study group on volatility to understand the factors contributing to the
recent low volatility in financial markets, driven by concern that this
might encourage financial players to take excessive risk, with potential
implications for financial stability;
a working group on financial stability and local currency bond markets to
review how far the issuance of local currency debt improves domestic
financial intermediation, and what financial stability implications these
developments might have; and
a working group on institutional investors to analyse the influence of
changing regulatory and accounting standards and structural reforms of
public pension systems on institutional investors’ asset allocation and
risk-taking decisions.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) contributes
to strengthening financial market infrastructure by promoting sound and
efficient payment and settlement systems. During the period under review, the
Committee further enhanced its cooperation with other international institutions
and groupings, and involved an increasingly wide group of central banks in its
activities. Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is Chairman of the Committee.
In May 2005, the Committee published reports on Central bank oversight
of payment and settlement systems and New developments in large-value
payment systems. In January 2006, it released a report on Cross-border
collateral arrangements, and one on General guidance for national payment
system development. This last report benefited greatly from input received
following the release of a consultative version of the report in May 2005.
In February 2006, the Committee announced that it would conduct a
survey of how banks and other selected institutions manage the risks they can
incur when settling foreign exchange transactions. The survey took place during
the second quarter of this year and was based on those carried out in 1996
and 1997, the results of which were reported in Reducing foreign exchange
settlement risk: a progress report. The latest survey was updated to reflect the
significant developments in settlement practices that have since taken place.
In March 2006, the Committee and the World Bank issued a consultative
report on General principles for international remittance services. The report
provides an analysis of the payment system aspects of remittances, on the
basis of which it sets out general principles designed to assist countries that
wish to improve the market for remittance services. The report contains five
general principles covering transparency and consumer protection; payment
system infrastructure; the legal and regulatory framework; market structure
and competition; and governance and risk management.

BIS 76th Annual Report

169

The Committee continued to enhance its cooperation with other central
banks, particularly those of emerging market economies, in order to extend its
work outside the G10. It also provided support and expertise to workshops
and seminars on payment system issues organised by the BIS in cooperation
with regional central banking organisations.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee brings together senior G10 central bank officials
responsible for market operations. Its bimonthly meetings provide an
opportunity for participants to exchange views on recent developments and
structural changes in foreign exchange and related financial markets, as well
as to consider the short-run implications of particular current events for the
functioning of these markets. The Committee invites representatives from
major countries to join the discussions on a regular basis; in addition to the
central banks and monetary authorities of Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong
SAR, Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Spain, the Reserve Bank of India
participated for the first time in early 2006.
Issues covered in the meetings included:
• the recent movements in the major bilateral exchange rates and the
impact of the changing assessments of the outlook for monetary policy
in the three largest currency areas;
• the implications of the new exchange rate arrangements in China;
• the influence of the growth of electronic trading platforms on the
functioning of forex markets;
• the challenges posed by the low-volatility environment;
• the factors behind the recent rise in the price of commodities, in particular
gold;
• the movements in bond yields in the major financial markets, with a focus
on the role played by supply and demand factors (including the influence
of institutional investors and the impact of changes in pension fund
regulatory arrangements), as well as on the more varied performance
across the credit spectrum; and
• the impact on financial markets of foreign exchange reserve accumulation.
Members also discussed a number of specific topics over the course of
the year, including the preparations for the next Triennial Central Bank Survey
of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity in April 2007, business
continuity challenges for central banks, and various monetary policy
implementation issues. With effect from 1 June 2006, Sheryl Kennedy, Deputy
Governor of the Bank of Canada, was succeeded by Hiroshi Nakaso, Director
General of the Bank of Japan, as Chair of the Markets Committee.

Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group
The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) is mandated by
the Governors of the G10 central banks to investigate emerging threats to
the security of banknotes and to propose solutions for implementation by the

170

BIS 76th Annual Report

issuing authorities. The CBCDG has developed anti-counterfeiting features to
prevent banknote images from being replicated by colour copiers and digital
technology (personal computers, printers and scanners). The BIS supports
the work of the CBCDG by hosting its Secretariat and acting as its agent in
contractual arrangements.

BIS contributions to broader international financial cooperation

Group of Ten
The Bank contributes actively to the work of the G10 Finance Ministers and
central bank Governors, their Deputies and the activities taking place under
their auspices. It participates in meetings as an observer institution and
provides secretariat support to the G10 together with the IMF and OECD.
In September 2005, a report prepared at the request of the G10 Deputies
on the implications of ageing populations and pension system reform for
financial markets and economic policies was released. It concluded that
changes under way in public and private pension schemes may significantly
increase the influence of retirement saving and related capital flows in
financial markets. The report recommended that regulatory and supervisory
arrangements should aim to influence and support the trend towards more
rigorous risk management, greater transparency and better governance at
private pension funds, for example by ensuring consistency between funding
and prudential requirements and accounting standards. Tax rules should
not hinder the build-up of funding buffers by private pension funds, but
should avoid the abuse of tax deferrals. In addition, as risks are increasingly
shifted to individual households, financial education and advice may need to
be strengthened, in order to protect pension beneficiaries. Work was also
undertaken on safeguarding critical functions performed by private financial
institutions.

Financial Stability Forum
The Financial Stability Forum (FSF), established in 1999, promotes
international financial stability through enhanced information exchange and
cooperation in financial supervision and surveillance. Its principal remit is to
assess conjunctural and structural vulnerabilities affecting the international
financial system and to encourage and coordinate action to address them. The
FSF comprises senior officials from finance ministries, central banks and
financial regulators in key financial centres, as well as representatives of
international financial institutions (the BIS, IMF, OECD and World Bank),
international supervisory and regulatory standard-setting bodies (Basel
Committee, IAIS, IASB and IOSCO) and central bank expert groupings (CGFS
and CPSS). The Forum’s Secretariat is based at the BIS. More information on
the FSF is available at www.fsforum.org.
The FSF meets twice yearly in plenary form, most recently in September
2005 in London and March 2006 in Sydney. The Forum also holds regional

BIS 76th Annual Report

171

meetings to foster wider exchanges of views on financial vulnerabilities and
the work under way nationally and internationally to address them. Recent
regional meetings were held in Mexico City in November 2005, focusing on
the Latin American economies, and in Sydney in March 2006, focusing on the
Asia-Pacific region.
In the past year, in addition to its regular assessment of financial
vulnerabilities, the FSF also examined the preparedness of major financial
institutions to deal with major changes in the economic and financial environment;
the lessons of past episodes of market liquidity erosion; business continuity
principles for financial firms and authorities; the potential economic and financial
stability implications of an avian flu pandemic; progress in the implementation
of international standards and codes; the robustness of international financial
standard-setting processes; and concerns about regulatory overload.
The rapid growth of the hedge fund sector in recent years has attracted
attention in markets and in the official community. In November 2005, the FSF
convened two informal workshops, attended by senior members of the hedge
fund community, their counterparties and financial authorities, with the aim of
improving understanding between the official and private sectors on issues
relating to hedge funds. The workshops discussed trends in the sector, risks in
the present market environment, risk management challenges for hedge funds
and their counterparties, and operational issues.
The FSF also supported efforts to strengthen international accounting
and auditing standards and practices, including by fostering dialogue among
stakeholders in this area. In February 2006, the FSF, the International
Accounting Standards Board and the International Federation of Accountants
organised a roundtable that addressed experiences in the first year of
implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); the
convergence process between the IASB and other national accounting
standard setters; fair value accounting issues; and risks in the financial
reporting process. The roundtable brought together senior representatives
from national authorities with responsibility for financial reporting, accounting
and auditing professional organisations, standard setters, market participants
(including representatives from capital market firms, corporations and investors),
international regulatory bodies and international financial institutions.
In March 2005, the FSF set in train a process to promote further
improvements in offshore financial centres (OFCs), drawing on initiatives by
FSF members at both international and national level and appropriate steps
by the FSF itself. As part of this process, the FSF set up a group to review the
results of work being carried out by FSF member bodies to ensure that OFCs
meet international standards and to address remaining problems in several
OFCs, notably in the areas of effective cross-border cooperation, information
exchange and adequacy of supervisory resources. The review group held its
first formal meeting in February 2006 and subsequently reported to the full
FSF on progress in these areas.
At the end of April 2006, Roger W Ferguson Jr stepped down as Chairman
of the FSF upon his departure from the Federal Reserve. He was succeeded by
Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy.

BIS 76th Annual Report

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The IAIS has been hosted by the BIS since the establishment of its Secretariat
in January 1998. Its role is akin to that of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, but focused on the insurance sector. The IAIS aims at
contributing to global financial stability through improved supervision of
the insurance industry, the development of standards for supervision,
international cooperation based on exchange of information, and mutual
assistance. In collaboration with other international regulatory bodies
(within the framework of the Joint Forum of the Basel Committee, IOSCO
and the IAIS), the IAIS has also helped develop principles for the supervision
of financial conglomerates. Moreover, it actively participates in the Financial
Stability Forum. The continuous increase in new members and observers
reflects the recognition of the IAIS’s role. More information on the IAIS is
available at www.iaisweb.org.
During the past year, the IAIS undertook several key initiatives in the
development and harmonisation of insurance standards concomitant with the
changing financial landscape, the priority areas being accounting, capital
adequacy and solvency, and reinsurance.
In the area of accounting, June 2005 saw the release of the paper Issues
arising as a result of the IASB’s insurance contracts project – Phase II: initial
IAIS observations. The paper provides initial observations on identified
measurement themes common to both financial and regulatory reporting that
the IAIS believes the IASB should address in its consideration of Phase II of its
insurance contracts project, notably regarding the valuation of insurance
liabilities.
Regarding capital adequacy and solvency, in October 2005 the IAIS
approved a policy paper entitled A new framework for insurance supervision:
towards a common structure and common standards for the assessment of
insurer solvency (the Framework paper), describing the rationale and the
contents of a framework for insurance supervision. At the same time, the IAIS
adopted Towards a common structure and common standards for the
assessment of insurer solvency: cornerstones for the formulation of regulatory
financial requirements (the Cornerstones paper), which sketches the contours
of the common structure and standards, highlighting some of the critical
cornerstones for the formulation of regulatory financial requirements. In
February 2006, another overarching standard-setting paper, Roadmap for a
common structure and common standards for the assessment of insurer
solvency, was released, setting out the work plan for future efforts in
establishing the new framework for insurance supervision.
Also in October 2005, the IAIS approved a supervisory Guidance paper on
risk transfer, disclosure and analysis of finite reinsurance. In December, the
IAIS published its second annual Global reinsurance market report, based on
global reinsurance market statistics for the financial year 2004. The report
reviews the overall financial health of the sector during 2004, during which it
was able to withstand a number of natural catastrophes, including four major
hurricanes in the United States and typhoons in Japan. It also briefly discusses

BIS 76th Annual Report

173

loss-causing events in 2005 – in particular Hurricane Katrina, the impact of
which fell heavily on the reinsurance sector – concluding that while reinsurer
earnings will have been substantially reduced there will not be any significant
adverse impact on the reinsurance sector’s overall capital.
Training remains a high priority for the IAIS. During the past year, the IAIS
organised or assisted in 20 seminars, conferences and workshops around the
world, in several cases in collaboration with the Financial Stability Institute. At
the same time, the Association, along with the World Bank, carried forward the
insurance core curriculum project, developing some 25 high-quality modules
for in-depth application of the IAIS core principles.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) was established in May
2002 and opened its Head Office at the BIS in October that year. Currently, 61
organisations (of which 44 are members) from around the world are involved in
the activities of IADI, including a number of central banks that have an interest
in promoting the adoption or operation of effective deposit insurance systems.
The Chair of the Executive Council and President of IADI is Jean Pierre
Sabourin and the Secretary General is John Raymond LaBrosse.
During its fourth year, IADI continued to provide a forum to facilitate wide
international contacts among deposit insurers and other interested parties.
For example, its Fourth Annual Conference, held in Taipei in September 2005,
was attended by 150 deposit insurers and policymakers from 49 countries;
the conference theme was “Challenges for deposit insurers in resolving bank
failures”.
IADI also organised the first ever International Week of Deposit Insurance,
with a special exhibition at which 32 exhibitors provided information on the
key characteristics of depositor protection arrangements in countries around
the world. Another new initiative was the Deposit Insurance Organization of the
Year Award, conferred on a member institution in celebration of an important
achievement and/or in recognition of the contribution that the member has
made to the furtherance of IADI’s objects.
Work is continuing on guidance to improve the effectiveness of deposit
insurance systems. The Association has published guidance papers on:
• the establishment and design of deposit insurance systems;
• the development of differential premium systems;
• the promotion of effective interrelationships among financial safety net
participants; and
• general guidance on its Bank resolutions consultation paper.
Recent regional activities included conferences, seminars and Committee
meetings in Almaty, Cartagena, Manila, Abuja, Taipei, Prague and Marrakesh.
IADI also collaborated with the Asian Development Bank on an international
seminar “Integrating financial supervision and the role of deposit insurers” in
February 2006.
The website (www.iadi.org) and a bimonthly newsletter provide
information on activities to members and participants.

Financial services of the Bank

Banking services
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services designed specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 130 such authorities, as well as a number of
international institutions, currently make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of the Bank’s credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management framework.
In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit reporting directly
to the Deputy General Manager – and through him to the General Manager –
monitors the Bank’s credit exposure, liquidity, and market and operational risks.
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central banks,
the BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of currency
denomination, liquidity and maturity. In addition to traditional money market
placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the Bank offers
two instruments that can be traded (bought and sold back) directly with it: the
Fixed-Rate Investment at the BIS (FIXBIS), available in maturities from one week
to one year; and the BIS Medium-Term Instrument (MTI), with maturities from
one to 10 years. A series of callable MTI structures, as well as other instruments
with embedded optionality, are also part of the standard product range.
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers.
From time to time, it extends short-term credits to central banks, usually on a
collateralised basis. The BIS also acts as trustee and collateral agent (see below).
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities or
high-grade assets. These may take the form of either a specific portfolio
mandate negotiated between the BIS and a central bank or an open-end fund
structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing customers to invest in
a common pool of assets. The two Asian Bond Funds (ABF1 and ABF2) are
administered by the BIS under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the
BIS and ABF2 by a group of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided out of two linked trading rooms: one
at its Basel head office and one at its Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR.

Operations of the Banking Department in 2005/06
The BIS balance sheet continued to expand in 2005/06 to reach a financial
year-end record at 31 March 2006 of SDR 220.1 billion, representing a
substantial year-on-year increase of SDR 39.6 billion or 22%. Of this increase,
SDR 2.7 billion was attributable to changes in exchange rates, notably the
appreciation of the US dollar against the SDR, and SDR 3.7 billion was
attributable to a higher market price of gold.

Liabilities
The size of the BIS balance sheet is mainly driven by placements from
customers, which constitute the lion’s share of total liabilities. On 31 March

2006, customer placements (excluding repurchase agreements) amounted to
SDR 195.2 billion, compared with SDR 157.7 billion at the end of the previous
financial year.
Some 95% of customer placements are denominated in currencies, with
the remainder in gold. Currency deposits rose from SDR 150.6 billion a year
earlier to SDR 186.0 billion at end-March 2006, representing around 6% of the
world’s total foreign currency reserves. The share of currency placements
denominated in US dollars was 65%, while euro-denominated funds accounted
for 20%. The increase in gold deposits from SDR 7.1 billion to SDR 9.2 billion
was mainly due to valuation effects, ie a higher gold price.
The expansion in customer placements was mainly driven by fixed-term
deposits and MTIs. Subscriptions to MTIs increased by 35%, making them the
single largest BIS instrument held by customers. Growth of more than 40% in
fixed-term deposits partly reflected a shift from FIXBIS, a more liquid but loweryielding instrument.
A geographical breakdown of currency placements with the BIS shows a
relative shift from Asian customers to those in other parts of the world,
particularly Europe.

Assets
Most of the BIS assets consist of investments with top-quality commercial
banks of international standing as well as government and quasi-government
securities, including reverse repurchase agreements. In addition, the Bank
owns 165 tonnes of fine gold, having disposed of 15 tonnes during the financial
year. The credit exposure is managed in a very conservative manner, with
99.7% of the Bank’s credit exposure rated A– or higher as at 31 March 2006
(see note 4E to the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency deposits and securities, including reverse
repurchase agreements, totalled SDR 199.2 billion on 31 March 2006, up from
SDR 165.4 billion at the end of the previous financial year. These additional
funds were mainly invested in Treasury bills, time deposits with banks, and
debt securities issued by commercial banks.

BIS 76th Annual Report

The Bank uses various derivative instruments in order to manage its
assets and liabilities efficiently (see note 9 to the financial statements).

Functions as agent and trustee
Trustee for international government loans
The Bank continued to perform its functions as trustee for the funding bonds
1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young Loans during the year (for details, see the
63rd Annual Report of June 1993). The Deutsche Bundesbank as paying agent
notified the Bank that in 2005 the Bundeswertpapierverwaltung (BWV –
German Federal Securities Administration) had arranged for payment of
approximately €4.9 million for redemption of funding bonds and interest.
Redemption values and other details were published by the BWV in the
Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette) .
The Bank maintained its reservations regarding the application by the
BWV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan (stated in detail in
its 50th Annual Report of June 1980), which also extend to the funding bonds
1990–2010.

Escrow agent functions
Within the context of an external debt agreement reached in October 2005
between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and its 15 Paris Club creditor
countries, the BIS entered into a Depository and Escrow Agreement with the
Central Bank of Nigeria dated 31 October 2005, holding funds and releasing
them to each creditor country once the relevant bilateral debt restructuring
agreements with Nigeria had been concluded.

Collateral agent functions
Under a number of agreements, the BIS acts as collateral agent to hold and
invest collateral for the benefit of the holders of certain foreign currency
denominated bonds issued by countries under external debt restructuring
arrangements. During 2005/06, collateral pledge agreements included those for
Brazilian bonds (described in detail in the 64th Annual Report of June 1994),
Peruvian bonds (see the 67th Annual Report of June 1997) and Côte d’Ivoire
bonds (see the 68th Annual Report of June 1998).

Institutional and administrative matters

Changes to the BIS governance structure
In 2004, the BIS undertook a review of its governance to determine the extent
to which it was consistent with current principles of sound corporate
governance, taking due account of the specific features of the Bank as an
international organisation (see the 75th Annual Report of June 2005).
The review was conducted by three leading independent corporate
governance experts: Professor Klaus J Hopt, Director of the Max Planck

BIS 76th Annual Report

177

Institute for Foreign Private and Private International Law in Hamburg;
Professor Reinier H Kraakman, Harvard Law School; and Professor JeanVictor Louis, former General Counsel of the National Bank of Belgium and
Emeritus Professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles.
The experts submitted their final report to the BIS Board of Directors in
November 2004. The report, available on the BIS website, identified some
possibilities for improving the Bank’s Statutes and its governance practice.
A committee composed of selected Board members was created, to discuss
the matters raised in the report and to make proposals for concrete action.
The committee recommended a number of amendments to the BIS Statutes to
improve the Bank’s corporate governance and increase its transparency. The
amendments were approved by the Board and adopted at an Extraordinary
General Meeting of the Bank on 27 June 2005.

The Bank’s administration
Budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next financial
year starts about six months in advance with the setting by the BIS management
of a broad business orientation and financial framework. Within this context,
business areas specify their plans and the corresponding resource requirements.
The process of reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and overall
resource availability culminates in the determination of a draft financial budget.
This must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
In drawing up the budget, a distinction is made between administrative
and capital expenditures. In common with other organisations of a similar
nature to the BIS, management and staff expense, including remuneration,
pensions and health and accident insurance, amounts to around 70% of
administrative costs. The other major expenditure categories, each accounting
for around 10% of administrative spending, are IT and telecommunications
and building and equipment expenditure. Capital spending mainly relates to
building and IT investment expenditure, and can vary significantly from year
to year. Most of the Bank’s administrative and capital expenditure is incurred
in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenses before depreciation during the financial year
2005/06 amounted to 223.6 million Swiss francs, 1.2% below the budget of
226.3 million Swiss francs,1 while capital expenditure, at 23.8 million Swiss
francs, was 3.2 million below budget. The underspending in administrative
expenses was primarily attributable to the initial headcount savings from
the Bank’s activity review (see below), which led to lower expenditure on
management and staff costs. As regards capital spending, the largest items of

The Bank’s budgetary accounting is cash-based and excludes certain financial accounting adjustments,
principally relating to post-employment benefit obligations, which take into account financial market and
actuarial developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” disclosed in the
profit and loss account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

178

BIS 76th Annual Report

expenditure related to the enhancement of the Bank’s physical security
systems and building safety.
Expenditure in 2005/06 was the closest to the budget achieved in the past
few years, and reflected further improvement in budgetary management, which
was attributable to tighter budgeting and the enhancement of the quarterly
monitoring of the objectives in business area plans that was introduced in
2004/05. In addition to these measures, Management undertook a thorough
review of the Bank’s activities during the year, which identified a number of
areas where efficiency gains and headcount savings could be realised.
Administrative and capital expenditure also reflected the priorities set in
the 2005/06 budget of strengthening the Bank’s risk management, internal
audit and compliance functions, and of continuing the efforts to improve
security arrangements.
In March 2006, the Board approved an increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2006/07 of 2.5% to 232.0 million Swiss francs. The
capital budget foresees a decrease of 1.1 million Swiss francs to 25.9 million.
The budgets for 2006/07 are based on the main objectives of the Bank for the
next financial year, which are to:
• expand BIS services to deepen relations with shareholders in the AsiaPacific region. This initiative includes a three-year policy-oriented
research programme on monetary and financial sector issues in Asia and
further enhancement of banking services in the Asian time zone;
• implement the recommendations arising from the activity review undertaken
during 2005/06. The first phase will lead to a reduction of administrative
positions in Basel, thereby providing the room for manoeuvre to pursue
the Asian initiative within a restrained budgetary framework; and
• plan for further renewal of meeting facilities at the Tower building in
Basel and the renovation of the Sports Club buildings.

Remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a number
of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and responsibilities,
and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are associated with
a structure of salary ranges. Regular salary surveys are conducted in which
the structure of BIS salaries is assessed against that in comparable institutions
or market segments. The analysis takes into account differences in the taxation
of salaries of the staff of the surveyed institutions. When applying the market
data to BIS salaries, the Bank focuses on the upper half of market salaries in
order to attract highly qualified staff.
In those years in which no comprehensive salary survey is undertaken,
the salary structure is adjusted for the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the
average rise in real salaries in the business sector of major industrial countries.
In July 2005, the salary structure was increased by 1.2%. Movements of
salaries of individual staff members within the ranges of the salary structure
are based on merit, subject to a regular evaluation of performance.
Non-Swiss and non-locally hired staff, including senior management, are
entitled to an expatriation allowance. This currently amounts to 14% or 18%

BIS 76th Annual Report

179

of annual salary depending on family status, subject to a ceiling. Expatriate
staff are also entitled to receive an education allowance.2 In addition, BIS
staff members have access through the Bank to health insurance and a
defined benefit contributory pension plan.
With regard to the remuneration of senior officials, it was decided in early
2005 to conduct regular surveys to benchmark their salaries against conditions
in comparator institutions. Between surveys, salaries of senior officials are
adjusted for Swiss inflation. As of 1 July 2005, the annual remuneration of
senior managers before expatriation allowances is based on the following
salary structure:
718,370 Swiss francs
• General Manager
607,850 Swiss francs
• Deputy General Manager
Heads
of
Department
552,590 Swiss francs
•
In addition to the above, the General Manager receives an annual
representation allowance and enhanced pension rights.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of
the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years. The
most recent adjustment took place on 1 July 2005, bringing the overall fixed
annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors to a total of 895,800 Swiss
francs. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each Board
meeting in which they participate. Assuming the full Board is represented in all
Board meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to 824,160
Swiss francs.

Net profit and its distribution

Net profit
The net profit for the 76th financial year amounted to SDR 599.2 million,
compared with the equivalent figure for the preceding year of SDR 370.9 million.
The factors behind this outcome are discussed below.

Total operating income
Total operating income amounted to SDR 573.4 million in the financial year
2005/06, compared with SDR 458.4 million in 2004/05. There were three principal
reasons for this development:
• Inflows from share subscriptions and retained profits increased the
component of the Bank’s equity denominated in currencies, and
consequently generated additional interest income from the Bank’s
investment securities. Interest income from investment securities also
benefited from rising interest yields.
• Net income from the Bank’s deposit-taking business rose as a result of
the strong inflow of deposits from customers during the financial year.
Intermediation margins in 2005/06 were almost unchanged from 2004/05.

2
Certain staff members who joined the Bank before 1997 receive an expatriation allowance of 25%, but
are not entitled to receive education allowances.

180

BIS 76th Annual Report

•

Foreign exchange losses were incurred in both financial years, but at
SDR 25.2 million in 2005/06 they were SDR 9.3 million lower than in
2004/05. The exchange loss in 2005/06 resulted principally from the
impact of an appreciating gold price on the market value of forward
contracts for the sale of gold investment assets.3

Operating expense
Operating expense (see note 28 to the financial statements) amounted to
SDR 146.9 million, 1.3% above the preceding year’s figure of SDR 145.0 million.
Administrative expenses before depreciation amounted to SDR 133.6 million,
3.3% above the previous year’s figure of SDR 129.3 million. The depreciation
charge decreased from SDR 15.7 million to SDR 13.3 million.

Operating profit and other profit items
The Bank’s operating profit, which reflects the profits of its ongoing business,
amounted to SDR 426.5 million, 36.1% higher than the equivalent figure of
SDR 313.4 million recorded in 2004/05.
A net gain of SDR 58.2 million was incurred on the sale of investment
securities during the year. This resulted from the realignment of the Bank’s
investment portfolio to its underlying benchmark position and reflected the
sale of securities acquired when interest rates were higher.
The realised gain of SDR 114.5 million on sales of gold investment assets
during 2005/06 arose from the sale of 15 tonnes from the Bank’s total holdings
of 180 tonnes at 31 March 2005.

Review of dividend policy
During the year, the Board reviewed the Bank’s dividend policy, taking into
consideration the Bank’s capital needs and the interests of BIS shareholders in
obtaining a fair and sustainable return on their investments in BIS shares.
Having examined the outlook for the Bank’s profits, the Board concluded that
the current approach of increasing the dividend by SDR 10 each year would
be broadly consistent with these considerations. This approach would result
in an increase in the dividend from SDR 235 per share in 2004/05 to SDR 245 in
2005/06.
The Board also decided to review the dividend policy every two to three
years, taking changing circumstances into account where necessary.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the net profit of SDR 599.2 million for the financial year 2005/06 be applied

3
The exchange loss of SDR 34.5 million in 2004/05 resulted from the impact of the appreciation of the
Swiss franc against the SDR during 2004 on the excess of Swiss franc liabilities over assets in that currency
that existed before the repurchased shares of the Belgian and French issues were sold back to the
respective central banks in autumn 2004.

BIS 76th Annual Report

181

by the General Meeting in the following manner:
1. SDR 132.4 million in payment of a dividend of SDR 245 per share;
2. SDR 46.7 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;4
3. SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund; and
4. SDR 414.1 million, representing the remainder of the available net profit,
to be transferred to the free reserve fund. This fund can be used by the
Board of Directors for any purpose that is in conformity with the Statutes.
If approved, the dividend will be paid on 3 July 2006 according to each
shareholder’s instructions in any constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss
francs, to the shareholders whose names were contained in the Bank's share
register on 31 March 2006. The proposed dividend of SDR 245 per share for the
financial year 2005/06 represents a 4.3% increase over the dividend for 2004/05.
The full dividend will be paid on 510,192 shares. The dividend payable in
respect of the 35,933 treasury shares of the American issue that were
redistributed on 31 May 2005 will be settled on a pro rata basis from that date.
The number of issued and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares, 1,000
were held in treasury at 31 March 2006, namely the suspended shares of the
Albanian issue. No dividend will be paid on these treasury shares.

Report of the auditors
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG, who
have confirmed that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s financial
position at 31 March 2006 and the results of its operations for the year then
ended. Their report is to be found immediately following the financial
statements.

4
Since the general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2005,
Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend shall be paid
into this fund, until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

Changes among the Board of Directors and senior officials
At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 27 June 2005, it was decided to
abolish the position of President of the BIS. Nout Wellink, President of the
Netherlands Bank, who had been re-elected as Chairman of the Board of
Directors and President of the BIS with effect from 1 March 2005, continued to
serve in his capacity as Chairman of the Board before stepping down on
28 February 2006. At its meeting in January 2006, the Board elected Jean-Pierre
Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, as
Chairman of the Board of Directors for a period of three years commencing on
1 March 2006.
On 7 November 2005, the term of office of Vincenzo Desario, Director
General of the Bank of Italy, as a member of the Board of Directors came to
an end. Following the resignation of Antonio Fazio as Governor of the Bank of
Italy on 19 December 2005 and pending the start of the term of office of the
new Governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Desario assumed the role of Acting
Governor of the Bank of Italy and became an ex officio Director of the BIS from
20 December 2005 until 15 January 2006. By letter dated 23 December 2005,
Mr Desario appointed Pierluigi Ciocca, Deputy Director General of the Bank of
Italy, as a member of the Board to fill the seat vacated by Mr Desario, for a
period of three years ending on 22 December 2008. On 16 January 2006,
Mario Draghi was appointed Governor of the Bank of Italy and became an ex
officio Director of the Board of Directors.

BIS 76th Annual Report

185

At the end of December 2005, Lars Heikensten resigned from his position
as Governor of Sveriges Riksbank and vacated his seat on the Board. At its
meeting in November 2005, the Board elected Stefan Ingves, the successor to
Mr Heikensten at Sveriges Riksbank, as a member of the Board from 1 January
2006 for the unexpired period of Mr Heikensten’s term of office, ie until
31 March 2008. At the same meeting, Axel Weber, President of the Deutsche
Bundesbank, reappointed Hans Tietmeyer as a member of the Board of
Directors for a further period of three years ending on 31 December 2008, and
the Board re-elected Hans Tietmeyer as Vice-Chairman of the Board of
Directors from 1 January 2006 until the end of his term of office as a member
of the Board.
On 1 February 2006, Ben S Bernanke succeeded Alan Greenspan as
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and
became an ex officio Director of the Board of Directors. With effect from
1 March 2006, Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium,
reappointed Alfons Verplaetse as a member of the Board of Directors for a
further period of three years ending on 28 February 2009.
On 31 December 2005, Hervé Hannoun resigned from his position as First
Deputy Governor of the Bank of France and vacated his seat on the Board. On
27 April 2006, Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, appointed
Jean-Pierre Landau as a member of the Board of Directors to fill the seat
vacated by Hervé Hannoun for the unexpired period of Mr Hannoun’s term of
office, ie until 27 November 2006.
Axel Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, appointed Wolfgang
Mörke as his second Alternate from July 2005 to succeed Stefan Schönberg.
Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, appointed Giovanni Carosio as his
first Alternate and Ignazio Visco as his second Alternate from January 2006.
As regards the senior officials of the Bank, upon the retirement of André
Icard, Hervé Hannoun was appointed Deputy General Manager of the BIS
from 1 January 2006. Daniel Lefort was appointed General Counsel, upon the
retirement of Mario Giovanoli, from 1 January 2006.

It was with deep regret that the Bank learned of the death of Antonino
Occhiuto, Honorary Director General of the Bank of Italy, on 27 June 2005.
Mr Occhiuto had served on the Board as an appointed Director between 1975
and 1980.
The Board noted with deep regret the death of Wim Duisenberg on
31 July 2005. Mr Duisenberg had served on the Board as a Director from 1982 to
1997. During this time, he had served two terms as President of the Bank and
Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1988 to 1990 and from 1994 to 1997.

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction

B. Designation of financial instruments

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is
an international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930,
the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The
headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002
Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).

Upon initial recognition each financial instrument is
allocated to one of the following categories, depending on
the nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into:

The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its
Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks,
to provide additional facilities for international financial
operations and to act as trustee or agent for international
financial settlements. Fifty-five central banks are currently
members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting
at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the
number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries.
The Board of Directors of the Bank is composed of the
Governors of and appointed Directors from the Bank’s
founder central banks, being the central banks of Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United
States of America, as well as the Governors of the central
banks of Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland.
These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet
and profit and loss account, as required by Article 49 of the
Bank’s Statutes.

2. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

•
•
•

Loans and receivables
At fair value through profit and loss
Available for sale

The designation of the financial instrument determines the
accounting that is applied, as described in the accounting
policies below.
Where the financial instrument is designated at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

C. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2005 and
effective 1 January 2006. As currently calculated, one
SDR is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410,
JPY 18.4 and GBP 0.0903. Prior to 1 January 2006, the
SDR was calculated as equivalent to the sum of USD 0.577,
EUR 0.426, JPY 21 and GBP 0.0984. The change in
composition of the SDR basket was such that the values of
the SDR under the old and new baskets were equivalent at
31 December 2005 and no significant gains or losses
resulted from the change in the weights of the currencies.
The composition of this currency basket is subject to
review every five years by the IMF, the next review being
undertaken in December 2010.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

A. Scope of the financial statements
D. Currency translation
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
predominantly with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank are not included in these financial statements.
Information on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is
disclosed in Note 35.

BIS 76th Annual Report

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other
assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange
rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits and losses
are translated into SDR at an average rate. Exchange
differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of transactions
are included as net foreign exchange gains or losses in the
profit and loss account.

195

E. Very short-term monetary assets and liabilities
Very short-term monetary assets comprise cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts (which
are included under the balance sheet heading “Time
deposits and advances to banks”). Very short-term liabilities
comprise sight and notice deposits (which are included
under the balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”).
These financial instruments typically have notice periods
of three days or less. They are designated as loans and
receivables.
They are included in the balance sheet on a settlement date
basis at their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest
is included in interest income (for assets) or interest
expense (for liabilities) on an accruals basis.

F. Gold and gold deposits
Gold comprises gold bars held in sight accounts. Gold
deposit assets comprise fixed-term gold loans to
commercial banks. Gold deposit liabilities comprise sight
and fixed-term deposits of gold from central banks. They
are designated as loans and receivables.
These financial instruments are included in the balance
sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market
price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued
interest.
Gold deposit assets and liabilities are included on a trade
date basis. Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for
on a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of
gold are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
Interest on gold deposits is included in interest income (for
assets) or interest expense (for liabilities) on an accruals
basis. The treatment of the realised and unrealised gains or
losses on revaluation depends on the designation of the
gold deposits as described below:

1. Gold deposit liabilities and related gold banking
assets
The Bank operates a banking business in gold on behalf of
central bank customers in which it takes limited gold price
risk. These financial instruments are designated as loans
and receivables. Gains or losses on these transactions in
gold are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net foreign exchange gain or loss” as net transaction
gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking business are included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange gain or
loss” as net translation gains or losses.

2. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated as
available for sale assets. Unrealised gains or losses on the
Bank’s gold investment assets over their cost are taken to
the gold revaluation account in equity, which is reported
under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is

196

approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

G. Currency investment assets
Currency investment asset comprise securities purchased
under resale agreements and government and other
securities. They are held for the long term, but not
necessarily to maturity. They are designated as available
for sale assets.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, currency investment assets are revalued
to fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. Realised
profits on disposal are included under the profit and loss
heading “Net gain on sales of investment securities”.

H. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the management
of currency banking assets, they are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss. Where these liabilities are associated with currency
investment assets they are designated as loans and
receivables.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in “Interest expense”.
After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as at
fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair value,
with unrealised gains or losses included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net valuation movement”.

I. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with
all realised and unrealised movements in value included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.

BIS 76th Annual Report

Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.

J. Currency deposit liabilities and related banking
assets
These financial instruments constitute the majority of the
Bank’s balance sheet and include treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, time deposits and
advances to banks, government and other securities and
currency deposits.
The accounting treatment for very short-term currency
deposit liabilities is detailed in section E above.
The Bank acts as a market-maker in certain of its currency
deposit liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank's risk management policies
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on currency banking assets,
derivatives or other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would
otherwise arise from recognising realised and unrealised
gains and losses on different bases, the Bank designates all
of the relevant assets and liabilities in its currency banking
portfolios as held at fair value through profit and loss.
All the relevant financial instruments are initially included
in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost.
The subsequent accrual of interest and amortisation of
premiums paid and discounts received are included in
“Interest expense” (for currency deposit liabilities) or in
“Interest income” (for related banking assets).
After trade date, the financial instruments are revalued to
fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements in
value included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net valuation movement”.

Although a significant degree of judgment is, in some
cases, required in establishing fair values, the Bank
believes the fair values recorded in the balance sheet and
the changes in fair values recorded in the profit and loss
account are appropriate and reflect the underlying
economic situation.

L. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are included in the balance
sheet at cost.

M. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:
Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years
The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

N. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,
provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Best estimates and assumptions
are used when determining the amount to be recognised
as a provision.

K. Valuation policy
The Bank includes most of its financial instruments in its
balance sheet at fair value, and includes most changes in
fair value in profit and loss. The fair value of a financial
instrument is defined as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable
willing parties in an arm’s length current transaction. Key
judgments affecting this accounting policy relate to how
the Bank determines fair value for financial instruments.
To derive fair value the Bank uses reliable quoted market
prices from active markets. Where no active market exists,
or where quoted market prices are not otherwise available,
the Bank determines fair values based on financial models
using a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash
flow analysis is dependent on estimates of future cash
flows, interest rates, exchange rates and prepayment
speeds, and upon credit, liquidity and volatility factors.

BIS 76th Annual Report

O. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, directors’ pensions and
health and accident insurance for current and former staff
members. An independent actuarial valuation is performed
annually for each arrangement.

Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.

197

The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the estimated
future cash outflows. The rate used to discount the cash
flows is determined by the Bank based on the market yield
of highly rated corporate debt securities in Swiss francs
which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of
the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “Corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included under
the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of the directors’ pension arrangement
are calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff
pension fund.

Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

Corridor accounting

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts, which
are very short-term financial assets that typically have
notice periods of three days or less.

3. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive
at these estimates the Management uses available
information, exercises judgment and makes assumptions.
Judgment is exercised when selecting accounting policies
for the Bank and also when applying the accounting
policies. The judgments relating to the designation and
valuation of financial instruments are key to understanding
these financial statements.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for
example related to the valuation of assets and liabilities,
the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations
and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

4. Capital and risk management
A. The risks that the Bank faces
The Bank is exposed to the following categories of risk:

Credit risk. The risk of a financial loss arising from a
counterparty’s failure to service its debt in a timely manner.
This is the largest risk that the Bank faces.

Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside
the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

Market risk. The risk of a decline in the total value of the
Bank’s assets and liabilities due to adverse changes in such
market variables as interest rates, exchange rates and gold
prices.

P. Cash flow statement

B. How the Bank manages these risks

The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.

Organisation structure

198

Liquidity risk. The risk of being unable to meet its
obligations to pay as they fall due without incurring
unacceptable losses.
Operational risk. The risk of financial losses, damage to
the Bank’s reputation, or both, caused by people, failed or
inadequate processes or systems, or external events.

The Bank is operated to serve the central banking
community whilst earning an adequate return to maintain
its capital strength.

BIS 76th Annual Report

The Bank manages risk through a framework including an
independent risk control function and regular reporting of
risk positions to appropriate Management committees.
The Bank’s risk methodologies and risk policies are
documented in a detailed risk manual, which is reviewed
on a regular basis. The Bank’s credit limits are documented
in a counterparty manual. All changes to credit limits
require Management approval.
The finance function and legal service augment the risk
control function. The role of the finance function is to
produce the Bank’s financial statements and to control its
expenditure through setting and monitoring the annual
budget. The legal service provides legal advice and
support covering a wide range of issues relating to the
Bank’s activities.
The purpose of the Bank’s compliance function is to
provide reasonable assurance that the activities of the
Bank and its staff conform with applicable laws and
regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s Code of Conduct
and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of
sound practice. The compliance function identifies and
assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff
on compliance issues. It also performs a monitoring,
reporting and, in cooperation with the legal service, an
advisory role.
The internal audit function reviews internal control
procedures and reports on how they comply with internal
standards and industry best practices. The scope of
internal audit work includes the review of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal audit is directly
responsible to the General Manager and the Deputy
General Manager.

measuring risk to the Bank’s net profit and its equity. The
Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light
of its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
Economic capital is a key quantitative risk methodology
used by the Bank. Economic capital is a measure designed
to estimate the amount of equity needed to absorb the
potential losses arising from exposures on any given date,
to a statistical level of confidence determined by the Bank’s
aim to remain of the highest creditworthiness. Many of the
Bank’s internal limits and reports are expressed in terms of
economic capital. The Bank calculates economic capital
covering credit risk, market risk and operational risk.
To calculate economic capital for credit risk the Bank uses
an internal model for credit portfolio value-at-risk that is
based on the Bank’s assessment of:

•
•

The probability of default of individual counterparties;

•

The likely loss that the Bank would incur as a result of
the default.

The correlations of losses associated with individual
counterparties; and

The market risk economic capital measure is derived from
the Bank’s value-at-risk (VaR) methodology. This is
discussed in more detail in section F below.
The Bank’s operational risk economic capital measure is
based on a model that incorporates the Bank’s experience
of operational losses and external loss data.
In computing its credit, market and operational risk
economic capital measures the Bank uses as key
assumptions a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% level
of confidence.

The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s
risk control and compliance functions.

D. Capital adequacy

The head of compliance and head of internal audit also
report regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

The Bank maintains a very strong capital position, which is
measured using its economic capital model and the
framework proposed by the Basel Capital Accord of July
1988 (the Basel Accord). The table below shows the Bank’s
capital as at 31 March 2006:

Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two books:

As at 31 March

1. A banking book comprising currency and gold
deposit liabilities and related banking assets and
derivatives.
In this book the Bank takes limited interest rate, gold price
and foreign currency risk.

SDR millions
Share capital
Statutory reserves
Less: shares held in treasury
Tier 1 capital

2. An investment book comprising assets, liabilities
and derivatives relating principally to the investment
of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds. The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank uses a comprehensive range of quantitative
methodologies for valuing financial instruments and for

The Basel Accord ratios measure capital adequacy by
comparing the Bank’s eligible capital with its risk-weighted
assets. The risk-weighted assets are derived by applying
a series of risk weightings to the Bank’s assets and
derivatives, based on the Basel Accord. The Bank’s capital
ratios are high due to the proportion of sovereign debt

199

(which is zero risk-weighted) within the Bank’s assets.
The Bank’s Tier 1 ratio was 32.4% as at 31 March 2006
(2005: 35.8%).

The following tables show credit exposure by sector and
credit rating:

As at 31 March

E. Credit risk
Credit risk includes:

Default risk – the risk that a counterparty will not fulfil its
obligations in accordance with the agreed terms of a
transaction. Default risk arises on financial assets and
derivatives, as well as committed facilities that the Bank
provides for central banks and international organisations.
Settlement risk – the risk of failure of the settlement or
clearing of financial transactions where the exchange of
cash, securities or other assets is not simultaneous.
Transfer risk – the risk that a counterparty is unable to meet
its foreign currency obligations due to restricted access to
foreign currency.
The Bank manages its exposure to credit risk by placing
limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to one
borrower or a group of borrowers. Such risks are monitored
on a regular basis and are subject to at least an annual
review and will be adjusted as deemed appropriate. The
main criterion for these reviews is the ability of borrowers
and potential borrowers to meet interest and capital
repayment obligations. Limits on the level of credit risk are
approved by the Bank’s Management within a framework
set by the Board of Directors. Actual exposures are
monitored daily against limits.
The Bank also obtains collateral, in addition to reverse
repurchase agreements, to mitigate credit risk on derivative
financial instruments, and has established bilateral setoff
agreements with certain of its counterparties.

Sector of risk
Percentages

Default risk on the Bank’s holdings of securities is reduced
by the highly liquid nature of most of the assets. Securities
are sold when the Bank’s Management considers that a
counterparty has an unacceptable risk of default.
Default risk on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives is
mitigated using collateral management agreements. As
at 31 March 2005 the Bank held as collateral on OTC
derivatives SDR 93.6 million nominal of G10 sovereign
securities. The Bank held no collateral on OTC derivatives
at 31 March 2006.

2. Settlement risk
The Bank minimises settlement risk by:

•
•

Using established clearing centres;

•

Where possible requiring net settlement of payments
on derivative financial instruments;

•

Using cash correspondent banks with the ability to
stop payments at short notice;

•

In respect of foreign exchange transactions, ensuring
where possible that these take place subject to setoff
arrangements that would apply should a counterparty
fail to deliver the counter-currency to such a transaction;
and

•

Calculating and limiting the settlement risk on a
counterparty basis.

Where possible settling transactions only once both
parties have fulfilled their obligations (the delivery
versus payment settlement mechanism);

3. Transfer risk
The Bank calculates and sets limits for transfer risk on a per
country basis.

The Bank’s credit policies ensure that the vast majority of
its assets are invested with G10 sovereigns or with
financial institutions rated A or above. Because of the
limited number of potential investments, the Bank has
significant individual counterparty concentrations within
these risk sectors.

200

2005

Sovereign

1. Default risk
The Bank controls its default risk on both a counterparty
and a portfolio level. Credit exposures are restricted using
a series of credit limits covering individual counterparties
and countries of risk. The Bank conducts its own detailed
independent credit analysis resulting in the assignment of
internal credit grades. Based on this analysis the Bank sets
its credit limits.

F. Market risk

2. Currency risk

The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Bank
incurs market risk primarily through the assets relating to
the management of its equity. The Bank measures market
risk using the value-at-risk (VaR) methodology, and by
computing sensitivities to certain market risk factors. VaR
expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential
loss on the current portfolio assuming a specified time
horizon and measured to a specified level of confidence.
Market risk economic capital is measured and managed on
an aggregated market risk basis. The Bank’s Management
limits the Bank’s market risk economic capital usage within
a framework set by the Board of Directors.
All VaR models, while forward-looking, are based on past
events and dependent on the quality of available market
data. VaR limits are supplemented with a framework of
other limits and reporting, including specific stress tests
and detailed monitoring of the largest market risk positions.

1. Gold price risk

Currency risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in exchange rates. The
Bank is exposed to currency risk principally through the
assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank
is also exposed to currency risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary
in foreign exchange transactions between central and
commercial banks. The Bank reduces its currency
exposures by matching the assets relating to the
management of its equity to the constituent currencies of
the SDR on a regular basis, and by allowing only small
currency exposures relating to customer deposits and
foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following table shows the Bank’s currency positions
after adjusting for its holdings of gold investment assets:

Gold price risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in the SDR price of
gold. The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally
through its holdings of gold investment assets, which
comprise 165 tonnes (2005: 180 tonnes). This is held in
custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At
31 March 2006 approximately 19% of its equity comprised
gold holdings (31 March 2005: 16%). The Bank can also
have small exposures to gold price risk through its banking
activities with central and commercial banks. Gold price
risk is measured within the Bank’s aggregate market risk
economic capital framework.

3. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the potential impact on the fair value of
assets and liabilities from changes in interest rates. The
Bank is exposed to interest rate risk principally through the
interest-bearing assets relating to the management of its
equity. These assets are managed using a fixed duration
benchmark of bonds. The Bank is also exposed to limited
interest rate risk through its activities in accepting and
reinvesting customer deposits.
The Bank closely monitors interest rate risk including the
sensitivity of fair values to movements in interest rates.
Market risk is restricted using economic capital, VaR and
stress test-based limits.

G. Liquidity risk
Net movements in the currency and gold deposits from
central banks, international organisations and other
public institutions are the key determinants of the size of
the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to
repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit
instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank
is managed to preserve a high degree of liquidity to ensure
that it is able to meet the requirements of its customers at
all times.

set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires liquid
assets to be equal to at least 100% of the potential liquidity
requirement faced by the Bank. In addition, liquidity stress
tests are performed which assume extreme withdrawal
scenarios considerably beyond the estimated potential
liquidity requirement. These stress tests define additional
liquidity requirements which must also be met by holdings
of liquid assets. The Bank’s liquidity has consistently been
materially above its minimum liquidity ratio limit.

The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model using prudent
assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity of
liabilities. Within this framework, the Board of Directors has

6. Gold and gold deposits

Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of
financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both,
resulting from one or more of the following:

A. Total gold holdings

•

•

•

•

Human error or fraud (eg insufficient personnel, lack of
requisite knowledge, inadequate training, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate
succession planning or lack of integrity or ethical
standards);
Failed or inadequate processes (eg an internal policy or
process is inadequate, poorly designed or unsuitable,
or is not properly documented, understood,
implemented, followed or enforced);
Failed or inadequate systems (eg hardware, software
applications, operating systems or infrastructure
necessary to support the activities of the Bank are
poorly designed, unsuitable, inadequate, unavailable,
fail, or do not operate as intended); and

The composition of the Bank’s total gold holdings was as

Comprising:

External events (ie the occurrence of an event having
an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control).

The Bank manages operational risk through internal
controls, including policies, procedures, practices and
organisational structures, designed to reduce the likelihood
of an operational risk event occurring or that mitigate the
adverse consequences of such an event if it does occur. The
Bank allocates economic capital for operational risk on the
basis of a statistical model that incorporates the Bank’s
experience of operational losses as well as external loss
data.
The Bank is currently working on identifying and assessing
operational risks and evaluating the effectiveness of existing
controls through a Bank-wide Control Self-Assessment
(CSA) programme. The Bank-wide rollout is expected to
be completed by end-2006. A feasibility study has been
carried out to assess possible ways to integrate CSA
results and operational risk quantification. The BIS has
further enhanced its control framework in recent years,
strengthening its risk control, internal audit and compliance
functions, and is currently working on a draft operational
risk management framework.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the
balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed
cost value is included in the gold revaluation account
(reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”), and realised gains or losses on the disposal of
gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and
loss account.
Note 21B provides further analysis of the gold revaluation
account. Note 30 provides further analysis of the net gain
on sales of gold investment assets.

(see note 30). The balance at 31 March 2006 amounted to
165 tonnes of fine gold.

7. Currency banking and investment assets
A. Total holdings
Fixed-term loans are investments made with central banks,
international institutions and commercial banks. These
include advances to central banks and international
institutions as part of committed and uncommitted
standby facilities. The balance sheet total “Time deposits
and advances to banks” also includes call and notice
accounts (see note 8).

Currency banking and investment assets comprise treasury
bills, securities purchased under resale agreements, fixedterm loans, and government and other securities. Banking
assets comprise those assets that represent the
reinvestment of customer deposits. Investment assets
comprise the investments funded by the Bank's own equity.
Currency banking assets are designated as fair value
through profit and loss. Currency investment assets are
designated as available for sale.

Government and other securities are investments made
with central banks, international institutions and
commercial banks and include fixed and floating rate
bonds and asset-backed securities.

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are transactions under which the
Bank places a fixed-term deposit with a counterparty which
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
deposit is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and
there is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent
securities subject to the repayment of the deposit. During
the term of the agreement the fair value of collateral is
monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit exposure.

9. Derivative financial instruments

The Bank’s investment assets are designated as available
for sale.

The Bank uses the following types of derivative instruments
for economic hedging and trading purposes.

Note 21A provides further analysis of the securities
revaluation account. Note 29 provides further analysis of
the net gain on sales of investment securities.

Interest rate and bond futures are contractual obligations
to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest
rates or bond prices on a future date at a specified price
established in an organised market. Futures contracts
are collateralised by cash or marketable securities and
changes in the futures contract value are settled daily with
the exchange.

currency investment assets:

Currency and bond options are contractual agreements
under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but
not the obligation, to either buy (call option) or sell (put
option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency,
a bond or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Options on futures are contractual agreements that confer
the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures
contract at a predetermined price during a specified period
of time.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps are commitments to
exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result in
an economic exchange of currencies, gold or interest rates
(for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination
of interest rates and currencies (cross-currency interest
rate swaps). Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of
principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards represent commitments to
purchase foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.

8. Time deposits and advances to banks
Time deposits and advances to banks comprise fixed-term
loans and call and notice accounts.
Fixed-term loans are designated as fair value through profit
and loss.
Call and notice accounts are designated as loans and
receivables and are included as cash and cash equivalents.
These are very short-term financial assets, typically having
a notice period of three days or less. These are included in
the balance sheet at amortised cost.

Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement
at a future date for the difference between a contracted rate
of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are options under which the seller grants the
purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by
or on a set date.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate
investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to
10 years. The Bank also offers MTIs which are callable at
an exercise price of par at the option of the Bank (callable
MTIs), with call dates between April 2006 and March 2007
(2005: April 2005 and March 2007). The amount of callable
MTIs in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2006 was
SDR 6,262.9 million (2005: SDR 3,720.1 million).

incurs realised profits or losses, which are included under
the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.
In accordance with the Bank's risk management policies
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on currency banking assets,
derivatives or other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would
otherwise arise from recognising realised and unrealised
gains and losses on different bases, the Bank designates
all of the relevant assets and liabilities in its currency
banking portfolios as held at fair value through profit and
loss.
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposits)
are included in the balance sheet at fair value. This value
differs from the amount that the Bank is contractually
required to pay at maturity to the holder of the deposit. For
total currency deposits the amount that the Bank is
contractually required to pay at maturity to the holder of
the deposit, plus accrued interest to 31 March 2006, is
SDR 187,896.6 million (2005: SDR 151,115.9 million).
The Bank uses financial models to estimate the fair value of
its currency deposits. These models value the expected
cash flows of financial instruments using discount factors
that are derived partly from quoted interest rates (eg Libor
and swap rates) and partly from assumptions about
spreads. The Bank determines these spreads based on
recent market transactions. In the financial year ended
31 March 2006, changes to the assumptions about spreads
used for valuing currency deposits decreased the Bank’s
profit by SDR 6.0 million (2005: decreased profit by
SDR 7.9 million).

FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the BIS for any
maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the BIS with
maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate
is reset in line with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS,
typically with a maturity of less than one year. The Bank
also takes fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the
maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank
(dual currency deposits). The amount of dual currency
deposits included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2006
was SDR 231.1 million (2005: SDR 1,096.4 million). The
maturity dates of these deposits are between April and
June 2006 (2005: April and September 2005).

13. Gold deposit liabilities
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from
central banks. They are all designated as loans and
receivables.

Sight and notice deposits are very short-term financial
liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or
less. They are designated as loans and receivables and are
included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
The Bank has undertaken to repay at fair value certain
deposit instruments, in whole or in part, at one to two
business days’ notice. As a result of this activity the Bank

14. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements

17. Share capital
The Bank’s share capital consists of:

Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase
agreements”) are transactions under which the Bank
receives a fixed-term deposit from a counterparty to which
it provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on
the deposit is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and
there is an irrevocable commitment to repay the deposit
subject to the return of equivalent securities. They originate
entirely from commercial banks.
As at 31 March 2006 and 2005 all of the securities sold
under repurchase agreements were associated with the
management of currency investment assets. They are
therefore all designated as loans and receivables and are
included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

18. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s
annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the
proposal of the Board of Directors to three specific reserve
funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and
the special dividend reserve fund; the remainder of the net
profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated
to the free reserve fund.

Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at
10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After paying any dividend, 10% of
the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently
must be allocated to the general reserve fund. When the
balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up
capital, such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the
remainder of the annual net profit.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder
of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special
dividend reserve fund, which shall be available, in case of
need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared
dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the Bank’s net
profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been
made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally
transferred to the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of BIS shares are allocated
to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully
funded, with the remainder being credited to the general
reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal
reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any
losses incurred by the Bank. In the event of liquidation
of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after
the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs
of liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s
shareholders.

19. Repurchase and subsequent redistribution
of shares
The Extraordinary General Meeting on 8 January 2001
amended the Bank’s Statutes to restrict the right to hold
shares in the BIS exclusively to central banks, thereby
effecting a mandatory repurchase from private (ie noncentral bank) shareholders of 72,648 shares on which the
American, Belgian and French central banks exercise
voting rights. At the same time the Bank repurchased
2,304 shares of these three issues from other central
banks. The total compensation paid was CHF 23,977.56
per share plus interest thereon.
The Bank held these shares in treasury and redistributed
40,119 of them, corresponding to the shares of the Belgian
and French issues held in treasury, during the financial
year ended 31 March 2005 to the central banks of those
countries. The Bank redistributed the remaining 35,933
shares of the American issue held in treasury by selling
them to shareholding central banks on 31 May 2005 (see
note 20).

In accordance with the Bank’s Statutes, the BIS shares
repurchased in early 2001 and subsequently held in
treasury (see note 19) may be redistributed by the Board of
Directors by way of sale to shareholding central banks
against payment of an amount equal to that of the
compensation paid to the former shareholders (ie
CHF 23,977.56 per share). Consistent therewith, during the
financial year ended 31 March 2005, the Bank redistributed
all treasury shares of the Belgian and French issues by
selling them to the central banks of those countries. The
proceeds of this sale of 40,119 shares amounted to
CHF 962.0 million, equivalent to SDR 536.7 million at the
relevant transaction dates.

212

BIS 76th Annual Report

On 31 May 2005 the Bank redistributed the remaining
35,933 shares of the American issue held in treasury
by selling them to shareholding central banks at a price
of CHF 23,977.56 per share. The proceeds of this
sale amounted to CHF 861.6 million, equivalent to
SDR 468.2 million at the transaction date.

A. Securities revaluation account
The figure of SDR 396.2 million (2005: SDR 456.4 million)
represents the SDR equivalent of the cost of the
compensation in Swiss francs paid to the former
shareholders of the shares at the time of the shares
repurchase in January 2001 and the final award of the
Hague Arbitral Tribunal in September 2003. For more
information on the Hague Arbitral Tribunal, see last year’s
financial statements, note 17. When the sale proceeds
of these shares were received, an exchange gain of
SDR 72.0 million (2005: SDR 80.3 million) was realised.
This resulted from the appreciation of the Swiss franc
against the SDR during the period from 2001 to the dates
of sale.
The remaining shares held in treasury consist of 1,000
suspended shares of the Albanian issue.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2006 a loan from
the Bank to a consortium of central banks that related to the
suspended shares of the Albanian issue was reclassified
from accounts receivable to shares held in treasury. The
amount reclassified was SDR 1.7 million.

22. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:

All arrangements are valued annually by independent
actuaries.

1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for
its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund without
separate legal personality, out of which benefits are paid.
The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole
benefit of current and former members of staff who
participate in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately
liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.

In addition, the Bank operates a blocked personal deposit
account for certain staff members who were previously
members of the Bank’s savings fund, which closed on
1 April 2003. The terms of these blocked accounts are such
that staff members cannot make further deposits and
balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The
accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the Bank
based on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank on
similar staff accounts. The total balance of blocked
accounts at 31 March 2006 was SDR 19.4 million
(2005: SDR 21.2 million). They are reported under the
balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its
directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum
service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident
benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this
arrangement is based in principle on the employee
remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the
completion of a minimum service period of 10 years.

The assumed increases in staff salaries, directors’

incorporate an inflation assumption of 1.5%.
The expected rate of return on fund assets is based on
long-term expectations for inflation, interest rates, risk
premiums and asset allocations. The estimate takes into
consideration historical returns and is determined in
conjunction with the fund’s independent actuaries.
The assumption for medical inflation has a significant effect
on the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account.
A 1% change in the assumption for medical inflation
compared to that used for the 2005/06 calculation would

The net loss in the financial year ended 31 March 2006
resulted principally from the impact of an appreciating
gold price on the market value of forward contracts for the
sale of gold investment assets. This loss was offset by a
corresponding increase in the realised gain on the Bank’s
sales of gold investment assets (see note 30) when these
transactions were settled.

The net loss in the financial year ended 31 March 2005 was
attributable principally to the impact of the appreciation of
the Swiss franc against the SDR on the Bank’s short Swiss
franc position which existed prior to the subscription
by the central banks of Belgium and France for the shares
of their national issues which were formerly held in
treasury. On the date of subscription, this loss (and the
related translation losses in prior years since these shares
were repurchased from private shareholders in 2001) was
offset in the Bank’s equity by a realised exchange gain of
SDR 80.3 million (see note 20).

The Bank invests the majority of its funds in the interbank
market (with G10 based global financial institutions) and in
G10 sovereign debt. A geographical analysis of the Bank’s
total assets is not provided because the Bank’s
Management believes that this would not present a fair

The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from
central banks and international institutions, comprise
93.6% (2005: 92.7%) of its total liabilities. At 31 March 2006
currency and gold deposits originated from 154 depositors
(2005: 159). Within these deposits there are significant
individual customer concentrations, with five customers
each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a

BIS 76th Annual Report

The Bank offers personal deposit accounts for all staff
members and its Directors. In addition, the Bank operates
a blocked personal deposit account for certain staff
members who were previously members of the Bank’s
savings fund. The terms of these blocked accounts are such
that staff members cannot make further deposits and
balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The
personal deposit accounts and the blocked accounts bear
interest at a rate determined by the Bank based on the rate
offered by the Swiss National Bank on similar staff
accounts. At 31 March 2006, the movements and total
balance on personal deposit and blocked accounts relating
to members of the Board of Directors and the senior
officials of the Bank were as follows:

The BIS provides banking services to central banks,
international organisations and other public institutions.
In fulfilling this role, the Bank in the normal course of
business enters into transactions with related party central
banks and connected institutions. These transactions
include making advances, and taking currency and gold
deposits.
It is the Bank’s policy to enter into transactions with related
party central banks and connected institutions on similar
terms and conditions to transactions with other, non-related
party customers.

institutions totalled SDR 7,132.0 million as at 31 March
2006 (2005: SDR 5,170.3 million).

Derivative transactions with related party central
banks and connected institutions
The BIS enters into derivative transactions with its related
party central banks and connected institutions, including
foreign exchange deals and interest rate swaps. The
total nominal value of these transactions with related
party central banks and connected institutions during the
year ended 31 March 2006 was SDR 10,948.1 million
(2005: SDR 4,184.5 million).

40. Contingent liabilities
The Bank is involved in two separate legal proceedings (in
addition to the proceedings before the Hague Arbitral
Tribunal that were completed in 2003) arising out of the
decision of 8 January 2001 to repurchase all BIS shares
then held by private shareholders (see note 19).
A group of former private shareholders initiated a legal
proceeding in December 2001 before the Commercial Court
in Paris. That Court made a preliminary determination
(without addressing the substance of the matter) in March

224

2003 that it had jurisdiction over claims seeking to increase
the amount of compensation. The Bank subsequently
requested review of this procedural decision by the Paris
Court of Appeals, arguing that the Hague Arbitral Tribunal
had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. In a decision
rendered on 25 February 2004, the Paris Court of Appeals
ruled in favour of the Bank by concluding that the Paris
Commercial Court had no jurisdiction over such claims. In
April 2004, a small group of former private shareholders
petitioned the French Cour de Cassation to quash the
ruling of the appeals court on the jurisdiction issue. Written
arguments regarding the jurisdiction issue were filed by
both the claimants and the Bank in late 2004, and a decision
of the court is pending. The Bank considers this action to
be without merit. Accordingly, no separate provision has
been made for these claims.
A separate proceeding was filed by a group of claimants
who purport to have sold BIS shares on the markets during
the period between the announcement of the share
withdrawal proposal on 11 September 2000 and the
8 January 2001 Extraordinary General Meeting decision
effectuating such withdrawal. The claim was brought not
against the BIS, but rather against JP Morgan & Cie SA
and Barbier Frinault, the Bank’s financial advisers for
determining the original compensation for the transaction.
That notwithstanding, the Bank faces indirect liability
through an indemnification clause in the contract with
JP Morgan & Cie SA with respect to litigation and costs that
might arise in connection with the financial advisory
services performed. No provision has been made for this
claim.
Aside from the foregoing, no significant litigation or
arbitration procedure involving the BIS is currently under
way.

BIS 76th Annual Report

Report of the auditors

Report of the auditors
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements (pages 190–224) of
the Bank for International Settlements. These financial statements incorporate
the balance sheet and profit and loss account, as required by the Bank's
Statutes, and the notes thereto. The financial statements have been prepared
by the Management of the Bank in accordance with the Statutes and with
the principles of valuation described under significant accounting policies in
the notes. Our responsibility under the Statutes of the Bank is to form an
independent opinion on the balance sheet and profit and loss account based on
our audit and to report our opinion to you. The prior year financial statements
were audited by another auditor whose report dated 9 May 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing. Those Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We have received all the information and explanations which we
have required to obtain assurance that the balance sheet and profit and loss
account are free of material misstatement, and believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements, including the notes thereto, have
been properly drawn up and give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Bank for International Settlements at 31 March 2006 and the results
of its operations for the year then ended in conformity with the accounting
principles described in the notes to the financial statements and the Statutes
of the Bank.
