FOREWORD
Five years after the world committed to end
hunger, food insecurit y and all forms of
malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve
this objective by 2030. Data tell us that the
world is progressing neither towards SDG
target 2.1, of ensuring access to safe, nutritious
and sufficient food for all people all year round,
nor towards target 2.2, of eradicating all forms
of malnutrition.

will exceed 840 million by 2030. Hence, the world
is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger, even
without the negative effects that COV ID-19 will
likely have on hunger. Preliminar y projections
based on the latest available global economic
outlooks, also presented in this report, suggest
that the COV ID-19 pandemic may add an
additional 83 to 132 million people to the ranks
of the undernourished in 2020.

There are many threats to progress. The 2017
and 2018 editions of this report showed that
conf lict and climate variabilit y and extremes
undermine efforts to end hunger, food insecurit y
and malnutrition. In 2019, the report showed
that economic slowdowns and downturns also
undercut these efforts. In 2020, the COV ID-19
pandemic, as well as unprecedented Desert
Locust outbreaks in Eastern Africa, are
obscuring economic prospects in ways no one
could have anticipated, and the situation may
only get worse if we do not act urgently and take
unprecedented action.

Beyond hunger, a growing number of people
have had to reduce the quantit y and qualit y
of the food they consume. Two billion people,
or 25.9 percent of the global population,
experienced hunger or did not have reg ular
access to nutritious and sufficient food in
2019. This situation could deteriorate if we do
not act immediately and boldly.
These trends in food insecurit y contribute to
increasing the risk of child malnutrition, as
food insecurit y affects diet qualit y, including
the qualit y of children’s and women’s diets, and
people’s health in different ways. Hence,
as painful as it is to accept, it is unsurprising
that the burden of child malnutrition
remains a threat around the world: in 2019,
21.3 percent (144.0 million) of children
under 5 years of age were estimated to be
stunted, 6.9 percent (47.0 million) wasted and
5.6 percent (38.3 million) overweight, while
at least 340 million children suffered from
micronutrient deficiencies. The good news
is that between 2000 and 2019, the global
prevalence of child stunting declined by
one-third. However, the world is not on track to
achieve the global nutrition targets, including
those on child stunting, wasting and overweight
by 2030. Furthermore, adult obesit y is on the
rise in all regions. Projections for 2030, even
without considering a potential global recession,
ser ve as an added warning that the current level
of effort is not any where near enough to end
malnutrition in the next decade.

The most recent estimate for 2019 shows that
prior to the COV ID-19 pandemic, almost
690 million people, or 8.9 percent of the global
population, were undernourished. This estimate
is based on new data on population, food supply
and more importantly, new household sur vey
data that enabled the revision of the inequalit y
of food consumption for 13 countries, including
China. Revising the undernourishment estimate
for China going back to the year 2000 resulted in
a significantly lower number of undernourished
people worldwide. This is because China has
one-fifth of the global population. Despite this,
the trend reported in past editions of this report
still stands: since 2014, the number of hungr y
people worldwide has been slowly rising.
The new estimate for 2019 has revealed that
an additional 60 million people have become
affected by hunger since 2014. If this trend
continues, the number of undernourished people

negative environmental impacts and the health
costs do not account for the negative impacts of
undernutrition due to data constraints. In light
of this evidence, it is clear that the adoption
of healthy diets that include sustainabilit y
considerations can significantly reduce these
hidden costs, generating important synergies
with other SDGs.

We can still succeed, but only by ensuring
all people’s access not only to food, but to
nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet.
With this report, all five agencies are sending
a strong message: A key reason why millions
of people around the world suffer from hunger,
food insecurit y and malnutrition is because
they cannot afford the cost of healthy diets.
Costly and unaffordable healthy diets are
associated with increasing food insecurit y and
all forms of malnutrition, including stunting,
wasting, overweight and obesit y. Food supply
disruptions and the lack of income due to the
loss of livelihoods and remittances as a result
of COV ID-19 means that households across the
globe are facing increased difficulties to access
nutritious foods and are only making it even
more difficult for the poorer and v ulnerable
populations to have access to healthy diets.

We must look throughout the food system to
address the factors that are driving up the cost
of nutritious foods. This means supporting
food producers – especially small-scale
producers – to get nutritious foods to markets
at low cost, making sure people have access
to these food markets, and making food
supply chains work for v ulnerable people –
from small-scale producers to the billions of
consumers whose income is simply insufficient
to afford healthy diets.

It is unacceptable that, in a world that produces
enough food to feed its entire population, more
than 1.5 billion people cannot afford a diet that
meets the required levels of essential nutrients
and over 3 billion people cannot even afford
the cheapest healthy diet. People without
access to healthy diets live in all regions of the
world; thus, we are facing a global problem
that affects us all.

Clearly, then, we face the challenge of
transforming food systems to ensure that
no one is constrained by the high prices
of nutritious foods or the lack of income
to afford a healthy diet, while we ensure
that food production and consumption
contribute to env ironmental sustainabilit y.
However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution
for countries, and policy makers will need to
assess the context-specific barriers, manage
trade-offs and maximize sy nerg ies – such as
potential env ironment gains – to achieve the
required transformations.

Current food consumption patterns also
generate what this year’s report calls “hidden
costs” related to health costs (SDG 3) and
climate-change costs (SDG 13). If current food
consumption patterns continue, diet-related
health costs linked to mortalit y and diet-related
non-communicable diseases are projected
to exceed USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030.
The diet-related social cost of greenhouse
gas emissions associated with current dietar y
patterns is estimated to reach more than
USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030. Both of these
hidden costs are a significant underestimation.
The environmental costs do not account for other

We trust that the recommendations in this
report, once tailored to each countr y context,
will help governments to reduce the cost of
nutritious foods, make healthy diets affordable
for ever yone and enable v ulnerable people
working in food systems to earn decent incomes
that enhance their own food securit y. This will
set in motion a transformation of existing
food systems that makes them resilient and

incentives towards more nutrition-sensitive
investment; and policy actions all along food
supply chains, with a focus on nutritious
foods for healthy diets, to reduce food losses,
create opportunities for v ulnerable small-scale
producers and others working in food systems,
and enhance efficiencies. Nutrition-sensitive
social protection policies will also be central to
increase the purchasing power and affordabilit y
of healthy diets by the most v ulnerable
populations. An enabling environment should
also be promoted by policies that, more
generally, improve the nutritional qualit y of
the food produced and available on the market,
support the marketing of diverse and nutritious
food, and provide education and information for
fostering individual and social behaviour change
towards healthy diets.

Our agencies stand firmly committed to support
a shift that makes healthy diets affordable to
all and contributes to the eradication of hunger,
food insecurit y and all forms of malnutrition in
children and adults. Our efforts shall ensure that
this shift unfolds in a sustainable way, for people
and the planet, and creates synergies to spur
progress on other SDGs.

METHODOLOGY
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 has been prepared by the FAO Agricultural
Development Economics Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the Economic and Social
Development Department and a team of technical experts from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, W FP and W HO.
A senior advisor y team consisting of designated senior managers of the five UN publishing partners
g uided the production of the report. Led by FAO, this team decided on the outline of the report and
defined its thematic focus. It further gave oversight to the technical writing team composed of experts
from each of the five co-publishing agencies. Background technical papers were prepared to support the
research and data analysis undertaken by the members of the writing team.
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs, including an annotated outline, first draft
and final draft of the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by the senior advisor y team at
each stage in the preparation process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review by senior
management and technical experts from different divisions and departments within each of the five UN
agencies, both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the report underwent executive review
and clearance by the heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 was jointly prepared by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health
Organization (WHO).
Under the overall guidance of Maximo Torero Cullen, the direction of the publication was carried out by
Marco V. Sánchez Cantillo and José Rosero Moncayo, with the overall coordination of Cindy Holleman,
the Editor of the publication, all of whom are from the FAO Economic and Social Development
Department (ES). The development of the report was guided by a Steering Committee consisting of agency
representatives from the five co-publishing partners: Marco V. Sánchez Cantillo (Chair), Sara Savastano
(IFAD), Victor Aguayo (UNICEF), Arif Husain (WFP) and Francesco Branca (WHO). Alessandra Garbero
and Tisorn Songsermsawas (IFAD), Chika Hayashi and Roland Kupka (UNICEF), Yvonne Forsén (WFP)
and Marzella Wüstefeld (WHO) contributed to the coordination and provided technical support.
Valuable comments and final approval of the report were provided by the executive heads and senior staff
of the five co-authoring agencies.
Part 1 of the report was coordinated by Anne Kepple (FAO). Section 1.1 was prepared by Carlo Cafiero with
inputs from Piero Conforti, Juan Feng, Adeeba Ishaq, Anne Kepple and Sara Viviani (FAO). Section 1.2 was
prepared by Elaine Borghi with Elisa Dominguez (WHO), Chika Hayashi, Julia Krasevec, Richard Kumapley,
Roland Kupka and Vrinda Mehra (UNICEF), with inputs from Katrina Lundberg, Lisa Rogers, Zita
Weise Prinzo and Marzella Wüstefeld (WHO). Section 1.3 was prepared by Anne Kepple, with Cristina
Álvarez-Sánchez, Marinella Cirillo, Ana Moltedo, Ramani Wijesinha-Bettoni, Trudy Wijnhoven and
Isabela Sattamini (FAO), and Chika Hayashi and Vrinda Mehra (UNICEF), with inputs from Nancy Aburto
and Lidan Du (FAO), Katrina Lundberg, Karen McColl and Marzella Wüstefeld (WHO) and inputs from
Terri Ballard and Anna Herforth. José Rosero Moncayo provided editorial support and input to Part 1.
This year’s report contains important updates, especially the revision of the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU) for China. This revision is significant, given that China has one-fifth of the
global population, and hence we sought independent assessment on the integrity of our approach and
methodolog y from four leading experts: Joachim von Braun, Professor for the Department of Economic
and Technological Change and Director of Center for Development Research (ZEF) at Bonn University,
and Chair of the Scientific Committee of the 2021 Food Systems Summit; Christopher Barrett, Professor of
Applied Economics and Management, international professor of agriculture at the Charles H. Dyson School
of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University; David Laborde, Senior Research Fellow and
Theme Leader on Macroeconomics and Trade at the International Food Policy Research Institute;
and Maria Ana Lugo, Senior Economist with the Poverty and Equity Global Practice at the World Bank.
Reviewers concluded that the approach adopted by FAO to update estimates of the coefficient of variation
for food consumption at the national level for China, which is based on the combined analysis of data
from two different household sur veys, is valid, and that the methodolog y is sound. They attested to
the increased consistency of our revised results with existing evidence on nutrition in China, as well
as with a set of economic development indicators in the countr y, including extreme povert y, prevalence
of stunting, food expenditure distribution and shared prosperit y. The peer reviewers also confirmed
that our results were aligned with the findings of their own analyses based on different econometric
modelling exercises. FAO is deeply indebted to the peer reviewers for generously sharing their time
and expertise.

KEY MESSAGES
è Globally, the burden of malnutrition in all its forms
remains a challenge. According to current estimates, in
2019, 21.3 percent (144.0 million) of children under
5 years of age were stunted, 6.9 percent (47.0 million)
wasted and 5.6 percent (38.3 million) overweight.

è Updates for many countries have made it possible
to estimate hunger in the world with greater accuracy
this year. In particular, newly accessible data enabled
the revision of the entire series of annual
undernourishment estimates for China back to 2000,
resulting in a substantial downward shift of the series of
the number of undernourished in the world.
Nevertheless, the revision confirms the trend reported in
past editions: the number of people affected by hunger
globally has been slowly on the rise since 2014.

è The world is making progress but is not on track to
achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child stunting
and low birthweight, and for exclusive breastfeeding, is
on track only for the 2025 target. The prevalence of
wasting is notably above the targets. Most regions are
not on track to achieve the targets for child overweight.
Adult obesity is on the rise in all regions. Urgent action
is needed to reverse these upward trends.

è Current estimates are that nearly 690 million
people are hungry, or 8.9 percent of the world
population – up by 10 million people in one year and
by nearly 60 million in five years. The number of
people affected by severe food insecurity, which is
another measure that approximates hunger, shows a
similar upward trend. In 2019, close to 750 million –
or nearly one in ten people in the world – were
exposed to severe levels of food insecurity.

è The nutritional status of the most vulnerable
population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to
the health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.
è Food insecurity can worsen diet quality and
consequently increase the risk of various forms of
malnutrition, potentially leading to undernutrition as well
as overweight and obesity.

è Considering the total affected by moderate or
severe food insecurity, an estimated 2 billion people in
the world did not have regular access to safe,
nutritious and sufficient food in 2019.

è Low-income countries rely more on staple foods and
less on fruits and vegetables and animal source foods
than high-income countries. Only in Asia, and globally
in upper-middle-income countries, are there enough
fruits and vegetables available for human consumption
to be able to meet the FAO/WHO recommendation of
consuming a minimum of 400 g/person/day.

è The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger
by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number of
people affected by hunger would surpass 840 million
by 2030.
è A preliminary assessment suggests that the
COVID-19 pandemic may add between 83 and
132 million people to the total number of
undernourished in the world in 2020 depending on
the economic growth scenario.

è While we still face significant challenges in just
accessing food, challenges are even more important in
terms of accessing healthy diets.

| xvi |

The adoption of healthy diets is projected to lead to
a reduction of up to 97 percent in direct and indirect
health costs and 41–74 percent in the social cost of
GHG emissions in 2030.

è Healthy diets are unaffordable to many people,
especially the poor, in every region of the world. The
most conservative estimate shows they are unaffordable
for more than 3 billion people in the world. Healthy
diets are estimated to be, on average, five times more
expensive than diets that meet only dietary energy
needs through a starchy staple.

è However, not all healthy diets are sustainable and
not all diets designed for sustainability are always
healthy. This important nuance is not well understood
and is missing from ongoing discussions and debates
on the potential contribution of healthy diets to
environmental sustainability.

è The cost of a healthy diet exceeds the international
poverty line (established at USD 1.90 purchasing
power parity (PPP) per person per day), making it
unaffordable for the poor. The cost also exceeds
average food expenditures in most countries in the
Global South: around 57 percent or more of the
population cannot afford a healthy diet throughout
sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.

è To increase the affordability of healthy diets, the
cost of nutritious foods must come down. The cost
drivers of these diets are seen throughout the food
supply chain, within the food environment, and in
the political economy that shapes trade, public
expenditure and investment policies. Tackling these
cost drivers will require large transformations in food
systems with no one-size-fits-all solution and different
trade-offs and synergies for countries.

è All diets have hidden costs, which must be
understood to identify trade-offs and synergies in
relation to other SDGs. Two hidden costs that are most
critical relate to the health (SDG 3) and climate-related
(SDG 13) consequences of our dietary choices and the
food systems that support these.

è Countries will need a rebalancing of agricultural
policies and incentives towards more nutritionsensitive investment and policy actions all along the
food supply chain to reduce food losses and
enhance efficiencies at all stages. Nutrition-sensitive
social protection policies will also be central for them
to increase the purchasing power and affordability of
healthy diets of the most vulnerable populations.
Policies that more generally foster behavioural
change towards healthy diets will also be needed.

è Under current food consumption patterns,
diet-related health costs linked to mortality and
non-communicable diseases are projected to exceed
USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2030. On the other hand,
the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions
associated with current dietary patterns is estimated to
be more than USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030.
è Shifting to healthy diets can contribute to reducing
health and climate-change costs by 2030, because
the hidden costs of these healthy diets are lower
compared to those of current consumption patterns.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION
AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

The reasons for the obser ved increase of the
last few years are multiple. Much of the recent
increase in food insecurit y can be attributed to
the greater number of conf licts, often exacerbated
by climate-related shocks. Even in some peaceful
settings, food securit y has deteriorated as a result
of economic slowdowns threatening access to
food for the poor.

Five years into the 2030 Agenda, it is time
to assess progress and to question whether
continuing efforts implemented thus far will
allow countries to reach SDG 2 targets. For this
reason, this year’s report complements the
usual assessment of the state of food securit y
and nutrition in the world with projections of
what the world may look like in 2030 if trends
of the last decade continue. Importantly, as the
COV ID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, this
report attempts to foresee some of the impacts
of this global pandemic on food securit y and
nutrition. However, given that the full extent of
the devastation that COV ID-19 will cause is still
largely unknown, it is important to recognize
that any assessment at this stage is subject to
a high degree of uncertaint y and should be
interpreted with caution.

The evidence also reveals that the world is not on
track to achieve the SDG 2.1 Zero Hunger target
by 2030. Combined projections of recent trends
in the size and composition of the population, in
the total food availabilit y, and in the degree of
inequalit y in food access point to an increase of
the PoU by almost 1 percentage point. As a result,
the global number of undernourished people in
2030 would exceed 840 million.
The PoU in Africa was 19.1 percent of the
population in 2019, or more than 250 million
undernourished people, up from 17.6 percent
in 2014. This prevalence is more than twice the
world average (8.9 percent) and is the highest
among all regions.

Progress towards hunger and food insecurity targets
The three most recent editions of this report
already presented evidence that the decades-long
decline in hunger in the world, as measured
using the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU),
had unfortunately ended. Additional evidence
and several important data updates, including a
revision of the entire PoU series for China back
to 2000, show that almost 690 million people in
the world (8.9 percent of the world population)
are estimated to have been undernourished in
2019. Revision in light of the new data, which
results in a parallel downward shift of the entire
global PoU series, confirms the conclusion of
past editions of this report: the number of people
affected by hunger in the world continues to
increase slowly. This trend started in 2014 and
extends to 2019. There are nearly 60 million more
undernourished people now than in 2014, when
the prevalence was 8.6 percent – up by 10 million
people between 2018 and 2019.

Asia is home to more than half of the total
undernourished people in the world – an
estimated 381 million people in 2019.
Yet, the PoU in the population for the region
is 8.3 percent, below the world average
(8.9 percent), and less than half of that of Africa.
Asia has shown progress in reducing the number
of hungr y people in recent years, down by
8 million since 2015.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, the PoU was
7.4 percent in 2019, below the world prevalence
of 8.9 percent, which still translates into almost
48 million undernourished people. The region
has seen a rise in hunger in the past few years,
with the number of undernourished people
increasing by 9 million between 2015 and 2019.

| xviii |

insecurit y in 2019. In all regions of the world
except Northern America and Europe, the
prevalence of severe food insecurit y has
increased from 2014 to 2019. This is also broadly
consistent with recent trends in the PoU in
the world and across regions, with the partial
exception of Asia.

In terms of the outlook for 2030, Africa is
significantly off track to achieve the Zero Hunger
target in 2030. If recent rates of increase persist,
its PoU will rise from 19.1 to 25.7 percent.
Latin America and the Caribbean is also
off track, although to a much lower degree.
Mostly due to deterioration in recent years, its
PoU is expected to increase from 7.4 percent in
2019 to 9.5 in 2030. Asia, while making progress,
will also not achieve the 2030 target based on
recent trends.

While the 746 million people facing severe food
insecurit y are of utmost concern, an additional
16 percent of the world population, or more
than 1.25 billion people, have experienced food
insecurit y at moderate levels. People who are
moderately food insecure do not have reg ular
access to nutritious and sufficient food, even if
not necessarily suffering from hunger.

Overall, and without considering the effects of
COV ID-19, projected trends in undernourishment
would change the geographic distribution of
world hunger dramatically. While Asia would still
be home to almost 330 million hungr y people
in 2030, its share of the world’s hunger would
shrink substantially. Africa would overtake Asia
to become the region with the highest number of
undernourished people (433 million), accounting
for 51.5 percent of the total.

The prevalence of both moderate and severe
levels of food insecurit y (SDG Indicator 2.1.2)
is estimated to be 25.9 percent in 2019 for the
world as a whole. This translates into a total of
2 billion people. Total food insecurit y (moderate
or severe) has consistently increased at the global
level since 2014, mostly because of the increase in
moderate food insecurit y.

At the time of this writing, the COV ID-19
pandemic was spreading across the globe,
clearly posing a serious threat to food securit y.
Preliminar y assessments based on the latest
available global economic outlooks suggest that
the COV ID-19 pandemic may add between 83
and 132 million people to the total number of
undernourished in the world in 2020 depending
on the economic growth scenario (losses ranging
from 4.9 to 10 percentage points in global GDP
growth). The expected recover y in 2021 would
bring the number of undernourished down but
still above what was projected in a scenario
without the pandemic. Again, it is important
to recognize that any assessment at this stage
is subject to a high degree of uncertaint y and
should be interpreted with caution.

Although Africa is where the highest levels of
total food insecurit y are obser ved, it is in Latin
America and the Caribbean where food insecurit y
is rising the fastest: from 22.9 percent in 2014 to
31.7 percent in 2019, due to a sharp increase in
South America.
In terms of the distribution of total food insecure
(moderate or severe) people in the world, out
of the 2 billion people suffering from food
insecurit y, 1.03 billion are in Asia, 675 million
in Africa, 205 million in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 88 million in Northern America and
Europe, and 5.9 million in Oceania.
At the global level, the prevalence of food
insecurit y at moderate or severe level, and severe
level only, is higher among women than men.

Latest estimates suggest that 9.7 percent of the
world population (slightly less than 750 million
people) was exposed to severe levels of food

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The gender gap in accessing food increased from
2018 to 2019, particularly at the moderate or
severe level.

Worldwide, 14.6 percent of infants were born
with low birthweight (less than 2 500 g) in
2015. The trends for this indicator at global and
regional level show that some progress has been
made in recent years, but not enough to achieve
the target of a 30 percent reduction in low
birthweight by 2025 or even by 2030.

Progress towards global nutrition targets
Worldwide, the prevalence of child stunting in
2019 was 21.3 percent, or 144 million children.
Although there has been some progress, rates of
stunting reduction are far below what is needed
to reach the World Health Assembly ( W H A)
target for 2025 and the SDG target for 2030.
If recent trends continue, these targets will only
be achieved in 2035 and 2043, respectively.

Globally, as of 2019, it is estimated that
44 percent of infants aged less than six months
were exclusively breastfed. Currently, the world
is on track to achieve the 2025 target of at least
50 percent of babies younger than six months
being exclusively breastfed. If additional efforts
are not made, however, the global target for
2030 of at least 70 percent will not be achieved
before 2038. Most subregions are making at
least some progress, except Eastern Asia and the
Caribbean. If the Eastern Africa, Central Asia
and Southern Asia subregions maintain their
current rates of progress, they will reach the
targets set for both 2025 and 2030.

In 2019, more than nine out of ten stunted
children lived in Africa or Asia, representing
40 percent and 54 percent of all stunted children
in the world, respectively. Most regions have
made some progress in reducing stunting
between 2012 and 2019 but not at the rate
needed to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets.
Globally, stunting estimates var y by wealth.
Children from the poorest wealth quintile had a
stunting prevalence that was more than double
that of children from the richest quintile.

Adult obesit y continues to rise, from 11.8 percent
in 2012 to 13.1 percent in 2016 and is not on
track to reach the global target to halt the rise in
adult obesit y by 2025. If the prevalence continues
to increase by 2.6 percent per year, adult obesit y
will increase by 40 percent by 2025, compared to
the 2012 level. All subregions show increasing
trends in the prevalence of adult obesit y between
2012 and 2016.

The global prevalence of overweight among
children under 5 years of age has not improved,
going from 5.3 percent in 2012 to 5.6 percent,
or 38.3 million children, in 2019. Of these,
24 percent lived in Africa and 45 percent
in Asia. Australia and New Zealand is the
only subregion with a ver y high prevalence
(20.7 percent). Southern Africa (12.7 percent)
and Northern Africa (11.3 percent) have
prevalences considered high.

The critical link between food security and nutrition
outcomes: food consumption and diet quality
Diet quality comprises four key aspects: variety/
diversity, adequacy, moderation and overall
balance. According to WHO, a healthy diet
protects against malnutrition in all its forms, as
well as non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such
as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
It contains a balanced, diverse and appropriate
selection of foods eaten over a period of time.

Globally, 6.9 percent of children under 5
(47 million) were affected by wasting in 2019 –
a fig ure significantly above the 2025 target
(5 percent) and the 2030 target (3 percent) for
this indicator.

| xx |

The world average availabilit y of fruits and
vegetables increased; however, only in Asia,
and globally in upper-middle-income countries,
are there enough fruits and vegetables available
to meet the FAO/W HO recommendation of
consuming a minimum of 400 g per day.

In addition, a healthy diet ensures that a person’s
needs for macronutrients (proteins, fats and
carbohydrates including dietary fibres) and
essential micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
are met, specific to their gender, age, physical
activity level and physiological state. Healthy diets
include less than 30 percent of total energ y intake
from fats, with a shift in fat consumption away
from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and the
elimination of industrial trans fats; less than
10 percent of total energ y intake from free sugars
(preferably less than 5 percent); consumption of
at least 400 g of fruits and vegetables per day; and
not more than 5 g per day of salt (to be iodized).
While the exact make-up of a healthy diet varies
depending on individual characteristics, as well
as cultural context, locally available foods and
dietary customs, the basic principles of what
constitutes a healthy diet are the same.

Availabilit y of animal source foods overall
is highest in high-income countries, but it
is growing rapidly in upper-middle-income
countries. Most of the global increases in animal
source foods were obser ved in lower- and
upper-middle-income countries. Asia showed
the largest increase in the total amount of
animal source foods available.
The contribution from animal source foods varies
with the countr y income group. It is higher in
high-income countries (29 percent) compared
to upper-middle- and lower-middle-income
countries (20 percent), and lowest in low-income
countries (11 percent).

Global assessment of food consumption and diet
qualit y poses many challenges. To date, there is
no single, validated composite index to measure
the multiple dimensions of diet qualit y across
all countries.

According to UNICEF, dietar y diversit y
in infants and young children was low in
the majorit y of the regions, with less than
40 percent of children meeting minimum dietar y
diversit y in seven out of the eleven subregions.
In addition, there are stark disparities in the
prevalence of minimum dietar y diversit y by
the place of residence (urban/rural) and wealth
status. The prevalence of children eating foods
from at least five out of eight food groups is on
average 1.7 times higher among children living
in urban households than in rural, and among
those living in the richest households compared
to the poorest.

Data on food availability at the country level show
large discrepancies in the per capita availability of
foods from different food groups across different
country income groups. Low-income- and
lower-middle-income countries rely heavily
on staple foods like cereals, roots, tubers and
plantains. Overall, the availability of staple foods
for the world has changed little between 2000 and
2017. Availability of roots, tubers and plantains
increased in lower-middle-income countries,
driven by a rise in Africa, whereas it decreased in
high-income countries.

How does food insecurity affect what people eat?

In low-income countries, cereals, roots, tubers
and plantains represent nearly 60 percent of all
food available in 2017. This percentage decreases
gradually with countr y income groups, down to
22 percent in high-income countries.

An analysis of dietar y patterns according to levels
of food insecurity found that diet quality worsens
with increasing severity of food insecurity.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Increasing availabilit y of and access to
nutritious foods that comprise healthy diets
must be a key component of stronger efforts
to achieve the 2030 targets. The remaining
years of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition
2016 –2025 present an opportunit y for
policymakers, civil societ y and the private
sector to work together and accelerate efforts.

The ways in which moderately food insecure
people modif y their diets var y according
to the income level of the countr y. In two
lower-middle-income countries studied (Kenya
and Sudan), there is a marked decrease in
consumption of most food groups, and an
increase in the share of staples in the diet.
In two upper-middle-income countries
examined (Mexico and Samoa), people who
are moderately food insecure consume more
foods that are t y pically cheaper on a per-calorie
basis (cereals, roots, tubers and plantains), and
consume lesser amounts of expensive foods
(meat and dair y), compared with those who
are food secure. Mexico in particular shows a
decrease in fruit and dair y consumption as the
severit y of food insecurit y increases.

TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS
TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY
DIETS FOR ALL
As already highlighted above, diet qualit y is a
critical link between food securit y and nutrition
outcomes that needs to be present as part of all
efforts to achieve the hunger, food securit y and
nutrition targets of SDG 2. Meeting these targets
will only be possible if we ensure that people
have enough food to eat, and that what they are
eating is nutritious. However, one of the biggest
challenges to achieving this is the current cost
and affordabilit y of healthy diets, which is the
focus of Part 2 of this report this year.

In summar y, with ten years to go until 2030, the
world is off track to achieve the SDG targets for
hunger and malnutrition. After decades of long
decline, the number of people suffering from
hunger has been slowly increasing since 2014.
Beyond hunger, a growing number of people
have been forced to compromise on the qualit y
and/or quantit y of the food they consume, as
ref lected in the increase in moderate or severe
food insecurit y since 2014. Projections for 2030,
even without considering the potential impact of
COV ID-19, ser ve as a warning that the current
level of effort is not enough to reach Zero
Hunger ten years from now.

The cost and affordability of healthy diets
around the world
New analysis presented in this report aims to
determine whether the food system brings three
levels of diet qualit y within reach of the poorest.
The three diets chosen denote increasing levels
of diet qualit y, starting from a basic energ y
sufficient diet meeting calorie needs, to a nutrient
adequate diet and then a healthy diet, the latter
including an estimation of recommended intake
of more diversified and desirable food groups.
As expected, the cost of the diet increases
incrementally as the diet qualit y increases and
this is true across all regions and countr y income
groups. The cost of a healthy diet is 60 percent
higher than the cost of the nutrient adequate
diet, and almost 5 times the cost of the energ y
sufficient diet.

As for nutrition, progress is being made
on decreasing child stunting and low
birthweight and on increasing exclusive
breastfeeding for the first six months of life.
However, the prevalence of wasting is notably
above the targets and the prevalence of both
child overweight and adult obesit y is increasing
in almost all regions. COV ID-19 is expected to
exacerbate these trends, rendering v ulnerable
people even more v ulnerable.

and reveal how dietar y choices affect other SDGs.
Two hidden costs that are most critical relate to
the health (SDG 3) and climate-related (SDG 13)
consequences of our dietar y patterns and the
food systems that support these. The health
and environmental consequences of unbalanced
and unhealthy diets translate into actual costs
for individuals and societ y as a whole, such as
increased medical costs and the costs of climate
damage, among other environmental costs.

While most of the poor around the world can
afford an energ y sufficient diet, as defined here,
they cannot afford either a nutrient adequate or a
healthy diet. A healthy diet is far more expensive
than the full value of the international poverty
line of USD 1.90 PPP per day, let alone the portion
of the poverty line that can credibly be reserved
for food (63 percent), to end up with a threshold of
USD 1.20 PPP per day. When comparing its cost to
household food expenditure, on average a healthy
diet is affordable, with the cost representing
95 percent of average food expenditures per
capita per day at the global level. Most striking
is that the cost of a healthy diet exceeds national
average food expenditures in most countries in
the Global South.

New analysis for this report has estimated
the health and climate-change costs of five
different dietar y patterns: one benchmark diet,
representing current food consumption patterns,
and four alternative healthy diet patterns that,
although differing in the way they include foods
from several groups and diversit y within food
groups, all include sustainabilit y considerations.

It is estimated that based on estimated income
distributions more than 3 billion people in
the world could not afford a healthy diet in
2017. Most of these people are found in Asia
(1.9 billion) and Africa (965 million), although
there are also millions that live in Latin America
and the Caribbean (104.2 million), and in
Northern America and Europe (18 million).

The health impacts associated with poor diet
qualit y are significant. Diets of poor qualit y are
a principal contributor to the multiple burdens of
malnutrition – stunting, wasting, micronutrient
deficiencies, overweight and obesit y and both
undernutrition early in life and overweight and
obesit y are significant risk factors for NCDs.
Unhealthy diets are also the leading risk factor
for deaths from NCDs. In addition, increasing
healthcare costs linked to increasing obesit y rates
are a trend across the world.

While the cost and affordabilit y of diets varies
around the world, across regions and in different
development contexts, they may also var y within
countries due to temporal and geographical
factors, as well as variations in the nutritional
needs of individuals across the life cycle.
These within-countr y variations in cost are
not captured in the above global and regional
analysis – but evidence from case studies makes
it clear such variations can be substantial.

Assuming that current food consumption
patterns accommodate expected changes in
income and population, as per in the benchmark
scenario representing current food consumption
patterns, health costs are projected to reach an
average of USD 1.3 trillion in 2030. More than
half (57 percent) of these are direct healthcare
costs as they are associated with expenses related
to treating the different diet-related diseases.
The other part (43 percent) accounts for indirect
costs, including losses in labour productivit y
(11 percent) and informal care (32 percent).

of what we eat
Valuing the hidden costs (or negative
externalities) associated with different diets could

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Managing trade-offs and exploiting synergies in the
transition towards healthy diets that include
sustainability considerations

If, instead, any of the four alternative diet
patterns used for the analyses are adopted (FLX,
PSC, V EG, VGN), diet-related health costs
dramatically decrease by USD 1.2–1.3 trillion,
representing an average reduction of 95 percent
of the diet-related health expenditures worldwide
compared to the benchmark scenario in 2030.

To achieve the dietar y patterns for healthy diets
that include sustainabilit y considerations, large
transformative changes in food systems will be
needed at all levels. Given the large diversit y
of current food systems and wide discrepancies
in food securit y and nutrition status across and
within countries, there is no one-size-fits-all
solution for countries to move from the status
quo to achieving healthy diets and create
synergies to reduce their environmental
footprints. Assessing the context-specific
barriers, managing (and sometimes enduring)
short-term and long-term trade-offs and
exploiting synergies is critical.

What people eat, and how that food is
produced, not only affects their health, but
also has major ramifications for the state of the
environment and for climate change. The food
system underpinning the world’s current
dietar y patterns is responsible for around
21–37 percent of total greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, which reveals it to be a major driver
of climate change, even without considering
other environmental effects.
Most global and cross-countr y valuations
of environmental impacts focus on GHG
emissions, because data limitations hamper
global cross-countr y comparisons of other
important environmental impacts related to land
use, energ y and water use. This data limitation
also affects this report’s own global analysis,
which looks at the hidden climate-change costs
by focusing exclusively on GHG emissions and
their climate impacts.

While the cost of the healthy diet is lower
than current food consumption patterns when
one considers health and climate-related
externalities, in some contexts, there are
other important indirect costs and trade-offs.
For countries where the food system not
only provides food, but also drives the rural
economy, it will be important to consider the
impact of shifting to healthy diet patterns in
terms of the livelihoods of smallholder farmers
and the rural poor as well. In these cases, care
must be taken to mitigate the negative impact
on incomes and livelihoods as food systems
transform to deliver affordable healthy diets.

The diet-related social cost of GHG emissions
related to current food consumption patterns
are estimated to be around USD 1.7 trillion for
2030 for an emissions-stabilization scenario.
Our analysis shows that adoption of any of
the four alternative healthy diet patterns that
include sustainabilit y considerations could
potentially contribute to significant reductions
of the social costs of GHG emissions, ranging
from USD 0.7 to USD 1.3 trillion across the four
diets (41–74 percent) in 2030.

Many lower-income countries, where
populations already suffer nutrient deficiencies,
may need to increase their carbon footprint
in order to first meet recommended dietar y
needs and nutrition targets, including those
on undernutrition. On the other hand, other
countries, especially upper-middle-income and
high-income countries, where diet patterns
exceed optimal energ y requirements, and where
people consume more animal source foods than

required, will need to make major changes in
their dietar y practices and food environments
as well as system-wide changes in food
production and trade.

What is driving the cost of nutritious food?
To increase the affordabilit y of healthy diets,
the cost of nutritious foods must come down.
Many factors determine the consumer price of
nutritious food, from the point of production
throughout the food supply chain, and also
within the food environment when consumers
engage with the food system to make decisions
about acquiring, preparing and consuming foods.

Food and agricultural policies also have the
power, either directly or indirectly, to affect the
cost of food. In particular, the priorities of the
food and agriculture policy framework illustrate
the difficult balancing act required when
choosing between actions in agriculture versus
other sectors; among different government
objectives (e.g. different fiscal policies);
between benefits for producers, consumers and
intermediaries; and even between different
agricultural subsectors.

Addressing low productivit y in food production
can be an effective way of raising the overall
supply of food, including nutritious foods,
by reducing food prices and rising incomes,
especially for the poorer family farmers and
smallholder producers in low-income and
lower-middle-income countries, like farmers,
pastoralists and fisherfolk. In addition to low
productivit y, insufficient diversification towards
the production of horticultural products,
leg umes, small-scale fisheries, aquaculture,
livestock and other nutritious food products also
limits the supply of diverse and nutritious foods
in markets, resulting in higher food prices.

Trade policies affect the cost and affordabilit y
of healthy diets by altering the relative prices
between imported and import-competing
foods. Protectionar y trade measures such as
import tariffs, bans and quotas – together
with input subsidy programmes – have
often been embedded in self-sufficiency and
import substitution strategies. In low-income
countries, this policy has protected and
incentivized the domestic production of
energ y-dense foods such as rice and maize,
but often at the detriment of vitamin- and
micronutrient-rich products (i.e. fruits and
vegetables). This can have an adverse effect
on the affordabilit y of more nutritious foods.
Non-tariff measures, such as sanitar y and
phyto-sanitar y measures (SPS) and technical
barriers to trade (TBT) can also negatively
affect the affordabilit y of diets, as for example,
exporters and importers may face additional
costs to comply with reg ulator y requirements,
driving up the cost of trade.

Reducing pre-har vest and post-har vest losses
in quantit y and qualit y at the production
level in the agriculture, fisheries and forestr y
sectors is an important starting point to reduce
the cost of nutritious foods along the food
supply chain, as this decreases the overall
availabilit y of these foods – while possibly
contributing to environmental sustainabilit y as
well. Another important component of market
infrastructure is the overall qualit y and efficiency
of the national road and transportation network,
which is critical in getting produce from the farm
gate to markets at reasonable cost.
| xxv |

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Subsidy levels in the food and agriculture
sectors should also be revisited, especially
in low-income countries, to avoid taxation
of nutritious foods. Policies should promote
investment in irrigation infrastructure
specifically targeting strengthened capacit y
for all-season vegetable production and other
high-value commodities to increase availabilit y
of nutritious foods. Likewise, national food
and agricultural strategies and programmes
should step up investment in research and
development (R&D) to raise productivit y
of nutritious foods and help reduce their
cost, while enhancing access to improved
technologies, especially for family farmers and
smallholder producers, to maintain adequate
levels of profitabilit y.

Last but not least, globalization has been
accompanied by a massive growth of
investments by transnational food corporations
and rapidly increasing levels of food sold
through supermarkets, referred to as the
“supermarket revolution”. These developments
represent a key aspect of the political economy
that drive food systems transformation and
inf luence the cost and affordabilit y of food.

Policies to reduce the cost of nutritious foods
and ensure affordability of healthy diets
Ten years remain to achieve the ambitious
SDG targets within the current economic, social
and political env ironment – an env ironment
increasingly v ulnerable to climate and other
shocks, not to mention the unprecedented
health, social and economic impacts of the
COV ID-19 pandemic. With this short timeline,
countries must identif y and implement critical
policy and investment changes that will
transform their current food systems to ensure
ever ybody can afford healthy diets that include
sustainabilit y considerations. Urgent action is
needed, especially for the poorest in societ y,
who face the g reatest challenges.

There is a need for stronger policies towards
more nutrition-sensitive value chains.
Key policy actions include investments in
improved storage, processing and preser vation
to retain the nutritional value of food products,
rather than investing in highly processed foods.
Improving the national road network, as well
as transport and market infrastructure, can go
a long way to ensuring greater affordabilit y
of healthy diets. In addition to food storage,
appropriate food handling and processing
facilities are central to increasing efficiencies
along the value chain for nutritious foods.

Reducing the cost of nutritious foods and
increasing the affordabilit y of healthy diets
must start with a reorientation of agricultural
priorities towards more nutrition-sensitive food
and agricultural production. Public expenditures
will need to be stepped up to enable many of the
policy decisions and investments needed to raise
productivit y, encourage diversification in food
production and ensure that nutritious foods are
made abundantly available.

Policies and investments should also focus
on reducing food losses, as this can increase
affordabilit y of nutritious foods in two ways.
First, by focusing on the earlier (production)
stages of the food supply chain, as this tends
to boost supplies and hence reduce food prices
at the farm gate. This is particularly important
for the reduction of losses in perishable
commodities, such as fruits and vegetables,
dair y, fish and meat. Second, by targeting
the parts of the food supply chain where food
losses are greatest, as this will more likely have

Policies that penalize food and agricultural
production (through direct or indirect taxation)
should be avoided, as they tend to have adverse
effects on the production of nutritious foods.

cash transfer prog rammes, but also in-kind
transfers, school feeding prog rammes and
subsidization of nutritious foods. These policies
can be particularly important in the face of
adversit y, as we are seeing today during the
COV ID-19 pandemic.

a greater impact on reducing the cost of the
targeted food item. The overall price effect will
differ from one commodit y to the next and also
across countries.
Trade and marketing policies aimed at
decreasing the cost of food to consumers, while
avoiding disincentives to the local production of
nutritious foods, are often difficult to balance.
Nevertheless, the efficiency of internal trade
and marketing mechanisms are possibly just as
important as measures to support international
trade – if not more – in determining the cost
of healthy diets for both urban and rural
consumers, while also ensuring that food safet y
standards are met.

Given different starting points and challenges
in each countr y, as well as the potential
trade-offs, a combination of complementar y
policy inter ventions towards reducing the
cost of nutritious foods, while enhancing the
affordabilit y of healthy diets is likely to be more
effective than any single policy measure.

Policies aimed at reducing poverty and income
inequality, while enhancing employment and
income-generating activities, are key to raising
people’s incomes and hence the affordability of
healthy diets. While there are important synergies
between policies enhancing employment and
reducing income inequality for increased food
security and better nutrition, including social
protection, these have been addressed in depth in
the 2019 edition of this report.
In this edition of the report, the importance of
nutrition-sensitive social protection policies is
particularly highlighted. These t y pes of policies
are most appropriate to prov ide better access to
nutritious foods to lower-income consumers and
thus increase their affordabilit y of healthy diets.
It is important to strengthen nutrition-sensitive
social protection mechanisms, ensuring they
can support micronutrient supplementation
where needed, as well as create healthy food
env ironments by encourag  consumers to
diversif y their diets to reduce dependence on
starchy staples, reduce consumption of foods
high in fats, sugars and/or salt, and include more
diverse, nutritious foods. These mechanisms
may include a number of policy tools, t y pically
| xxvii |

To achieve the healthy dietar y patterns, large
transformative changes in food systems will
be needed at all levels and it is important
to underscore that, although there are some
overlaps, these changes go beyond the policy
options and investments that are explicitly
designed and implemented to reduce the cost of
and increase the affordabilit y of healthy diets.
That is to say, other conditions must also be met,
requiring a whole range of other policies that
are more explicitly tailored to raise awareness
and inf luence consumer behaviour in favour of
healthy diets, possibly with important synergies
for environmental sustainabilit y. n

THE WORLD IN 2020
Section 1.1 presents the latest available
evidence on progress towards achieving the
hunger and food insecurit y targets (SDG 2.1).
This assessment is complemented with a first
assessment of the potential for achieving these
targets by 2030 at the global and regional levels
based on the assumption that the trends obser ved
in the last decade will continue.

In 2015, the countries of the United Nations
committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. This agenda recognized the
importance of looking beyond hunger towards
the goals of ensuring access to safe, nutritious
and sufficient food for all people all year round,
and of eradicating all forms of malnutrition
(SDG 2 Targets 2.1 and 2.2). Five years into the
2030 Agenda, it is now time to assess progress
and to question whether continuing efforts
implemented thus far will allow countries
to reach these objectives. For this reason,
this year’s report complements the usual
assessment of the state of food securit y and
nutrition in the world with projections of what
the world may look like in 2030 if trends of
the last decade continue. Importantly, as the
COV ID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, this
report attempts to foresee some of the impacts
of this global pandemic on food securit y and
nutrition. However, given that the devastation
that COV ID-19 will cause is still largely
unknown, it is important to recognize that any
assessment at this stage is subject to a high
degree of uncertaint y and should be interpreted
with caution.

Section 1.2 presents the latest fig ures on progress
towards achieving global targets for seven
nutrition indicators (including three SDG 2.2
indicators), with a spotlight on childhood
stunting. The section also provides a glimpse of
what the nutrition situation would be like in 2030
if current trends continue.
The analyses presented in Sections 1.1 and
1.2 use input data compiled up to March 2020,
but with a reference period that ends in 2019.
As such, they should be understood to represent
the food securit y and nutrition situation before
the outbreak of COV ID-19. At this stage, it
is not possible to undertake a complete and
well-informed quantification of the impact of the
COV ID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, this report
provides an assessment of how the pandemic
might affect food securit y and nutrition, within
the limitations imposed by the information that
is currently available.

Food securit y and nutrition are closely
interlinked. Food insecurit y can lead to different
manifestations of malnutrition. One vital
element that explains this connection is the
food that people eat; specifically, the qualit y
of their diet. Food insecurit y can affect diet
qualit y in different ways, potentially leading to
undernutrition as well as overweight and obesit y.
Ensuring access to a healthy diet is a prerequisite
for achieving the SDG target of eradicating all
forms of malnutrition. For this reason, this report
examines several issues related to the qualit y of
diets, including the challenges of assessment and
monitoring of food consumption and diet qualit y
at global level.

Section 1.3 describes the challenges of defining
and monitoring diet qualit y. It also presents
evidence on what people are eating around the
world including global trends in food availabilit y
and assessments of diet qualit y at the global
and national levels. It ends by examining the
important link between people’s food insecurit y
(access) and diet qualit y. This seg ues into Part
2 of this report, which scrutinizes in depth the
cost and affordabilit y of healthy diets. Section 1.4
summarizes and concludes Part 1.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

PROGRESS TOWARDS
HUNGER AND FOOD
INSECURITY TARGETS

è Considering the total affected by moderate or

1.1

severe levels of food insecurity, an estimated 2 billion
people in the world did not have regular access to
safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019.

è At the global level, the prevalence of food

insecurity at moderate or severe level, and severe level
only, is higher among women than men. The gender
gap in accessing food increased from 2018 to 2019.

KEY MESSAGES
è Updates for many countries have made it

possible to estimate hunger in the world with greater
accuracy this year. In particular, newly accessible
data enabled the revision of the entire series of
annual undernourishment estimates for China back to
2000, resulting in a substantial downward shift of the
series of the number of undernourished in the world.
Nevertheless, the revision confirms the trend reported
in past editions of this report: the number of people
affected by hunger globally has been slowly on the
rise since 2014.

è The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger

by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number of
people affected by hunger will surpass 840 million
by 2030, or 9.8 percent of the population. This is an
alarming scenario, even without taking into account
the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

è COVID-19 is expected to worsen the overall

prospects for food security and nutrition.
Pockets of food insecurity may appear in countries
and population groups that were not traditionally
affected. A preliminary assessment suggests the
pandemic may add between 83 and 132 million
people to the total number of undernourished in the
world in 2020 depending on the economic growth
scenario (losses ranging from 4.9 to 10 percentage
points in global GDP growth). The expected recovery
in 2021 would bring the number of undernourished
down, but still above what was projected in a
scenario without the pandemic.

è Current estimates are that nearly 690 million

people are hungry, or 8.9 percent of the world
population – up by 10 million people in one year and
by nearly 60 million in five years.
è Despite the re-assessment of the extent of hunger

in China, the majority of the world’s undernourished
– 381 million – are still found in Asia. More than
250 million live in Africa, where the number of
undernourished people is growing faster than in any
other region of the world.

Ten years remain to eliminate hunger
and ensure access to food for all

hunger, also shows an upward trend. In 2019, close to
750 million – or nearly one in ten people in the world
– were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity.

The assessment benefits from important updates
for several populous countries. In particular,
newly accessible data for China made it possible
to update estimates of inequalities in dietar y
energ y consumption in the countr y. This has in
turn allowed us to revise the entire prevalence of

in the world with greater accuracy (see Box 1).

and 2), show that almost 690 million people in
the world (8.9 percent of the world population)
are estimated to have been undernourished
in 2019 (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). Revision in light
of the new data, which results in a parallel
downward shift of the entire global PoU series,
confirms the conclusion of past editions of
this report: the number of people affected
by hunger in the world continues to increase
slowly. This trend started in 2014 and extends
to 2019. There are nearly 60 million more
undernourished people now than in 2014,
when the prevalence was 8.6 percent – up by
10 million people between 2018 and 2019.

The report presents an assessment through 2019
based on the data that was available in March
2020, just before the COV ID-19 pandemic began
to take hold. The challenge of eradicating hunger
and ensuring access to safe and nutritious
food for all now appears to be more daunting.
The fig ures and projections reported in this
section and in Section 1.2 provide a picture
of how food insecurit y and malnutrition in
the world would have evolved had COV ID-19
not appeared. In this sense, it is an important
assessment to be used as a baseline against
which to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on
food securit y and nutrition.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

BOX 1

UPDATED INFORMATION FOR CHINA IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF GLOBAL HUNGER ESTIMATES
was needed was reinforced further by a recent
assessment on the state of nutrition in China, the
Report on Chinese Residents’ Chronic Diseases and
Nutrition, published by the Chinese National Health
and Family Planning Commission on 30 June 2015.
The report showed considerable improvement in the
nutritional status of the Chinese population, including a
reduction of undernutrition in adults (measured as the
percentage of individuals with Body Mass Index below
18.5 kg/m2) from 8.5 percent in 2002 to 6 percent in
2012, and of stunting in children under 6 years from
16.3 percent in 2002 to 8.1 percent in 2013.11,12*
However, the data in the report could not be used
for the update, as it does not provide information on
inequality of food consumption in the population.
This year FAO obtained data from two surveys in
China that could be used to update the PoU estimates.
The first is the China Health and Nutrition Survey
(CHNS)** conducted from 1990 to 2011, covering
12 provincial-level administrative regions of China.
The second is the China Household Finance Survey
(CHFS),*** which covers 28 out of 34 provincial-level

Revising parameters to estimate the PoU is standard
procedure, conducted annually as more data become
available. This makes it impossible to compare PoU
estimates across different editions of the report (see
Box 2 and Annex 2). Even so, data are not available
to update parameters for all countries every year.
This year has been rich in updates, including
revision of the crucial parameter of inequality in
food consumption for 13 countries, among them
some of the world’s most populous. As highlighted in
previous editions, particularly problematic until this
year had been access to more recent data to revise
the parameter of inequality in food consumption for
China. Given that the country hosts one-fifth of the
world’s population, any update of Chinese parameters
can be expected to make a significant difference to
global estimates.
While still facing food security and nutrition
challenges, China has made impressive economic
and social development gains since the last update
that were not reflected in previous assessments.
Our conviction that an update of the PoU for China

administrative regions of China, and was conducted
every two years from 2011 to 2017. With these data
it was possible to update the information on inequality
of dietary energy consumption across the Chinese
population and, consequently, the estimates of the PoU
for China, and to revise the whole series back to 2000
for consistency.
Although based on different sampling frames
and designs, CHNS and CHFS provide sufficiently
reliable estimates of average food consumption and
average food expenditure, respectively, by province
and income deciles. This allowed the estimation of a
statistical function that links the daily dietary energy
consumption of typical households in China to their
monthly food expenditure. The estimated model was
then used to predict the levels of energy consumption
by income decile in each of the provinces and years
based on the reported food expenditure data in the
CHFS. The results, properly weighted by the current
population in each income decile by province, were
used to compute estimates of inequality in habitual
dietary energy consumption due to income (CV|y) in

2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. These estimates were
then used to update the series of PoU for China.****
With the revision, the estimated PoU for China in
2017 is below 2.5 percent of the population, which
is the lowest value that can be reliably reported using
the PoU methodology. Without the revision, the 2017
estimate would be close to 10 percent.
The revisions to the China series have resulted in
a new series of estimates of PoU and the number of
undernourished in the world which, reflecting new
information, are now more accurate than in the past.
The result was a substantial downward shift of the
entire series of global hunger numbers, as depicted in
Figure A. Despite this shift in levels, the revision confirms
the trend reported in past editions of this report: the
number of people affected by hunger in the world has
been slowly on the rise since 2014.
In addition to the trends on improving nutrition in
China from the 2015 report mentioned above, further
validation for the revision comes from comparing
the revised global estimates of PoU with the recent
estimates of the prevalence of severe food insecurity

based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES).
As explained in past editions of the report, the PoU
and the prevalence of severe food insecurity based
on the FIES are different, independent measures of the
extent of serious food deprivation, based on different
methods and data sources. However, they are two
complementary ways to look at the extent of hunger in
the world (see also the section on SDG Indicator 2.1.2
in this report).

The revised PoU estimates, both for the entire world
and for the world excluding China (Figure B), display
a remarkable convergence with the series of the
prevalence of severe food insecurity in 2014–2019.
This confirms the validity and urgency of the revision.
The greater concurrence of these two indicators – for
China and for the world – is a welcome step towards
a unified baseline for gauging progress on the road
towards the achievement of SDG 2.

structural imbalances and the inclusiveness of
the policy framework interact with natural and
man-made causes to trigger persisting povert y
and hunger.

increased in the last few years. Weak, stagnant
or deteriorating economic conditions are
underlying causes of increasing povert y and
undernourishment. Economic slowdowns and
downturns, particularly since the financial
crisis of 2008 –2009, have had significant
impacts on hunger through various channels.1
Despite significant progress in many of the
world’s poorest countries, and extreme povert y
rate declining in the last two decades from
more than 50 percent to about 30 percent,
almost 10 percent of the world population still
lives on USD 1.90 per day or less, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. 2
Debt has increased significantly in many poor
economies during the last decade, with total
debt reaching almost 170 percent of GDP in
2018, 3 thus contributing to rising global risks
and weakening growth prospects in many
emerging and developing economies.

The increasing frequency of extreme weather
events, altered environmental conditions,
and the associated spread of pests and
diseases over the last 15 years are factors that
contribute to vicious circles of povert y and
hunger, particularly when exacerbated by
fragile institutions, conf licts, violence and the
widespread displacement of populations. 4,5,6,7
The number of displaced people in the world in
2018 was about 70 percent higher than in 2010,
reaching some 70.8 million, mostly hosted by
developing countries. 2
Smallholder farmers and communities that rely
directly on their abilit y to produce their own
food are affected more by these phenomena.
Moreover, the prevalence of hunger is higher
in countries with fast population growth
and poor access to healthcare and education.
This establishes direct links between food
securit y, nutrition and health conditions of the
population, which in turn affect the prospects of
economic growth and development.

A high level of commodit y-export and
commodit y-import dependence is another
factor that makes several countries and
regions more v ulnerable to external shocks.
Large inequalities in the distribution of income,
assets and resources, together with the absence
of effective social protection policies, also
undermine food access, particularly for the
poor and v ulnerable. Economic conditions,

2030. Combined projections of recent trends
in the size and composition of population, in
the total food availabilit y, and in the degree of
inequalit y in food access point to an increase
of the PoU by almost 1 percentage point. As a
result, the global number of undernourished
people in 2030 would exceed 840 million
(see Box 2 and Annex 2 for a description of the
projection methodolog y).

The majorit y of undernourished people
in Africa are found in the sub-Saharan
subregion, which shows an increase of about
32 million undernourished people since 2015.
Hunger has been on the rise throughout
sub-Saharan Africa since 2014, though the
increase has been especially significant in
the Eastern and the Western subregions, as
well as in Middle Africa where it has reached
29.8 percent of the total population in 2019
(Figure 2, Tables 1 and 2).

These projections for 2030 indicate that
Target 2.1 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development – “By 2030 end hunger and
ensure access by all people, in particular
the poor and people in v ulnerable situations
including infants, to safe, nutritious and
sufficient food all year round” – will not be met
unless relevant stakeholders at all levels, from
the subnational all the way to the global level,
undertake urgent and consistent actions to
reverse the current trends. a

Economic slowdowns and downturns help
explain much of the obser ved increase in
hunger in several parts of sub-Saharan Africa,
especially in the last two to three years.
For instance, in Western Africa, recent increases
in undernourishment have occurred together
with these adverse economic factors, as has been
the case in Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau,
Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria.1

This is the projected situation in 2030 based on
trends in recent years, without considering the
unknown impact of the COV ID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic will most likely accelerate the
projected increase in the number of hungr y
people, at least in the immediate future.
This reinforces the need for urgent action to get
back on track towards achieving the Zero Hunger
goal. The possible impact of the COV ID-19
pandemic on the food securit y outlook for the
world in 2030 is discussed in Box 3.

Additionally, a number of conf licts have affected
the subregion in recent years, including in
Burundi, the Central African Republic, Côte
d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Libya, Mali, northeast Nigeria and South
Sudan. 4,8 When such disruptions persist over
long periods of time, they impair all dimensions
of food securit y, from the abilit y to access food,
to the availabilit y of supplies and the livelihoods
of rural communities, along with the production
chains that ensure the distribution of food.
Protracted instabilit y can easily destroy the
resilience of well-functioning food systems.

According to estimates, the PoU in Africa
was 19.1 percent of the population in 2019,
or more than 250 million undernourished
people, up from 17.6 percent in 2014. b This
prevalence is more than twice the world
average (8.9 percent) and is the highest among
all regions (Tables 1 and 2).

The recent rise in undernourishment in
Middle Africa and parts of Eastern Africa
results from a combination of widespread
violence in countries such as Central African
Republic and Somalia – where almost half
of the population is undernourished – and a
drop in crop yields due to climate variabilit y.
For instance, in the Great Lakes and the Horn
of Africa areas, poor yields of key products,
such as maize, sorghum and groundnuts,
have fallen further in recent years. 7
A significant presence of displaced persons
from neighbouring countries has added to
the challenges already faced by countries like
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia,
Kenya and Sudan. 4

a The last three editions of this report presented a set of responses
that are relevant going forward. The 2017 edition 4 offered concrete
recommendations for building and strengthening resilience to shield
food security from the impact of conflicts (pp. 73–75). The 2018
edition7 introduced policies and programmes to build resilience of
livelihoods and food systems to climate shocks and stresses
(pp 105–111). The 2019 edition1 presented a set of recommendations to
reduce the effects of economic vulnerability on food security and create
sustained escapes from hunger and malnutrition (pp. 102–118).
b The complete historical series of the PoU at global, regional and
country levels can be found in the FAOSTAT database (available at
www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS).

of Africa, where reduced mobilit y due to violence
has affected grazing patterns and access to land
and water. Similar occurrences have fueled
conf lict in other parts of the Sahel, for instance
in the case of Mali, where desertification is
reducing available croplands. 7

At the same time, changing environmental
conditions and competition for key resources
such as land and water, have played a significant
role in provoking violence and armed conf licts,
exacerbating the vicious circle of hunger and
povert y. The conf lict in Darfur, for instance,
is largely attributed to prolonged drought
conditions. Competition between pastoralists

In terms of outlook for 2030 (Table 1 and Figure 2),
Africa is significantly off track to achieve the
Zero Hunger target, even without considering
the impact of COV ID-19. If recent trends persist,
its PoU will increase from 19.1 to 25.7 percent.
Undernourishment is expected to worsen,
particularly in the sub-Saharan subregion.

In particular, conf licts in Syrian Arab Republic
and Yemen have increased undernourishment.
In Yemen, the economic downturn following
the conf lict that began in 2015 has resulted in
the destruction of social protection networks
and basic ser vices, contributing to critical
conditions of food securit y and nutrition.
In Syrian Arab Republic, the civil war that
started in 2011 has destroyed the economy,
infrastructures, agricultural production, food
systems and social institutions. All of this is
exacerbated by a large presence of internally
displaced populations, which is also affecting
neighbouring countries.

Despite ver y different conditions, histories and
rates of progress, the reduction in hunger in
both countries stems from long-term economic
growth, reduced inequalit y, and improved access
to basic goods and ser vices. Average GDP growth
rates were 8.6 percent and 4.5 percent in China
and India, respectively, in the last 25 years.1
In Southern Asia, significant progress was also
made in reducing hunger in the last ten years in
countries like Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
owing largely to improved economic conditions.
Conf licts and instabilit y are the primar y drivers
behind the rise in hunger seen in Western Asia.

The projections for Asia in 2030 (Tables 1, 2 and
Figure 3) show that significant progress has
been made in reducing undernourishment in
all subregions, with the exception of Western
Asia (see Box 2 for an explanation of how the
projections are made), where undernourishment
is increasing. Without considering the potential
impact of the COV ID-19 pandemic, Eastern and
Central Asia are on track to meet SDG Target
2.1 by 2030. Southern and South-eastern Asia
are making progress, but nevertheless are not on

track to achieve the target by 2030. The current
increasing trend in Western Asia is the opposite
of what is needed to achieve the target by 2030.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, the
PoU was 7.4 percent in 2019, below the world
prevalence of 8.9 percent, which still translates
into almost 48 million undernourished people.
The region has seen a rise in hunger in the past
few years, with the number of undernourished
people increasing by 9 million between 2015 and »

REVISED SERIES OF PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS UP TO 2030
world. In December 2019, a new Food Balance Sheets
domain was added to FAOSTAT with the series from
2014 to 2017. The series will be extended to 2018
for all countries by the end of 2020. Anticipating this
release, the unpublished new Food Balance Sheets
data for 50 countries in 2018 was used to update
estimates of dietary energy consumption in the
population, which informs the PoU estimates in 2018
presented in this report. The revision of the Food
Balance Sheets has been substantial for a number of
countries, pointing to even tighter food supplies in
recent years than previously thought.
Finally, as new food consumption data from
household surveys have been made available,
revised estimates of the coefficient of variation (CV)
of per capita levels of habitual, daily dietary energy
consumption in the population were considered for
a few countries and years. Since the last edition
of this report, 25 new surveys from the following
13 countries have been processed to update the CV:
Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia,
Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Peru, Sudan and Thailand. When a new estimate of
the CV from a survey is available for a country, the
whole series is revised reconnecting the last available
data point to the most recent one through linear
interpolation. For most countries, however, the latest
available survey dates back to 2014 or earlier.
When a reliable estimate of the prevalence of
severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIsev) – see next section on SDG
Indicator 2.1.2 – is available for countries, the
component of the CV of food consumption, linked to
the differences in income among households (CV|y),
is further updated. The update is based on the trend
in FIsev from 2015 or the year of the last available
food consumption survey, if the latter is more recent.
The update is made to capture recent trends in food
consumption inequality. In making the connection
between FIsev and CV, only the fraction of changes in
the PoU values that could be attributed to changes in
food consumption inequality were considered.

The PoU series is always revised prior to the
publication of each new edition of The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World. This is done to
take into account any new information that FAO has
received since the release of the previous edition.
As this process usually implies backward revisions
of the entire series, readers must avoid comparing
PoU series across different editions of this report.
They should always refer to the most current report,
including for past values. This is especially important
this year, given the significant downward revision of
the series of PoU estimates resulting from the updated
PoU for China (see Box 1).
This edition extended the projections to 2030 to
provide initial indications of whether the world was
on track to achieve the SDG target of Zero Hunger
in 2030. This was done in addition to the routine
revisions due to the processing of new data and
without anticipating the onset of COVID-19.
ROUTINE REVISIONS
One of the routine revisions involves the series
of population data used for all countries.
National population figures were obtained from
the World Population Prospects released by the
Population Division of the Department of Economic
and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat
in June 2019. It is worth noting that the new series of
population estimates present different figures also for
earlier years, as official statistical series are revised
retrospectively each time new data become available
and inconsistencies are corrected. Population figures,
in terms of age and sex composition, have several
implications for PoU estimates. They enter into the
computation of per capita levels of Dietary Energy
Supply (DES), estimates of the minimum dietary energy
requirement (MDER), estimates of the coefficient of
variation of food consumption that can be traced
to differences in energy requirements (CV|r) and
parameters that are used to calculate the number of
undernourished people. The new data from the 2019
revision of the World Population Prospects reduced
the levels of previously estimated MDER and CV|r,
resulting in a reduction in PoU levels compared with
assessments from previous years.
Another major revision that FAO regularly
implements is the update of the Food Balance Sheet
series used to estimate the average DES. Since May
2019, the Statistics Division of FAO has used improved
methods for compiling Food Balance Sheets, leading
to revised food supply series in all countries in the

PROJECTIONS
In extending the projections of the PoU to assess the
prospects for achieving the Zero Hunger target by
2030, an approach was followed based on projecting
each of the three fundamental components of the PoU
estimates separately for each country. The PoU and
number of undernourished (NoU) values were then
aggregated at the regional and global levels.

observations get older. In other words, the more recent
the observation, the higher the associated weight.
The total DES was then divided by the projected
population numbers to provide an indication of the
evolution at per capita levels.
Finally, trends in the CV as estimated from 2015
or from the date of the last available survey were
extended to 2030, following the same principle that
guided the update of the CV up to 2019.

First, projected population size and composition
(median variants), readily available from the World
Population Prospects, were used. This allowed the
projections of values of MDER and CV|r up to 2030.
Second, the current time series of total DES
from 2005 to 2017/2018 were forecast to 2030

which treats weighted averages of past observations

the highest prevalence, showed some moderate
progress in the recent past, while in Central
and South America, the situation has worsened
(Figure 4).
As in other regions, progress and setbacks
in reducing hunger are a result of economic
conditions, extreme climate events, political
instabilit y and conf licts.
In the Caribbean, the most severe conditions
are found in Haiti, which has been battered
by depletion of natural resources and
extreme weather events like droughts,
f loods, heat waves and earthquakes.
They have contributed to dire economic
conditions, widespread povert y and high
levels of undernourishment. Despite some
improvements in the last decade, about
half of the population is still estimated to
be undernourished.

The Latin America and Caribbean region
is not on track to achieve the SDG 2.1
Zero Hunger target by 2030 (Tables 1 and 2).
The region is projected to have more than
19 million more hungr y people in 2030
compared to 2019, even without considering
the likely impact of the COV ID-19 pandemic.
A 3-percentage point increase in the PoU
is projected for Central America. In South
America, the PoU is projected to increase to
7.7 percent, equal to almost 36 million people,
in 2030. The Caribbean subregion, while
making progress, is not on track to achieve
the target by 2030.

In South America, the increase in

In summar y, despite having achieved the most
progress in reducing undernourishment, Asia
is currently home to more than 55 percent
of the undernourished people in the world.
Africa has the highest PoU and the second
highest number of undernourished people,
accounting for 36.4 percent of the global total.
A much smaller share is seen in Latin America
and the Caribbean (almost 7 percent), and an
even smaller share in Oceania and other regions
(Figure 5, left chart).

Even without considering the effects of
COV ID-19, projected trends in undernourishment
would change the geographic distribution of
world hunger dramatically (Figure 5, right chart).
While Asia would still be home to almost
330 million hungr y people in 2030, its share of
the world’s hunger would shrink substantially,
thanks to progress in highly populated countries
of Eastern and Southern Asia. Africa would
overtake Asia to become the region with the
highest number of undernourished people,

HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC MAY AFFECT HUNGER IN THE WORLD
major food crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybean)
is expected to remain above average in 2020.17
But the pandemic has already created disruptions
along the food supply chain. COVID-19 containment
measures are already limiting labour mobility in areas
dependent on seasonal or migrant labour and making
it difficult to access markets and transport food both
within and across countries. Further disruptions of
logistics could disrupt the new planting seasons.
On the demand side, the massive lockdowns
across the world are expected to hamper people’s
ability to access food and create serious economic
downturns. This will make it difficult to afford food,
particularly for the poor and vulnerable groups.
Low- and middle-income countries will likely be the
most affected, as they do not have the contingency
mechanisms and funds to stimulate their economies
and protect the most vulnerable. As a consequence,
a pandemic-induced global economic crisis is likely
to generate new pockets of food insecurity even in
countries that did not require interventions previously.

This report presents projections (Figure 1) of what the
extent of hunger in the world may be in 2030, if
trends of the last decade, observed until late last year,
were to continue (see Box 2 and Annexes 1B and 2). At the
time of going to press (June 2020), the COVID-19
pandemic was spreading across the globe, clearly
posing a serious threat to food security. There is no
doubt the pandemic will expose more people to food
insecurity and accelerate the projected increase in the
number of hungry people, unless immediate actions
are taken. As the extent to which the COVID-19
pandemic will persist is not known, both in terms of
scope and severity, the projections provided here must
be seen as preliminary.
There are multiple ways in which the pandemic
may affect food systems and food security.14,15,16
It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is already
delivering shocks to both the supply and the demand
side of food systems throughout the world. On the
supply side, COVID-19 itself may not necessarily
create food shortages, as the production of the

(CONTINUED)
Estimating COVID-19’s effect on food security
comes with a high degree of uncertainty due to lack
of data and clarity about what the future of the world
economy will look like. Potential scenarios may take
different shapes, depending on the kind of policies
that will be put in place and the time they will take
to start showing their impact. At the time of writing,
a so-called “U-shaped” recovery appeared to be
more likely, which could mean a recession in 2020
followed by a recovery, whose length is uncertain, but
starting in 2021. Such a recovery is conditional on
second waves of infections not materializing or being
easily contained.
Although it is still too early to quantify the full
impact of the pandemic, this box presents the results of
a quantitative analysis of the potential consequences
in terms of the PoU, as driven by the global economic
prospects. The analysis aims to show how the scenario
described in Figure 1 might change once some of the
potential effects of COVID-19 are factored in.
Because COVID-19 is triggering shocks on both the
supply and the demand side of the global economy,
the simplest way to gauge its potential effect on the
PoU is through its impact on world economic growth.
This is done by combining data from the International
Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook (WEO)
released in April and updated in June 2020,18 with a
statistical analysis of the relationship between economic
growth and food availability. It follows the methodology
and country samples of an earlier exercise conducted
by FAO using previously available data.19,20
Based on time series of total food supplies and
GDP growth over 1995–2017 for most countries in
the world, the statistical analysis shows that GDP
growth reduction significantly affects the net food
supply in net food-importing countries, and especially
in low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs).
On average, 1 percentage point of GDP growth
reduction is estimated to reduce the food supply in
net food-importing countries by 0.06 percent in net
food-importing countries that are not low-income, and
by 0.306 percent in LIFDCs.
The IMF’s WEO forecasts a contraction of
4.9 percent in the world GDP in 2020, followed
by a recovery of 5.4 percent in 2021. It provides
country-specific estimates of GDP change in 2020
and 2021. The aforementioned elasticities estimated
by FAO were applied using the GDP growth forecasts
for 2020 and 2021 to all net food-importing countries
(distinguishing between LIFDCs and non-LIFDCs)
in order to estimate the likely shift in the series of
total Dietary Energy Supply. This is used to compute
the PoU, under three scenarios, illustrated by three
different lines in the figure presented below. The three

simulated scenarios contrast with the projections
presented in Figure 1, a world without COVID-19.
The first scenario builds on the WEO, which forecasts
world economic growth to be -4.9 percent in 2020 and
+5.4 percent in 2021, which closely approximates an
earlier forecast by IFPRI.21 It is illustrated by the orange
line in the figure. Such negative economic performance
in 2020 would imply an increase of about 83 million
undernourished in 2020 (from 695.7 to 778.3)
attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The second, less optimistic scenario (red line)
foresees 2.1 percentage points lower GDP growth both
in 2020 and 2021 compared with the base one (that
is to say, world economic growth would be on average
-7 percent and +3.3 percent in 2020 and 2021,
respectively). In such case, the increase in the number
of undernourished in 2020 would be of 103 million.
The third, more pessimistic scenario (dark red
line) implies a reduction of 5.1 percentage points
in the GDP growth rates compared to the first
scenario, thus assuming a world economic growth of
-10 percent and +0.3 percent, in 2020 and 2021
respectively. This scenario would bring the number of
undernourished up to almost 828 million in 2020, out
of which more than 132 million might be attributable
to the impact of COVID-19. The expected recovery
in 2021 would bring the number of undernourished
down to 766 million, which is 62 million more than
the already worrisome projection in the absence of the
pandemic (indicated by the yellow line).
In all cases, the world economy would not fully
recover in 2021.
The analysis is limited to the potential impact
of the pandemic on net food supplies only, as the
pre-COVID-19 projections for the population size and
compositions and for the food consumption inequality
are not altered. As a result, the analysis does not
capture the full impact of the economic recession,
as it does not consider possible consequences in
terms of inequality in food access within countries.
Therefore, it may underestimate the total potential
impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity should the
simulated economic growth scenarios materialize. It is
also important to highlight that, as presented in the
IMF’s WEO, the analysis assumes that the recovery
will happen in two years. Considering the high degree
of uncertainty around the duration of the recovery, this
represents an important limitation of this assessment.
While it cannot be considered a precise, detailed
analysis, it demonstrates that, if no action is taken
to prevent foreseeable disruptions in the world food
systems, especially in food-deficit countries, COVID-19
will further complicate the already daunting challenge
of reaching the SDG target of Zero Hunger.

Compared to SDG Indicator 2.1.1, this indicator
focuses specific attention on moderate food
insecurit y (Figure 6). As noted in the 2019 edition
of this report, people who are moderately
food insecure do not have reg ular access to
nutritious and sufficient food, even if not
necessarily suffering from hunger. This level
of food insecurit y can have negative effects
on diet qualit y (see Section 1.3) and increase
the risk of various forms of malnutrition and
poor health. This is a crucial aspect today,
when people in many parts of the world are
beginning to face the consequences of the
COV ID-19 pandemic. While FIES data have yet
to be collected in the context of the pandemic,
it is expected that some people who were
previously food secure may face new difficulties
in accessing food due to disruptions in food
distribution systems, restrictions on movement
and loss of income.

Although obtained using different data and
methods, the prevalence of severe food insecurit y

This is because people experiencing severe food
insecurit y, as measured by the FIES, are unlikely
to be able to acquire enough food to continuously
fulfil their dietar y energ y requirements.

prevalence of severe food insecurit y only, given
its expected relationship to the PoU.

Severe food insecurity
Our latest estimates suggest that 9.7 percent
of the world population (slightly less than
750 million people) was exposed to severe levels
of food insecurit y in 2019 (Tables 3 and 4).

food insecurity has increased from 2014 to

consistent with recent trends in the PoU in

Moderate or severe food insecurity

The divergence can be explained by the
different timeliness of the data used for the
analyses. While FIES data are available almost
in real-time, food consumption data are not
collected in household sur veys on a yearly basis.
As PoU estimates rely on data that refers to a
few, and sometimes several years back, they
may fail to ref lect phenomena that affect the
actual extent of inequalit y in food consumption.
When recent food consumption data are
available, the two series tend to converge
more closely.

While the 746 million people facing severe
food insecurit y are of utmost concern,
an additional 16.3 percent of the world
population, or more than 1.25 billion
people, have experienced food insecurit y
at moderate levels. The prevalence of both
moderate and severe levels of food insecurit y
(SDG Indicator 2.1.2) is estimated to be
25.9 percent in 2019 for the world as a whole.
This translates into a total of 2 billion people
(Tables 3 and 4). Total food insecurit y (moderate

or severe) has consistently increased at the
global level since 2014 (Figure 7), mostly because
of the increase in moderate food insecurit y.

is concentrated in Southern Asia where the
total prevalence of food insecurit y increased
from less than 30 percent in 2017 to more than
36 percent in 2019.

Figure 7 shows also that the prevalence of food
insecurit y (moderate or severe) is still on an
upward trend in Africa. This is explained
by the increase in the sub-Saharan region.
Although Africa is where the highest levels
of total food insecurit y are obser ved, it is
in Latin America and the Caribbean where
food insecurit y is rising the fastest: from
22.9 percent in 2014 to 31.7 percent in 2019,
due to a sharp increase in South America
(Table 3). In Asia, the percentage of people
exposed to moderate or severe food insecurit y
remained stable from 2014 to 2016, then
started increasing from 2017 on. The increase

The global crisis induced by the COV ID-19
pandemic will certainly bring these fig ures to
much higher levels, even in regions of the world
like Northern America and Europe, which have
traditionally been more food secure.
Figure 8 shows that today, out of the 2 billion
people suffering from food insecurit y, 1.03 billion
are in Asia, 675 million in Africa, 205 million in
Latin America and the Caribbean, 88 million in
Northern America and Europe and 5.9 million
in Oceania.

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

Gender differences in food insecurity

Globally, the gender gap in food insecurit y at
both moderate or severe and severe levels only
decreased slightly from 2014 to 2018. The gender
gap in food insecurit y is larger among the poorer
and less-educated strata of the population, and
for individuals who are out of the workforce,
with health problems and who live in suburbs
of large cities compared with those who live in
rural areas.

The FIES data collected annually by FAO in
more than 140 countries at the individual (rather
than household) level from 2014 to 2019 provide
a unique opportunit y to analyse the differences
in the prevalence of food insecurit y among men
and women.
Figure 9 shows the prevalence of food insecurit y
at different levels of severit y among men
and women worldwide and in all regions,
highlighting the evolution from 2014 to
2019. At the global level, the prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurit y is higher
among women than men, with significant
differences found in almost all years for Africa
and Latin America. For Northern America and
Europe, the difference is small but statistically
significant for most years. For severe food
insecurit y, the prevalence is also higher
among women than men. The differences are
statistically significant at the global level in
2019, and for Latin America in all years. At the
global level, and more markedly in Africa and
Latin America, the gender gap in accessing
food increased from 2018 to 2019, particularly
at the moderate or severe level of severit y.

These findings point to the need for a deeper
understanding of the forms of discrimination
that make access to food more difficult for
women, even when they have the same income
and education levels and live in similar areas
as men.
In summary, the continued gradual increase
in the number of hungr y and food insecure
people in most regions of the world is
alarming. It may only worsen in the face of
the COV ID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the
need to redouble efforts to achieve the SDG
targets in the ten years remaining until 2030.
The food insecurit y trends described in this
section can have nutritional consequences,
potentially leading to different manifestations
of malnutrition. The next section presents the
latest fig ures on progress towards ending all
forms of malnutrition, with projections for
2030. The section includes a special focus on
childhood stunting. n

An in-depth analysis conducted by pooling all
FIES data collected by FAO from 2014 to 2018
provides more details about the socio-economic
characteristics of individuals who lack access
to adequate food. 23 In addition to finding
that food insecurit y is more prevalent among
women, regardless of the level of severit y,
people with higher risk of food insecurit y were
those in the lowest income quintile, with lower
education, unemployed, with health problems,
living in rural areas, belonging to the age group
between 25 and 49 years old, and separated or
divorced (see Annex 2 for a description of the
methodolog y).
After controlling for socio-economic
characteristics, women still had about a
13 percent higher chance of experiencing
moderate or severe food insecurit y than men,
and close to 27 percent higher chance of being
severely food insecure at the global level.

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

PROGRESS TOWARDS
GLOBAL NUTRITION
TARGETS

è The prevalence of stunting is higher in rural

1.2

populations than in urban ones. Lower household
wealth is associated with higher levels of stunting.

è Most regions are not on track to achieve the

targets for child overweight. Adult obesity is on
the rise in all regions. The nutritional status of
the most vulnerable population groups is likely
to deteriorate further due to the health and
socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. This will
potentially have an effect on the projections
presented in this report.

KEY MESSAGES
è SDG 2 emphasizes not only the need to

ensure access to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food for all people, but also to eradicate all
forms of malnutrition. Globally, the burden of
malnutrition in all its forms remains a challenge.
According to estimates, in 2019, 21.3 percent
(144 million) of children under 5 years of age
were stunted, 6.9 percent (47 million) wasted and
5.6 percent (38.3 million) overweight.

This section presents the latest assessment
of the progress towards the global nutrition
targets, specifically Target 2.2 of the SDGs and
those endorsed by the World Health Assembly
(WHA) in 2012 to be achieved by 2025. 24 To
align with the 2030 SDG agenda, the WHA
targets were extended to 2030 (see Table 5). 25 In
addition, the WHA adopted a Global Monitoring
Framework for the Prevention and Control of
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2013.
This framework includes a target to halt the
rise in adult obesity, a nutritional risk factor for
NCDs, by 2025. 26

è The world is making progress but is not on track

to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets for child
stunting and low birthweight, and for exclusive
breastfeeding, is on track only for the 2025 target.
Childhood overweight is not improving and adult
obesity is increasing. The prevalence of wasting
is notably above the 2025 and 2030 targets.
Efforts must be intensified if the global targets are to
be attained.

In April 2016, the United Nations Decade
of Action on Nutrition (2016 –2025) 27 was
proclaimed to provide all stakeholders with a
unique opportunit y to strengthen joint efforts to
end all forms of malnutrition by 2025.

è Central Asia, Eastern Asia and the Caribbean

have the largest rates of reduction in the prevalence
of stunting and are the only subregions on track to
achieve the 2025 and 2030 stunting targets.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

The global prevalence of overweight
among children under 5 years of age has
not improved, increasing slightly from
5.3 percent in 2012 to 5.6 percent, or
38.3 million children, in 2019. 29 Urgent
efforts are needed to reverse this trend in
order to halt the rise in childhood overweight
by 2025 and achieve the target of no more
than 3 percent by 2030.

The assessment examines progress made since
the baseline (2012) and projected trajectories
towards 2025 and 2030 targets (more details are
presented in Annex 2), looking at subregional,
regional and global levels. It is based on data
available prior to the COV ID-19 pandemic, which
is likely to affect progress in the coming months,
if not years. This edition includes a spotlight on
stunting, highlighting other key factors related to
the promotion of optimal growth.

Wasting is an acute condition that can change
frequently and rapidly over the course of a
calendar year. This makes it difficult to generate
reliable trends over time with the input data
available. As such, only the most recent
global and regional estimates are reported.
Globally, 6.9 percent of children under 5
(47 million) were affected by wasting in 2019 29
– significantly above both the 2025 target
(5 percent) and the 2030 target (3 percent).

Global trends
This year’s report includes updated estimates
for four of the seven global nutrition indicators:
child stunting, wasting, overweight and exclusive
breastfeeding. Globally, progress is being made
towards stunting and exclusive breastfeeding
targets, but the pace must be increased to achieve
them by 2025 and 2030. Currently the prevalence
of child wasting is above the 5 percent target
for 2025, putting the lives of tens of millions
of children at risk in the immediate term.
The increasing trend in childhood overweight is
of great concern and must be urgently addressed.

Worldwide, 14.6 percent of infants were born
with low birthweight (less than 2 500 g) in
2015. 31 The Average Annual Rate of Reduction
(A A RR) for this indicator of 1 percent per
year shows that some progress has been made
in recent years , but not enough to achieve
the target of a 30 percent reduction in low
birthweight by 2025 (the 2030 target is the
same). If progress continues at the current rate,
the target will be achieved only in 2046.

Anaemia in women of reproductive age
(15 – 49 years) remains the most challenging
nutrition target to monitor. There are various
research initiatives to improve the evidence
base for the indicator used to assess this target.
In 2016, 32.8 percent (or 613 million) of women
of reproductive age (15 – 49 years) globally were
affected by anaemia, practically unchanged since
2012. 28,42 An update of the global estimates for
anaemia is expected in 2021. Hence, progress for
this target is not assessed in this report.

As of 2019, it was estimated that 44 percent of
infants aged less than six months globally were
exclusively breastfed. 32 The world is currently
on track to achieve the 2025 target of at least
50 percent for this indicator. If additional efforts
are not made, however, the global target for
2030 of at least 70 percent will not be achieved
before 2038.

Figure 10 summarizes progress made towards
the nutrition targets at the global level.
Worldwide, 21.3 percent of children under
5 years of age were stunted in 2019, or
144 million. 29 Although there has been some
progress, rates of stunting reduction are far
below what is needed, at 2.3 percent per year in
recent years (defined as the period from 2008 to
2019). A rate of 3.9 percent per year is required
to reach the targets of 40 percent reduction for
2025 and 50 percent reduction for 2030, starting
from the baseline year (2012). 30 If recent trends
continue, these targets will only be achieved in
2035 and 2043, respectively.

Adult obesit y continues to rise, from 11.8 percent
in 2012 to 13.1 percent in 2016 33 and is not on
track to reach the global target to halt the rise in
adult obesit y by 2025. If the prevalence continues
to increase by 2.6 percent per year, adult obesit y
will increase by 40 percent by 2025, compared to
the 2012 level.

in this section do not take into consideration

BOX 4

THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON MALNUTRITION

Although it is too early to provide evidence on the
impact of COVID-19 on the nutritional status of
populations, the pandemic is expected to increase
levels of malnutrition in all its forms in vulnerable
households. This can occur due to:



to prevent and treat malaria, diarrhoea and other
infectious diseases 35 and increased malnutrition.
Discontinuation or suspension of community-level
activities including community worker visits
to households to provide counselling and
deliver interventions, as well as cancellation of
vitamin A and vaccination campaigns and growth
monitoring and promotion events.
School closures leading to missed meals and
nutrition education normally provided through
school food and nutrition programmes.36
Deterioration of childcare practices. This could
happen because of separation of mothers/
caregivers from children due to quarantine,
self-isolation, illness or death. Diminished or
suspended breastfeeding promotion and nutrition
counselling activities, together with mothers’ fears
around COVID-19 infection may result in increased
utilization of breastmilk substitutes. It could also
spur opportunistic marketing, making the adoption
and enforcement of the International Code of
Breastmilk Substitutes even more important.37
Altered purchasing patterns favouring products with
longer shelf life and often poorer nutrition profiles,38
which could lead to higher levels of undernutrition,
as well as overweight and obesity.39,40

 An increase in food insecurity due to, for
example, disruptions along food supply chains
that complicate the transportation of food to
markets, restrictions of movement that impact the
access to markets by consumers, price increases in
particular in import-dependent countries, the loss
of jobs and incomes resulting from the economic
recession and the interruption or lack of social
protection mechanisms. Higher food prices,
especially for nutritious foods, and reduced
affordability of healthy diets can all negatively
affect nutrient intake and diet quality, and
consequently, increase the risk of malnutrition.
 Overwhelming of health systems’ capacities
to deliver curative and preventive services,
including child care and antenatal care, due
to factors such as cessation of services, health
worker illness and fatigue, scarcity of essential
medicines, and diminished access to health
services, including the loss of health insurance
coverage as well as precautionary behaviour
of families.34 In children, this can hamper the
management of wasting, which affects their
nutritional status and health, leading to higher
risk of mortality.35 At the same time many people
living with NCDs are no longer able to access
the medicines that they need.
 Possible increase in infant and young child
morbidity due to diminished healthcare resources

Social safety nets and efforts to provide accurate
information on virus transmission are key to
mitigating potential negative effects of COVID-19.
The nutritional status of the population is likely to
deteriorate due to the socio-economic impact of
COVID-19, particularly in places where health, food
and social protection programmes are fragile or
cannot be scaled up as needed.

In 2019, more than nine out of ten stunted
children lived in Africa or Asia, representing
40 percent and 54 percent of all stunted
children in the world, respectively.
Most regions have made some progress in
reducing stunting between 2012 and 2019 but
not at the rate needed to achieve the 2025 and

2030 targets. The prevalence of stunting in
sub-Saharan Africa is decreasing, but only
at half the rate needed, and is still ver y high
(31.1 percent in 2019). Moreover, the subregion
has actually seen an increase in the number of
stunted children from 51.2 million in 2012 to
52.4 million in 2019. The Central Asia, Eastern

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

MOST REGIONS ARE MAKING SOME PROGRESS, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE GLOBAL TARGETS; NO SUBREGION IS ON TRACK FOR THE LOW
BIRTHWEIGHT TARGET, AND ADULT OBESITY IS WORSENING IN ALL SUBREGIONS

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

» Asia and Caribbean subregions are on track

Most subregions are making at least some
progress towards the 2025 and 2030 targets
for exclusive breastfeeding, except Eastern
Asia and the Caribbean, the only subregions
experiencing a decline in prevalence.
Central America is nearly on track to reach
both the 2025 and the 2030 targets for exclusive
breastfeeding, missing both targets by only
one year if current trends continue. If the
Eastern Africa, Central Asia and Southern
Asia subregions maintain their current rates
of progress, they will reach the targets set for
both 2025 and 2030. The African and Asian
regions present a sustained increasing trend
in exclusive breastfeeding and are on track to
achieve the target of at least 50 percent by 2025,
but not the 2030 target of at least 70 percent
(Figure 11).

to achieve the 2025 and 2030 targets (Table 6).
If current progress continues, Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean regions will be
ver y close to achieving the targets for 2025
and 2030 (missing by only one year), while
Africa will need to triple its progress rate if
population growth continues to increase as
projected (Figure 11).
Out of the 38.3 million children who were
overweight in 2019, 24 percent lived in Africa
and 45 percent in Asia, despite these being
the regions with the lowest prevalence of
children who are overweight (4.7 percent in
Africa and 4.8 percent in Asia). Australia and
New Zealand is the only subregion with a ver y
high prevalence (20.7 percent). Southern Africa
(12.7 percent) and Northern Africa (11.3 percent)
have prevalences considered high, 41 followed
closely by Oceania (9.4 percent) and Western
Asia (8.4 percent). Australia and New Zealand
has also experienced the largest increase in
childhood overweight, followed by Oceania
(excluding Australia and New Zealand); these
subregions require concerted efforts to reverse
their rapidly rising upward trends. There has
been little or no progress to stem the rate of
overweight for most of the subregions between
2012 and 2019 (Table 6). Africa as a whole has
halted the increase in childhood overweight so
far, but increased efforts are needed to achieve
the target of 3 percent by 2030. All other regions
also require urgent action to reverse their
upward trends (Figure 11).

All subregions show increasing trends in the
prevalence of adult obesit y between 2012
and 2016. Thus, they are off track for the
target of halting the rise in obesit y by 2025.
Northern America, Western Asia and Australia
and New Zealand had the highest levels,
35.5 percent, 29.8 percent and 29.3 percent,
respectively, in 2016. Latin America and the
Caribbean as a whole and Oceania excluding
Australia and New Zealand also had levels
above 20 percent in 2016.
The assessment of child wasting is made based
on the latest estimates (2019) through a straight
comparison to the target levels of 5 percent
and 3 percent for 2025 and 2030, respectively.
The prevalence of wasting for the African
region is 6.4 percent, with only the Southern
Africa subregion having a prevalence below
5 percent. Oceania excluding Australia and
New Zealand has the highest prevalence of
wasting of all regions (9.5 percent), followed
by Asia (9.1 percent). Southern Asia, which
is home to more than half of the world’s
wasted children under 5 years of age, is the
only subregion having a high prevalence of
14.3 percent (25 million) in 2019. By contrast,
Latin America and the Caribbean is the
only region with a prevalence of wasting
(1.3 percent) already below the 2025 and 2030
targets (Figure 11).

The most recent estimates (2012–2015) indicate
that none of the regions are on track to achieve
the target of 30 percent relative reduction in the
proportion of babies born with low birthweight,
even by 2030. Notably, the Southern Asia
subregion had the highest prevalence estimate
(26.4 percent in 2015). Rates of reduction for
this indicator are ver y low for all subregions,
with a maximum A A RR of 1.2 percent per year
in Southern Asia. Moreover, recent trends
indicate no reduction in South America and a
slight increase in Australia and New Zealand

Spotlight on stunting

stunting might predispose an individual to a
more central distribution of adiposit y at later
ages, which could translate to overweight or
obesit y. The extent to which maternal obesit y
adversely affects early growth and development
of offspring might be exacerbated if the mother
was undernourished in early life, reinforcing
the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition in its
different forms. 55

Stunting, or being too short for one’s age, is
defined as length/height for age that is more than
two standard deviations below the World Health
Organization ( W HO) Child Growth Standards
median. 43 This indicator is a well-established risk
marker of poor child development. Before the
age of two years, it predicts poorer cognitive
and educational outcomes later in childhood and
adolescence, 44 and higher susceptibilit y to NCDs
in adulthood. 45 Stunting is also associated with
impaired education and economic development
at the individual, household and communit y
levels. 46 According to World Bank estimates, a
1 percent loss in adult height due to childhood
stunting is associated with a 1.4 percent loss
in economic productivit y. 47 It is estimated that
stunted children earn 20 percent less as adults
compared to children who were not stunted. 48
Stunted and wasted children also have a higher
mortalit y risk, which is further increased when
the two conditions coexist. 49

In 2019, 144 million children under 5 were
affected by stunting worldwide, a 12 percent
reduction relative to the baseline reference
year for the global nutrition targets in 2012
(164 million). Current progress is insufficient
for the world to achieve the target of 40 percent
reduction in the number of stunted children
by 2025 (98.6 million) as well as the 2030
target of 50 percent reduction (82.2 million).
Across subregions, progress in reducing
stunting between the baseline (2012) and latest
(2019) years show the disparities in terms of
acceleration required to achieve the 2025 and
2030 targets (Figure 12).

Stunting is caused by poor diets and frequent
infections. In some settings, a high proportion
of stunting has its origins in utero due
to, for example, poor maternal nutrition.
These determinants are in turn underpinned
by other socio-economic and demographic
factors. 50,51,52,c When pregnancy occurs during
adolescence, demands for ongoing maternal
growth limit the nutrients available for the fetus,
which can lead to childhood stunting. 46 Growth
failure often continues after birth, as a ref lection
of suboptimal breastfeeding practices and
inadequate complementar y feeding and control of
infection. 53 The complementar y feeding period,
generally corresponding to age 6 –24 months,
represents an important period of sensitivit y
to stunting with lifelong, possibly irreversible
consequences. 54 Therefore, focusing on the
critical 1 000-day window from conception to the
child’s second birthday is key.

The biggest challenge remains in the
sub-Saharan Africa subregion, where projected
rapid under-5 population growth would offset
the projected progress in terms of prevalence,
hampering efforts to bring down the number
of children affected. In contrast, the projected
decrease in population in Asia and in Latin
America and the Caribbean, together with
the projected decrease in prevalence, have
contributed to progress towards the target.
The prevalence of stunting is unequally
distributed across the globe, and even within
regions and subregions, with contrasting severit y
levels (Figure 13).
Globally, stunting estimates var y by wealth,
residence, age and gender (Figure 14). 56 Among
available groupings, the largest disparit y
in stunting prevalence is seen between
the poorest and richest wealth quintiles.
Children from the poorest wealth quintile
had a stunting prevalence of 43 percent,
more than double that of children from the
richest quintile. The prevalence of stunting
among children residing in rural areas was
34 percent, 1.7 times higher than children

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition early
in life may predispose children to overweight
and NCDs later in life. In some settings, early
c Socio-economic status refers to an individual’s access to social and
economic resources. It is usually measured by educational level, income
and occupation.

the poorest households in Central Asia have

The poorest in Northern Africa have a

Conceptual Framework developed by W HO, 58
a range of actions is needed, targeting the

becomes pregnant, there is competition
for nutrients between the mother and the
foetus. This can result in cessation of the
prospective mother’s linear growth and
increase her risk of stunting, and can also
lead to foetal growth restriction and low
birthweight. 46 However, many adolescents and
women cannot access healthy diets needed to
meet the demands of pregnancy, especially
in low- and middle-income countries where
numerous micronutrient deficiencies coexist.
Balanced energ y and protein supplementation
are an important intervention for the
prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes in
undernourished women. It increases birthweight

Some key evidence-based actions include:
1. Adolescent and maternal nutrition: Consistent access
to affordable foods that support healthy
diets, including food sources of vitamins and
minerals, are vital to ensure that adolescents
and women have the abilit y to maintain an
adequate diet throughout pregnancy and
lactation. Globally, approximately 11 percent
of births occur among girls between the
ages of 15 and 19 years. Adequate nutrition
before and during pregnancy is essential for
meeting maternal and foetal growth needs,
optimal birth outcomes and reducing the risk
of later NCDs. When a growing adolescent

counterparts. These price patterns are an
element of the shift of dietar y patterns
obser ved in the “nutrition transition”. 65
Thus, improving the availabilit y and
the affordabilit y of nutritious foods that
contribute to healthy diets can ensure
healthy feeding and eating habits and reduce
the risk of child stunting (see Part 2).
4. Water, sanitation and hygiene: Infectious diseases
caused by a lack of hygienic conditions and
clean water are important determinants of
child stunting. Clean and sufficient drinking
water, proper sanitation, drains for wastewater
and proper management of solid waste are key
inter ventions in deprived areas.
5. Social protection/cash transfer programmes: Social
protection schemes can improve access
to food products that are rich in protein,
vitamins and minerals that would otherwise
not be accessible to poor households.
These programmes targeted to low-income
households are more effective when coupled
with additional inter ventions or conditions
such as attending health and nutrition ser vices
and good sanitation practices.
6. Monitoring health inequalities: Monitoring stunting at
national and subnational levels is needed to
identif y geographic areas and subpopulations
where prevalence is highest. The most
affected areas and population groups should
be prioritized for inter ventions. The most
disadvantaged and v ulnerable groups are
often adolescents, women and children living
in poorest households in rural areas but also
urban areas. Addressing these inequalities
might help to prevent stunting.

by 41g and reduces the risk of stillbirths by
40 percent and small-for-gestational-age births
by 21 percent. 59 Thus, increasing daily energ y
and protein intake for pregnant women in
undernourished populations is recommended
to reduce the risk of low-birthweight neonates,
especially in highly food-insecure areas or
in populations with little access to a variety
of foods. Social protection programmes also
increase food security and reduce women’s risk
of becoming undernourished due to periods of
pregnancy and lactation. 60
2. Optimal breastfeeding practices: Early initiation and
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months
provides protection against gastrointestinal
infections, which can lead to severe nutrient
depletion and therefore stunting. 61 Breastmilk
is also a key source of nutrients during
infection. Studies in resource-poor settings
have associated non-exclusive breastfeeding
with poorer growth outcomes, because
breastmilk is replaced by less nutritious
foods or water that often also expose infants
to diarrheal infections. Similarly, continued
breastfeeding in the second year contributes
significantly to intake of key nutrients that are
lacking in low-qualit y complementar y diets in
resource-poor settings.
3. Child dietary diversification: One of the most
effective inter ventions for preventing
stunting during the complementar y feeding
period is improving the qualit y of children’s
diets. For example, the consumption of
animal source foods has been associated
with improved linear growth. 62,63 Vitamins
and minerals in the diet are also vital as they
boost immunit y and healthy development. 64
Assessments of nutrition-sensitive
agriculture inter ventions identif y dietar y
diversification and income generating
activities through family farming as likely
pathways through which agriculture and
food systems could improve nutrition and
reduce stunting. Recent analyses suggest
that households that can afford diversified
diets, including fortified complementar y
foods, experience improved nutrient
intakes and reduced stunting. 46 However,
the paradox remains that the price and
accessibilit y of these nutritious foods which
are necessar y for healthy development are
often much higher than their less nutritious

Recognizing that both the drivers and solutions
to the multiple facets of malnutrition are
intricately linked, ten “double-dut y actions”
have been identified to address the problems
of undernutrition (including stunting) and
obesit y simultaneously. 66,67 These actions include
inter ventions, programmes and policies to be
implemented at all levels of the population
– countr y, cit y, communit y, household and
individual. Several of the above recommendations
are also considered double-dut y actions
to address malnutrition in all its forms.
Other double-dut y actions include school food
programmes and policies to promote food
environments able to provide healthy diets. 67

è Only in Asia, and globally in upper-middle-income

In summar y, although countries are making
some progress, 68 they are encouraged under
the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition to
scale up and strengthen many of the above
actions to prevent stunting. 69 Many of the
above inter ventions aim to prevent stunting by
implementing strategies designed to achieve
SDG Target 2.2 to end all forms of malnutrition.
In the section that follows, the focus will be on
how healthy diets can contribute to achieve this
and other targets of the SDG agenda. n

countries, are there enough fruits and vegetables
available for human consumption to be able to meet
the FAO/WHO recommendation of consuming a
minimum of 400 g/person/day.

è Globally, only one in three children 6 to

23 months of age meets the recommended minimum
dietary diversity, with wide variation among world
regions.

è Analysis of individual- and household-level data

shows that diet quality is negatively affected by
food insecurity, even at moderate levels of severity.
People who experience moderate or severe food
insecurity consume less meat, and fewer dairy
products and fruits and vegetables, than those who
are food secure or mildly food insecure.

THE CRITICAL LINK
BETWEEN FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION OUTCOMES:
FOOD CONSUMPTION
AND DIET QUALITY
1.3

è The finding that diet quality worsens as the severity

of food insecurity increases is consistent with the
theoretical basis of the Food Insecurity Experience
Scale: that is, people experiencing moderate food
insecurity face uncertainties about their ability to
obtain food and have been forced to compromise
on the nutritional quality and/or quantity of the food
they consume. This points to cost and affordability of
nutritious foods as a key factor affecting food security
and, consequently, diet quality.

KEY MESSAGES
è Food insecurity can increase the risk of various

forms of malnutrition. One vital element that helps
explain this is the food that people eat: specifically,
the quality of diets. Food insecurity can affect diet
quality in different ways, potentially leading to
undernutrition as well as overweight and obesity.

Since 2017, The State of Food Security and
Nutrition in the World has reported on progress
made towards eliminating hunger and food
insecurit y (SDG Target 2.1), and malnutrition
in all its forms (SDG Target 2.2), presenting
evidence of the link between these two SDG
targets. As highlighted in previous editions of
this report, food insecurit y can increase the
risk of various forms of malnutrition.1,7,4 One
vital element that helps explain this is the food
that people eat: specifically, the qualit y of diets.
Food insecurit y can affect diet qualit y in different
ways, potentially leading to undernutrition,
including micronutrient deficiencies, as well as
overweight and obesit y.

è The exact make-up of a healthy diet varies

depending on individual characteristics, cultural
context, local availability of foods and dietary
customs, but the basic principles of what constitutes
a healthy diet remain the same. The unfeasibility of
defining specific foods and quantities that comprise
a healthy diet for all countries, and the lack of
cross-country comparable data on individual dietary
intake, pose challenges for global assessment of food
consumption and diet quality.

è There are large discrepancies in the per capita

availability of foods from different food groups across
different country income groups. Low-income countries
rely more on staple foods, and less on fruits and
vegetables and animal source foods than
high-income countries.

Healthy diets are a prerequisite to achieving
many SDGs and global nutrition targets. 70
However, global monitoring of diet qualit y
poses multiple challenges. While there are
evidence-based g uiding principles for healthy
| 40 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

diets, it has been difficult to develop valid
food- or diet-related metrics of diet qualit y for
global monitoring because of the rich variet y of
foods consumed and dietar y patterns obser ved
worldwide. Existing metrics are relatively new
and have not yet been applied widely enough
to provide global data or are specific only to a
single population group. The scarcit y of data
on what people are eating – especially data
that are comparable across countries – adds
to the challenge of monitoring trends in diet
qualit y worldwide.

while simultaneously addressing multiple
forms of malnutrition through the adoption of
double-duty actions (see Section 1.2). 66 Actions
and policies aimed at ensuring food security
must also focus on increasing access to nutritious
foods that contribute to healthy diets in order to
combat all forms of malnutrition.

A healthy diet is guided by basic principles
that can be put into practice in multiple ways
Diet qualit y comprises four key aspects:
variet y/diversit y (within and across food
groups), adequacy (sufficiency of nutrients or
food groups compared with requirements),
moderation (foods and nutrients that should be
consumed with restraint) and overall balance
(composition of macronutrient intake). 72
Exposure to food safet y hazards is another
important qualit y aspect. According to W HO,
a healthy diet protects against malnutrition
in all its forms, as well as non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease,
stroke and cancer. 73 It contains a balanced,
diverse and appropriate selection of foods
eaten over a period of time. A healthy diet
ensures that a person’s needs for macronutrients
(proteins, fats and carbohydrates including
dietar y fibres) and essential micronutrients
(vitamins and minerals) are met, specific to
their gender, age, physical activit y level and
physiological state. Healthy diets include less
than 30 percent of total energ y intake from
fats, with a shift in fat consumption away
from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and
the elimination of industrial trans fats; less
than 10 percent of total energ y intake from
free sugars (preferably less than 5 percent);
consumption of at least 400 g of fruits and
vegetables per day; and not more than 5 g per
day of salt (to be iodized). 73 While the exact
make-up of a healthy diet varies depending
on these individual characteristics, as well as
cultural context, locally available foods and
dietar y customs, these basic principles of what
constitutes a healthy diet are the same (Box 5).

After describing some of these challenges in
monitoring diet qualit y globally, this section
presents evidence on global trends in availabilit y
of food for human consumption and assessments
of diet qualit y at the global and national levels.
The important link between food insecurit y and
diet qualit y is also examined.

The evolving view of diet in the food security
and nutrition debate
In the mid-twentieth centur y, food securit y
inter ventions focused on agricultural production
strategies to increase food supplies and meet
dietar y energ y needs. Production of staple foods
was emphasized, t ypically with less attention
given to the nutritional diet qualit y.
In the decades that followed, awareness grew
that this focus was largely misg uided. The real
problem was that many people did not have
year-round access to safe, affordable healthy diets
in sufficient quantit y necessar y to support health
and well-being. 71 The nutrient adequacy of diets
became a central element of food securit y and
nutrition programmes.
As the centur y drew to a close, it became
increasingly evident that food insecurity was
associated not only with undernutrition, but
often with overweight and obesity, as well,
particularly in upper middle- and high-income
countries. This put a spotlight on additional
aspects of diet quality in the food security
and nutrition policy debate. Consequently,
inter ventions and policies have shifted from
closing the dietar y energ y gap to making healthy
diets more widely available and affordable,

The changes needed across food systems
and beyond to promote healthy diets var y
considerably depending on the context.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR HEALTHY DIETS

Healthy diets:74
 include safe and clean drinking water as the fluid
of choice;
 are adequate (i.e. reaching but not exceeding
needs) in energy and nutrients for growth and
development, and to meet the needs for an active
and healthy life across the life cycle;
 are consistent with WHO guidelines to reduce the
risk of diet-related NCDs, and ensure health and
well-being for the general population;73
 contain minimal levels, or none if possible, of
pathogens, toxins and other agents that can cause
foodborne disease.

 start early in life with early initiation of
breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding until six
months of age, and continued breastfeeding until
two years and beyond, combined with appropriate
complementary feeding;
 are based on a great variety of unprocessed or
minimally processed foods, balanced across food
groups, while restricting highly processed food and
drink products;*
 include wholegrains, legumes, nuts and an
abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables;**
 can include moderate amounts of eggs, dairy,
poultry and fish; and small amounts of red meat;

* Food processing can be beneficial for the promotion of high-quality diets; it can make food more available as well as safer. However, some forms of processing can lead to very high
densities of salt, added free sugars and saturated or trans fats and these products, when consumed in high amounts, can undermine diet quality. 75
** Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots are not classified as fruits or vegetables.

profiles, as well as food habits and customs,
livelihoods, ecosystems and food supply chains.
While science provides quantified nutrient intake
requirements for different population groups,
there are myriad ways in which individual foods
from various food groups can be combined
within diets to meet these requirements.
For these reasons, while the basic principles
for healthy diets in Box 5 apply to all countries,
it is not feasible to define a single healthy diet
for all countries to follow, in terms of specific
foods and quantities. Rather, each countr y must
translate the basic principles for healthy diets
into specific g uidelines for their populations
to follow. Accordingly, a growing number of
countries have established national food-based
dietar y g uidelines (FBDGs), with dietar y
recommendations that are appropriate for their
unique contexts. Some countries also address
food combinations (meals), eating modalities,
food safet y considerations, lifest yle and
sustainabilit y aspects in their FBDGs.

The examples of FBDGs from Australia, China
and Thailand in Figure 16 illustrate how the
application of the principles for healthy diets
can differ from one countr y to another. 76,77,d
Each countr y’s FBDGs are based on foods
that are available, accessible and culturally
appropriate for their population. These are
used to construct recommended diet patterns
that meet nutrient intake requirements, in
addition to other principles for healthy diets,
and address the countr y’s main nutrition
concerns. Even though all three countries are in
the Asia-Pacific region, they present important
differences and nuances. The graphic chosen
by each countr y corresponds to an image
that is culturally relevant for the population.
When the three sets of FBDGs are compared by
looking at the percentage weight contribution
of each food group to the total diet based
on recommendations, three differences are
evident: the way the foods are grouped; the

In light of these trends, it is therefore crucial

and nutrition problems, food availabilit y, eating
patterns and food cultures that are specific to
each countr y (see Annex 2 for more detail and
Annex 4, Table A4.1 for additional examples of
quantified national FBDGs).
When national FBDGs include quantitative
recommendations, they can also be
used as a tool to assess adherence to the
g uidelines in a given population (see Box 6).
Quantitative recommendations facilitate the use
of FBDGs for other research purposes, as well:
the analysis of the cost and affordabilit y of diets
presented in Section 2.1 is an example (see Box 11
and Annex 4). At this time, however, only about a

Trends in food available for human
consumption and aspects of diet quality
in the world: a look at the evidence through
different lenses
Global assessment of food consumption and
diet qualit y poses many challenges. To date
there is no single, validated composite index
to measure the multiple dimensions of diet
qualit y mentioned above across all countries:
variet y/diversit y; adequacy; moderation; and
overall balance. Alternative approaches used to
assess the diet qualit y of populations include
use of measures that capture a single facet
of diet qualit y such as dietar y diversit y, 72 or
consumption of food groups, single foods or food
components whose intake should be increased
or limited to protect health. 72,85 An additional
challenge is the lack of robust, cross-countr y
comparable data on individual dietar y intake
worldwide. 86 In its absence, different sources of
data may be used for global assessment of food
and nutrient intake and diet qualit y, each with
certain strengths and limitations (see Annex 2).

While each countr y must define the best way
to translate the basic principles for healthy
diets into FBDGs appropriate for its own
context, there have been efforts in recent
years to define theoretical global healthy
diet patterns (see Section 2.2). This is for the
purpose of researching global dietar y intake
patterns and their relationship to health and
environmental outcomes, and of enabling
cross-countr y comparisons.
As the concept of healthy diets evolved with
growing knowledge about the impacts of diets
on health outcomes, the impacts of diets on
the environment have come under increasing
scrutiny. A growing body of scientific
evidence reveals how the way we produce and
consume food is taking a toll on the natural
resource base and contributing to greenhouse
gas emissions (see Section 2.2). 81,74,82 The
environmental and health impacts will increase
if trends in diet and population growth
continue. 83 As populations become more
aff luent and urbanized, they demand more
food, particularly more meat, fish, dair y, eggs,
sugar, fats and oils, 84 which can contribute to
higher risk of diet-related diseases as well as
greater environmental impacts, for example
those associated with consumption of animal
source foods. In addition, projected population

An added issue which hampers comparabilit y
of dietar y estimates and recommendations
from different studies and countries is the
use of different food group classifications
and the total number of food groups used.
Classification of foods into food groups can
be done based on different aspects, such
as the nutritional profiles of foods (e.g.
protein-rich), purpose of the analysis (e.g.
identif y vitamin A and iron-rich foods), and
botanical definition and their common use
(e.g. tomatoes and eggplants are consumed
as vegetables, but botanically they are
fruits). Furthermore, imposing a classification
on already existing data is circumscribed by
the granularit y of the data. For example, it
is not possible to identif y highly processed
foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt using

HOW DO CURRENT CONSUMPTION PATTERNS COMPARE WITH NATIONAL FOOD-BASED DIETARY
GUIDELINES RECOMMENDATIONS? CASE STUDY FROM BELGIUM

covering ten cities in nine countries found that
adolescents ate half of the recommended amount of
fruits and vegetables and less than two-thirds of the
recommended amount of milk (and dairy products),
but consumed much more meat (and meat products),
fats and foods and drinks containing high amounts of
sugars than recommended. Nonetheless, median total
daily energy intake was estimated to be nearly in line
with the recommendations.79
Some countries have developed a Healthy Eating
Index (HEI) based on their FBDGs, by converting
their FBDGs messages into a score which is used to
monitor diet quality over time. However, since an
HEI needs to be developed, validated and updated
whenever the FBDGs are revised, these indices are
not very common, and currently not available for any
lower-middle-income countries. In their absence, a
“snapshot” comparing the current diet and FBDGs, as
presented here for Belgium, can be very useful.

To help guide daily food choices, some FBDGs include
recommended dietary intake patterns expressed as
servings (often in grams) to be consumed from each
food group per day by age and sex group. In such
cases, if individual food consumption data are
available for a given country, the adherence to FBDGs
can be evaluated for specific population groups.
The image on the left side of the figure below
shows the pyramid graphic chosen by Belgium to
communicate the recommendations in its national
FBDGs. The image on the right compares the mean
habitual food consumption of 14–17 year-olds in
Belgium taken from the 2014–2015 National Food
Consumption Survey with the FBDGs recommendations
for this age group.78
Looking at the graphic, it is evident that adolescents
in Belgium are eating much less than the recommended
amount for most food groups. This pattern is similar
to that found in other European countries. A study

» Food Balance Sheets or Supply and Utilization

2000 –2017. e The contribution of all food groups
(combined into 7 groupings) to total food and
dietar y energ y supply in 2017 is also presented
by countr y income group. The novelty of this
analysis is three-pronged. First, it uses SUA
data instead of FBS data. Second, foods are
classified into food groups on the basis of their
nutritional relevance following the classifications
used in the FAO/WHO Global Individual Food
consumption data Tool (GIFT) 89 instead of the
FBS classification. Third, food quantities are
adjusted for losses that may occur up to the retail
level and for non-edible portions. This is done
to estimate quantities that are closer to what
people may actually be consuming. The estimates
presented reflect food available (edible quantities)
for human consumption. Thus, they are likely
to be higher than actual individual intake (see
Annex 2 and Gheri et al. (forthcoming) 90 for an
expanded description of the methodolog y, results
and limitations of SUA and FBS data).

Accounts data. The remainder of this section
and Part 2 present various analyses which
rely on slightly different food groupings.
Nevertheless, each analysis is based on a
relevant food group classification according to
the study purpose and the t ype of data used.

Trends in global and regional food availability
Data on food availabilit y from FAO Food
Balance Sheets (FBS) have been widely used
by economists, researchers and policymakers
as a prox y of national average food
consumption. They are used to identif y ver y
broad aspects of dietar y patterns across the
world. In fact, for some countries, particularly
low-income nations, FBS may be the only data
source available for this purpose.
FAO has put together FBS annually for most
countries and territories since 1961. The balance
sheets 87,88 are compiled from Supply and
Utilization Accounts (SUA), which are detailed
lists of over 400 food and agricultural items.
The availabilit y estimates are produced by
balancing the data on a countr y’s food supply
(production, imports and opening stocks)
against its food utilization (exports, availabilit y
for consumption, seeds, feed, post-har vest
losses, other utilizations and closing stocks).
The FBS provide information on quantities
expressed in terms of primar y equivalents for
crops, livestock products and fish commodities .
SUA provide more granular information of
official or assessed quantities of commercialized
food products. However, both FBS and SUA
data provide information on food availabilit y
only at the national, aggregate level. They do
not provide information on actual individual
food or nutrient intake, or the distribution of
access to the food available by the different
population groups. In some cases, national SUA,
as well as FBS, might not ref lect production
from some small farms or private households.
Therefore, these caveats should be carefully
considered when using and interpreting FBS
and SUA data.

Low-income and lower-middle-income countries
rely heavily on staple foods like cereals, roots,
tubers and plantains. The availability of staple
foods for the world has changed little between
2000 and 2017 (Figure 17). There were modest
fluctuations in the availability of cereals across
regions and country income groups. In 2017, cereal
availability was highest in lower-middle-income
countries (391 g/capita/day), and lowest in
high-income countries (259 g/capita/day).
Availability of roots, tubers and plantains
increased in lower-middle-income countries,
driven by a rise in Africa. It decreased in
high-income countries, due primarily to
reductions in Northern America and Europe.
The global availability of pulses, seeds and nuts
increased 24 percent from 2000 to 2017, with the
largest increases in low- and lower-middle-income
countries (Figure 18).
Only upper-middle-income countries and Asia
have enough fruits and vegetables available
to meet the FAO/W HO recommendation of
consuming a minimum of 400 g per day. 91,92
e Geographical regions were defined according to the United
Nations Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49
standard) classification,131 while countries were classified into four
country income groups (high-income countries, upper-middle-income
countries, lower-middle-income countries and low-income countries)
using the World Bank classification for the 2020 year.132

In the analysis below, SUA data are used to
depict trends in availability of 10 selected
food groups, and 3 meat subgroups, by region
and by countr y income group for the years

From 2000 to 2017, the availabilit y of fruits
and vegetables in Africa increased from
167 to 191 g/capita/day. In low-income
countries it grew from 121 to 142 g/capita/day.
However, the total amounts available in Africa
and low-income countries fall far short of the
400 g/capita/day consumption target. In 2017,
Asia was the only region with enough fruits and
vegetables available to meet the recommended
amount (470 g/capita/day). However, even if
the per capita availabilit y appears to cover the
recommended consumption at the population
level, there is no assurance that consumption is
distributed in a manner that satisfies the needs
of all individuals.

In 2000, in all regions, availabilit y of fruits and
vegetables for human consumption was below
400 g/capita/day. Out of all countr y income
groups, only upper-middle-income countries
surpassed that mark. Between the years 2000
and 2017, the world average availabilit y of fruits
and vegetables increased from 306 to 390 g/
capita/day (Figure 17). Upper-middle-income
countries showed the highest percentage
change increase (50 percent) in total fruits and
vegetables available. These countries had a
notably higher total combined availabilit y of
fruits and vegetables (645 g/capita/day) than the
other countr y income groups. For high-income
countries, availabilit y of fruits and vegetables has
declined slightly over time.

Increased availability of meat, which likely
reflects increasing demand, may have positive or
negative implications for health depending on the
context. For poor and vulnerable people in most
low-income countries, and for population groups
with higher nutrient requirements, such as infants
and women of reproductive age, a small increase
in meat and other animal source foods can greatly
improve the nutritional adequacy of their diets,
because they are good sources of quality protein
and important micronutrients.95 However, a
high consumption of red and processed meat
| 49 |

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

can contribute to high saturated fat and/or salt
intakes, and is associated with higher risk of
certain types of cancer and other diet-related
NCDs. 93,96 Furthermore, diets high in animal
source foods, particularly beef, lamb, milk and
other dairy products have a higher environmental
impact than plant-based diets (see Section 2.2).

In low-income countries, cereals, roots, tubers
and plantains represent nearly 60 percent
of all food available (by weight) in 2017.
This percentage decreases gradually with
countr y income groups, down to 22 percent
in high-income countries. Likewise, the
contribution from animal source foods (fish,
meat, eggs and dair y), in percentage of weight,
varies with the countr y income group. It is higher
in high-income countries (29 percent) compared
to upper-middle- and lower-middle-income
countries (20 percent), and lowest in low-income
countries (11 percent).

The availability of sugars and fats is highest in
high-income countries, but the largest increases
were seen in upper-middle-income countries.
Availability of fats and oils increased steadily
for all regions and country income groups from
2000 to 2017 (see Figure 19). The highest increases
were observed in upper-middle-income countries.
High-income countries had the highest availability
over time, but the smallest increase in percentage
change. Looking at sugars and sweeteners, the
availability in high-income countries (109 g/
capita/day or 39.8 kg/capita/year) was double that
of upper- and lower-middle-income countries
in 2017, and four times the amount available in
low-income countries.

The SUA data that informs the above analyses
ref lect food availabilit y for human consumption
up to 2017. As such, this analysis does not
factor in the effects of the COV ID-19 pandemic
on food availabilit y. Box 7 summarizes some
of the potential ways in which the COV ID-19
pandemic is likely to impact the availabilit y of
nutritious foods and, consequently, diet qualit y of
the population.

The findings presented in Figures 17, 18 and 19 are
in line with other empirical evidence that shows
that in recent decades, diets, particularly from
upper-middle-income countries, have shifted
away from staples towards more animal source
foods, sugars, fats and oils. 84,97

These analyses of national level food availabilit y
provide indirect information on trends in diet
qualit y over time and across regions and countr y
income groups. But it is information derived
from actual food consumption and nutrient
intake data – when available – that allows
detailed assessments of diet qualit y in different
populations. Indicators of dietar y diversit y like
those used in the following section, compiled
from such data, are an increasingly valuable
component of the evidence base.

Food groups available for consumption differ
across countr y income groups. At the global
level, in 2017, cereals, roots, tubers and plantains
represent the highest contribution to the total
food available for human consumption, both
in terms of edible quantities (34 percent)
and dietar y energ y (51 percent) (Figure 20).
Globally, and in all countr y income groups
dietar y energ y availabilit y has increased since
2000, with high-income countries showing
the smallest increase (not shown). Fruits and
vegetables represent the second-most available
food group (in percentage of weight), whereas
their contribution to total dietar y energ y
availabilit y is small (6 percent globally), which
is to be expected as they tend to be low in
dietar y energ y. Conversely, sugars and fats
are the second-highest group in terms of
total dietar y energ y contribution, but they
represent a relatively small fraction in terms of
quantit y available.

Dietary diversity of young children and women
A key element of diet qualit y is dietar y
diversit y, or the variet y of foods from different
food groups that make up the diet. Eating a
larger variet y of foods tends to increase the
chances that a person will consume adequate
amounts of different nutrients necessar y
for their overall health and well-being.
Several tools for measuring dietar y diversit y
have been developed for specific populations,
including the Minimum Dietar y Diversit y
for Women (MDD-W) indicator (Box 8) and
the Minimum Dietar y Diversit y (MDD)
indicator for infants and young children.
The latter is used for the global assessment
below. The data that inform such indicators

POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS
FOODS AND OVERALL DIET QUALITY
milk and other dairy products. Fresh produce, in
particular, often requires many people to work in
close proximity to cultivate, harvest and process.
The crowded working conditions that characterize
most dairy and meat processing plants also pose
a challenge for meeting physical distancing needs.
In addition, these perishable foods need to be
moved quickly from farm to consumers, which makes
them more vulnerable to travel restrictions and
market shutdowns.
 Closure of informal markets may exacerbate
the increasing inaccessibility of nutritious foods.
In addition to their social and cultural importance,
informal markets support healthy, nutritious diets
as well as livelihoods of poorer population groups.
The fresh foods sold in supermarkets and formal
markets are often less affordable or inaccessible to
urban poor groups.
 Highly processed, packaged foods that tend to
be high in fats, sugars and/or salt are often less
expensive than fresh and nutritious foods, especially
in high- and upper-middle-income countries.103
The lower price and the longer shelf life, coupled
with limited access to fresh and nutritious foods,
suggests that highly processed food products may
be consumed in higher amounts leading to lower
diet quality.104

Besides directly threatening people’s health and
well-being through viral infection, the COVID-19
pandemic will also impact access to nutritious foods
and overall diet quality through social and economic
channels and disruptions in food systems. Some of the
likely impact channels include the following:
 The economic fallout may reduce purchasing
power for sufficient, safe and nutritious foods,
particularly for informal day labourers.98 Migrants
and their families will lose purchasing power
due to the reduced flow of remittances, mostly
used to purchase food.99 Women,100 youth101 and
persons with disabilities102 will likely be much more
affected, given that they are already disadvantaged
in accessing economic and financial resources.
In addition, restrictions in personal movement may
decrease access to food even for those who have
the economic means to obtain it.
 The economic impact of the pandemic may have
more negative impacts on diet quality than on
quantity, as grain supplies do not appear to be
at risk. This is because their production is less
labour-intensive and they can be stored for longer
periods. Demand for staple foods has traditionally
been less sensitive to price change than that of
fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products.
 In many countries, suppression measures like physical
distancing requirements and restrictions on movement
are affecting the production and transportation
of high-value, labour intensive, perishable and
nutritious foods, such as fruits and vegetables, meat,

The extent of the economic fallout and impact of
physical distancing requirements is not yet known.
The short-, medium- and long-term risks to food access
and diet quality are yet to be fully understood.

and Nigeria (2018) have reported the most recent
available results.111,112,113 The table in this box shows
the percentage of women aged 15–49 years meeting
MDD-W (≥5 food groups) in these three countries
according to area of residence (urban/rural) and
wealth quintile. Overall, 50 percent of women in
Nepal achieved minimum dietary diversity; the figures
for Nigeria and Tajikistan were 56 percent and
80 percent, respectively. A higher percentage of urban
residents achieved minimum dietary diversity than their
rural counterparts.
Foods from the “grains, white roots and tubers,
and plantains” group were consumed most.
Over 98 percent of the women in all three countries
reported eating them. At least 70 percent of women
in Nigeria and Tajikistan reported consuming food
from the “meat, poultry and fish” group, compared
with only 35 percent in Nepal. The percentage of
women reporting consumption of “dark green leafy
vegetables” was highest in Nigeria (72.7 percent)
and lowest in Tajikistan (18.7 percent). For “other
vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables” the percentage
was highest in Tajikistan (59.9 percent). For “other
fruits”, the percentage was lowest in Nigeria
(35.7 percent).

The Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W)
indicator is a proxy that reflects dietary diversity and
micronutrient adequacy for women of reproductive
age.109 It is calculated by counting how many out of
ten defined food groups* have been consumed over
the previous 24 hours. If foods from five or more of
these food groups have been consumed, minimum
dietary diversity – which is associated with a greater
chance of adequate intake of 11 micronutrients – is
considered to be achieved.110 Since the launch of
the MDD-W in 2015, ten countries have collected
nationally representative MDD-W data and many
others have used it for research or impact evaluation
at subnational level. The MDD-W indicator is one
of the World Food Programme’s (WFP) corporate
indicators for stunting prevention and nutrition-sensitive
programming in specific contexts. In 2018, there were
data available for programmes in 29 countries.**
In 2019, it was decided that the MDD-W would be
included as a core indicator in the Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) Programme, which currently
covers 90 countries.
Before this decision was taken, however, a few
countries had already included the MDD-W in their
national DHS. Nepal (2016), Tajikistan (2017)

substantially increase the likelihood of having an adequate micronutrient intake. Super cereal and other specialized nutritious foods, for example, are provided to pregnant and
lactating women who receive food assistance or are targeted by social protection programmes.114

The MDD indicator f refers to the percentage of
children 6 –23 months of age who have consumed
the recommended minimum number (five) of
the following eight food groups: breastmilk;
grains, roots and tubers; leg umes and nuts;
dair y products (infant formula, milk, yog urt,
cheese); f lesh foods (meat, fish, poultr y and
liver/organ meats); eggs; vitamin-A rich fruits
and vegetables; and other fruits and vegetables.
A prox y for the nutrient content of foods
consumed by infants and young children, it is
an indicator in the Global Nutrition Monitoring
Framework for tracking progress towards W H A
global nutrition targets for 2025 and 2030 SDG
targets. Information on dietar y diversit y can
be collected by simply asking about a child’s
consumption of foods from the different food
groups during the previous 24 hours, as is
done in the Demographic and Health Sur veys
and the UNICEF Multiple-Indicator Cluster
Sur veys. The data can also be constructed
using 24-hour dietar y recall data, as long as
foods can be grouped into the standard groups
listed above. UNICEF has been collecting data
and maintaining a database on children’s diets
since the early 1990s when the initial set of
global standard indicators were established.
Indicators assessing the qualit y of children’s diets
such as MDD were developed relatively recently
(2008 –2010) and have been included in global

How does food insecurity affect
what people eat?
Households and individuals that experience
food insecurit y face uncertainties about their
abilit y to obtain enough safe and nutritious
foods for an active and healthy life, due to lack
of money or other resources. As a consequence,
they may have poorer diets than those that are
food secure or only mildly food insecure.

of food insecurit y based on the analysis of food
securit y and food consumption data from two
lower-middle-income countries, Kenya and
Sudan, and two upper-middle-income countries,
Mexico and Samoa. g Population average estimates
of usual consumption for 11 food groups and
of total dietar y energ y are computed for each
food insecurit y class. The food groupings
were defined on the basis of their nutritional
relevance following the classifications used in
the FAO/W HO GIFT, 89 with some exceptions.
Only statistically significant results are reported. h »

Much of the existing evidence highlighting
the association between household food
insecurit y levels and dietar y outcomes comes
from Northern and Latin America and is based
on data collected using experience-based
food insecurit y measures similar to the FIES.
Studies from different countries have shown
that both dietar y diversit y and consumption of
nutritious foods, such as fruits, vegetables, dair y
and meat, tend to worsen as food insecurit y
becomes more severe.115,116,117,118,119 Preliminar y
analysis of FIES data, combined with data
collected using new cross-countr y comparable
metrics of diet qualit y, point to a similar
association (Box 9). The body of evidence that is
comparable across countries is growing as more
countries include the FIES, or compatible scales,
in national population-based sur veys that also
collect food consumption data.

g The four surveys are nationally representative and include either the
FIES (Kenya, Samoa and Sudan) or the ELCSA (Latin America and
Caribbean Food Security Scale), which is a similar experience-based
food insecurity measure (Mexico). The mean consumption (per capita
per day) was estimated for a selection of 11 food groups, along with
the dietary energy for all food groups. For the analysis of dietary
energy with HCES data (Kenya, Sudan and Samoa) only food items
reported in terms of quantities were considered; food items reported
only as expenditure (e.g. lunch consumed away from home) were
excluded. In the analysis of dietary energy with Mexico ENSANUT
2012 (individual dietary intake data), all items were considered.

The analysis presented below expands on
previous studies by considering cross-countr y
comparable measures of food insecurit y that
are calibrated against the global FIES scale.
It explores dietar y patterns according to levels

h Regression analyses are followed by Tukey’s pairwise post-hoc tests
to determine whether there was a difference between the mean of all
possible pairs, except for Samoa, where differences across groups
were assessed with regression analysis only.

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FOOD INSECURITY BASED ON THE FIES AND DIET QUALITY BASED
ON NEW METRICS: EVIDENCE FROM GHANA AND THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
between food security status and diet quality (see
Annex 2 for more details). The models controlled
for household size, age, gender, marital status,
education and income.
In both countries, those who are food insecure
consume less diverse diets and fewer nutritious
foods that contribute to healthy diets. Diet quality
worsens with increasing severity of food insecurity.
In addition, food insecure individuals in these two
countries are also less likely to consume dietary
components that should be limited, such as highly
processed, energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars
and/or salt. In other countries that have different
socio-economic contexts, food insecurity could
be associated with greater consumption of these
foods. All three indicators of diet quality are
important to monitor, especially in light of evidence
pointing to dietary and nutrition transitions and
the multiple burden of malnutrition in lower-middle
and upper-middle-income countries.122 In the United
Republic of Tanzania, gender is also associated with
differences in diet quality. Women consumed less
diverse diets, fewer nutritious foods and also fewer
energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt
than men.****
In summary, the findings show that in both
countries, food insecurity is associated with lower
diet quality in terms of both food group diversity and
nutritious foods. In the United Republic of Tanzania,
being female is associated with the same reduction in
diet quality.

As mentioned at the beginning of Section 1.3, diet
quality is a multifaceted construct, comprising diversity,
adequacy, moderation and overall balance. A Diet
Quality Questionnaire (DQ-Q) has been developed
with the aim of measuring diet quality at the
population level in a way that is comparable across
countries.121 It takes five minutes or less to administer.
It is designed to gather data on consumption of food
groups, which is then used to create a suite of healthy
diet indicators.
Three of the indicators of diet quality, described
in greater detail in Annex 2, are:
 Food Group Diversity Score (FGDS)
 Score of consumption of nutritious foods that
contribute to healthy diets (FLAVOURS)
 Score of consumption of dietary components that
should be limited or avoided (FAD)
The FGDS reflects dietary diversity for the general
population.* The other two indicators reflect the
likelihood of meeting current WHO global dietary
recommendations.** These indicators can be used to
identify problem areas of diets at the population level,
such as too-low consumption of fruits and vegetables,
whole grains, legumes, nuts and dietary fibre
(FLAVOURS), or excessive intake of free sugars, salt,
total fat and saturated fat (FAD).
In 2019, the Gallup© World Poll (GWP)
implemented both the DQ-Q and the FIES in Ghana
and United Republic of Tanzania.*** Preliminary
analyses are presented here to assess the association

* FGDS uses the same ten food groups as the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of reproductive age (MDD-W).
** These recommendations are based on WHO (2018) 73 in addition to IARC (2018).123
*** The DQ-Q was implemented as part of the Global Diet Quality Project, which aims to measure diet quality across countries globally through the Gallup © World Poll (GWP). The DQ-Q
survey module can be adopted and implemented by other survey mechanisms, enabling capacity for diet quality monitoring at country level.
**** In Ghana, there is no notable association between gender and diet quality; being female is associated with only slightly higher diet diversity.

» In Kenya, Samoa and Sudan, food consumption

In Kenya and Sudan, those who experience
moderate food insecurit y consume lower
quantities of all food groups than those who are
food secure – with the exception of cereals in
both countries and fish in Kenya – and have a
lower dietar y energ y intake. People experiencing
severe food insecurit y consume lower quantities
of roots, tubers and plantains, dair y, vegetables,
fats and oils, sweets and sugars (Kenya and
Sudan), cereals, fruits, eggs and fish (Kenya)
than those who are moderately food insecure.
In Kenya, food insecure people consume a
slightly higher amount of fish, compared with
those who are food secure. This could be
explained by the fact that subsistence fishing is
practiced by some of the poorest and most food
insecure communities in the countr y.124

information was collected at the household level
in Household Consumption and Expenditure
Sur veys (HCES). i In Mexico, it was captured at
the individual level using an individual-level
food consumption sur vey. Individual-level
sur veys provide detailed quantitative individual
food and nutrient intake information that can
be disaggregated at many levels (e.g. sex and
age). Due to their high cost and complexit y,
the number of recent, nationally representative
sur veys is relatively small. Food consumption
data from HCES, on the other hand, are more
widely available, across countries and over time.
However, HCES are not purposefully designed to
capture food consumption. Instead, they provide
information at the household level, albeit not for
individual household members. For this reason,
while the food insecurit y status in the analysis
that follows is comparable across countries, the
food consumption levels should be compared
with caution (see Annex 2 and Alvarez-Sanchez
et al. [forthcoming]120 for a full description of the
methodolog y and the results).

In Mexico and Samoa, notable variations in the
diet are also obser ved between the food secure
and the food insecure groups, but they follow a
different pattern than Kenya and Sudan. As food
insecurit y becomes more severe, dietar y energ y
intake remains relatively stable in Samoa and
declines less markedly in Mexico compared
to Kenya and Sudan. There is a reduction in
the consumption of some animal source foods
(such as dair y and meat), but minimal change
(or even an increase) in the consumption
of some plant-based foods (such as cereals,
roots, tubers and plantains, pulses, seeds and
nuts, and vegetables) and sweets and sugars.
In Mexico, fruit consumption decreases with
food insecurit y, whereas in Samoa it increases.
Conversely, consumption of eggs in Mexico is
higher for those who are food insecure.

Overall, the analysis reveals that people who
experience moderate or severe food insecurit y
consume less meat and dair y products (in all four
countries) and less fruits and vegetables (Kenya
and Sudan) than those who are food secure or
mildly food insecure (from here on, referred to as
“food secure”) (Figure 24). Consumption of cereals,
roots, tubers and plantains, and pulses, seeds and
nuts either decreases slightly, remains similar,
or increases, resulting in a higher proportional
contribution of these food groups to the total
diet. The more food insecure people are, the
larger the share of staples in their diet. This holds
true even if food insecure people in Kenya and
Sudan reduce their consumption of staples,
because they reduce consumption of other food
groups even more.

The finding that diet qualit y worsens with
increasing severit y of food insecurit y is
consistent with the theoretical construct of
food insecurit y on which the FIES is based:
people experiencing moderate food insecurit y
face uncertainties about their abilit y to obtain
food and have been forced to compromise on
the nutritional qualit y and/or quantit y of the
food they consume. On the other hand, people
experiencing severe food insecurit y have
t y pically run out of food and, at worst, gone one
or more days without eating.125
»

i The three HCES used in this analysis (from Kenya, Samoa and
Sudan) collected information on food consumed at the household level
(i.e. apparently consumed; this may include food waste at the
household level). This is in contrast to the individual-level food
consumption survey from Mexico that collected information on
individuals’ food intake (i.e. food ested). However, for simplicity,
herein, we use the term “consumption” to refer to food estimates and
“intake” to refer to dietary energy estimates, from both household and
individual-level data. Our use of the term “consumption” differs from
that of economists who refer to “consumption” as food and non-food
expenditures.133

NOTES: Food consumption estimates shown for selected food groups only. In Kenya, Sudan and Samoa, food insecurity was measured with the FIES, and food group and dietary energy
consumption were calculated excluding food items reported only in terms of monetary value (with no food quantities attached). In Samoa, the prevalence of severe food insecurity was
very low, thus, the prevalences of moderate and severe food insecurity were combined. In Mexico, food insecurity was measured with the “Escala Latinoamericana y Caribeña de
Seguridad Alimentaria” (ELCSA), and food group and dietary energy consumption were calculated considering all food items. For details about the food groupings, see Annex 2.

PART 1 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD IN 2020

» The ways in which moderately food insecure

moderately food insecure people is smaller in
Mexico and Samoa than in Kenya and Sudan is
that Mexico and Samoa are well into the nutrition
transition, which is characterized by a rapid shift
in diet composition towards a higher intake of
highly processed, energ y-dense foods that have
minimal nutritional value and are cheap and
widely available. 97

people modif y their diets var y according to
the income level of the countr y. In the two
lower-middle-income countries studied (Kenya
and Sudan), there is a marked decrease in
consumption of most food groups, and an
increase in the share of staples in the diet.
In the two upper-middle-income countries
examined (Mexico and Samoa), people who
are moderately food insecure consume more
foods that are t y pically cheaper on a per-calorie
basis (cereals, roots, tubers and plantains), and
consume lesser amounts of expensive foods
(meat and dair y), compared with those who
are food secure. Mexico in particular shows a
decrease in fruit and dair y consumption as the
severit y of food insecurit y increases. This is in
line with studies that show that the purchase of
fruits and milk is sensitive to changes in income
and prices.126 The increase in fruit consumption
with worsening food insecurit y in Samoa may
be explained by the fact that those who are
food insecure consume more fruits from their
own-production instead of purchasing it.127

As more countries collect good qualit y
household- or individual-level food securit y
and food consumption data, this analysis can
be expanded to shed more light on the links
between food insecurit y and diet qualit y
around the world. Combined with ongoing
efforts to develop national FBDGs and address
the challenges of global monitoring of diet
qualit y, more and better evidence will soon be
available to g uide actions aimed at g uaranteeing
universal access to enough nutritious foods for
healthy diets. n

1.4

There are several plausible reasons why food
insecurity, as measured by experience-based
scales like the FIES, may contribute to different
dietary outcomes in lower-middle- and
upper-middle-income countries, to the extent
that these countries may be exemplary of other
countries in the same income-level groups.
First, healthy diets may generally be less affordable
in lower-middle-income countries than in
upper-middle-income countries. As discussed
in Section 2.1 of this report, healthy diets are
unaffordable to many people, especially the
poor, in every region of the world. Second, social
protection programmes may receive less funding
in lower-middle-income countries.128 Lastly,
vulnerable people’s access to food, especially
perishable nutritious foods, may be more
compromised in lower-middle-income countries
than in upper-middle-income countries, due to lack
of physical infrastructure and food processing and
storage technology, as well as food safety issues.129
Problems like these associated with the food
supply chain tend to drive up the cost of nutritious
foods, as discussed in Section 2.3 of this report.

CONCLUSIONS

With ten years to go until 2030, the world is off
track to achieve the SDG targets for hunger and
malnutrition. After decades of long decline, the
number of people suffering from hunger has
been slowly increasing since 2014. The trends
shown by the prevalence of undernourishment
and the prevalence of severe food insecurit y
based on the FIES both point to failed progress.
Beyond hunger, a growing number of people
have been forced to compromise on the qualit y
and/or quantit y of the food they consume, as
ref lected in the increase in moderate or severe
food insecurit y since 2014. Projections for 2030,
even without considering the potential impact of
COV ID-19, ser ve as a warning that the current
level of effort is not enough to reach Zero Hunger
ten years from now.
As for nutrition, progress is being made on
decreasing child stunting and low birthweight
and increasing exclusive breastfeeding for the
first six months of life. However, prevalence of
wasting is notably above the targets and the
prevalence of both child overweight and adult
obesit y is increasing in almost all regions, a
worrisome trend that will add to the global
burden of disease and increase public health

Worldwide, less than a third of young children

and nutrient needs.

ser vice and health care costs. These trends in
hunger, food insecurit y and malnutrition must
be reversed. COV ID-19 is expected to exacerbate
these trends, rendering v ulnerable people even
more v ulnerable. Urgent action is needed in order
to meet the 2030 targets, even as the world braces
for the impact of the pandemic.

The qualit y of people’s diets worsens with
increasing constraints on their access to food,
putting them at higher risk of undernutrition as
well as overweight and obesit y. Among other
factors, cost is a key determinant of access to
food. Part 2 of this report sheds light on how
food prices and affordabilit y of diets contribute
to food insecurit y and inequalities in diet
qualit y. It also maps out actions needed to
reshape food systems in ways that g uarantee
universal access to enough nutritious foods
that contribute to healthy diets. The remaining
years of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition
2016 –2025 present an opportunit y for
policymakers, civil societ y and the private
sector to work together and accelerate efforts.
There is still time to get back on track towards
achieving Zero Hunger and ending all forms of
malnutrition by 2030. n

Increasing availabilit y of and access to
nutritious foods that make up healthy diets
must be a key component of stronger efforts
to achieve the 2030 targets. The availabilit y of
dietar y energ y per person has increased globally
over the past two decades. However, this has
not translated into an increase in the availabilit y
of nutritious foods that contribute to healthy
diets. There are large discrepancies in the per
capita availabilit y of foods from different food
groups across countries of different income
levels. Low-income countries rely more on
staple foods and less on fruits and vegetables
and animal source foods than high-income
countries. An increase in per capita availabilit y
of fruits and vegetables has been obser ved
since 2000. And yet, according to the analysis
presented, only upper-middle-income countries

TRANSFORMING FOOD

DIETS FOR ALL
Policies that aimed to increase food availabilit y
and energ y intake with less focus on improving
the qualit y of the food have long been a key
element of the efforts to end hunger. But this
paradigm is changing. The prevailing strateg y
to end hunger and eliminate malnutrition must
address other multifaceted challenges: i) there
are multiple burdens of malnutrition; ii) food
policies have overemphasized calories and
protein quantit y, neglecting a wider range of
dietar y qualit y required for people’s health and
development; and iii) any approach to addressing
hunger and all forms of malnutrition must also
consider the sustainabilit y of food systems.

A healthy diet ensures adequate calories and
nutrients. It includes a balanced, diverse intake
of foods from several different food groups. It is
intended to meet all requirements of nutrient
adequacy and help prevent malnutrition in
all its forms, as well as NCDs. Diet qualit y is
an important link between food securit y and
nutrition outcomes and is a crucial part of all
efforts to achieve the hunger, food securit y and
nutrition targets of SDG 2. Meeting these targets
will only be possible if people have enough food
to eat and what they are eating is nutritious.
One of the biggest challenges of achieving this,
is the cost and affordabilit y of healthy diets.
New evidence presented in this part of the
report shows that healthy diets are unaffordable
for many people in ever y region of the world,
especially for the poor and those facing economic
challenges. Evidence presented in this part of the
report also demonstrates that the higher cost and
unaffordabilit y of healthy diets is associated with
increased food insecurit y and different forms
of malnutrition, including stunting and adult
obesit y. Shocks, like the COV ID-19 pandemic,
exacerbate this because they negatively affect
poor people’s qualit y of diet and make healthy
diets less accessible in many parts of the world.

As shown in Part 1 of this report, most countries
are not on track to meet the SDG 2 targets to
end hunger and food insecurit y (SDG Target 2.1)
and all forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2)
by 2030. The COV ID-19 pandemic will make it
more difficult to get back on track. Part 1 shows
that undernourishment and food insecurit y are
not the only challenges, but also overweight and
obesit y and other forms of malnutrition. In this
respect, food and diet qualit y is a critical link
between food securit y and nutrition outcomes, in
all its forms, particularly overweight and obesit y.
No doubt, the link should be strengthened to
achieve SDG 2.

The stor y does not end there. There are also
hidden costs and externalities associated
with current food consumption patterns,
notably those related to the health and
environmental consequences of our dietar y
choices. They increase the costs of dealing
with health problems and adverse effects of
climate variabilit y, among other environmental
challenges. However, these costs are not
ref lected in the price of foods and diet.

The health impacts associated with poor qualit y
diets are significant. Unhealthy diets are a
leading cause of non-communicable diseases
(NCDs), mainly cardiovascular diseases,
cancers and diabetes, that result in death.1 Both
overweight and obesit y are significant risk
factors for NCDs, and increasing healthcare costs
linked to rising obesit y rates are a trend across
the world. Out of 56.9 million deaths globally
in 2016, 40.5 million deaths, or 71 percent,
were attributable to NCDs. 2

AROUND THE WORLD

These issues must be considered within the
context of a world where hunger continues
to increase, 2 billion people experience food
insecurit y, and the burden of malnutrition in all
its forms remains a challenge. With just a decade
away from the endpoint of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development (2015 –2030) and with
only five years remaining in the UN Decade of
Action on Nutrition (2016 –2025), hard questions
remain. How can the world end hunger and
all forms of malnutrition, while transforming
food systems to provide affordable healthy
diets for all? How can the remaining years of
the Decade of Action on Nutrition be leveraged
to accelerate action? What are the costs and
trade-offs of actions? This part of the report
provides new evidence that addresses these
important questions and identifies the main
drivers that make access to affordable healthy
diets challenging. Further, this part of the report
also identifies the main drivers behind the high
cost of nutritious foods and provides g uidance on
policy and investments for countries to transform
their food systems to provide access to affordable
healthy diets for ever yone, while tackling
trade-offs and making the most of synergies for
environmental sustainabilit y. n

2.1

KEY MESSAGES
è While we still face significant challenges in just

accessing food, challenges are even more important
in terms of accessing healthy diets. One of the biggest
challenges is the current cost and unaffordability of
healthy diets.

è Analyses conducted for this report show that

healthy diets cost 60 percent more than diets that
only meet the requirements for essential nutrients and
almost 5 times as much as diets that meet only the
dietary energy needs through a starchy staple.

è The cost of a diet increases incrementally as the

diet quality increases – from a basic energy sufficient
diet to a nutrient adequate diet and then to a healthy
diet including more diversified and desirable food
groups – across all regions and country income
groups globally.

è The high cost and unaffordability of healthy diets

is associated with increasing food insecurity and
different forms of malnutrition, including child stunting
and adult obesity.

è The unaffordability of healthy diets is due to their

high costs relative to people’s incomes, a problem
likely to be exacerbated by COVID-19.

è Healthy diets – that reflect global guidelines and

include foods from several groups and have greater

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

diversity within food groups – are unaffordable
for more than 3 billion people, and more than
1.5 billion people cannot even afford a diet that only
meets required levels of essential nutrients.

What does the evidence tell us?
The cost and affordabilit y of the foods that
form a healthy diet are important determinants
of food choices. As such, they can affect food
securit y, nutrition and health. The cost refers
to what people have to pay to secure a specific
diet. Affordabilit y, on the other hand, is the cost
of the diet relative to income. j Evidence shows
that the cost and affordabilit y of a diet is linked
to the qualit y of the diet, and to food securit y
and nutrition outcomes. 3,4,5,6,7

è Most of the people who cannot afford healthy

diets live in Asia (1.9 billion) and Africa (965 million).
Many others live in Latin America and the Caribbean
(104.2 million), with the fewest in Northern America
and Europe (18 million).

è The cost of a healthy diet is much higher than the

Over weight and obesit y are the outcomes of a
my riad of socio-economic factors along with
childhood undernutrition. k However, there is
strong ev idence that the higher prices of healthy
food options – and cheaper, less nutritious food
options – are contributing to the g rowing trend
of over weigth and obesit y. Changes in relative
prices between energ y-dense foods of minimal
nutritional value and nutritious foods also make
a difference. The strongest effects are seen
among people struggling on low incomes, who
are most sensitive to and most affected by the
cost of food. 8

international poverty line, established at USD 1.90
purchasing power parity (PPP) per day. This puts
healthy diets beyond the reach of those living in
poverty or just above the poverty line.

è The cost of a healthy diet exceeds average food

expenditures in most countries in the Global South.
More than 57 percent or more of the population
throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia
cannot afford a healthy diet.

è The challenges are greater for countries with a

protracted crisis situation. While the cost of a healthy
diet in these countries is comparable to the global
average, 86 percent of the population in these
countries cannot afford it. This is more than double the
world average figure (38 percent) and is 57 percent
higher than what is estimated for the Global South.

A recent global study comparing the relative
caloric unit costs of nutritious foods and
energ y-dense foods that are high in fat, sugar
and/or salt l has found that food price variation
helps explain international patterns in child
stunting and adult overweight and obesit y. 7
The relative cheapness of these energ y-dense
foods was found to be positively associated with
excess body weight in adults. There was a strong
link between the overweight prevalence among
adults and low prices of sugar, as well as foods
and drinks containing high amounts of sugars.
This is consistent with a growing literature
linking the consumption of these products to
weight gain. 9,10

è Food systems transformation is required to

address the problem of millions of people not being
able to afford healthy diets because of high food
price and income constraints. At the same time,
this transformation should create supportive food
environments, encourage people to learn about
nutrition and spur behaviour change that can lead to
healthy food choices.

Cost and affordability of healthy diets are
critical for food security and nutrition

j In this report the cost of a diet refers to the sum of the value of all the
food items that make up the diet. The value, in turn, is the price per unit
for each food item multiplied by the quantity of the food item.

The world faces immediate challenges in making
healthy diets accessible for ever yone, an essential
requirement in meeting the hunger and nutrition
targets of SDG 2. The COV ID-19 pandemic has
made the situation even more difficult. One of
the biggest challenges is the current cost and
unaffordabilit y of healthy diets.

k Evidence points to the fact that childhood undernutrition also
increases the risk of later overweight and obesity. See, for example,
Wells et al. (2020).338
l Associations between relative calorie prices (RCPs) for sugar, soft
drinks, oils/fats and salty snacks and adult overweight prevalences
revealed statistically significant coefficients for all four energy-dense
foods, although the associations are stronger for sugar and soft drink
prices.7

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

These results not only apply to high-income
countries but also to lower-middle and
low-income countries, where overweight and
obesit y are a per vasive and growing problem.
Income growth of countries is associated
with lower levels of stunting, as well as with
increases in overweight and obesit y.11
The relative inexpensiveness of energ y-dense
foods high in fat, sugar and salt is implicated
in high rates of obesit y. This is seen in
high-income countries 12 as well as in
transitional economies, such as China, India
and urban Africa. New research also shows that
overweight increases in lower-middle-income
countries are mainly due to ver y rapid
changes in food systems, particularly the
availabilit y of cheap, highly processed food and
sugar-sweetened beverages.13

Similarly, African countries, represented by
blue dots in Figure 25D, report the highest rates of
stunting associated with higher unaffordabilit y
of healthy diets (with few exceptions).
The association between adult obesit y and
affordabilit y of a healthy diet is the inverse of
the other associations. High-income countries
have the highest affordabilit y fig ures of the
healthy diets and, at the same time, the highest
rates of adult obesit y. Likewise, Latin America
and the Caribbean have also among the highest
adult obesit y rates, although with slightly
higher unaffordabilit y (Figure 25E-F), as the cost
of the healthy diet in this area is higher than
the average in high-income countries (USD 3.98
vs. USD 3.43). In fact, results in these regions
align with recent research on the different
stages of the so-called “obesit y transition”,
in which as countries develop and GDP per
capita grows, the prevalence of overweight and
obesit y increases substantially. However, this
picture hides demographic and socio-economic
differences within countries and, over time,
different groups are affected. Where cheap
energ y-dense foods of minimal nutritional
value are available, the poor will buy these
foods, as healthy diets are still too expensive for
them. 20,21 Many high-income countries, notably
the United States of America and Europe,
have for some time been in that stage of the
“obesit y-transition” where the prevalence of
obesit y among those with lower socio-economic
status surpasses that of those with higher
socio-economic status. However, it should be
noted that, although this is not the only variable
that inf luences weight gain, the focus of this
report remains on the cost and affordabilit y.

Recent evidence shows that reductions in
child stunting, which also reduces the risk
of overweight and obesit y, are associated
with lower relative prices of fresh cow’s milk,
eggs, meat, fish and fortified infant foods. 7,14
However, evidence is not conclusive and
additional studies are needed, including the
potential nutritional impacts of eggs and cow’s
milk in key target groups.15,16,17,18,19
New analysis in this report provides further
evidence of the association between cost and
affordabilit y of a healthy diet (see Box 10 for
definition and Annex 3 for the methodolog y of
the healthy diet) and food securit y and nutrition
outcomes. m It shows that, across regions and
countr y income groups, the more unaffordable
a healthy diet is, the greater the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU) and child stunting
becomes (Figure 25). Regional differences
and development context matter, however.
Looking at countr y income groups in Figure 25A,
we see that high-income countries, mainly
representing Europe and Northern America,
are concentrated in the bottom left of the
graph, denoting average lower levels of
undernourishment and higher affordabilit y
of healthy diets than in other countries.

How do costs and affordability of diets constrain
access to food?
Cost and affordabilit y measure one aspect of
food systems, namely the degree to which food
choices are constrained by food prices and
household (or per capita) income. Of all the
barriers to food access, cost and affordabilit y are
among the most important, particularly in the
case of nutritious food. 22,23 According to FAO
and W HO (2019), 24 “Sociocultural aspects of
food choice notwithstanding, people generally
eat what they can afford.”

NOTES: The figure shows simple regression analysis between the PoU, child stunting and adult obesity (vertical axis), and the unaffordability of a healthy diet (horizontal axis) by
country income group and region. Higher values on the horizontal axis reflect higher levels of unaffordability of the healthy diet expressed as a percentage of average country food
expenditures measured in year 2017. All variables are expressed in logarithms. For each country, the most recent data on child stunting available between year 2014 and 2019 are
used, whereas the PoU refers to year 2017 and adult obesity refers to year 2016. The R-squared denotes the percent of the variance in the variable on the vertical axis explained by
affordability of the diet. See Box 10 for the definition of the healthy diet and Boxes 11 and 12 for the cost and affordability methodology. For the full methodological notes and data

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

» Access to food is generally determined by

Once food access is assured, food choices can
be determined by other individually modifiable
factors, such as time and convenience, nutrition
knowledge, n tastes and habits. These are shaped
by the food environment, including marketing,
advertising, labelling and other forms of
promotion, as well as social factors and forces
outside the food system, such as gender equalit y,
child care, intra-household allocation, housing
and transportation. 26 For example, a food
preparer’s time and the cost of fuel and water are
all required for food preparation. Social barriers
are also important in some societies where
certain groups are prohibited from consuming
particular foods.

physical access (e.g. own production, distance
to markets, availabilit y in markets, natural
resources and biodiversit y that provide wild
foods) and economic or financial access (e.g.
purchasing power, access to credit). In some
circumstances social access (e.g. abilit y to secure
food through social networks, based on extended
family, ethnicit y, religion or political affiliation)
may substitute for financial and physical access.
Globally, enough food is being produced
or in stock to meet dietar y energ y needs.
Nonetheless, both food availabilit y and food
access var y across regions and countr y income
groups, especially with regards to foods that
contribute to a healthy diet. Although food
systems facilitate food availabilit y in markets at
all levels, there are still physical, economic and
social barriers that prevent many people from
having sustainable access to food for an active
and healthy life. Physical barriers may include
poor road infrastructure, or simply the absence
of transport and the long distances required to
reach marketplaces.

How do food prices and income affect the choice
and consumption of foods?
To understand the effect of prices and income on
the consumption of healthy diets, it is important
to consider the extent to which the quantit y of
food consumed shifts in response to price and
income changes. This extent of response, or
elasticit y, describes the percentage change in the
demand of a given food item after a percentage
change in its price or a person’s income.
Generally, there is a negative association between
food prices and the quantit y of food demanded,
while the association is positive between income
and the quantit y of food demanded.

During the COV ID-19 outbreak, for example,
food has been by and large available. However, it
remains to be seen to what extent, over time,
food supply chains remain undisrupted and
prices generally unaffected; countries can
continue to import food; and food consumption
of v ulnerable populations is not compromised
due to income losses and the containment
measures enacted by governments around the
world. All of this could potentially translate into
problems of food availabilit y and access, but
information is too scarce at the time of writing to
draw conclusions. The next editions of this report
will monitor and analyse the future implications.

Own-price elasticities refer to changes in
demand for an item based on a change in its
price, and they are generally negative. o The
degree to which quantit y goes down varies,
however. For example, usually staple cereals
are considered a necessar y good, so these
goods have inelastic demand (i.e. they are
more price inelastic). An increase or decrease
n For example, studies show that women’s nutritional knowledge
plays a key role in nutritional outcomes of their children (see
Maitra 344 for a detailed review). Women’s decision-making power is
also crucial: in developing countries, they generally take on a more
active role than men in providing nutrients to children through
food.345 If women were given equal decision-making power as men
in the home concerning food, it is estimated that child malnutrition
could decrease by 13 percent.346 Research has shown that if women
can gain increased control of household income, other beneficial
outcomes in addition to improving children’s well-being, such as
improved education and overall household economic security, can
be achieved.347

To reiterate, what people eat depends on what is
available and what they can afford – a function
of the cost of food and incomes. 25 Once food
is available, food choices are the result of
the interaction between incomes, prices and
preferences, whereby higher incomes and lower
prices provide for more choices, allowing people
to consume more and diverse foods. Affordabilit y
is also a relative concept that encompasses
the market price of a food in relation to other
household expenses and household income.

o One exception is a Giffen good: this is a special case, under rare
circumstances, where people consume more of a food as the price rises
and vice versa.

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

in the price of cereal would not alter demand
for cereals by much compared with other food
items. There are also cross-price elasticities,
in which the demand for one item changes in
response to a change in the price of another
item, if these items are either substitutes or
complements. Income elasticities of demand
define the extent to which demand changes due
to income changes.

products in the same food categor y, which reduce
the average own price response of the product
categor y (Annex 5, Table A5.1). 30,31
Food consumption is generally inelastic with
regard to income, although large differences
exist as income elasticities of demand tend to
be higher in countries where income per capita
is relatively lower (Figure 26). Within countries,
it is possible to see high income elasticities
of demand in poorer segments of the
population, even in high-income countries.
There are also considerable differences in
income responsiveness across food items.
Demand for food staples, such as grains, is
generally less elastic than demand for fruits
and vegetables or meat and dair y products.

The own-price and cross-price elasticities
and income elasticities of demand for any
particular set of foods ref lect a combination of
substitution effects (e.g. substituting potatoes
for rice when the price of rice increases) and
income effects (e.g. consuming more of other
foods when the price of all starchy staples
decreases). For example, if the price of basic
staples declines, the reduction in the cost of
a basic diet comprising those staples frees up
money to buy more expensive foods. It translates
into a higher real income level, all other things
remaining constant. These concepts are critical to
understanding how the cost and affordabilit y of
foods affect people’s diets.

Price elasticities tend to increase for countries
with lower economic development, meaning
that increases in the price of all foods result
in greater reductions in food consumption in
poor countries (Annex 5, Table A5. 2 ). 28 Studies for
high-income countries and emerging economies
show that people living on low incomes are most
likely to respond to changing prices. 8 Changes
in food prices had the largest own-price effects
in low-income countries. Cross-price effects
were more varied and were found to reinforce,
undermine or alleviate the own-price effects,
depending on countr y income group. 29,32,33,34

The price and income elasticities of demand
for staple foods are known to be ver y small
and not significantly different from zero at
least in the short term. 27 Even large swings
in prices or incomes are not associated with
significant changes in total calories of staple
foods consumed. However, the short-term
response of dietar y intake to changes in price and
income does affect diet composition, as people
will substitute among foods to meet their daily
energ y needs.

Looking at income elasticities, a rise in income
leads to a rise in consumption of nutritious
foods, such as fruits and vegetables. 35 Income
elasticities for animal source foods, as well
as fruits and vegetables, are positive and
virtually always greater than for grains and
tubers. Nutritious foods, such as horticultural
products, meat and dair y, have a high income
elasticit y of demand in poor countries, such as
those in sub-Saharan Africa. In general terms,
these food items are less affordable than staple
foods. In fact, staple foods, such as cereals, have
smaller demand responses to income changes
than high-valued food items, such as meat, fish
and dair y. 3,28,36

Price elasticities for nutritious foods are larger
than for basic staples. 28,29 This is due to both
substitution and income effects. A meta-analysis
shows that a 10 percent increase in the price
of fruits and vegetables is associated with an
average reduction in their consumption by
6.1 percent, while a 10 percent increase in the
price of cereals is associated with an average
decrease in cereal consumption of 5.2 percent. 30
Furthermore, it is shown that price elasticities
estimated at the product level (e.g. apples) tend to
be higher in absolute terms than those estimated
for broader product categories (e.g. fruits). This
might be due to substitution possibilities between

In low- and middle-income countries, high
socio-economic status or living in urban areas is
associated with some elements of healthy dietar y
patterns, including higher intakes of fruits and

Healthy diets are unaffordable for many
people in all regions of the world, especially
the poor

vegetables, better diet qualit y, increased dietar y
diversit y and higher vitamin and mineral intakes.
However, high socio-economic status or living
in urban areas was also found to be related to
higher energ y, cholesterol and saturated fat
intakes due to concurrent consumption of highly
processed foods. 37

Evidence of cost comparisons of individual food
items and/or food groups from existing studies
indicates that the cost of nutritious foods,
such as fruits, vegetables and animal source
foods, is t y pically higher than the cost of more
energ y-dense foods high in fat, sugar and/or salt,
and higher than the cost of starchy staples, oils
and sugars. However, these costs var y across the
world and by a countr y’s gross national income
per capita. 4,39,40

In summar y, lowering food prices – which can
potentially result from changes triggered by
both supply 38 and demand – is not likely to affect
demand for calories, but which food prices are
lowered will have a large impact on consumption
choices. That is, the cost of nutritious foods
specifically is important in understanding
economic access to healthy diets. This cost is
proving too high for many people to afford, as
shall be seen next.

The relative prices of nutritious foods and
energ y-dense foods with minimal nutritional
value have also been shown to differ
| 71 |

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

systematically across income levels and
reg ions. 7,14 Most noncereal foods are relatively
cheap in high-income countries, including
sugar- and fat-rich foods. In lower-income
countries, nutrient-rich or fortified foods are
generally expensive, especially most animal
source foods and fortified infant foods.
Prices for vegetables and animal source foods
are shown to be systematically higher than
prices of starchy staples around the world. 7,14

This report bridges some of these knowledge
gaps. It offers new analysis on the cost and
affordabilit y of diets of increasing diet qualit y
around the world, by region and different
development contexts. Three diets are simulated
in order to determine the affordabilit y of three
levels of increasing diet qualit y, starting from a
basic energ y sufficient diet meeting calorie needs
to a nutrient adequate diet, and then to a healthy
diet, including an estimation of recommended
intake of more diversified and desirable food
groups. A full description of the three diets is
provided in Box 10.

Studies have also shown that the relative
caloric unit costs of most nutritious foods
are substantially higher in poorer countries,
although there are some exceptions. 7,41 Moreover,
the cost of nutritious foods tends to var y more
across geographic locations. Nutritious foods
are often highly perishable and less tradable.
As such, their prices are largely determined by
local productivit y and value chain efficiency,
including transport and cold chains. 7,42

The cost and affordabilit y analysis of the three
diets aims to answer three questions: i) what is
the cost and affordabilit y of the three different
levels of diet qualit y? ii) what is the relative
difference in cost and affordabilit y moving
from a diet that is energ y sufficient to one that
is nutrient adequate and then to one that is
healthy? iii) how many people are unable to
afford each t y pe of diet and where are they in
the world? The analysis explores these questions
from a global, regional and development
context perspective.

There is some evidence that the cost difference
between nutritious foods and energ y-dense
foods is increasing over time in some parts
of the world. 4 For example, a study from the
United States of America found that the price
disparit y between nutritious foods and highly
energ y-dense foods with minimal nutritional
value has grown between 2004 and 2008 in parts
of the countr y. 42 Results from South-eastern Asia
show similar patterns. 43

When actual dietar y patterns are compared, the
world’s poorest people consume something close
to a basic energ y sufficient diet. Any additional
income above subsistence is t y pically spent to
improve the starchy staple-based diet, with small
amounts of a second and third food group that is
more expensive per calorie but provides at least
some variet y and adds nutritional value.

Most evidence currently available on the cost
of nutritious foods, however, relates to the
cost comparisons of individual food items
and/or food groups. There is limited evidence
comparing the costs and affordabilit y of
diets as a whole, p and few comprehensive
global cross-countr y analyses. 44,56 Analysis of
economic access to food has been limited to
either income or food price indices that do not
clearly relate to healthy diets.

Further income increases are t y pically associated
with acquisition of more diverse foods, often
achieving higher levels of most nutrients but
using more expensive redients than the
least-cost nutrient adequate diet in an effort to
achieve higher levels of palatabilit y, convenience
and other attributes beyond essential nutrients.
In the case of high-income countries, where a
reverse wealth gradient of obesit y exists, lower
income correlates with obesit y, according to the
“obesit y-transition” as explained above, due to
the “nutrition transition”.

p The World Food Programme’s Fill the Nutrient Gap project has
recently conducted analyses of the cost and affordability of diets in a
number of lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) and in fragile/refugee
settings. By 2019 analysis was done for 27 countries, and over ten
more have been started in 2020. Project reports with published results
are available for El Salvador, Ghana, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Madagascar, Mozambique, Niger, Pakistan, Philippines,
Sri Lanka and Tajikistan. Please see WFP (2019) 60 for more details.

Between the energ y sufficient diet and nutrient
adequate diet, there are other diets that contain
more than just staple food for basic energ y

BOX 10

DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE DIETS USED IN THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS

For the purpose of this analysis, three reference diets
are analysed for cost and affordability to simulate
incremental levels of diet quality, starting from a basic
energy sufficient diet to a nutrient adequate diet and
then to a healthy diet.

The healthy diet is based on global guidelines46,47,48
that are nationally adapted to a country’s individual
characteristics, cultural context, locally available foods
and dietary customs through national food-based
dietary guidelines (FBDGs). At this time, however,
there are relatively few countries that have quantified
national FBDGs. Therefore, for analysis purposes, the
healthy diet in this section is guided by the quantified
recommendations from ten national FBDGs, which
represent a range of dietary recommendations
articulated by countries. These are then locally adapted
to each country through the assignment of least-cost
food items available by food group in each country
(see Box 11 and Annex 4, Table A4.1 for the description
of the ten FBDGs). Although the healthy diet is not
selected on the basis of nutrients but is determined
by FBDGs, this diet meets on average 95 percent of
nutrient needs, and it can be therefore almost always
considered as nutrient adequate.49

“ENERGY SUFFICIENT DIET”
This diet provides adequate calories for energy
balance for work each day. This is achieved using
only the basic starchy staple for a given country
(e.g. maize, wheat or rice only).
“NUTRIENT ADEQUATE DIET”
This diet not only provides adequate calories (per
the energy sufficient diet above), but also relevant
nutrient intake values of 23 macro- and micronutrients
through a balanced mix of carbohydrates, protein,
fat, essential vitamins and minerals within the upper
and lower bounds needed to prevent deficiencies and
avoid toxicity. Macronutrient intakes are within the
Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR)
set by the Institute of Medicine (2006).45

THE AIM OF THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS
The ultimate aim of the analysis presented in this
section is to measure whether food systems bring
these three levels of diet quality within reach of the
poorest, using those foods that meet each standard at
the lowest possible cost. In this case, the least cost of
the three diets are theoretical and do not necessarily
represent diets currently consumed.
See Boxes 11 and 12 for a brief description of the
methodology for estimating the cost and affordability
of the three diets and its caveats. For a full description
of the definition, methodology and data sources of the
three diets, see Annex 3.

“HEALTHY DIET”
This diet provides adequate calories and nutrients (per
the energy sufficient and nutrient adequate diets above),
but also includes a more diverse intake of foods from
several different food groups. As described in the last
section of Part 1 of this report, this diet is intended
to meet all nutrient intake requirements and to help
prevent malnutrition in all its forms, including diet-related
non-communicable diseases (see Part 1, Box 5).

(USD 1.06), where it was 34 percent higher than
the global average cost. The mean cost was lowest
in Northern America and Europe (USD 0.54) and
Oceania (USD 0.55), which was around 30 percent
lower than the global average cost.

These diets may be deemed as unhealthy as they
may be abundant in unhealthy fats and sugars
and/or salt, or may simply lack enough nutrient
rich-foods to meet nutrient requirements (e.g.
due to povert y or subsistence farms with limited
access to markets).

As expected, the cost of the diet increases
incrementally as the diet qualit y increases.
The cost of a healthy diet is 60 percent higher
than the cost of the nutrient adequate diet, and
almost 5 times the cost of the energ y sufficient
diet. This pattern holds across all regions and
countr y income groups (Table 7). At the global
level, a nutrient adequate diet was USD 2.33 per
person per day in 2017, whereas the healthy diet
was USD 3.75 per person per day.

For people who cannot afford a healthy diet
due to relatively high costs of nutritious foods,
unhealthy options such as sugar y drinks and
snacks high in sugars or saturated fat or salt are
more affordable, and can be attractive because
they are convenient, ready-to-eat or highly
marketed. People for whom healthy choices
are still largely unaffordable may also face
other pressures related to income earning and
time constraints to prepare balanced meals.
These unhealthy diets, however, are not analysed
in this report as the purpose of the affordabilit y
analysis is to determine the lowest possible cost
to meet certain nutritional targets.

The average cost of a diet varies by region and
countr y income group. However, there is a wide
and overlapping cost range among countries
across these regions and countr y income groups
of the world (see Annex 3, Table A3.2 for cost of
the three diets by countr y, income level and
population). For example, the healthy diet
in this analysis was on average more costly
per person per day in lower-middle-income
countries, estimated at USD 3.98, but the cost
across these countries ranged from USD 2.85 to
USD 5.00. The next most costly healthy diet was
in upper-middle-income countries (USD 3.95,
range USD 2.80 –5.60) and low-income countries
(USD 3.82, range USD 2.77–5.72). Healthy diets
were cheapest in high-income countries
(USD 3.43, range USD 1.88 –5.50).

A brief summar y of the methods used to compute
the cost of the three diets that have been
simulated for the analysis is provided in Box 11,
and the methods to compute the affordabilit y of
the diets is provided in Box 12. A full description
of the methodolog y and data sources, as well as
limitations of the analysis are found in Annex 3.

Analysis of cost and affordability
of three diets
Lowest cost of the three diets around the world

Geographically, the cost of a healthy diet was
highest in Latin America and the Caribbean
(USD 3.98, range USD 2.80 –5.60) and in Asia
(USD 3.97, range USD 2.81–5.50), especially in
Eastern Asian countries (Table 7), with ranges
showing cross-countr y variations within
regions. The cost of a healthy diet was lowest
in Oceania (USD 3.06, range USD 2.37– 4.06),
Northern America and Europe (USD 3.21, range
USD 1.88 – 4.42), and Africa (USD 3.87, range
USD 2.77–5.72).

The global average cost, converted to international
dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP),
of meeting calorie needs using the cheapest
starchy staple at each time and place – the energ y
sufficient diet – was USD 0.79 per person per
day in 2017q (Table 7). The cost was lowest in
low- and high-income countries (USD 0.70 and
USD 0.71, respectively) and highest in lowerand upper-middle-income countries (USD 0.88
and USD 0.87, respectively). Among geographic
regions, the highest cost for an energ y sufficient
diet was in Latin America and the Caribbean

Among the ten national food-based dietar y
g uidelines used in the estimation of the cost
of a healthy diet (see Box 11), the cost ranges
between USD 3.27 and USD 4.57 per person per
day, with a point estimate based on a median

COMPUTING THE LOWEST COST OF THE THREE DIETS USED IN THE COST AND
AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS
food composition achieves said criteria, which are
empirically determined at each place and time.
Typically, the linear programming model results in the
selection of 6–8 different items, including a starchy
staple plus one or more leguminous grains, such as
beans, and small quantities of low-cost vegetables,
fruits and animal source foods, like dried fish and
eggs. This nutrient adequate diet helps estimate the
cost and affordability of acquiring all nutrients in
the required proportions, so as to identify the ability
of each country’s food system to deliver nutrient
adequacy at all times and places. The minimal cost of
a nutrient adequate diet also provides a useful lower
bound on the cost of nutrients.

The three reference diets used in the cost and
affordability analysis are described in Box 10.
The analysis of the cost of these three diets is based
on a sample of 170 countries for which retail price
data are available in year 2017. Prices are obtained
from the World Bank’s International Comparison
Program (ICP) for internationally standardized items,
converted to international dollars using purchasing
power parity (PPP). The cost of each diet is estimated
for each country using the least expensive combination
of retail items whose food composition achieves the
specific criteria for each diet, which are empirically
determined at each time and place. This is what this
report calls “least-cost diets”. The least-cost diets for
the energy sufficient and nutrient adequate diets are
estimated from a linear programming model that
selects foods in the quantities needed to minimize
cost subject to energy and nutrient constraints. For the
healthy diet, a rank order optimization is used.
Specifically, the three least-cost diets are defined
as follows:

Cost of a healthy diet: Given that the exact make-up of
a healthy diet varies by local context, countries have
developed national food-based dietary guidelines
(FBDGs) to reflect their specific cultural context, locally
available foods and dietary customs. FBDGs, however,
are not available for all countries or, if available, they
do not always include specific food quantities.38 To
overcome this data limitation, this analysis applies the
quantified recommendations within and across food
groups from the ten FBDGs, which represent a range
of dietary recommendations articulated by countries.
These are then locally adapted to each country,
whereby the specific country preferences, in terms of
eating patterns, are captured by identifying local food
items at retail prices in each country.
The local cost of a healthy diet is calculated using a
rank order optimization method to select the two food items
in each group that fill each category at the lowest cost and
provide energy intake of 2 329 kcal. For each country,
ten costs of healthy diets are calculated by applying the
ten different quantified FBDGs, as each is associated
with a slightly different cost. Finally, the cost of a
healthy diet is computed for each country by taking the
average of the ten cost estimates (see Annex 3 for a full
description of the methodology). This method is a more
robust way of estimating the least-cost healthy diet
than applying a single global quantified description
of a healthy diet. Calculating the cost of this diet
helps identify the ability of each country’s food system
to deliver diets that encompass acceptable dietary
patterns, greater diet diversity and promote and protect
long-term health. The minimal cost of a healthy diet
provides a useful lower bound on the cost one needs to
incur when pursuing food security and nutrition through
market purchases.

Cost of an energy sufficient diet: This is the cost of a
single, cheapest starchy staple available at retail
markets in sufficient quantities to meet dietary energy
intake of 2 329 kcal, required for a reference group
represented by an adult woman of reproductive age.
This hypothetical benchmark50 helps establish a lower
bound on the cost of short-term survival and identify
the additional cost required to achieve longer-term
goals specified in the other two diets. The objective
of this diet is to set a benchmark that is used as a
point of comparison for discussing affordability of the
nutrient adequate and healthy diets. Costing a typical
diet would involve some combination of modelling
based on current dietary intake estimates in poor
populations, or arbitrary decisions about how much
of other foods to include to reach dietary energy
requirements. The global community’s vision for food
security is that no one should have to eat just one
single food (or even just two or three), but this is still
in fact the reality for some people in certain times and
places of the world.

Cost of a nutrient adequate diet: This is the minimum cost of
foods that meet all known requirements for essential
nutrients and provide an energy intake of 2 329 kcal,
required for an adult woman of reproductive age.
Calculating this cost at local level is based on the
least expensive combination of retail items whose

(CONTINUED)
Sources of data to compute cost: To estimate the cost of the
three diets, the following data are used: i) retail prices
from the World Bank’s International Comparison
Program (ICP) for internationally standardized items
for 2017 (for each food item, one price is provided
per country, representing an average across markets
and throughout the year); ii) food composition data
from the United States Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) nutrient data bank for internationally
standardized items, complemented by other food
composition data; and iii) quantities of food items
within and across food groups that together help meet
the recommended nutrient intake amount. They are
derived from ten published FBDGs representing a
range of dietary recommendations articulated by
countries (see Annex 4).

For the healthy diet, food preferences are taken into
account only as far as prices reported in the World
Bank’s International Comparison Program50 reflect
culturally acceptable foods that have a significant level
of expenditure share. Incorporating a greater degree of
food preferences would increase the estimated costs of
the diets as well as the estimates of numbers of people
who cannot afford them.
The lowest-cost healthy diet ensures energy
sufficiency and a balance between food groups and
diversity within food groups. It typically reaches
nutrient adequacy but may not ensure adequacy of
all nutrients in all cases. The cost of the healthy diet
is sensitive to the definition of the FBDGs. A complete
description of methods can be found in Annex 3 and
the description of FBDGs can be found in Annex 4.

» cost of USD 3.75 (Annex 4 and Figure A4.1). This is

Calculating ratios between the cost of diets across
regions and countr y income groups brings to
light an important finding: significant premiums
(i.e. additional costs) must be paid in order to
afford a higher diet qualit y across regions and
development contexts. Worldwide, the cost of a
nutrient adequate diet is on average 3.4 times
(range 1–9) more expensive than an energ y
sufficient diet. A healthy diet is 1.7 times (range
1–2.8) more expensive than a nutrient adequate
diet and 5.4 times (range 2–11) more expensive
than an energ y sufficient diet.

comparable to, for example, a range of between
USD 3.31 and USD 3.61 for the least-cost versions
of the four diet variants of the EAT-Lancet
reference diet (f lexitarian, pescatarian,
vegetarian and vegan), giving a point estimate
based on a median cost of USD 3.44 (Figure A4.1).
The EAT-Lancet reference diet refers to the
recommended intake values proposed by the
EAT-Lancet Commission that seek to address the
need to feed a growing population a healthy diet,
while also defining sustainable food systems that
minimize damage to our planet. r Four variant
diets of the EAT-Lancet reference diet are also
analysed for the valuation of the related health
and climate-change costs in the next section.

In general, low-income countries followed by
lower-middle-income countries face relatively
higher premiums to move from a nutrient adequate
diet to a healthy diet than other countries.
Geographically, Africa and Asia stand out as
having the highest premiums to reach a healthy
diet from a nutrient adequate diet. This is a
significant challenge, considering that most of the
food insecure and malnourished populations in
lower-middle-income countries and low-income
countries are consuming diets near to the energ y
sufficient diet. For example, it would cost a person
living in a low-income country around 6 times more
to move from an energ y sufficient to a healthy diet.

r The EAT-Lancet Commission consists of 37 world-leading scientists
from 16 countries from various scientific disciplines. It seeks to reach
scientific consensus on targets for healthy diets and sustainable food
production. In 2019, the Commission published what is referred to as
the “EAT-Lancet reference diet”, which quantitatively describes a
universal healthy reference diet, based on an increase in consumption
of nutritious foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes
and nuts), and a decrease in consumption of energy-dense foods (such
as red meat, sugar and refined grains) that would provide major health
benefits, and also increase the likelihood of attainment of the SDGs.
See Willett et al. (2019).79 There are four variants of the reference diet
(flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan).

NOTES: The table shows the USD cost per person per day of the three reference diets (energy sufficient, nutrient adequate and healthy diet) by region and country income group
in 2017. The analysis is based on a sample of 170 countries for which retail food price data are available in year 2017. Prices are obtained from the World Bank’s International
Comparison Program (ICP) for internationally standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). The cost of each diet represents a
simple average of the cost incurred by countries belonging to a specific region or country income group. See Box 10 for the definition of the three diets and Box 11 for a brief
description of the cost methodology. For the full methodological notes and data sources, see Annex 3.

(USD 0.71 per person per day) is much cheaper

on average, would have to pay 6 times more to
move from an energ y sufficient to a healthy diet.

credibly be reser ved for food (63 percent) of
USD 1.20 PPP per day (Figure 28). It is assumed
that a minimum of 37 percent of expenditures
must be reser ved for non-food expenditures,
such as housing, transport, education and
health, and farm inputs. 51,52,53,54 On average, the
cost of a nutrient adequate diet and a healthy
diet are respectively 2 and 3 times greater than
the povert y threshold of USD 1.20 per person
per day. This is true by any of the definitions
of healthy diets (based on national food-based
dietar y g uidelines) used in these analyses
(see Annex 4, Figure A4.1).

Dair y, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods
(plant and animal-sourced) are the highest-cost
food groups globally, in terms of quantit y
recommended for consumption per day for
a healthy diet (Figure 27A). There are regional
differences, with fruits and vegetables being
notably more expensive in Eastern Asia, and
dair y being more expensive in sub-Saharan
Africa, Eastern and South-eastern Asia but
cheaper in Western and Northern Europe,
Australia and New Zealand. Starchy staples and
oils account for only 16 percent of the cost of a
healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables account for a
little less than 40 percent of its cost, and dair y
and protein-rich foods combined account for a
little more than 44 percent (Figure 27B).

A nutrient adequate diet and a healthy diet are
unaffordable for those living below the povert y
line. They are also unaffordable for even the
populations who are v ulnerable to become poor
because their incomes are just above the povert y
line, and the cost of these diets well exceeds the
povert y line of USD 1.90 per person per day.

These proportions var y somewhat by countr y
income group, with dair y being notably more
expensive in low-income countries (see Annex 5,
Figures A5.1 and A5.2). These findings imply that
the cost of nutritious foods that contribute to
a healthy diet, particularly dair y, vegetables,
fruits and protein-rich foods, needs to decrease
in order for their consumption to increase.

This holds true across regions as well. Both the
nutrient adequate and the healthy diets exceed
USD 1.20 (63 percent of the povert y line) in
sub-Saharan Africa, as they are 1.7 and 3.2
times higher than the povert y line, respectively.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, they are
2.3 and 3.3 times higher, respectively, and
in Asia, they are 1.8 and 3.3 times higher,
respectively. In Northern America and Europe,
both the nutrient adequate and heathy diets are
unaffordable for the poor, as they are 1.9 and 2.6
times higher than the povert y line, respectively.

Affordability of the three diets around the world
After analysing the cost of this report’s
three reference diets, the next important
step is to examine their affordabilit y. In this
analysis, affordabilit y is measured comparing
the estimated cost of the least-cost diet per
person per day for each of the three reference
diets described for these analyses with: i) the
international povert y line; ii) t ypical food
expenditures in each countr y; and iii) estimated
income distribution in each countr y.
The methodolog y is described in Box 12.

While a healthy diet costs more than USD 1.20
in ever y countr y, the least-cost nutrient adequate
diet falls below this threshold only in Qatar,
and falls between USD 1.20 and USD 1.90 for
seventeen African, eleven Asian, six European,
one Latin American and one Oceanian countr y.
In comparison, the least-cost energ y sufficient
diet is affordable (still using the USD 1.20
threshold) for the poor around the world, except
in Bolivia (Plurinational State of ) (USD 1.42),
British Virgin Islands (USD 1.56), Dominica
(USD 1.22), Ecuador (USD 1.31), El Salvador
(USD 1.46), Grenada (USD 1.33), Japan
(USD 3.03), Nicarag ua (USD 1.44), Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines (USD 1.32), Sint Maarten
(USD 1.72), South Africa (USD 1.26), Taiwan
(USD 1.46) and Togo (USD 1.94).

Affordability comparing cost of the diets to the international
poverty lines
Findings show that while most of the poor
around the world can afford an energ y sufficient
diet, as defined here, they cannot afford either
a nutrient adequate or a healthy diet (Figure 28).
A healthy diet is far more expensive than the
full value of the international povert y line
of USD 1.90 PPP per day, let alone the upper
bound portion of the povert y line that can

BOX 12

COMPUTING THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE THREE REFERENCE DIETS

To gauge a degree of affordability, the cost of
each of the three diets described for these analyses
(see Box 11) needs to be compared with a standard
of income or expenditures. Our analysis uses the
following three standards.

as a percentage of average food expenditures in
a given country: a diet is unaffordable for values
greater than 100 percent (see Table in Box 13 and
Figure A5.3).
3. Estimated income distribution: The third measure of
affordability compares the cost of each diet
with the estimated income distribution in a given
country, using income distributions from the World
Bank PovcalNet interface.57** Specifically, a diet
is considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds
the 63 percent of the average income in a given
country, following the same rationale behind the
first measure of affordability. This third measure of
affordability provides estimates on the percentage
of people for whom the cost of a specific diet is
unaffordable. Percentages are then multiplied by
the 2017 population in each country, to arrive
at the estimated number of people who cannot
afford a given diet in a given country (see Table 8
and table in Box 13). Since income distributions
estimated by the World Bank are not available
for year 2017, income distributions in year 2018
are used that are based on household surveys
across 164 economies (see Annex 3 for a full
description of the methodology and data sources).
Out of the 170 countries included in this analysis,
information on the percentage and number of
people who are not able to afford the diets is
available on 143 countries. Furthermore, to
provide a range to these estimations, lowerand upper-bound estimates of this measure of
affordability are computed and presented in
Annex 3 (Table A3.3). The cost and affordability of
the three diets are shown in Table A3.2 (Annex 3).
Global maps showing ranges of affordability
are presented in Figure A5.3 (Annex 5) for the
143 countries analysed.

1. International poverty line: The first measure of
affordability compares the cost of each diet
with 63 percent of the international poverty
line of USD 1.90 PPP per day, which is equal to
USD 1.20 (see Figure 28). The 63 percent accounts
for a portion of the poverty line that can be
credibly reserved for food, based on observations
that the poorest people in low-income countries
spend, on average, 63 percent of their incomes
on food (World Bank Global Consumption
Database).55* It is assumed that a minimum of
37 percent of expenditures must be reserved for
non-food expenditures, such as housing, transport,
education and health, and farm inputs.51,52,53,54
In reality, 37 percent of expenditures is a
conservative assumption. For instance, non-food
expenditures may have a higher share in
high-income countries.
2. Average daily food expenditures in each country: The
second measure of affordability compares the cost
of each diet with average daily food expenditures
in each country. The national average per
capita food expenditures used in this measure
of affordability is calculated by Herforth et al.
(2020) 40 based on data from ICP, and is expressed
using ratios or percentages. Ratios are defined
as the cost of a diet divided by average country
food expenditures: ratios above 1 indicate that a
diet is unaffordable as its cost exceeds average
food expenditures in a given country (see Figure 29).
Alternatively, the cost of a diet can be expressed

* Among the countries used to calculate the USD 1.25 poverty line (later deflated to USD 1.90), the mean food share of the 28 countries with complete data to separate the food and
non-food poverty lines is 56 percent (with a range from 26 to 79). Thus, mean non-food share is 44 percent with a range of 21–74 percent. 58
** 2017 is a reference year in this exercise because the cost analysis uses retail prices from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP) for internationally standardized
items for 2017 (see Box 11).

higher than per capita food expenditures in
Liberia, and 1.4 times higher in Togo (Figure 29A).

povert y line may need to be adjusted to avoid
misg uidance, as it is the basis for programme
targets and social safet y net programmes, but
currently does not support the abilit y of people
to access even the least-cost versions of a healthy
diet. Specifically, povert y lines are not high
enough to ref lect incomes/consumption needed
to support food securit y and nutrition needs.
Povert y lines are determined by applying t y pical
food consumption patterns expressed by food
expenditure shares, using what is called a “basic
needs approach”. This approach uses food prices
to determine the cost of calorie needs weighted
by food expenditure shares. The cost analysis of
a healthy diet above shows that the povert y line,
which includes provision for basic food needs,
does not provide for having either a nutrient
adequate or a healthy diet in most countries.
Hence there is a need for new food price metrics,
based around global nutritional and dietar y
goals, to estimate food povert y lines that are
nutrition-sensitive. This issue is f lagged as an
area for further research in the last section of this
report (see Box 29).

There are many more countries in the world
where a nutrient adequate diet is not affordable
(Figure 29B). For low-income countries as a
whole, this diet is unaffordable as it represents
113 percent of the average food expenditure,
meaning that it costs, on average, 1.13 times more
than the average food expenditure. A nutrient
adequate diet is affordable in high-income
countries (costing 34 percent of average food
expenditure), in upper-middle-income countries
(46 percent) and also in lower-middle-income
countries but to a lesser extent (62 percent).
A nutrient adequate diet is overall affordable in
sub-Saharan Africa (91 percent). However, in this
region affordabilit y varies across its subregions
and countries (Figure 29B). In fact, the nutrient
adequate diet is not affordable in Western Africa
as it represents 109 percent of average food
expenditures, with countries such as Niger and
Liberia where this diet costs, respectively, two
and almost four times more than the average
national food expenditure. Although this diet is
on average affordable in Latin America and the
Caribbean (57 percent) and in Asia (43 percent),
it is less affordable for several countries in these
regions (Figure 29B).

Affordability comparing cost of the diets to average daily food
expenditures in each country
Looking now at diet costs compared with average
national food expenditures per person per day,
this report finds that the energ y sufficient diet
is affordable for most countries in the world
(Figure 29A). On average, this diet represents
19 percent of the average food expenditure in
the world, indicating affordabilit y. However, the
degree of this affordabilit y varies across countr y
and development contexts.

At the global level, on average, a healthy diet is
affordable, with the cost representing 95 percent
of average food expenditures per capita per
day. However, there are wide variations in
affordabilit y of this diet around the world and
across development contexts. Most striking is
that the cost of a healthy diet exceeds national
average food expenditures in most countries
in the Global South. s A healthy diet is not
affordable in lower-middle-income countries
(105 percent), and it is far from being affordable
– almost 3 times the average food expenditure
– in low-income countries (226 percent). On the
other hand, a healthy diet is generally affordable
in high-income countries, representing
on average 50 percent of the average food
expenditure, and in upper-middle-income
countries but to a lesser degree (71 percent).
»

As expected, an energ y sufficient diet is most
affordable in high-income countries (costing
10.5 percent of average food expenditure), with
the degree of affordabilit y decreasing as income
level of the countr y declines. It is the least
affordable in low-income countries (40 percent),
followed by lower-middle-income countries
(23 percent) and upper-middle-income countries
(16 percent). The energ y sufficient diet is least
affordable in Western African low-income
countries (50 percent). Moreover, this is the only
region with two countries where the energ y
sufficient diet is not affordable, costing more
than the average food expenditure. Specifically,

of a healthy diet poses the greatest challenge in
Africa. In this continent, the average cost of a
healthy diet exceeds the average food expenditure
(USD 3.87 vs. USD 3.57), and it is 2.2 times
higher in Western Africa (USD 4.03 vs. USD 2.66)
(Figure 29C). Some countries show a much more
disproportionate cost of this diet compared with
their average food expenditures. In Burundi,
Liberia, Niger and Togo, in particular, the cost
of healthy diets is between 4 and 7 times higher
than average food expenditures, with Liberia
reporting the highest unaffordabilit y.

More than 3 billion people in the world
cannot afford a healthy diet
Affordability comparing cost of the diets to estimated income
distribution in each country
The above analysis has shown clearly that
a nutrient adequate and a healthy diet are
significantly less affordable than an energ y
sufficient diet. In many countries, the poor would
have to use most or all of their total income in
order to acquire adequate quantities of essential
nutrients and a diversit y of nutritious food
groups; and for a number of countries, even this
amount would not be enough. In such situations,
affordabilit y imposes an insurmountable obstacle,
so price and income constraints need to be
addressed within supportive food environments
for nutrition knowledge and behaviour change to
be effective in inf luencing choices.

While a healthy diet is on average affordable
in North Africa (71 percent of average food
expenditures), it is not affordable in three
subregions of sub-Saharan Africa (Eastern,
Middle and Western Africa). In Western Africa,
it is 2.2 times more expensive than the average
food expenditure, followed by Eastern Africa
and Middle Africa, where the diet is 1.8, and
1.4 times higher than average food expenditures,
respectively. It is affordable in Southern Africa
where the healthy diet represents 92 percent of
average food expenditures. Overall, a healthy
diet is not affordable for more than 70 percent of
the countries in Africa (35 out of 50).

Ultimately, the aim of the cost and affordabilit y
analysis presented so far is to quantif y the
number of people for whom even a lowest-cost
healthy diet is out of reach. Table 8 presents
estimates of the prevalence and the total number
of people for whom each of the three levels of
diet qualit y is not affordable, based on estimated
income distribution. These estimates assume
that people spend on average 63 percent of their
income on food, where this chosen percentage
represents the food share expenditure of the
poorest segment of the population in low-income
countries, according to the World Bank (see Box 12
and Annex 3). To give a range of confidence to
these estimates, the prevalence and number of
people who cannot afford the three diets are also
computed using lower-bound and upper-bound
estimates that are shown in Annex 3 (Table A3.3).

In Asia, a healthy diet is on average affordable
(78 percent of average food expenditures),
owing to the affordabilit y seen in Western
Asia (56 percent), Eastern Asia (81 percent),
Central Asia (85 percent), and South-eastern
Asia (88 percent). However, it is not affordable
in Southern Asia (102 percent). For 10 countries
in Asia, out of 40 countries analysed, the
cost of a healthy diet exceeds the average
food expenditure.
Countries in food crisis face even greater
challenges in accessing a healthy diet, especially
countries with a protracted crisis situation which
are characterized by complex, multidimensional
conf licts and extreme fragilit y. In these contexts,
the cost of a healthy diet is similar to the global
average (USD 3.80 and USD 3.75 per person,
respectively); however, the proportion of the
people who cannot afford this diet is significantly
higher compared with the world average. Most or
86 percent of the population in countries with a
protracted crisis situation cannot afford a healthy

Based on this analysis, it is estimated that
more than 3 billion people in the world could
not afford a healthy diet in 2017. Most of these
people live in Asia (1.9 billion) and Africa
(965 million), although there are millions
that live in Latin America and the Caribbean
(104.2 million), and in Northern America and
Europe (18 million). The highest proportion of
the population that could not afford a healthy
diet is seen in Western Africa (82 percent),

NOTES: The table presents the average percentage (%) and the total number (million) of population in each region and country income group who cannot afford the three
reference diets (energy sufficient diet, nutrient adequate diet and the healthy diet) in the year 2017. This measure of affordability compares the cost of each diet with the
estimated income distribution in a given country, under the assumption that 63 percent of the income available can be credibly reserved for food. A diet is considered
unaffordable when its cost exceeds the 63 percent of the average income in a given country. See Box 10 for the definition of the three diets and Boxes 11 and 12 for a brief
description of the cost and affordability methodology. For the full methodological notes and data sources, see Annex 3. Lower-bound and upper bound estimates of affordability
are also computed and shown in Annex 3, Table A3.3.

BOX 13

COUNTRIES WITH A PROTRACTED CRISIS SITUATION FACE IMMENSE CHALLENGES
IN ENSURING THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHY DIETS
the global average, the proportion of the population
who cannot afford a healthy diet is significantly higher.
Specifically, the cost of a healthy diet is on average
slightly higher than the global average (USD 3.80 and
USD 3.75 per person, respectively). However, this is
unaffordable for most (86 percent) of the population
in countries with a protracted crisis situation – a figure
that is double the world average (38 percent), and
is 57 percent higher than what is estimated for the
Global South.
Within-country analysis of variations in cost and
affordability is available for a number of the most
affected countries with a protracted crisis situation.**
The results show that compared with countries with
a stable context, the cost of an energy sufficient diet
is usually only slightly higher. However, the cost of
a nutrient adequate diet is significantly higher due
to inefficiencies in supply and lower availability of
nutritious foods.
For example, in North Burundi, Tanganyika region
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Maradi and
Zinder in Niger and the plateau Dogon in Mali, a
nutrient adequate diet would be unaffordable for nearly
everyone (above 90 percent).60 In the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and in Somalia, rural markets
tend to offer significantly less variety of foods than
urban markets in the same regions, especially animal
source foods.*** When comparing the cost of a
nutrient adequate diet to an energy sufficient diet, the
nutrient diet in these regions was found to be 4–7 times
higher, as opposed to 2–4 times higher in stable
country settings.
Given the extreme severity and persistence of food
insecurity and malnutrition they suffer, countries with a
protracted crisis situation require special attention and
approaches to transforming food systems in order to
ensure affordable healthy diets for all.59,61,62

Countries in food crisis face even greater challenges
in ensuring the availability of nutritious foods and the
affordability of a healthy diet. This is especially the
case for countries with a protracted crisis situation,*
which are generally characterized by complex,
multidimensional and prolonged conflicts and
extreme fragility.
Countries with a protracted crisis situations present
specific challenges related to the cost and affordability
of healthy diets.59 Almost all these countries have
experienced some form of violent conflict over
prolonged periods. Their populations face frequent
food price fluctuations and spikes, disruptions in
food supply and access to functioning markets, and
greater uncertainties, risks and inefficiencies in food
systems. Most of these countries are also characterized
by very weak governance, breakdown of local
institutions, poor health of the affected populations,
higher risk of climate variability and climate change
impacts and high prevalence of natural disasters.
Moreover, a significant proportion of the population
in these contexts are acutely vulnerable to hunger,
malnutrition, disease and disruptions to livelihoods over
prolonged periods.
FAO currently identifies 22 countries with a
protracted crisis situation, but information on cost
and affordability is not available for seven of them:
Afghanistan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic
and Yemen (see Annex 6). The table below presents
the analysis of the costs and affordability of the three
reference diets (i.e. energy sufficient, nutrient adequate
and healthy) for the 15 countries with a protracted
crisis situation for which price data are available.
The cost and affordability analysis highlights the
immense challenge in ensuring affordable healthy diets
in these contexts. The findings show that while the cost
of a healthy diet in these contexts is comparable to

* FAO defines protracted crisis situations as “characterized by recurrent natural disasters and/or conflict, longevity of food crises, breakdown of livelihoods and insufficient institutional
capacity to react to the crises”. There are three criteria used to define a country with a protracted crisis situation: i) longevity of the crisis; ii) humanitarian aid flow to the country; and
iii) the country’s economic and food security status (see Annex 6).
** In these within-country studies, food price data were used to estimate the lowest cost of energy sufficient and nutrient adequate diets and these were compared with household food
expenditure curves to estimate the proportion of households within a country that would be able to afford each diet.
*** Study findings are from the WFP Fill the Nutrient Gap (FNG) studies in Kasai and Tanganyika regions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (unpublished), Maradi and Zinder (Niger),63

NOTES: The table shows the cost and affordability of the three reference diets (energy sufficient, nutrient adequate and healthy diet) for 15 countries with a protracted crisis situation, by region (column 2),
development status (column 3) and population in year 2017 (column 4). The cost of the three diets is based on retail food price data obtained from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP) for
internationally standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). Two measures of affordability are presented. One shows the cost of each diet as a percentage of
average food expenditure per capita per day in a given country (columns 6, 9 and 12): each diet is unaffordable for values greater than 100 percent. The other measure shows the percentage of people who
cannot afford the three reference diets: each diet is unaffordable when its cost exceeds the 63 percent of the average income in a given country (columns 7, 10 and 13). The 63 percent accounts for a portion of
average income that can be credibly reserved for food. See Box 10 for the definition of the three diets and Boxes 11 and 12 for a brief description of the cost and affordability methodology. For the full
methodological notes and data sources, see Annex 3.

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

Costs and affordability within countries

» Middle Africa (78 percent), Eastern Africa
(75 percent), Southern Africa (64 percent),
followed by Southern Asia (58 percent),
South-eastern Asia (46 percent), the Caribbean
(37 percent), Central Asia (33 percent) and
Central America (28 percent). Looking at
countr y income groups, the highest proportion
is seen in low-income countries (86 percent) and
lower-middle-income countries (59 percent),
whose populations face the greatest challenges
in affording healthy diets.

The cost and affordability of diets varies around
the world, across regions and in different
development contexts. They may also vary within
countries due to temporal and geographical
factors, as well as variations in the nutritional
needs of individuals across the life cycle.
These within-country variations in cost are not
captured in the above global and regional analysis.

In summar y, 77 percent or more of the
population throughout sub-Saharan Africa
and 58 percent in Southern Asia cannot
afford healthy diets. Furthermore, high
proportions of people throughout other parts
of Asia (30 percent) and Latin America and the
Caribbean (26 percent) cannot afford healthy
diets either (see Annex 5, Figure A5.3).

The affordabilit y of a healthy diet can var y widely
within a countr y, driven by variation among
regions with regard to higher prices of nutritious
food, lower economic status of a population,
limited availabilit y and diversit y of nutritious
foods or a combination of these factors. There are
significant temporal and geographical patterns
in the cost variations. For example, in a study
of Southern Asia, for some countries, the price
of a nutrient adequate food basket varied more
by season and has been increasing at a faster
rate than the price of a t y pical food basket.
This phenomenon was largely due to the variable
cost of vegetables. 66

Within-country variation driven by temporal
and geographical factors

These findings imply that: i) the cost of
nutritious foods that constitute healthy diets
needs to decrease, including dair y, fruits,
vegetables and protein-rich foods; and
ii) povert y lines may need to rise, as they are
the basis for prog ramme targets and social
safet y net prog rammes, and currently do not
prov ide a good gauge of people’s abilit y to
access even the least-cost versions of a healthy
diet. That is, they do not support food securit y
and nutrition.

Food price data are also used in a selection
of countr y studies to estimate the lowest-cost
nutrient adequate diets, t which were then
compared with household food expenditure
cur ves to calculate the proportion of households
within a countr y that would be able to afford
it. u Figure 30 shows the range of within-countr y
variation in unaffordabilit y of a nutrient
adequate diet for 25 countries. For example,
in Madagascar, there was a wide variation:
unaffordabilit y of a nutrient adequate diet
ranged from 25 percent to 97 percent.
»

National FBDGs ref lect the translation of
global g uiding principles of a healthy diet
that takes into account a countr y’s nutrition
situation, food availabilit y, culinar y cultures
and eating habits (see Section 1.3 in Part 1 of
this report). FBDGs are intended to establish
a basis for food and nutrition, public health,
education, social protection and agricultural
as well as other sectoral policies and
programmes, and also for food and nutrition
education programmes to foster healthy eating
habits. The findings indicate that as part of
comprehensive strategies in order to shift
population consumption towards recommended
diets by enabling all people to access healthy
diets, prices of those diets need to decline.

t Conducted by WFP in collaboration with the bureau of statistics or
other national agency from specific countries; see WFP.60
u The cost of the nutrient adequate diet discussed here follows the
same methodological approach as the above global and regional
analysis, but differs in some aspects as it is a within-country estimation.
Indeed, it is estimated using a household that typically includes five
individuals, and it is then expressed as a per capita average. The
modelled household varies by country but typically includes one
breastfed child aged 12–23 months, one school-aged child (6–7 years),
one adolescent girl (14–15 years), one lactating woman and one adult
man. Unaffordability is measured by the proportion of households in a
country whose food expenditure is not sufficient to afford a nutrient
adequate diet in their local environment (see Annex 3 for the difference
between methodologies).

PROPORTION OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT CANNOT AFFORD A NUTRIENT ADEQUATE DIET (%)

NOTES: The figure indicates the range of unaffordability of a nutrient adequate diet across different countries and different years. Unaffordability is measured by the proportion of
households in a country whose food expenditure is not sufficient to afford a nutrient adequate diet in their local environment. The nutrient adequate diet includes, per person, the
average energy needs and the recommended intake for protein, fat, four minerals and nine vitamins. The modelled household varies by country, but typically includes one breastfed
child aged 12–23 months, one school-aged child (6–7 years), one adolescent girl (14–15 years), one lactating woman and one adult man. Each data point represents an area of the
country. Each vertical line in the range represents a particular administrative area, e.g. a province or district. * Denotes that there was a consumer price index (CPI) adjustment made to
expenditure data to match the year for which the food price data were collected.

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

» Var ying food prices, which directly impact the

lower income, households spent only half as
much money on food compared with what
households in Maputo Province in the south do. v
Similarly, the Amazon region of Ecuador had
among the lowest cost of a nutrient adequate
diet in the countr y (on average USD 7.40 per
five-person household per day compared with
USD 8.60 national average). However, this does
not translate into greater affordabilit y of nutrient
adequate diets in these regions because of the
region’s poor economic status. As shown above, a
reference healthy diet has been shown to be more
expensive than a reference nutrient adequate
diet, so it is likely that families will struggle
even more to be able to afford a healthy diet to
promote and protect long-term health.

cost of a nutrient adequate diet, often mirror
urban-rural divides. In the urban south of
Mozambique, the prices of eggs and tomatoes,
which are imported from South Africa, were
4–5 times higher than in the rural central region,
where they were mainly produced by local
households. However, a nutrient adequate diet
was more affordable in the urban south, even
if it was more expensive, because incomes were
higher. This is a t ypical obser vation in many
countries. Rural areas were also impacted more
strongly by seasonalit y, with food prices in rural
areas rising higher in the lean season compared
with those in urban contexts.
In all contexts, food prices varied by ecological
system and livelihood. In rural Myanmar, the
“breadbasket” region of Ayeyarwady, where
most of the rice and other crops are produced
and sold on rural markets, the cost of a nutrient
adequate diet was 10 to 25 percent lower than in
remote regions of the countr y where transport,
storage and retail are required to get the foods
there. In the pastoralist belt of north Burkina
Faso, 82 percent of households were unable to
afford a nutrient adequate diet. In contrast, the
agricultural southern regions showed variation in
unaffordabilit y of a nutrient adequate diet from
35 to 43 percent.

Within-household variation driven by
life-cycle needs
Nutritional needs var y across the life cycle, and
hence dietar y intake requirements differ both
in terms of quantit y and diversit y. This has
implications for cost and affordabilit y, and risk
of micronutrient deficiencies. 67 Within the same
household, the cost of a nutrient adequate diet
is not the same for ever yone, as members are
generally at different stages of life. This is mainly
due to the increased need for some nutrients
during phases which should be met with foods
of higher nutritional value, such as pregnancy or
adolescence, which tend to be more expensive. 49

Furthermore, higher food prices and the higher
cost of a nutrient adequate diet were also
seen in remote mountainous communities of
Lesotho and El Salvador due to the challenges
of food supply and the difficulties in meeting
nutrient requirements from the foods that are
locally available. In El Salvador, the number
of nutritious foods available on the market
decreased with altitude, increasing the cost of
meeting nutrient requirements. Unaffordabilit y
of a nutrient adequate diet varied from 23 percent
in the plains to 44 percent in the high-altitude
Morazan region.

For example, in Malawi, pregnant and lactating
women and adolescent boys faced the highest
cost for a nutrient adequate diet. The average
cost of a nutrient adequate diet of these groups
was more than USD 1.50 per day, which was
much higher than the 70 percent of international
povert y line and the food expenditure per capita
per day in Malawi. 49 In terms of the cost per
1 000 kcal, females in general faced a higher
cost compared with males, as they require more
nutritious foods. This trend is the same at the
global level, showing adolescent girls and older
females facing particular challenges in terms of
the need for highly nutritious foods. 49

Even assuming relatively uniform food prices
across a countr y, the abilit y to afford a nutrient
adequate diet can also var y among different
areas depending on levels of povert y and
income. In the Zambezia, Gaza and Nampula
provinces of Mozambique, where there are fewer
income-earning opportunities and considerably

NOTES: The figure shows the contribution (percentage) of different household members to a household’s total needs for energy and iron requirements, and the contribution of
different household members to a household’s total cost of a nutrient adequate diet (using the least-cost diet), in Uganda (year 2016) and Burundi (year 2017). The nutrient adequate
diet includes, per person, the average energy needs and the recommended intake for protein, fat, four minerals and nine vitamins. The modelled household for Burundi and Uganda
includes one breastfed child aged 12–23 months, one school-aged child (6–7 years), one adolescent girl (14–15 years), one lactating woman and one adult man.

higher than their share of the energ y, but as the
data show, this varies, as it depends on the cost
of the local foods that contain the most-needed
nutrients. w This is likely to be worse in countries
where – due to lack of awareness and gender
dynamics – women, girls, and young children do
not get a larger share of more nutritious foods
to meet their higher nutrient needs. Despite the
higher costs, ensuring optimal nutrition of girls,
women and especially adolescent girls is a wise
return on investment to ensure the health of the
girls and women and also the health of future
generations due to the intergenerational cycle
of malnutrition.

the cost of a healthy diet is much higher than
both the international povert y line, established
at USD 1.90 PPP per day, and average food
expenditures. More than 77 percent of the
population cannot afford these diets throughout
sub-Saharan Africa, and 57 percent cannot
afford it in Southern Asia, and the challenges
are even greater for countries with a protracted
crisis situation. More than 1.5 billion people in
the world cannot even afford a diet that only
meets required levels of essential nutrients.
Aside from recognizing the prohibitive costs of
healthy diets for many of the world’s populations,
it is also important to understand what is making
these diets costly. Evidence points to a number of
different factors driving up the price of nutritious
foods throughout food systems. The following
sections further explore this in order to identif y
the key areas of policy inter vention and food
systems transformations. n

Another stage of life that requires foods of
high nutritional value is the period between
6 and 23 months. At this age, children have
high nutrient needs for growth but can only eat
small quantities of food because of their small
stomachs; therefore, they require breastfeeding
and nutrient-dense complementar y foods.
Although the cost of complementar y feeding
for a child of 6 –23 months of age is the lowest
in the household, the number and qualit y of
foods selected for that child is higher than for
an adult man, because of the nutrient densit y
required. For example, per 100 kcal of food, a
breastfed infant of 6 –8 months of age needs
9 times as much iron and 4 times as much zinc
as an adult man. 71

Conclusion
In summar y, the analysis of the costs and
affordabilit y of the three reference levels of diet
qualit y presented in this section helps determine
where, geographically, attention needs to be
paid if a healthy diet is to become affordable for
all, across and within countries, by regions and
countr y income groups. The evidence presented
ser ves to highlight where the cost of a healthy
diet must fall to be an affordable level for all,
as well as where the need is most pressing, so
that people can then have more choice options.
It shows that healthy diets are unaffordable to
many people, especially the poor, in ever y region
of the world. In fact, for more than 3 billion
people, even the lowest-cost healthy diet is
unaffordable. In many countries of the world,

considerations could help to reduce health and
climate-change costs by 2030, as their hidden
costs are lower compared with those of current
food consumption patterns. There is a range of
healthy diet patterns that can contribute to reducing
GHG emissions and allow climate adaptation,
depending on country contexts, individual preferences
and the nutrient needs of different population groups
in each country.

KEY MESSAGES
è Current food systems have clearly been successful

at producing low-cost calories, but healthy diets
remain costly and unaffordable for billions of people
in the world. However, considering only the cost and
affordability of different diets fails to account for the
hidden costs associated with food production and
consumption.

è Healthy diets can play an important role in

increasing the environmental sustainability of food
systems; however, not all healthy diets are sustainable
and not all diets designed for sustainability are always
healthy. This important nuance is not well understood
and is often missing from ongoing discussions and
debates on the potential contribution of healthy diets
to environmental sustainability.

è All diets around the world, from those that

meet only dietary energy needs to those that are
considered nutrient adequate and healthy diets,
have hidden costs that must be understood in order
to identify trade-offs and synergies that affect the
achievement of other SDGs.

è A shift towards healthy diets that also

costs for many people (SDG 3) and the climate-related
costs that the world as a whole incurs (SDG 13).

significant transformations in food systems, and
there is no one-size-fits-all solution for countries.
Assessing context-specific barriers, managing

in direct and indirect health costs, thus creating
significant savings that could be invested now to lower
the cost of nutritious foods.

the rural economy, care must be taken to mitigate the
potential negative impacts on incomes and livelihoods
as food systems transform to deliver affordable
healthy diets.

è Low- and lower-middle-income countries, where

populations still suffer undernutrition and nutrient
deficiencies, may need to increase the consumption
of nutritious foods even when they might result in
higher national carbon footprints in order to meet
recommended dietary needs and nutrition goals,
particularly to prevent undernutrition.

è The second hidden cost: The diet-related social

cost of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated
with current dietary patterns is projected to exceed
USD 1.7 trillion per year by 2030. The adoption of
healthy diets that include sustainability considerations
would reduce the social cost of GHG emissions by an
estimated 41–74 percent in 2030.

è Other countries, especially upper-middle-income

and high-income countries, where diet patterns
exceed optimal energy requirements and people
consume more animal source foods than required,
require major changes in dietary practices and
system-wide changes in food production, food
environments and trade.

result in a serious cost underestimation of achieving
food security and nutrition, and ignore the challenges
of achieving environmental sustainability and health

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

Current food systems have been successful at
producing low-cost calories that have fuelled a
fast-growing and more urbanized population,
and economic development more broadly.
However, these productivit y gains and cheap
calories have not improved access to healthy
diets, which remain costly and unaffordable for
billions of people in the world. But the issue of
cost of diets is problematic in another sense as
well, one that should not be overlooked.

to a higher content of plant-based foods may
be needed to reduce negative environmental
impacts, including on land use, freshwater
extraction and biogeochemical f lows. 73
The health and environmental consequences of
unhealthy diets translate into actual costs for
many people in the world and for society as a
whole, such as increased medical costs and the
costs of climate change, respectively. These costs
incurred in the production and consumption
of food are currently not reflected in the price
of food, even though they are a result of the
production and consumption of this food. They are
what economists call negative externalities, and
they can lead to market failures, overconsumption,
and production of energ y-dense foods and diets
that are harmful to environmental sustainability.
According to economic theory, correcting such
market failures requires integrating the previously
unaccounted costs in the price of those foods,
so that consumers and producers can make their
decisions based on full costs.

Considering only the cost and affordability of
different diets, as done in Section 2.1, fails to
account for the hidden costs associated with
current food production and consumption.
Understanding them is critical to identify
trade-offs and synergies for other SDGs. The two
most critical hidden costs relate to health- (SDG 3)
and climate-related (SDG 13) consequences of our
dietary patterns and the food systems that support
these. These costs are “hidden” because health
and environmental costs accrue years after the
observed production and consumption. x

Properly valuating these hidden costs or
externalities of food systems would significantly
modif y the assessment of what is “affordable”.
To show the significance of this, this section
presents new estimates of an economic
valuation of the health and climate change
consequences associated with dietar y choices,
but not currently ref lected in their costs.

The health impacts associated with poor qualit y
diets are significant for many people in the
world. In addition to the health and social costs
associated with undernutrition, unhealthy diets
are a leading risk factor for deaths and disabilit y
associated with from non-communicable diseases
(NCDs). Increasing healthcare costs linked to
rising obesit y rates are a trend across the world,
and both overweight and obesit y are significant
risk factors for NCDs. Out of 56.9 million
global deaths in 2016, 40.5 million, or 71 percent,
were due to NCDs. 2 The four main NCDs are
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and
chronic lung diseases.

Specifically, this section presents new estimates
of the health and climate-change costs
associated with current food consumption
patterns. Based on the estimates, the section
determines the impacts of shifting dietar y
patterns towards healthy diets that include
sustainabilit y considerations. y This exercise
can inform food policy to incentivize dietar y
changes towards healthy diets that are more
environmentally sustainable.

Current global methods of food production also
result in negative environmental impacts, 72
with repercussion for societ y as a whole. This is
seen for example in countries where energ y
intake and consumption of animal source
foods is too high, a rebalancing of the diets

y In order to examine these impacts, particularly in terms of the
associated health and climate-change costs, current food consumption
patterns are compared with four alternative dietary patterns that
include aspects of environmental sustainability. For presentational
purposes, the remainder of this report refers to these as “four
alternative healthy diets” based on a comprehensive review of the
literature on healthy eating and food system sustainability. However,
the four alternative diet scenarios are only examples of many other
possible healthy dietary patterns, and may not be the most healthy and
appropriate diets for all population groups.

x There are no universally agreed-upon discount rates – rates used to
convert future damages to present values. Therefore sensitivity analysis
is necessary, but it is also important to consider equity issues –
especially intergenerational equity issues – hidden in discount rates.
Stern (2008)348 presents an interesting discussion on the difficulties and
common mistakes made in estimating a discount rate for climatechange economic analysis.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Considering total global consumption, a
rebalancing of consumption towards healthy
diets that takes into account environmental
sustainabilit y would significantly reduce
negative externalities, creating synergies for
other SDGs. However, this global pattern
does not need to result in a decrease in each
countr y. At the national level, the impact of this
rebalancing depends on a countr y’s existing
food securit y and nutrition situation, the speed
at which it has been able to make progress, and
the magnitude of health and environmental
externalities. For some countries, a shift may
imply trade-offs, and the downsides may last
for some time. For example, the current diet
of a young child in a low-income countr y may
have a low environmental footprint, but its
nutritional content may be inadequate. In this
case, the environmental impact may have to
increase to meet the desired nutritional targets
first. Another example is the diversification
of production that is needed for healthy food
items. To minimize unfavourable trade-offs, the
livelihoods of family farmers and smallholder
producers for whom transition to diversification
is not immediately feasible should be prioritized,
particularly in countries where food systems
not only provide food but also drive the rural
economy. Hence, this section offers ideas for
prioritizing and making the most of synergies
while avoiding unfavourable trade-offs along the
transformation of food systems.

The two hidden costs have been estimated for
five different dietar y patterns: one baseline
or benchmark diet, representing current food
consumption patterns and four alternative
healthy diet patterns that include sustainabilit y
considerations. z The four alternative healthy
diet patterns analysed here differ from the
healthy diet analysed in Section 2.1, in that
these four diets not only are optimized
for health, but also include env ironmental
sustainabilit y considerations. For estimating
the health costs, updated estimates of the
health burden of dietar y risks (associated
with their contribution to diet-related
NCDs) were combined with cost-of-illness
estimates. For estimating climate-change costs,
food-consumption estimates were combined
with updated GHG emissions footprints and
estimates of the costs of climate damages
associated with such emissions, as expressed
in the social cost of carbon. Hence, a number
of env ironmental costs are not being accounted
for. A brief description of the methods and
baseline data for this estimation are prov ided in
Box 14, with a more comprehensive description of
the data and methodolog y prov ided in Annex 7.
For the analysis, this report focuses on the
projected health and climate change burden in
the year 2030 as a politically relevant timeframe
in light of the target year of the SDGs, and more
specifically for achieving the SDG 2 targets for
ending hunger, food insecurit y and all forms of
malnutrition. aa

A valuation of hidden costs
of dietary patterns

Underlying the valuation of the health and
climate-change cost analysis are estimates of
current and future food consumption and the four
alternative consumption scenarios that have been
devised as being healthy and include sustainability
considerations. Current food demand, referred to »

This report’s valuation of hidden costs of
dietar y patterns includes separate valuations
of health and climate-change costs, but
does not consider many other potential
environmental costs. Nonetheless, health and
climate-change costs are critical to consider in
any transformation of food systems aimed at
delivering affordable, healthy diets that include
sustainabilit y considerations. While these two
costs are different in nature – one directly
affecting only some people (health), the other
affecting the world as a whole – here they
are also evaluated together to understand
their full impact on current and future food
production systems.

z The analysis has been carried out in collaboration with the
University of Oxford, and is an update to a previous analysis on the
valuation of the health and climate-change benefits of dietary
change.84 In particular, the new analysis of this report increases the
number of dietary risk factors covered in the health analysis and
valuation; uses more recent emissions data in the environmental
analysis; and updates the diet scenarios to a standardized set of
healthy diets that include sustainability considerations that are analysed
as a means of reducing the negative health and climate-change costs
imposed on society.
aa Analyses for the years 2010, 2020 and 2050 were carried out for
sensitivity analysis.

VALUATION OF HEALTH AND CLIMATE-CHANGE COSTS: BASELINE DATA AND METHODS
The quantification of the health and environmental
costs are related to a dietary shift from national
average food consumption patterns to healthy diets
that include sustainability considerations. To quantify
health costs, a region-specific health model that covers
dietary and weight-related risk factors was used.
To quantify environmental costs, emissions accounting
and economic valuation models were used.

The four alternative healthy diet patterns were
developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy
Diets from Sustainable Food Systems, based on a
comprehensive review of the literature on healthy
eating and food system sustainability:79 a flexitarian
diet (FLX), which contains small to moderate amounts
of all animal source foods; a pescatarian diet (PSC),
which contains moderate amounts of fish but no
other meat; a vegetarian diet (VEG), which contains
moderate amounts of dairy and eggs, but no fish
or other meat; and a vegan diet (VGN), which is
completely plant-based consisting of a variety of fruits
and vegetables, whole grains and plant-based protein
sources, such as legumes and nuts. These diets are in
line with observed dietary patterns.80,81,82 See Annex 7
for full description of these diets.

BASELINE DATA AND FOUR ALTERNATIVE HEALTHY
DIET PATTERNS
For the baseline diet, food availability estimates in the
year 2010 are taken from a harmonized data set of
FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) that includes the full set
of 16 food commodities. Food availability estimates are
used as a proxy for national average food consumption,
after applying regional data on food wastage at the
consumption level combined with conversion factors
into edible matter (see Annex 7). Underlying the
analysis, there are estimates of national average food
consumption in the base year 2010, as well as future
food consumption projected in year 2030, which is
estimated considering expected changes in income,
population and dietary preferences.75 In this analysis,
national average food consumption is referred to as
the benchmark diet (BMK) or current food consumption
patterns in reporting results.
Starting from food availability estimates, the
International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural
Commodities and Trade (IMPACT)74 was used to
simulate the benchmark as well as four alternative
healthy diet patterns that include sustainability
considerations in 157 countries in year 2030.
Projections were also carried out for year 2050 for
sensitivity analysis. In the IMPACT model, regional
commodity prices are endogenously determined by
market-clearing conditions that take into account
changes in world prices, trade policies and costs,
and producer and consumer support measures in
national markets. Commodity prices in the base year
were based on data from the Agricultural Market
Access Database of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development,76,77 and estimates of
export and import tariffs were adopted from the Global
Trade Analysis Project (GTAP).78

METHODS TO ESTIMATE HEALTH COSTS
For estimating the health costs, the proportions of
mortality and disease cases attributable to dietary
and weight-related risk factors were first calculated,
with a focus on NCDs. These are the proportions that
would be avoided if the risk exposure changed from
current food consumption patterns to any of the four
alternative healthy diet patterns. Changes in mortality
at the regional level were calculated by multiplying
these proportions by region, disease- and age-specific
death rates and population numbers. For measuring
the health burden of diets, methods developed by
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project were
followed, using a comparative risk assessment
framework of dietary and weight-related risks.83 The
assessment included four disease endpoints: coronary
heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
cancer (both in aggregate and as site-specific
cases, such as colon and rectal cancer)80 in line with
available cost-of-illness estimates.84 The risk factors
included seven dietary risks: low intake of fruits,
vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains, as well
as high intake of red meat and processed meat.
The risk factors included also three weight-related
risks: being underweight, overweight or obese.
Note that high intake of sodium is not included in
this analysis as a risk factor. Although, ideally, cost
estimates would also include the costs related to

(CONTINUED)
the health impact of undernutrition, both in terms of
deaths and lost productivity, such estimates have not
been included because data for these estimations do
not exist. For this reason the estimated costs are likely
to be underestimated.
To quantify the cost of health impacts, the
cost-of-illness approach was used. For estimating the
health costs of diets, the estimates of cause-specific
attributable deaths obtained from the comparative risk
assessment were paired with cost-of-illness estimates.
The latter capture both the direct (i.e. medical and
healthcare costs) and indirect (costs of informal
care and lost working days) costs associated with a
specific disease.1

over time were accounted for by incorporating
the mitigation potential of bottom-up changes in
management practices and technologies from
marginal abatement cost curves, in line with previous
assessments. Finally, for monetizing the GHG
emissions, estimates of the social cost of carbon
(SCC) were used, which represent the economic
cost caused by an additional tonne of GHG
emissions. In particular, estimates come from a fully
revised version of the Dynamic Integrated model of
Climate and the Economy (DICE) for a scenario that
constrains a future temperature rise to 2.5 degrees
(with the temperature limit averaged over 100 years)
in line with policy goals.73,90,91
For future years, this report accounted for
improvements in the emissions intensities of foods
over time by incorporating the mitigation potential
of bottom-up changes in management practices and
technologies from marginal abatement cost curves90
in line with previous assessments.80 The mitigation
options included changes in irrigation, cropping
and fertilization that reduce methane and nitrous
oxide emissions for rice and other crops, as well as
changes in manure management, feed conversion
and feed additives that reduce enteric fermentation
in livestock. In line with commitments made as part
of the SDGs, this report also included a halving
of food loss and waste by 2030 in development
pathway. For monetizing the GHG emissions, this
report used estimates of the SCC, which represents
the economic cost caused by an additional tonne of
GHG emissions.

METHODS TO ESTIMATE CLIMATE-CHANGE COSTS
For estimating the climate-change costs of diets, the
GHG emissions associated with food consumption
were calculated and then paired with cost estimates
of climate damages. For the former, a set of
emissions factors derived from life-cycle assessments
were adopted, including a global life-cycle
assessment with regional detail covering livestock
products, which was undertaken by FAO,85 and a
comprehensive meta-analysis of life-cycle assessments
of other food products.86 The assessments included
all main emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide) and sources along the food supply chain
from the farm gate to the retail point: production,
processing, transport, including international trade,
and, for livestock products, land use and feed
production. For fish and seafood, wild-caught and
farmed fish production were differentiated87 and
paired with the associated emissions footprints.88,89
Improvements in the emissions intensities of foods

* Veganism in free-living populations tends to be associated with religious reasons or particular health consciousness; furthermore, non-biased intervention trials involving direct
comparison of vegan diets with various other dietary patterns and examination of long-term health effects are essentially non-existent.92 Although the vegan diet may result in positive
health outcomes in countries with ample food choice, access to supplements or an abundance of highly fortified foods, it is not likely to be applicable for many countries, and is not an
acceptable diet for young children and pregnant or lactating women in many contexts. Vegetarian diets are also likely to have similar (albeit smaller) issues relating to meeting nutrient
adequacy, and in pregnancy require careful monitoring to ensure essential nutrients are met.

This can be the case in settings where overall
diet qualit y is low: e.g. where micronutrients

below, is estimated based on a harmonized
data set of food availability estimates by FAO.
Future food demand is estimated considering
expected changes in income, population and
dietary preferences. 74 The food demand projections
are comparable with other estimates. 75
Four alternative healthy diet patterns are
analysed: a predominantly plant-based f lexitarian
diet which contains small to moderate amounts
of animal source foods; a pescatarian diet that
is based on sustainable aquaculture and which
contains moderate amounts of fish but no other
meat; a vegetarian diet that includes moderate
amounts of dair y and eggs, but no fish or other
meat; and a completely plant-based, vegan diet
that is based on a variet y of fruits and vegetables,
whole grains and plant-based protein sources,
such as leg umes and nuts. These diets conform to
the general recommendations of the EAT-Lancet
Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable
Food Systems and take into account regional
preferences for specific staple crops, fruits,
vegetables and other food categories, as well as
population-specific energ y requirements (Box 14).

Hidden health costs
As highlighted in Section 1.3 of this report,
a healthy diet ensures adequate calories and
nutrients, and includes a balanced, diverse intake
of foods from several different food groups
eaten over a period of time. It is intended to
meet all requirements of nutrient adequacy and
to help prevent malnutrition in all its forms,
as well as NCDs. Diets of poor quality are a
principal contributor to the multiple burdens of
malnutrition, like stunting, wasting, micronutrient
deficiencies, overweight and obesity. Both
undernutrition early in life and overweight and
obesity are significant risk factors for NCDs.95
Estimating the health costs related to poor
quality diets, including the multiple burdens of
malnutrition and related NCDs, is fraught with
challenges related to data availability and the
sheer complexity of the interrelated outcomes.
One of the biggest challenges is that there is a lack
of data on the costs related to the health impacts
of undernutrition, both in terms of deaths and lost
productivity. There are a few case studies of cost
estimates for undernutrition.96,97 For example, it
is projected that undernutrition will reduce gross
domestic product (GDP) by up to 11 percent in
Africa and Asia by 2050.98 Yet global estimates are
few. The lack of comprehensive comparable data,
however, prevents global modelling efforts from
capturing the full effect of diets on undernutrition,
including on children and adolescents. ac

The purpose of identif ying the four alternative
diet patterns is to examine the hidden costs
for different healthy diets that include aspects
of environmental sustainabilit y, rather than to
endorse any particular dietar y pattern. The four
alternative diet scenarios are only examples, and
other variations could be developed for a similar
analysis of hidden costs. While there is a range
of healthy diets, based in global g uidelines,
that can be designed to include sustainabilit y
considerations, not all are the most healthy
and appropriate diets for all population groups.
The purely plant-based diets in particular can
carr y large risks of nutrient inadequacies. ab
ab Veganism in free-living populations tends to be associated with
particular health consciousness; furthermore, intervention trials of vegan
diets that are related to direct comparison of vegan diets with various
other dietary patterns, that are defended from bias, and that examine
long-term health effects are essentially non-existent.92 Although the
vegan diet may result in positive health outcomes in countries with ample
food choice, access to supplements or an abundance of highly fortified
foods, it is not likely to be applicable for many countries, and is not an
acceptable diet for young children and pregnant or lactating women in
many contexts. Vegetarian diets are also likely to have similar (albeit
smaller) issues relating to meeting nutrient adequacy, and in pregnancy
require careful monitoring to ensure essential nutrients are met.

ac Although there is a lack of global comparable data, there are
some case studies. For example, the economic impact of undernutrition
resulting from productivity losses as a consequence of higher death
rates and lower levels of education can be considerable, and have
been shown to range between 1.7 percent and 11.4 percent of GDP in
countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic and four
South American countries (see ECLAC and WFP [2007]349 and
[2009]350 ). In addition to these economic considerations, the problems
associated with child undernutrition are not limited to the life cycle of
each individual, but can affect that person’s children, who will also be
more vulnerable (see ECLAC and WFP [2007]349).

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Even considering only obesit y, estimated
economic costs from existing studies var y
considerably due to the different methodologies
used to estimate indirect and direct costs. 95,99
For example, estimates from the United States
of America range from USD 89 billion to
USD 212 billion in total costs per year; those from
China are estimated at 3.6 and 8.7 percent of
gross national product (GNP) in 2020 and 2025,
respectively; and for Brazil, it is projected that
there could be a doubling of the obesit y-related
healthcare costs from USD 5.8 billion in 2010 to
USD 10.1 billion in 2050.

analysis presented in this report only relate to
the loss of productivit y/working days, and the
costs of informal care.
As mentioned above, ideally cost estimates
should include the costs related to the health
impact of undernutrition, both in terms of
deaths and lost productivit y due to diets that
are not sufficiently nutritious. However, data
for these estimations do not exist. The health
costs presented here, therefore, are likely to be
underestimated. Despite these data limitations,
the current analysis provides important insights
on the costs and health benefits of consuming
healthy diets.

There are also data limitations on the healthcare
costs and the effect of obesit y and overweight
on productivit y and disabilities, as these have
rarely been studied in low- and middle-income
countries, despite the fact that more than
70 percent of all obese or overweight people in
the world live in these contexts. The most widely
quoted, for 2014, reports that obesit y is projected
to cost USD 2 trillion annually by 2050, largely
driven by the value placed on lost economic
productivit y plus direct healthcare costs.100

Results
Shifting to healthy diets, including not only
cutting out energ y-dense foods of minimal
nutritional value, but also increasing the
diversit y of nutritious foods, is associated with
significant reductions in mortalit y. This finding
is seen across all four healthy diet scenarios,
looking at average estimates of avoided deaths
in 2030 compared with the benchmark scenario
of national average current food consumption
patterns (Figure 32). At the global level, for
example, the adoption of the f lexitarian diet
would result on average in 12.7 million avoided
deaths, ranging between a minimum of 7 and
a maximum of 18.3 million avoided deaths.
For the other three diet patterns, avoided deaths
are projected to be even higher: an average
of 13.2 million (7.5 –18.9) for the pescatarian,
12.9 million (7.3 –18.6) for the vegetarian and
13.7 million (7.9–19.4) for the vegan diet (Figure 32).

In valuing the economic impacts of poor qualit y
diets, it is not only linked to mortalit y and the
direct medical and healthcare costs associated
with treating a specific disease, but also
involves indirect costs. The indirect costs can be
significant, accounting for up to 60 percent of
the total costs of being overweight or obese.101
They include, for example, reduced educational
attainment, lower lifetime earnings, costs of
informal care, loss of productivit y, increased
disabilities and loss of working days.

Moving away from the global averages,
important differences in health benefits emerge
across regions and country income groups.
Middle-income countries, which represent
69 percent of the world population in 2030,
have the most to gain in terms of reduced
mortality by switching to any of the four
alternative diet scenarios. Between 73 and
75 percent of avoided deaths in the world,
across the four diets, occur in middle-income
countries. Specifically, the highest percentage
of deaths avoided (range 54–56 percent) would
be seen in lower-middle-income countries,
followed by upper-middle-income countries
(range 19–20 percent), high-income countries

Despite these challenges, valuating the health
impacts of diet-related diseases, specifically
NCDs, provides a useful indication of the level
of impacts. This report provides a comparative
analysis of the health benefits of global dietar y
changes for all major regions in the world and
by countr y income group. The analysis of hidden
costs or externalities related to the health impact
of diets combines two parameters: the estimated
number of deaths due to four specific NCDs
(coronar y heart disease, stroke, cancer, t ype 2
diabetes mellitus), and the estimated health
costs associated with those NCDs. Due to data
limitations, the indirect costs included in the

and type-2 diabetes mellitus. The y-axis shows the number of deaths avoided in 2030 by moving from the benchmark diet of national average food consumption to the four healthy and
sustainable dietary patterns. The four alternative healthy diet patterns for the analysis include the flexitarian (FLX), the pescatarian (PSC), the vegetarian (VEG) and the vegan (VGN)
diet (see footnote y for more information). See Box 14 for the definition of the five diets and a summary of the methods and data sources. For the full methodological notes, see Annex 7.

On a per capita basis, taking account of the
total population in each countr y income group,
36 percent of per capita avoided deaths are
projected to occur in upper-middle-income
countries. This is followed by 30 percent
in high-income countries, 23 percent in
lower-middle-income countries and 11 percent
in low-income countries.

(17–19 percent) and low-income countries
(8 percent), whose reduced mortality is the
same across the four diets. The low percentages
in low-income countries are explained by the
fact that mortality is only measured in terms
of NCDs, which are major causes of mortality
in higher-income countries. In low-income
countries, major causes of mortality are more
related to the multiple forms of communicable,
maternal, neonatal conditions and undernutrition.
Of the low- and middle-income countries, the
largest proportion of health benefits in terms
of avoided deaths from adopting any of the
four diet scenarios, 22–23 percent, is found in
South-eastern Asian countries.

Further insight is gained by examining the
contribution of the weight-related risk factors
(obesit y, overweight and underweight) and
diet-related risk factors (by food group) to the
total avoided death. This shows that for the four
diet scenarios, the majorit y of avoidable deaths

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

(on average 68 percent) are due to imbalances in
dietar y composition. The remaining 32 percent of
the avoided deaths are due to imbalanced weight
levels (see Annex 8, Table A8.1).

UNDER CURRENT FOOD CONSUMPTION
PATTERNS, DIET-RELATED HEALTH COSTS ARE
PROJECTED TO REACH USD 1.3 TRILLION PER
YEAR IN 2030

Assuming that current food consumption
patterns accommodate expected changes in
income and population, as per in the benchmark
scenario (BMK), health costs are projected to
amount to an average of USD 1.3 trillion in 2030
(Figure 33). More than half (57 percent) of these
are direct healthcare costs as they are associated
with expenses related to treating the different
diet-related diseases. The other part (43 percent)
accounts for indirect costs, including losses in
labour productivit y (11 percent) and informal
care (32 percent).

DIET-RELATED HEALTH COSTS IN 2030 (USD BILLION)

Across countr y income groups (Annex 8,

by the general level of healthcare spending
(healthcare costs are highest in high-income
countries) and by population numbers
(middle-income countries have the largest share
of world population, estimated at 76 percent).
Hence, the greatest costs are seen in high-income
countries (USD 637 billion), followed by
lower-middle-income countries (USD 415 billion),
upper-middle-income countries (USD 252 billion)
and low-income countries (USD 17 billion).

and indirect costs (indirect loss of productivity per working days and the costs of

If, instead, any of the four alternative diet
patterns used for the analyses are adopted (FLX,
PSC, V EG, VGN), diet-related health costs
dramatically decrease by USD 1.2–1.3 trillion,
representing an average reduction of 95 percent
of the diet-related health expenditures worldwide
compared to the benchmark scenario in 2030
(Figure 34).

lower-middle-income countries derives mostly
from savings on indirect costs, which include
avoided productivit y losses and days not worked,
potentially leading to positive second-round
effects for livelihoods and growth in the
economy overall.

Although most avoidable deaths would be found
in middle-income countries (more than twice as
many as in high-income countries), on average,
49 percent of all cost savings would occur in
high-income countries due to their higher
health expenditure.

Hidden climate-change costs
What people eat, and how that food is produced,
not only affects their health, but also has major
ramifications for the state of the environment
and for climate change. Most global and
cross-countr y valuations of environmental
impacts focus on GHG emissions, because
data limitations hamper global cross-countr y
comparisons of other important environmental
impacts related to land use, energ y and water use.

Lower-middle-income countries not only
stand to benefit from the highest number
of avoided deaths, but their cost saving is
also significant, second only to high-income
countries. More important, this cost saving in

During the 2007–2016 period, the food
system underpinning the world’s current
food consumption patterns was responsible
for 21–37 percent of total anthropogenic
GHG emissions (meaning originating in human
activit y), which presents it as a major driver
of climate change, even without considering
other environmental effects.102,ad This estimate
includes emissions of 10 –12 percent from

crop and livestock activities at the farm gate;
8 –10 percent from land use and land-use
change, including deforestation and peatland
degradation; and 5 –10 percent from supply chain
activities, including GHG emissions from food
loss and waste.
Increases in GHG emissions and other
environmental impacts are set to continue to
rise under current food consumption patterns
and food systems. FAO estimates that the
world will need to produce about 50 percent
more food by 2050 to feed the growing world
population, assuming no changes occur in food
loss and waste.103 If current dietar y patterns
and food systems remain, this would engender
significant increases in GHG emissions and

ad Food system emissions include CO2 and non-CO2 gases,
specifically those generated from: i) crop and livestock activities at the
farm gate; ii) land use and land-use change dynamics associated with
agriculture; and iii) food processing, retail and consumption patterns,
including upstream and downstream processes such as manufacture of
chemical fertilizers and fuel. In addition, food systems are a major
driver of land conversion, deforestation and loss of biodiversity.
Agriculture alone accounts for approximately 70 percent of global
freshwater withdrawals and is a major contributor to water pollution.

other environmental impacts, including loss
of biodiversit y, soil degradation, pollution and
water use.

foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains,
leg umes, nuts and seeds, and lower in trans and
saturated fats, free of sugars and salt. Such diets
have the potential to be both healthy and
include sustainabilit y considerations, but this
requires both climate change and health being
considered together.

Many studies indicate that dietar y shifts
can significantly reduce GHG emissions.
Setting dietar y and nutritional goals with no
consideration for the environment could in
some cases increase GHG emissions.136 For
instance, several studies highlight that if current
dietar y trends are maintained, this could lead
to a significant climate-change emissions from
agriculture of approximately 20 GtCO 2 -eq per
year by 2050. 73,84,104,105,106,107,108 A few studies
show contrasting results, but they focus on one
or more dietar y components of self-selected
healthy diets (diets freely chosen by consumers).
One study found that the lowest emission diets
analysed were lower in meat but higher in oil,
refined grains and added sugar.109

Healthy diets present important opportunities
for reducing GHG emissions in some contexts,
because they are rich in plant-based foods
that emit lower GHG levels compared with
diets that are heav y in red meat consumption.
However, this may not be the best option in
order to pursue a reduction in GHG emissions,
especially in contexts where consumption of red
meat and dair y can provide valuable sources of
essential nutrients to v ulnerable populations,
particularly to prevent undernutrition. There is
no exact make-up of a healthy diet that includes
sustainabilit y considerations, but the g uiding
principles for a healthy diet are the same (see
Section 1.3, Box 5). One of these g uiding principles
is that a healthy diet can contain animal source
foods in moderate to small amounts. Specifically,
a healthy diet can include moderate amounts
of eggs, dair y, poultr y, fish and small amounts
of red meat. This principle based on health
considerations, also presents an opportunit y
for countries to make the shift to healthy diets
and simultaneously contribute to reductions in
GHG emissions.

Recent analyses have highlighted that
reductions in consumption of meat and dair y
in many diets would not only have health
benefits in many countries but would have
significant environmental benefits. The analyses
have shown that reductions in global meat
consumption and other dietar y changes, for
instance, would ease pressure on land use 84,86,110
and reduce GHG emissions. 86,106,110,111 Other
studies have found that rebalancing consumption
towards healthy diets could help significantly
cut emissions from the food systems 111 and may
be essential to avoid negative environmental
impacts, such as major agricultural expansion105
and global warming of more than 2 degrees,106
while ensuring access to safe and affordable food
for an increasing global population.112

Not all healthy diets include aspects of
sustainabilit y because there is no “unique”
healthy diet. For example, most of the national
FBDGs that define a national healthy diet are
highly variable in their recommendations and
generally do not include aspects of sustainabilit y.
While some FBDGs are associated with
reductions in GHG emissions, these reductions
are generally estimated to be moderate.
Most FBDGs are not compatible with a set of
global environmental targets related to climate
change and environmental resources. The policy
measures that shift production and consumption
to healthy diets are not explicitly designed to
address the climate change problems of the
world. But healthy diets that include aspects of
sustainabilit y present important opportunities
for synergies for reducing GHG emissions.
The four diet scenarios analysed are only four

The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) Special report on Climate Change
provides an in-depth examination of GHG
emissions in relation to climate mitigation and
food securit y and concludes there are significant
opportunities to achieve both objectives
simultaneously 102 by adopting diets in line
with health-based dietar y recommendations.

(FBDGs) for healthy eating are based on global
g uidelines 46 and are broadly similar across
most countries. They are t ypically capped by

waste as livestock feed and recycling manure
for energ y and nutrients).115,116,117,118 Land-use
reg ulation, combating desertification and halting
biodiversit y loss are also important.102 These
approaches can also contribute to reducing the
cost of healthy diets.

Simply put, not all healthy diets are sustainable
and not all diets designed for sustainabilit y
are always healthy or adequate for all
population groups. This important nuance
is not well understood and is often missing
from ongoing discussions and debates on
the potential contribution of healthy diets to
environmental sustainabilit y.

As stated previously, data limitations hamper
global cross-countr y comparisons of other
important environmental impacts related to
land, energ y and water use. This has of course
limited this report’s own global analysis, which
looks at the hidden climate-change costs by
focusing exclusively on GHG emissions and their
climate impacts. Nonetheless, Table 9 summarizes
additional evidence from the literature on the
impact of current dietar y patterns on these other
environmental impacts, and the estimations
of potential impacts from shifting to healthy
diet patterns that include sustainabilit y
considerations. Another environmental impact to
consider is food biodiversit y, which is essential
for g uaranteeing diverse diets around the
world.119 One of the main factors inf luencing
biodiversit y loss is land-use change and diets.
Animal source foods, in particular, have been one
of the main contributors to biodiversit y loss.120

Dietary shifts that include sustainability
considerations can play an important role as
part of a broader strateg y, for increasing the
environmental sustainability of food systems.
These include limiting the impacts of diets on
the environment through technological and
productivity advancements, sustainable and
integrated land and natural resource use, and
enhanced efficiencies and innovations along
the food supply chain, including those aimed at
reducing food loss and waste. Limiting the impacts
of diets on the environment in this way may help
create a virtuous circle, or a recurring cycle of
events, each having a beneficial effect on the next,
as all the enhancements contribute to reducing the
environmental cost of producing nutritious food.
This is further explained in the next section.

Results
Due to data availabilit y constraints to conduct
a global and regional analysis, this report
presents estimates on the environmental costs
of diets focusing only on GHG emissions.
For this reason, this report makes more
reference to climate-change costs rather than
all environmental costs. A two-step approach
is adopted. In the first step, GHG emissions
associated with food consumption are calculated.
In the second step, these emissions are paired
with cost estimates of climate damages to gauge
the climate-change costs of each dietar y pattern
(see Annex 7 for the methodolog y and data
sources and Annex 8 for additional fig ures and
tables). Both steps present important results with
policy implications.

Though beyond the scope of this report, there
is an abundance of technological knowledge
and practices that can inform a combination of
approaches for increasing the environmental
sustainabilit y of food systems.113 One example
is sustainable land management practices
which do not require land use change and do
not create demand for more land conversion,
including sustainable management of cropland
and grazing lands, livestock, forest, fisheries
and aquaculture production.102 Another example
is integrated agricultural production systems
that use efficient climate-smart agricultural
practices, such as integrated rice and fish
farming and integrated crop-livestock systems.114
Addressing the contribution of livestock
production to GHG emissions is critical, but
there are numerous sustainable efficiency
enhancements that can be adapted and applied
across the diverse livestock production systems
(e.g. promoting the use of by-products and

Moving towards healthy diets

A systematic review found
that the “vegan diet” showed
the largest reductions in land

median of 55%. 122

Another study estimated that
healthy diets that include
sustainability considerations
would incur in an increase

Still another study estimated a
range of reduction between
8% to 11% measured as
million km2 by year, depending
of the dietary scenario.80

Energy use

Another study estimated that
a “vegetarian” dietary
scenario would reduce land
use in 16 million hectares
compared to a 2009
baseline. 86
Still another study found the
largest reduction on land use
was associated with the
“pescatarian” dietary
scenario, with reduction of
11% (million km 2/year). 80

Global estimates are not
available. For the United
States of America, it has
been estimated that the
average American diet
accounts for 19% of the total
energy consumption in the
country. 123

Only related to the use of
fossil fuel, it has been
estimated that shifting to
healthy diets that include
sustainability considerations
would reduce by 3% the fuel
consumption related to the
food system in the United
States of America. 124

Shifting to an “energy-use
efficient” diet would reduce
by 74% the fuel use of the
United States food system. 124

The use of freshwater in our
current dietary patterns is
estimated to be 1 506 km 3, 80
while a systematic study
found that the total water
footprint for different country
dietary patterns around the
world ranged from 688 to 8
341 litres per capita per
day. 125

A systematic study found that
moving towards healthy diets
that include sustainability
considerations would reduce
the water footprint of diets
with median of 18%
(l/capita/day). 122

A systematic review
estimated a median reduction
of 37% in the total water
footprint (l/capita/day) by
the adoption of a
“vegetarian” diet scenario. 122

In another study, moving
towards healthy diets that
include sustainability
considerations would reduce
the water footprint of diets
between 2% and 11%
compared with the current
scenario. 80

Another study estimated a
reduction of 25% of the total
water footprint by the
adoption of a dietary
scenario with no animal
source foods
(l/capita/day). 125
Still another study, the
largest reductions in
freshwater use would result
from a shift to a flexitarian
diet (11%), while shifting to a
vegan diet shows the lowest
reduction rate in freshwater
use (2%). 80

» changes). This represents 13 percent of estimated

milk and dair y (25 percent), which were
the greatest contributors at the global level.
These global findings echo those of other
studies on the climate implications of rising
meat and dair y intake. They also reiterate the
importance of reducing animal-product intake

any of the four alternative healthy diet patterns ae
worldwide would reduce projected diet-related
GHG emission by 41–74 percent (Figure 35).

More than half of all emissions under current
food consumption patterns (4.2 GtCO 2-eq or
52 percent) are associated with food demand from
lower-middle-income countries (Annex 8, Table A8.2).

are largest in upper-middle-income countries

af This is in line with other studies, for example, Kim et al. (2019),
who find that whether by serving, energy content, protein, or mass,
ruminant meats (i.e. bovine, sheep and goat) are by far the most
GHG-intensive items. Per serving, bovine meat (weighted average
6.54 kg C02e/serving) was 316, 115 and 40 times more GHG-intensive
than pulses, nuts and seeds, and soy.

capita GHG footprint to meet energ y needs and
the recommended protein intake (12 percent
of energ y). For example, in Figure 36, Uganda’s
GHG footprint (solid cur ve) is below the
dashed line, meaning the countr y would need
to increase its per capita GHG footprint to meet
energ y needs and recommended protein intake.
In contrast, the GHG footprint of the United
States of A merica is above the line, meaning
the countr y exceeds energ y needs and that
just by decreasing energ y and maintaining at
least 12 percent of energ y from protein, some
reduction in GHG emissions can be achieved.
Moreover, by shifting dietar y patterns to
be more plant-for ward, GHG emissions in
countries towards the left of the cur ve could be
cut even further.

Important differences in climate benefits
emerge when viewing the results by region
and countr y income group under the four
alternative diet patterns (Figure 35). The reduction
in emissions as a result of the adoption of
any of the four alternative healthy dietar y
patterns ag ranges between 45 and 78 percent
in middle-income countries (MICs), which
represent 69 percent of the world population in
2030. The highest percentage of reduction of
emissions (range 60 –86 percent) would occur
in upper-middle-income countries, followed by
high-income countries (range 60 –77 percent),
lower-middle-income countries (31–70 percent)
and low-income countries (27– 68 percent).
Of the low- and middle-income countries, the
greatest reduction of GHG emissions would be
65 –88 percent as seen in Latin America and
the Caribbean.

Climate-change costs associated with different dietary patterns
To estimate the climate-change costs associated
with alternative diets, GHG emissions were
monetized using estimates of the social cost
of carbon, which represents the economic
cost resulting from each additional tonne of
GHG emissions. This builds on a previous study 84
but uses estimates from a fully revised version
of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate
and the Economy (DICE) for a scenario that
constrains future global temperature rise (with
the temperature limit averaged over 100 years) to
a limit of 2.5 degrees, in line with stated policy
goals. 91 This scenario is referred to as the “DICE
2016 T2.5”. The social cost of carbon values in
that scenario was USD/tCO 2-eq 107, 204 and 543
for the years 2015, 2030 and 2050. ai

The global and countr y income group aggregates
hide important variations across subregions
and countries. These, in turn, indicate that
there are potential trade-offs that need to be
managed as countries transform food systems
towards healthy diets that include sustainabilit y
considerations. For example, countries with
high burdens of undernourishment and
multiple forms of malnutrition might see their
consumption-related emissions rise as growing
shares of their population consume healthy
and nutrient adequate diets. In these cases,
fighting hunger and malnutrition by increasing
the diversit y of nutritious foods available for
infants and young children outweighs the
negative effects deriving from higher national
GHG emissions.

Current food consumption patterns pose
significant social cost in terms of GHG emissions
and climate change. The diet-related social
cost of GHG emissions related to current
food consumption patterns is estimated
to be around USD 1.7 trillion in 2030 for
an emissions-stabilization scenario (i.e.
the “Dice 2016 T2.5” scenario) that keeps global
temperature limited to a 2.5-degree increase
(averaged over 100 years). It is estimated to

the GHG emissions of nine increasingly
plant-for ward diets ah found that several
countries would need to increase their per

ai An alternative would have been to adopt social cost of carbon
values obtained for different discount rates (by which future damages
are converted to present values) for a reference path with current
policies, or to adopt social cost of carbon values for an “optimal
control” path, but neither of these options fulfilled stated policy
objectives with respect to limiting climate change.

Health and climate-change costs:
putting them into context

contribute to significant reductions of the social
cost of GHG emissions, ranging from USD 0.7 to
1.3 trillion (41–74 percent) in 2030 (Figure 37).

To put the health and climate-change costs into
context, it is useful to compare the hidden costs
with the wholesale costs of the diets, estimated
at the consumption level and valuated based
on estimates of commodit y prices by reg ion.
On the agg regate level, the wholesale costs of
diets mirror those assessed at the consumption
level, and hidden costs are not included (see
Annex 7 for the methodolog y for estimating the
wholesale costs of the diets).

About 75 percent of the social cost of
GHG emissions from current food consumption
patterns come from meat and dair y products.
The largest share is from beef (36 percent),
followed by milk (25 percent). Cereals account
for 11 percent of the total cost. The adoption
of any one of four alternative heathy dietar y
patterns could potentially lead to sig nificant
reductions in social cost of GHG emissions,
even by means of the f lexitarian diet that
includes moderate amounts of animal source
foods and small amounts of red meat (Annex 8,
Figure A8.4).

Combining the total cost of diets measured at
current wholesale prices and estimates of the
hidden health and climate-change costs allows
a more complete estimate of the full cost of
| 109 |

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

these diets. These full cost estimates can help
inform food policy to incentivize shifts towards
healthy diets that include sustainabilit y
considerations (see Section 1.3).

env ironmental externalities represent a cost of
USD 0.35, or 26 percent of the total cost.
Under the benchmark diet, the highest cost
of health and climate change externalities
are found in high- and upper-middle-income
countries: for USD 1 spent on food, these
external costs amount to an additional
USD 0.87 and USD 0.79, respectively.
This represents 47 and 44 percent of the full
cost (wholesale value, plus hidden cost) for
high- and upper-middle-income countries,
respectively. On the contrar y, the cost of health
and climate - change externalities are much
lower for low-income and lower-middle-income
countries, amounting to only USD 0.37 and
USD 0.35, respectively.

Total wholesale cost of each of the four
alternative healthy diet patterns al is found to
be above the wholesale cost of current diets in
low-income and some lower-middle-income
countries but not in high-income and many
upper-middle-income countries (Figure 38).
If the diet-related health and climate-change
costs were added to the total wholesale cost of
the benchmark diet representing the current
consumption pattern, then the full cost of this
benchmark diet would increase by 50 percent
globally, from USD 6.0 to USD 8.9 trillion by
2030. This increase ranges from 35 percent in
lower-middle-income countries to 87 percent in
high-income countries.

Of course, the estimated hidden costs or
externalities would be much higher than
USD 0.5 for ever y USD 1 spent on food, if data
were available to factor in the full range of
health impacts of malnutrition in all its forms,
including undernutrition, as well as all of the
current dietar y patterns’ environmental impacts
related to land use, energ y and water use.

On the other hand, if the diet-related health
and climate-change costs were added to the
total wholesale cost of the four alternative
diet patterns (FLX, PSC, V EG and VGN), then
the full cost of these diets globally would
only increase between 8 and 19 percent.
Overall, this translates into a significant cost
savings, compared with the benchmark diet.
Considering the full costs (wholesale cost and
diet-related health and climate-change costs),
the adoption of any of the four alternative
dietar y patterns would lead to reductions in
the full cost of diets between 22 and 29 percent
globally, ranging from 11–21 percent in
low-income countries to 52–58 percent in
high-income countries (Figure 38).

Ignoring the hidden costs of current
dietar y patterns would result in a serious
underestimation of the true cost of achieving
food securit y and nutrition and environmental
sustainabilit y. Bringing to light the previously
unaccounted for health and climate-change
costs can help inform concrete policies that
target such externalities, including fiscal
policies that incentivize a shift towards healthy
diets. As shown above, a shift to healthy diets
would bring about significant reductions in
both individual health costs and global carbon
footprint by 2030, compared with current
dietar y patterns. However, given that not all
healthy diets are sustainable and not all diets
designed for sustainabilit y are always healthy
for ever yone, the nature of this shift needs to be
decided carefully, as we explore further below.

Recognizing the externalities that result from
current food consumption patterns is therefore
important. The analysis shows that for ever y
USD 1 spent on food, health and climate
change externalities create an additional cost
of USD 0.5. Put differently, considering all the
costs (monetar y and external), the external cost
of food makes up one-third of the total cost.
However, there is some variation across reg ions.
In sub-Saharan African countries, for instance,
for ever y USD 1 spent on food, health and

Managing trade-offs and exploiting synergies
in the transition towards healthy diets that
include sustainability considerations

trade as well. The analysis also shows that
affordabilit y of healthy diets is a major barrier for
the majorit y of Indonesians, as the cost of healthy
diets is higher than the current average food
expenditure in the countr y. Similar conclusions
could be drawn for countries where large
parts of the population do not meet minimum
dietar y recommendations.

A shift towards healthy diets that also include
sustainabilit y considerations is essential, if we
are to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition,
and ensure the sustainabilit y of agriculture and
food production systems – in short, achieve
SDG 2. The challenge is huge, as most countries
do not meet or are unlikely to meet dietar y
recommendations for healthy diets by 2030 based
on current trends.

Clearly, the process of food systems
transformation will not be easy, and therefore
countries must carefully assess their own
context-specific barriers and manage the potential
trade-offs and synergies. For example, where
the food system not only provides food, but
also drives the rural economy, a shift towards
healthy diets could mean the loss of livelihoods
or incomes for small farmers and the rural poor as
well. In these cases, care must be taken to mitigate
the negative impact on incomes and livelihoods
as food systems transform to deliver affordable
healthy diets. Many lower-income countries whose
populations suffer nutrient deficiencies may also
need to increase their national GHG emissions in
order to first meet nutrition targets. Conversely, in
upper-middle-income countries and high-income
countries, where diet patterns exceed optimal
energ y requirements and people consume more
animal source foods than required, major changes
in dietary practices and system-wide changes in
food production patterns will be needed to reduce
their environmental impact.

This dietar y shift will require large
transformative changes in food systems at
all levels. Given the large diversit y of current
food systems and wide discrepancies in food
securit y and nutrition status across and within
countries, there is no one-size-fits-all solution
for countries to shift towards healthy diets and
create synergies to reduce their environmental
footprints. 44,73,80,84 Raising awareness and
inf luencing policy concerning healthy diets is
complicated because of persistently high levels
of hunger and undernutrition in many countries,
and low levels of understanding about the
multiple burdens of malnutrition and how they
are interconnected.
As noted previously, to address hunger and
malnutrition in all its forms, many countries
may need to increase their carbon footprint
in order to ensure that certain food items are
available to their population, particularly to
the most v ulnerable groups. This is illustrated
well in a countr y analysis covering Indonesia
(Box 15). Most Indonesians’ diets do not meet
minimum dietar y recommendations, but exceed
recommended levels of dietar y energ y intake
due to high consumption of rice, sugar and fats.
To increase dietar y diversit y, some increases
in food consumption-related GHG emissions
would therefore be necessar y. To lower the excess
energ y intake levels, a substantial reduction in
rice consumption would also be needed, even
though rice has been at the forefront of the
countr y’s food securit y policy. This would require
major changes in current dietar y practices
and food production, whose impacts would
reverberate across the entire food supply chain,
with impacts on domestic and international

Conclusion
Section 2.1 of this report highlighted that the cost
of a healthy diet must fall to an affordable level
for all, to enable people to consume a healthy
diet. But the matter of cost has another, broader
dimension to consider. Section 2.2 has further
shown that diets have hidden costs, whose
consideration is not only critical for meeting the
SDG 2 targets to end hunger and food insecurit y
and all forms of malnutrition by 2030, but also
other SDGs. Specifically, this section has brought
to light the health (SDG 3) and climate-related
(SDG 13) consequences of our dietar y patterns
and food systems that support these.
Using different variants of healthy diets as a
reference, this section has shown that a shift
towards healthy diets can result in savings

MOVING FROM CURRENT DIETARY PATTERNS TO HEALTHY DIETS THAT INCLUDE
SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS: BALANCING GOALS AND TRADE-OFFS IN INDONESIA
Energy intake is higher while protein intake is lower
than recommended by the Indonesian FBDGs.
Low dietary diversity in the country leads to an
inadequate intake of essential micronutrients, which
affects people’s short- and long-term health and
development; moreover, the current intake of nutritious
foods is too low to prevent NCDs. Furthermore, the
disproportionately high level of energy intake from
rice and foods high in fat and sugar increases
the prevalence of overweight and obesity, while
micronutrient deficiencies persist.
According to a recent analysis44,126 comparing
current consumption with a number of different
healthy diets that include sustainability considerations

Indonesia is an emerging lower-middle-income
country that has made enormous gains in poverty
reduction and whose prevalence of undernourishment
(PoU), currently at around 8 percent, is well below
the average for lower-middle-income countries.
Nevertheless, the country faces a triple burden of
malnutrition: more than one-third of children under
5 years of age are stunted, indicating a large
undernutrition problem; a quarter of all adults are
overweight or obese; micronutrient deficiencies
are widespread.
The current diets are dominated by staple
foods, mainly rice, which provides 70 percent of
dietary energy needs (see “baseline” diet, Figure A).

prevent undernutrition and its consequences for
human capital development, prevent the risks of
NCDs later in life, and promote healthy lives in
general. The challenge is that a more diversified
diet with less rice costs more and has higher
GHG emissions than diets consumed today, even
when limiting the increase of animal source foods
consumption and focusing on non-ruminants
and seafood as animal sources of proteins and
micronutrients. Two exceptions to this are the low
food chain and vegan diets, but these do not meet
nutrient needs.
Policies to improve access to and affordability
of more diversified, healthy diets that meet nutrient
needs while possibly contributing to reductions of
GHG emissions would need to focus on reducing the
cost of nutritious foods, adding nutritional value and
promoting the use of sustainable agricultural practices.
This could be done through food production, food
value chain optimization, food fortification and
creation of healthy food environments. This would
also require policies to provide better access to
nutritious foods to lower-income consumers through
social protection instruments, including school feeding
programmes and healthy public procurement policies.
More policy recommendations along these lines are
presented later.

(i.e. diets that help reduce climate-change costs), some
increases in food consumption-related GHG emissions
would be necessary for Indonesia to achieve global
dietary recommendations44,127,128,129,130,131,132,133 (Figure B).
The results show that current food consumption
patterns (“baseline”)127 provide 2 607 kcal and 56 g
of protein per capita per day. Reducing energy to
an amount that is more in line with estimated needs
for a healthy diet (i.e. 2 300 kcal/capita/day, and
ensuring that 12 percent of energy comes from
protein (69 g/capita/day), while maintaining relative
contributions of current dietary protein sources) would
result in a 15 percent increase in Indonesia’s GHG
emissions (“baseline adjusted”, see Figure B).
The recommended reduction in rice consumption
is substantial and would require major changes
in dietary practices and food production patterns.
Compared with current food consumption patterns,
the “no red meat”, “pescatarian”, “low food chain”

In terms of nutrient adequacy, the optimized diet

almost half of the full cost of their current food
consumption patterns (i.e. 47 to 44 percent
of the full cost, respectively). Indeed, looking
at per capita emissions under current food
consumption patterns, these are projected to be
the largest in upper-middle- and high-income
countries. Therefore, importantly, the bigger

in upper-income and high-income countries.

KEY MESSAGES
è Factors driving the cost of nutritious foods are

found throughout food systems, in the realms of food
production, food supply chains, food environments,
as well as consumer demand and the political
economy of food.

On the other hand, an seen from the above
regional and countr y-income distribution of the
social cost of GHG emissions, a real difference
can be made in lower-middle-income countries
given that by 2030 they would account for more
than half or 52 percent of the social cost of
GHG emissions under current food consumption
patterns, because they house the majorit y of
the world’s population. Small changes in these
countries can make a significant difference,
and the change that they need to make in terms
of change of diet is much smaller than the
changes needed in upper-middle-income and
high-income countries.

è Food production: Low levels of productivity,

high production risks and insufficient diversification
towards the production of more nutritious foods are
key drivers of the cost of healthy diets, especially in
low-income countries.

è Food supply chains: Inadequate food storage,

poor road infrastructure and limited food preservation
capacity, especially for highly perishable foods, lead
to food losses and inefficiencies along the food supply
chain that drive up the cost of nutritious foods.

The shift towards healthy diets that help
mitigate the effects from climate change, no
doubt, can also create a v irtuous circle.
This can happen, for example, by limiting the
impacts of diets on the env ironment through
technolog ical and productiv it y advancements,
and through sustainable and integ rated land
and natural resource use. Enhanced efficiencies
and innovations along the food supply chain,
including those aimed at reducing food loss and
waste and accompanied w ith concrete policy
measures such as fiscal policies are other
examples. Mov  towards healthy diets
through these enhancements w ill contribute to
reducing the cost of producing and consuming
nutritious food because, as shall be seen in the
next section, it simultaneously addresses some
of the factors driv  the cost of food.
The remaining years of the UN Decade of
Action on Nutrition, for which creation of
sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy
diets is a priorit y, present an opportunit y to
accelerate countr y level action in this area. n

è Food environments: In both urban and rural areas,

the lack of physical access to food markets, especially
to fresh fruit and vegetable markets, represents
a formidable barrier to accessing a healthy diet,
especially for the poor.

è Consumer demand: Rapid rates of urbanization

have resulted in more work-away and
eat-away-from-home habits, with a direct impact on
the demand for easy-to-prepare, highly processed
foods or convenience foods that are often energy
dense and high in fats, sugars and/or salt and do not
necessarily contribute to healthy diets.

è Political economy: Trade policies, mainly

protectionary trade measures and input subsidy
programmes, tend to protect and incentivize the
domestic production of staple foods, such as rice and
maize, often at the detriment of nutritious foods, like
fruits and vegetables. Non-tariff trade measures can
help improve food safety, quality standards and the
nutritional value of food, but they can also drive up
the costs of trade and hence food prices, negatively
affecting affordability of healthy diets.

remains to be seen.

the cost of nutritious foods implies the need to also
tackle environmental externalities associated with
current food systems and the hidden cost they create,
particularly at the food production level, but also at
the consumption level.

Affordabilit y of diets is determined by the cost
of food relative to people’s incomes. The 2019
edition of this report addressed the relationship
between food securit y, nutrition and povert y.
It showed that povert y and inequalit y reduction
is critical to improving people’s capacit y to
access sufficient and nutritious food, pointing to
concrete policy recommendations, some of which
are revisited in the last section of this part of the
report. While the broader issue of how to increase
people’s incomes is at the core of economic
development,144 this topic is beyond the scope of
this year’s report. On the other hand, increasing
affordabilit y through food price reductions is
not as widely studied, hence the drivers of the
cost of foods, rather than the drivers of people’s
incomes, are the focus of this section.

As shown in the cost and affordabilit y analysis,
even the most conser vative cost estimate of
a healthy diet is unaffordable for more than
3 billion people in the world. To understand what
is driving the high cost of healthy diets relative
to people’s incomes, we need to look at their most
costly food groups. As was shown previously,
the highest-cost food groups in a healthy diet
are those that are more nutritious: dair y, fruits,
vegetables, protein-rich foods (plant-based and
animal source), with some variations by region
(Figure 27). Therefore, to increase the affordabilit y
of healthy diets, the cost of these nutritious foods
must come down.
Global food price developments represent an
important indicator of changes in the cost
of food at countr y levels. am Following a long
period of decline during the twentieth centur y,
food prices of major commodities, including
meat, dair y, cereals, vegetable oils and sugar,
rose sharply during the first decade of the
twent y-first centur y. By 2011, price indices for
these commodit y groups more than doubled
(even tripled for some). Since reaching a peak
in 2011–2013, global prices of these major
commodities have dropped by about 29 percent,
although meat and dair y prices declined less by
about 15 –19 percent from their highest levels.134

Many factors determine the consumer price of
nutritious foods, from the point of production
throughout the food supply chain and also within
the food environment, where consumers engage
with the food system to make decisions about
acquiring, preparing and consuming foods.
As food systems have become more globalized,
industrialized and dominated by large actors
capable of economies of scale and of maintaining
long supply chains,145 this has had different
effects on food prices and the affordabilit y of
various diets across countries. Other drivers,
including rising incomes, increasing urbanization
and changing consumer demands, have
led to food markets becoming outlets for
mass-produced and highly processed foods,
often energ y-dense foods of minimal nutritional
value that are high in fats, sugars and/or salt.145
This has resulted in vegetables, fruits and
animal source foods often being too expensive or
inaccessible to many households, leading to low
nutritional qualit y diets.

Recently food markets have been confronted with
significant uncertainties that affect the price
of foods, ranging from a fast-changing trade
environment to the rapid spread of African Swine
Fever over several continents, Desert Locust
outbreaks in Eastern Africa and Southern Asia,
and the devastating impacts of the COV ID-19
pandemic on economies and markets of so many
countries around the world (Box 16). These major
events place upward pressure on food prices, thus

Within the broad context of these global trends,
the unique structure and performance of a
multitude of food systems (and their supply
chains) at national, subnational and municipal
(or community) levels imply different cost
structures for nutritious foods in different
locations. Some of the cost drivers, such as

am Price trends reported here stem from the FAO Food Price Index,
which is a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a
basket of food commodities. It consists of the average of five
commodity group price indices, weighted with the average export
shares of each of the groups for 2002–2004.134

HOW COULD THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECT FOOD PRICES AND AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHY DIETS?
Healthy diets are further out of reach for more than
3 billion people. As the tragic human impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic is engulfing the world, it is also
wreaking havoc on the world economy* with multiple
effects on people’s reduced capacity to access healthy
diets. Record levels of unemployment, lost livelihoods**
and rising poverty levels*** will cause healthy diets
to become even more unaffordable for the more than
3 billion people estimated in this report. This number is
likely to rise during the course of 2020.

Food prices may rise in the absence of urgent and
coordinated policy measures and corrective action.
How the extreme economic conditions affect food
prices varies tremendously across and within countries,
between urban and rural areas and across different food
groups. The depth and length of the economic crisis, and
to what extent corrective policy measures are taken and
implemented in a coordinated manner will determine if
rises in food prices can be avoided. Most importantly,
trade channels must stay open to prevent food price
rises. Both exporters and importers of foods should
agree not to impose trade barriers in response to the
pandemic. Countries should eliminate existing export
restrictions, including export taxes and export bans,
while also reducing tariffs to facilitate imports.139

There is sufficient food, but millions risk not having
access to diverse and nutritious foods. Globally, enough
food is being produced or in stock to meet dietary
energy needs. But border closures, quarantines, market,
supply chain and trade disruptions are restricting
people’s physical access to sufficient, diverse and
nutritious sources of food, especially in countries hit
hard by the pandemic or already affected by high
levels of food insecurity.135 High value perishable
commodities are going to waste, as essential workers in
food and agriculture are barred from crossing borders
and food supply chains are being disrupted.136 Closure
of informal markets may exacerbate unaffordability
healthy diets. Estimates based on scenarios modelling
the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
the number of undernourished people in the world
are presented in Part 1 (see Box 3), while the possible
impacts on malnutrition are presented in Box 4.
Currently, in low- and middle-income countries,
the lives and livelihoods of an estimated 265 million
people are under severe threat unless swift action is
taken to address the impact of COVID-19.137

Evidence of impact on food prices. At the time of writing,
few countries had reported significant rises in food
prices, except for a number of local markets because
of temporary food shortages. In Western Africa,
countries like the Central African Republic, Gambia,
Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Sierra Leone,
where the market situation was already fragile, may
face further deterioration. In several of these countries
non-seasonal price increases of 10–20 percent have
already been recorded in monthly variations for food
products. In countries hardest hit by the pandemic,
there has been a reduction in the demand for fruits,
horticultural and other perishable products, such as
aquatic products, leading to a decline in food prices.
The poultry and egg food production chains have also
faced strong downward price pressures.138
Impact on some of the most vulnerable populations.
Migrant workers have been affected by lockdowns,
trade disruptions, layoffs and illness, while their
capacity to send remittances to their home countries
has dropped significantly. This will affect families
especially in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Kenya,
Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, Tajikistan and many others,
where remittances make up a large proportion of the
income of poor households.

Food losses are increasing as food supply chains are
under strain. In spite of major efforts to keep open
food production, processing, trade and transportation
networks, and access to food markets and retail
outlets, there are reports of significant food losses,
especially of fruits and vegetables, fish, meat and dairy
products.138 Furthermore, travel restrictions are causing
severe labour shortages in food and agriculture
production and processing industries, leading to
production and supply disruptions. Middle- and
high-income countries have been most affected by
increased levels of food losses as producers cannot
market their produce putting upward pressures on food
prices, especially of perishable commodities.136

Policies to counter the negative effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on food systems worldwide should prevent
significant increases in the cost of nutritious food and
support affordability of healthy diets. Recommendations
are presented in Box 21.

* The IMF expects the world economy to contract by 3 percent in 2020, much worse than during the 2008–2009 financial crisis.140
** ILO estimates that 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy (nearly half the global workforce) risk losing their livelihoods and the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs will be
lost during the second quarter of 2020 (10.5 percent lower than end 2019).141
*** The World Bank estimates 40–60 million people will fall into extreme poverty (< USD 1.90/day, half of which in SSA) and 90–100 million will fall below the USD 3.20/day poverty
line (half of which in Southern Asia). Other estimates from UNU-WIDER place the figures much higher and suggest that about half a billion people worldwide could be pushed into
poverty due to COVID-19.142,143

whereas others var y by food group or are specific
to the countr y context, such as domestic policies
aimed at increasing the availability of staple
foods. International trade and related government
policies and the aspects of the political economy
of food also represent major drivers of the cost
of nutritious foods. Finally, climatic shocks (as
highlighted in the 2018 edition of this report) and
other unexpected shocks, including those caused
by infestations and diseases at the regional
level (e.g. African Swine Fever or Desert Locust
outbreaks) or at the global level (COV ID-19)
are becoming more frequent and severe, often
disrupting the world’s food supply chains.

Cost drivers in the production of diverse
nutritious foods

Hence, food systems today are facing huge
challenges in adapting to a multitude of
developments. They simultaneously face demands
to ensure that healthy diets are affordable not
only to a growing urbanized world population
but especially also to the majorit y of the poorest
living in rural areas. While production and
processing advances have made food more
convenient, widely available and affordable for
large portions of the world,146 these same food
systems are a dominant driver of the increased
availabilit y of energ y-dense foods of minimal
nutritional value that are high in fats, sugars and/
or salt. They are also a driver of health threats
like NCDs and many environmental threats,
including climate change, biodiversit y loss, and
degradation of land, soil and freshwater.

Low levels of technology, innovation
and investment in food production
Addressing low productivit y in food production
can be an effective way of raising the overall
supply of food including nutritious foods,
reducing food prices and raising incomes,
especially for the poorer family farmers and
smallholder food producers in low-income and
lower-middle-income countries, like farmers,
pastoralists and fisherfolk. Sustained productivit y
growth in food and agriculture, without depleting
natural resources, depends on food producers
having the capacities to innovate (enabling them
to raise yields), manage inputs more efficiently,
adopt new crops or breeds and improve qualit y,
while also conser ving natural resources.147

This section focuses on four main sets of drivers
determining the cost of food. The following
drivers are specifically covered:

Productivit y growth at ever y stage of the
food supply chain requires technological
and institutional innovations, which allow
food production, handling and processing to
remain profitable at a lower per-unit cost for
consumers,103 while at the same time being
sustainable. In recent decades, the expansion of
agricultural areas has played only a marginal role
in increasing production. Hence, technological
innovation in many forms (e.g. mechanization,
increased access to irrigation, plant and animal
breeding, improved management practices,
along with increased access to global and locally
specific information) is urgently needed for
substantial and sustained growth in yields and
productivit y in most of the world, especially

1. Cost drivers that relate to the production of
diverse nutritious foods that contribute to
healthy diets (insufficient diversification and
low productivit y; low levels of technolog y;
pre-har vest and post-har vest losses;
seasonalit y and other climate risk factors;
insufficient investment in R&D, limited access
to knowledge and information).
2. Cost drivers that relate to the food supply
chain beyond food production (inadequate food
storage, handling and preser vation, especially
of perishable foods; food losses beyond
pre-har vest and post-har vest losses; poor road
networks and limited transport capacit y).

in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, reducing
pre-har vest and post-har vest losses at the
production level should be an integral part of
efforts to increase productivit y.

producers resulted in yields of tomatoes and
chilies increasing by 20 percent and 12 percent,
respectively, compared with a control group.150
And in the United Republic of Tanzania, a
technolog y transfer project resulted in important
yield increases in four varieties of vegetables,
with increases of more than 20 percent in tomato
production.151

In addition to low productivit y, insufficient
diversification towards the production of
horticultural products, leg umes, small-scale
fisheries, aquaculture, livestock and other
nutritious food products also limits the supply
of diverse and nutritious foods in markets,
resulting in higher food prices. Diversified and
well-integrated production systems not only
increase the availabilit y of nutritious foods, but
also help v ulnerable populations to increase
their resilience to climate and price shocks and
reduce seasonal variation in food production.148
It is also critical to increase the variet y of
foods produced and move into higher-value
products, such as from staple foods to also
producing fruits and vegetables and exportable
food products.149

Of course, productivit y is only one of several
drivers that determine the ultimate consumer
prices, but it is still an important one. A global
analysis based on the IMPACT model ao has
shown that increasing the productivit y of fruits,
vegetables, pulses and poultr y by 25 percent
could result in the reduction of the average world
prices of these commodities by 20 –25 percent.
Different scenarios produced similar results.
For example, the doubling of agricultural
productivit y in these commodities could also lead
to a 50 percent reduction in prices.152
Further efforts to improve diet qualit y, especially
for the growing populations in low-income
countries, may require increased consumption
of animal source foods (ASFs), including dair y
products, as well as fisheries and aquaculture
products, to meet protein intake requirements
for those populations. Increasing livestock
production can lead to lower prices of livestock
products and, therefore, increased access to
such products by the poor, especially poor
urban consumers.153 However, the perishable
nature of ASFs, especially of fresh milk, fish
and eggs, could also lead to supply constraints
and consequently higher prices. Even given the
option of low-cost imports, these only offer
limited scope to bring down prices. 7

Over the past number of decades, increases in
agricultural productivit y across countries and
regions has been highly uneven with the fastest
rate of growth (measured as the gross output
of crops and livestock per hectare of farmland)
registered in the developed countries of
Eastern Asia ( Japan and the Republic of Korea).
In contrast, growth in agricultural productivit y
has regrettably been slowest in sub-Saharan
Africa and Southern Asia.149 Insufficient
investment in nutritious foods, especially in
low-income countries with a high prevalence
of undernutrition, has led to a relatively high
cost of these foods. For instance, vegetable
productivit y varies widely across countries,
with tremendous potential for improvements.
In Nigeria, for example, average yields in
tomato production reached only 4 tonnes per
hectare, compared with China’s 51 tonnes per
hectare. an Such large productivit y gaps could
be successfully reduced with stepped-up public
and private sector investment in agricultural
research, technolog y transfer and technical
assistance for fruit and vegetable producers.
In Indonesia, the implementation of Farmer
Field Schools aimed specifically at vegetable

Indeed, high prices are already seen in many
countries due to poor productivit y in the
dair y and poultr y sectors. Dair y production,
for its part, has some specific constraints: for
example, it is poorly suited to tropical climates.
In many parts of Africa, keeping dair y animals
is severely constrained by tsetse f lies. The high
price of eggs in many parts of the world is
paradoxical, given that poultr y are the most

widely owned livestock in low-income countries.
Unfortunately, homestead poultr y production is
often hindered by diseases like Newcastle’s and
lack of inputs. Countries like India that have
achieved larger-scale commercial production

and vaccinations have seen marked declines in
the prices of eggs and poultr y products, even in
the face of rising demand. 7

for more perishable food commodities like
fruits and vegetables and livestock and
fisheries products.
In Ethiopia, rapid economic progress over the
past two decades went hand-in-hand with
substantial increases in agricultural productivit y,
spurred by government policies and investment.
However, this involved much higher levels of
investment towards increased productivit y
of starchy staples, eventually resulting in a
reduction of staple food prices with relatively
higher prices for nutritious foods (see Box 17).

In South-eastern Asia, innovative “climate-smart”
agricultural techniques consisting of low-cost
and environmentally friendly farming practices
have led to higher incomes for poor households,
especially in rural and remote areas, while also
increasing the diversity of food items available
on local markets. For example, in Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, “rice-fish farming” practices
combining aquatic products and rice as the
main staple have increased household incomes
through diversification and more efficient use
of inputs.154 Aquatic animals and plants raised
in rice fields have increased dietary diversity in
food consumption and represent important and
affordable sources of protein and micronutrients
to the population.155

However, increasing productivit y may not
accrue gains on its own. Without access to
markets to absorb excess local supply, there is
little incentive to increase production as this
will only lead to lowering farm-gate prices.161
These lower prices in turn act as a disincentive
to increased food production and technological
innovation in the sector,161 ultimately leading to
higher food prices.

Managing risks in food and agricultural production
Engaging in the food and agriculture sector
can be an intrinsically risky endeavour, be it
in crop or livestock production, fisheries and
aquaculture or forestr y. This is particularly the
case for poorer family farmers and smallholder
producers on marginal lands or those with
limited access to technolog y, capital or other
productive resources. In crop production,
traditional staple foods generally carr y a lower
risk compared with the production of higher
value and more nutritious foods. For many
low-income smallholders, it might be a rational
choice to stick with low-productivit y, low-risk
technological options – but the consequence is
that poor households may never produce enough
to enable them to provide sufficient diverse
nutritious food for their families. This is in stark
contrast to the food and agriculture sectors in
high-income countries, where producers can
purchase insurance to protect their incomes.

A large body of evidence confirms that there are
high returns to public investments in agricultural
R&D. When agricultural technologies and new
practices are introduced simultaneously, they
can significantly raise productivit y and reduce
food prices in low-income countries. For staple
foods, such combined efforts could reduce food
prices by up to 49 percent for maize, 43 percent
for rice and 45 percent for wheat.156 A wide
range of technologies, including no-till farming,
heat-tolerant crops, artificial insemination in
livestock and DNA-based approaches to identif y
and monitor disease-causing agents, can benefit
smallholders in low-income countries.157,158
In spite of the high potential for technological
advances, in many low- and middle-income
countries, investment in agricultural sector
R&D is currently insufficient.159 For example,
in a sample of 70 LMICs, the average number
of public sector researchers per million in the
countr y’s population is 4–5 in cereal research,
with only 1 researcher each in the cultivation of
fruits and vegetables.160 The focus on staples is
a reason for continued high prices, in particular

Managing risk is an important aspect of food
production in all food and agriculture sectors,
one that greatly inf luences what a producer
decides to grow, raise or capture. This indirectly
affects prices, and thus the cost of diets and
how affordable they may or may not be for

THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE ON THE COST
OF NUTRIENT ADEQUATE DIETS IN ETHIOPIA
During 2004–2010, Ethiopia was one of the fastest
growing economies in the world as it experienced an
average annual GDP growth of 11 percent, and just
under 10 percent during 2011–2017. Among the
several factors behind this economic success was a
rapid agricultural sector modernization that notably
increased the productivity of cereals.162
This economic transformation was accompanied by
rapidly rising food inflation and increases in nominal
wages from 2002 to 2016. In particular, the cost of
animal source foods, fruits, vegetables and pulses,
increased far more rapidly than the cost of starchy
staples and oils and fats, partly reflecting government
commitment to increase productivity of traditional crop
varieties such as teff, wheat and maize.163
The agricultural transformation, however, did
not take into consideration diet quality and health
consequences of diets of low nutritional quality.
It helped alleviate poverty through a reduction in cereal
prices, but insufficient investment in the production of
high-value crops, such as fruits and vegetables, and
animal source foods contributed to higher relative
prices of these foods compared with starchy staples,

thus limiting the affordability of these nutritious foods,
especially for the poorest households.
During the transformation, nominal wages
increased faster than the cost of a nutrient adequate
diet, thus making this diet (as described in Box 10)
more affordable over time, as it came to represent
22 percent of the average nominal wage in 2016 from
32 percent in 2008. Nevertheless, this improvement
was driven by wage increases rather than a decline in
food prices.164
Generally, even if wage increases are positive for
the real affordability of diets as it occurred in Ethiopia,
the higher increase in the cost of healthy diets poses
important challenges. As the demand for nutritious
foods is highly elastic (i.e. a small change in prices
corresponds to a high change in demand), there tends
to be a consumer reluctance to turn wage gains into
purchases of these foods. To bring down prices of
high-quality commodities, the economic transformation
of the country should, therefore, focus not only on
the traditional staple crops but also on improving the
production systems of noncereal sectors.49

the consumer. Vegetable production is often
identified as a profitable but more risky option
for smallholders. The risk factors include:
higher levels of capital outlay, like irrigation
equipment; potential for har vest losses due
to extreme weather conditions; the highly
perishable nature of vegetables; changing levels
of consumer demand; and volatile producer
prices. Other sectors, such as livestock rearing,
fisheries or aquaculture also call for substantial
levels of capital investment and hence require
a good understanding of risk factors before
engaging in production.

followed by drought and pests.165 In Malawi and
Mozambique, traditional vegetable value chains
are exposed to risks not only at the production
level, but also in the other stages of the value
chain due to poor infrastructure and lack of
processing or packaging facilities.166
In the absence of access to knowledge,
information and credit, all of the above are
risks that inf luence food producers’ decisions
on whether to invest in crop production,
livestock or aquaculture, which ultimately
inf luences the overall availabilit y of nutritious
foods and their prices. Many producers will
continue g rowing what they know best, largely
staple foods, rather than venture into more
risk-prone products or other commodities of
higher nutritional content.167

In Ethiopia, a qualitative study on the smallholder
perceptions about the risks of producing
vegetables found that the major risks observed
by farmers are market price fluctuations,

Tajikistan is a landlocked lower-middle-income country

shocks and seasonality in food production limit its
access to markets and nutritious foods.172 In addition,

from seasonal, mostly construction-related labour in
Russian Federation. The dual effect of climate-related
shocks and seasonality and irregular remittances have
caused both seasonal and year-on-year increases
of food prices, raising the cost of nutrient adequate
diets while affordability levels have decreased.
Households already spend 50–60 percent of their
expenditure on food and are therefore unable to
absorb much of a change in food prices.
A WFP-supported Fill the Nutrient Gap analysis
helped identify key barriers faced by the most
vulnerable across four regions in Tajikistan in

accessing nutritious foods.173 The analysis found that
29–42 percent of households could not afford a
nutrient adequate diet. When factoring in the habitual
high consumption of vegetable oil and fat, this
proportion increased to 41–56 percent.
As a result of the year-on-year increase of
prices of food and non-food items and variations in
income-earning opportunities during 2014–2017 –
i.e. a lower proportion of households reported
“having worked over the previous week” –
a downward trend in affordability was observed.
The analysis showed a decrease in affordability
from 55 percent in May 2015 to 45 percent in June
2016, while WFP monitoring data showed that the
proportion of rural households that reported spending
more than 65 percent of expenditure on food grew
from 33 percent in December 2014 to 60 percent in
December 2017.174

Those smallholders who have successfully engaged
in vegetable production have had several factors
in common: access to markets, enhanced access to
credit, irrigation infrastructure, technolog y and
knowledge.168 For many, contract farming is an
instrument that can provide certainty in expected
returns on production. In India, for instance,
contract farming in onions has led to increased
yields and overall production levels.169

When food prices show high seasonalit y, this
may have particular consequences for dietar y
intake and nutritional outcomes and may also
cause even further food price volatilit y,171 further
challenging food securit y and nutrition. A study
of 13 commodities across 193 markets in seven
countries pointed to high levels of food price
seasonalit y in African food markets, as measured
by the “seasonal gap”. The seasonal gap,
defined as the difference between the high price
immediately prior to the har vest and the low
price following the har vest averaged across years,
was highest for fruits and vegetables and lowest
for commodities produced throughout the year,
such as eggs (Table 10). In some countries, food
price seasonalit y was quite high even for staples
such as maize.171

Seasonality and climate factors
Prices for most food and agricultural products
exhibit significant seasonalit y, t ypically peaking
just before the har vest, when food supplies are
scarce, and dropping thereafter. The seasonalit y
of prices of fruits and vegetables is t ypically more
extreme, with different peaks according to the
timing of the har vest. Even as people substitute
between foods according to price f luctuations,
the lowest possible expenditure needed to meet
all nutrient intake requirements still varies
significantly due to seasonalit y, while the cost
of calories (largely derived from less perishable
staple foods) usually f luctuates less 170 (see Box 18).

Climate change is expected to further aggravate
seasonalit y through increased drought
frequency, disruption of food production by
f loods and tropical storms, increasing and
more variable temperatures, and more erratic
rainfall. Small Island Developing States (SIDS)

rainfall patterns, the average consumer price
of maize and other coarse grains could rise
by 150 –200 percent over a 20-year period
(2010 –2030) with the highest price rises to
be seen in Southern Africa.178 Elsewhere, a
climate impact study conducted on the five
largest countries in Southern Asia suggests
that there is likely to be a significant negative
impact on food production and agricultural
productivit y, while food prices are expected to
rise. This has important implications for food
securit y and nutrition.179 Similarly, a long-term
study in Malaysia (1980 –2017) shows a negative
effect of climate change on fruit and vegetable
production180 that might prompt shifts in eating
patterns towards even lower fruit and vegetable
intakes and increased consumption of highly
processed food and beverages that are high in
saturated fats, trans fats, sugars and/or salt.145

Current food consumption patterns and the food
systems that support them are both major drivers
of negative environmental impacts and climate
change, creating a vicious circle. As shown
in Section 2.2, these patterns and systems
have major ramifications for the state of the
environment and climate change. Current food
demand patterns create significant hidden social
costs in terms of GHG emissions and climate
change, estimated to reach USD 1.7 trillion per
year by 2030 (Figure 37). However, there is also
strong evidence of global climate change leading
to increasing climate variabilit y and extremes
and unpredictable seasonalit y, as highlighted in
the in-depth climate analysis presented in the
2018 edition of this report. Climate variabilit y
and extremes and unpredictable seasonalit y are
exacerbated because these hidden environmental
and climate-change costs are left unaddressed.
This, in turn, negatively impacts productivit y
in the food and agricultural sectors, ultimately
increasing the cost of nutritious foods and
healthy diets.

NOTES: The table shows the average estimated seasonal gap in food prices by
food crop in seven selected countries in Africa (2000–2012). The seasonal gap
is the difference between the high price immediately prior to the harvest and
the low price following the harvest averaged across years. For above crops,
there are between 6 and 13 years of monthly price data over the 2000–2012
period depending on the country, market place and commodity. Countries

in particular suffer from these effects of climate
change, including as the result of cyclones
and hurricanes, rising sea levels and eroding
coastlines. These changes exacerbate their
already fragile natural environments making
it more difficult to produce sufficient food at
reasonable cost to meet their dietar y needs.175
Climate change will lead to a general decline
in agricultural production over the next two to
three decades, turning into a major cost driver
of food in the near future. Overall degradation
of soil qualit y and agro-ecosystem conditions
is furthermore leading to a general decrease in
agricultural production.176,177 In sub-Saharan
Africa, it has been predicted that as climate
change affects food production, particularly
through average temperature and changing

Cost drivers along the food supply chain
In addition to the challenges of diversif ying food
production and increasing the productivit y of
nutritious foods, there are a host of bottlenecks
along the food supply chain that must be
addressed to deliver a variet y of nutritious and
safe foods at a lower cost to consumers.

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

Food losses and waste

chain stage, fruit and vegetable loss and waste
at the retail level are as high as 35 percent in
sub-Saharan Africa.

Reducing pre-har vest and post-har vest losses
in quantit y and qualit y at the production level
in the agriculture, fisheries and forestr y sectors
is an important starting point to reduce the
cost of nutritious foods along the food supply
chain. This is because losses decrease the overall
availabilit y of these foods, while also possibly
undermining environmental sustainabilit y.
In lower-income countries, where food insecurit y
is often severe, increasing access to a greater
amount and variet y of foods is critical.

Important causes of losses at the production
level include exposure to adverse weather
conditions, har vest and handling practices, as
well as marketing challenges. Inadequate storage
conditions and decisions made at earlier
stages of the supply chain (e.g. lack of proper
plant health management, inadequate crating
or packing of foods) lead to products with a
shorter shelf life. Adequate cold storage, in
particular, can be crucial to prevent quantitative
and qualitative losses of perishable foods.
Moreover, during transportation, good physical
infrastructure and efficient trade logistics of key
importance to prevent food losses.

The effect of a reduction of food losses on
access to food w ill be different for each actor
of the food supply chain, depending on the
overall price effect. For example, a fall in
prices can improve consumers’ access to
food, but if not proportionally supported by
productiv it y gains at the production level,
it may diminish the food securit y status of
commercial farming households, as they w ill
then receive lower prices for their products.181
This highlights the importance of combining
pre-har vest and post-har vest loss reduction at
the production level w ith other investments
for productiv it y gains (as outlined above)
as part of comprehensive efforts to increase
productiv it y. Such combined efforts can
contribute not only to lower consumer prices,
but also to increased profit marg ins for
food producers.

Generally, reducing food loss and waste entails
certain costs. Producers and consumers will
only undertake the necessar y efforts if the
benefits outweigh these costs. For producers,
the benefits of reducing food losses by investing
in technolog y or improved practices may be
too small in relation to the investment cost.
For consumers, the value of their time may be
too high to justif y efforts to curb waste, such
as planning food purchases, meal preparation
and managing food stocks.181 Again, the impact
of reduction in food loss and waste depends
on how their effect on prices is transmitted
throughout the food supply chain; some actors
may benefit, others may lose out. Public policy
needs to create the right incentives for
producers to cut food losses and for consumers
to reduce food waste in order to maximize social
benefits and reduce the cost of nutritious foods.

Recent estimates show that around 14 percent of
the world’s food is lost during the post-har vest
production stage and before reaching the retail
level. Global revised estimates of percentages
of food wasted ever y year occurring at the retail
and consumer levels, are being compiled by UN
Environment Programme.181

Technology and infrastructure
Fruits and vegetables and animal source foods
are highly perishable, especially fish, fresh
milk, meat and eggs. Lack of adequate market
infrastructure and limited processing technolog y
can result in food losses and higher food prices,
especially for highly perishable foods like
milk. As stated above, improved technolog y
and infrastructure in handling, storage and
processing (cool storage systems, cold chains,
dr ying techniques, improved packaging)
offers opportunities to reduce losses and lower
consumer food prices. Certain processing

All along the supply chain, from production to
wholesale and retail, food losses and waste are
generally highest for more perishable nutritious
foods, including fruits, vegetables and animal
products. A recent analysis finds that the losses
and waste are higher for fruits and vegetables
than for cereals and pulses at all stages in
the food supply chain, with the exception of
on-farm losses and those incurred during
transportation in Eastern and South-eastern
Asia.181 For example, looking at only one supply

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

benefit is often offset by the difficulties that
smaller producers face in complying with
increasingly standardized procurement
processes that accompany trends in systematic
“super-marketization” and internationalization
of markets.185 Moreover, poor road networks
continue to constrain the existence of
well-functioning markets.

techniques can increase the nutrient content of
food and raise the bioavailabilit y of nutrients,
including through fermentation, germination
and roasting.182,248
Some of these preser vation techniques rely
on low levels of technolog y (e.g. open air or
solar dr ying, or smoking of fish); however, a
stable supply of electricity becomes important
for cold storage of perishable commodities
requiring refrigeration. In sub-Saharan Africa,
refrigeration facilities remain inaccessible to
most smallholders. In the United Republic of
Tanzania, it has been estimated that 25 percent
of milk deteriorates because lack of refrigeration
facilities; 97 percent of red meat sold in the
countr y has been never been refrigerated.183
Highly perishable foods require storage facilities
with controlled temperature and humidity
conditions. In the absence of these facilities,
many producers have little option but to sell their
produce immediately regardless of the market
price, or face the risk of heav y losses.183 Hence,
the lack of adequate storage facilities negatively
affects smallholders’ incomes, and the availability
and cost of fresh foods produced locally.

As for the food processing industry, there
is concern that food policies and the private
sector have promoted “inexpensive calories and
expensive nutrients”,186 leading to increased
prevalence of overweight and micronutrient
deficiencies. This is of particular concern in
high-income countries and rapidly growing
low- and middle-income countries, where the
agricultural sector has become or is rapidly
becoming a supplier of raw materials for the
food processing industry, rather than a provider
of food for direct human consumption.186 These
developments have underscored the need for policy
interventions that promote nutrition-sensitive food
systems from the production level throughout the
food value chain, as discussed in the next section.

The food environment and consumer demand
as a cost driver

Another important component of market
infrastructure is the overall qualit y and efficiency
of the national road and transportation network,
which is critical in getting produce from the farm
gate to markets at reasonable cost. Investment in
all-weather rural roads is particularly important.
This reduces the time it takes to reach rural
and urban markets, thus helping to reduce
pre-har vest and post-har vest losses, including
of perishable fruits and vegetables. In many
countries, transport costs are a barrier to
increasing the affordabilit y of healthy diets,
particularly for lower-income consumers (Box 19).
Therefore, investing in road infrastructure would
have significant returns in getting nutritious food
to the market at lower costs.

The food environment is the “physical, economic,
political and socio-cultural context in which
consumers engage with the food system to make
their decisions about acquiring, preparing and
consuming food”. 35 It is the marketplace where
food prices are determined based on supply and
demand, where food marketing shapes food
preferences, and where consumers form their
understanding and expectations of food safet y
and qualit y (e.g. through nutrition labelling).
Consumer decisions are also important in regard
to how much of their household budget is spent
on food and on what food items in particular.

Overall, small- and medium-sized producers
have seen their capacit y to engage with markets
increase, both at the local and international
levels. This trend has been essentially driven by
their improved access to local infrastructure
(e.g. power grid, roads) and to local supermarkets,184
along with their proximit y to marketplaces
in growing urban centres. However, this

Consumption decisions, on the one hand, are
based on relative prices and consumer income
(or cost and affordability) and consumer
preferences. This part of the report focuses on
cost and affordability, but, as shall be seen in
Section 2.4, the effectiveness of policies to reduce
the cost of nutritious food and increase the
affordabilit y of healthy diets will also depend

considered to have the most efficient transportation
network in the region.*** Second, the cost reduction
is transmitted to the final retail price of the food
commodity analysed.

Public investments in the road networks of 14 African
countries could help raise the affordability of nutrient
adequate diets,* especially for the poorest, by means
of reducing transport costs by up to USD 50 per
household on an annual basis. A simulation of the
impact of improvements in road infrastructure on price
reductions of key food commodities helped derive
increased levels of affordability for country-specific
nutrient adequate diets.**
The estimation of the potential cost savings for
such a diet, as shown in the figure below, is built on
two assumptions. First, an improvement of the road
network will decrease average transport costs for a
given food commodity relative to the transport cost
for the same product in South Africa, the country

Results. If transportation were more efficient as a
result of a better road network, potential savings
would amount to USD 7 per capita per year, on
average, across the countries analysed. Assuming an
average household size of five members187 in the
analysed countries, these savings could amount
to USD 35 per household on an annual basis.
Given that the composition and cost structure of
a nutrient diet is different in each country, the
savings effect of the reduced transport costs differ

NOTES: The figure shows simulated lower- and upper-bound annual average reduction in the cost of a nutrient adequate diet, following a reduction in transport costs associated with
improved road networks for selected countries in Africa (2014–2017). Upper bound reflects the scenario of transport cost shock applied to half the retail price, while in the lower bound,
the shock is applied to a quarter of the retail price. Retail food price data from 2017 are obtained from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP) for internationally
standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). See Box 10 for the definition of the nutrient adequate diet, Box 11 for a brief description of
the cost methodology, and Annex 3 for a full description of the simulation methodology and data sources.

by country. For example, in Burkina Faso, savings
per household could be as much as USD 55 per
year. In Burkina Faso, Burundi and Mozambique,
per capita savings in the diet are close to 1 percent
of the annual per capita GDP. In Malawi, Rwanda
and Senegal, the effect is less pronounced, with a
nutrient adequate diet costing just USD 25 less per
household on an annual basis. Given that lower
transportation costs could change the relative price
of different products, they could also lead to gradual
changes in the composition of the diet. For example,
in Benin, consumers could start to consume more

potatoes as these become more affordable compared
with maize.
These results highlight the importance of public
investments in infrastructure in support of raising the
affordability of a nutrient adequate diet. Different from
trade policies, which often generate opposing
incentives to producers and consumers, as further
explained below (see Box 24 on trade policy in Central
America), policies and investments in support of the
provision of public goods, like roads, railroads and
transport services, may have a positive effect for all
actors along the food supply chain.

* The nutrient adequate diet analysed here is defined as in Box 10.
** The estimated potential decrease in transportation costs is derived from the database on price incentive indicators developed by the Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural
Policies (MAFAP) Programme of FAO.
*** Transport costs are adjusted downward using the World Bank Logistics Performance Index (Dimension Infrastructure, on quality of trade and transport related infrastructure) of
each country expressed with respect to the ratio for South Africa, the most efficient country in the region in terms of transport networks. According to the index (average 2010–2012),
the analysed sub-Saharan African countries were about 30 to 50 percent less efficient than South Africa, in terms of trade and transport infrastructure.

not be able to access these markets, because of
the distance and high transport costs involved.
For these countr y income groups, the opportunit y
cost of eating healthy is too high, because of
the time and the transport cost that they would
have to incur, and they end up eating unhealthy
food that is available closer to home at a much
lower cost.

and other policies that help shift consumer
preferences towards healthy diets.
The distance to food marketplaces and the time
required to prepare a healthy meal are among
the key barriers that prevent many consumers
from having access to, and hence deciding to pay
a higher cost for healthy diets. These barriers
can be seen as cost drivers because people who
tr y to overcome them would have to accept an
additional cost on top of the cost of food itself.
The concept of “opportunit y cost”, which put
simply means the loss of other alternatives when
one alternative is chosen, can be applied in this
context as explained as follows.

In such instances, homestead food production can
be a good source of fresh foods, add diversit y to
the diet and lower the cost of a nutrient adequate
diet. For example, the Philippines national
nutrition sur vey found that more than half of the
green, leaf y and yellow vegetables and more than
one-quarter of other vegetables consumed were
produced by the households consuming them.188
A simulation of different levels of homestead
food production, sales and consumption of
vegetables showed that, at optimal levels of sales
and own consumption, the proportion of rural
households that otherwise would not be able to
afford a nutrient adequate diet could decrease
from 37 percent to none.189

Access to markets
In many parts of the world, in both urban and
rural areas, physical access by consumers to food
markets, especially to fresh fruit and vegetable
markets, represents a formidable challenge to
eating a healthy diet. This is particularly true
among poorer countr y income groups, who may
| 127 |

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

countries.198 In low- and middle-income
countries in particular, easy access to
traditional produce markets remains key to
lowering the cost of nutritious foods and
providing a wider variet y of choices for these
foods than in more modern supermarkets.
Conversely, in a growing number of megacities
worldwide, urban food prices have risen, as
it has become more and more difficult and
time-consuming to transport fresh produce
to market.

Poor road networks or long distances between
production and consumption areas are
also barriers to domestic trade that prevent
well-functioning markets from existing.
These constraints often translate into
wide-ranging degrees of accessibilit y to food
commodities, and price differences within
countries, as seen in countries like the United
Republic of Tanzania (Box 20).
In Kenya, as elsewhere, f luctuations in
consumer prices of fruits, vegetables and
staples are mainly determined by har vest
performance, production cycles and
transportation costs from the farm gate to the
food markets. In Kenya’s vast Arid Lands, food
must be transported over large distances, and
this becomes more difficult during the rainy
seasons when roads deteriorate. Apart from
seasonal volatilit y, food prices increase by
about 1.3 percent for ever y additional hour of
deliver y time from the market hubs in central
parts of the countr y to the more distant district
headquarters, and by 1.8 percent for each hour
between the district headquarters and remote
markets off the reg ular transport corridors.190
These price increases are ultimately passed on
to the consumer.

The rapid growth of supermarkets in urban
settings presents challenges and opportunities
for providing access to affordable healthy
diets. Supermarkets’ modern and efficient food
supply model offers significant opportunities
to distribute fresh fruits and vegetables, and
animal source and fortified foods widely, to
stabilize food prices and to ensure food safety.
On the other hand, supermarkets also offer a
wide variety of non-perishable energ y-dense
foods of minimal nutritional value, often high
in unhealthy fats, sugars and/or salt, at lower
prices than nutritious foods. While governments
could put in place measures to stimulate adequate
availability of affordable nutritious foods in
supermarkets, in large part the development of
supermarket chains is stimulated by technological
change and consumer demand, which are beyond
the control of governments.199

Urban settings and food prices
Population growth, increases in income and
urbanization are fundamental drivers of the
rising demand for food and changes in people’s
diets with effects on food prices. The urban
population, in particular, will continue to
rapidly rise, with most of the increase seen
in small- and medium-sized cities in Africa
and Asia. Notably, by 2030, it is expected that
the youth (under the age of 18) will make up
60 percent of urban populations,197 which
presents both challenges (e.g. in terms of high
youth unemployment in urban areas) and
opportunities (e.g. youth engaging in urban
agriculture) in regard to providing sufficient
access to nutritious foods to rapidly growing
urban populations.

A promising solution can be seen in the area
of urban and peri-urban agriculture, which
has gained in prominence as a means for
urban dwellers to access fresh and nutritious
food items, including fruits and vegetables at
reasonable cost, either through own production
or through short value chains. For urban
farmers, the proximit y to markets allows
them to reduce pre-har vest and post-har vest
losses in vegetables by as much as 30 percent.
Twelve case studies across different cities
and countries have documented that 80 to
100 percent of the supply of leaf y vegetables
in these cities is produced through urban
agriculture. 200 In Ghana, for instance, almost
all of the supply of fresh milk, spring onions
and lettuce in the cit y of Kumasi is produced
through urban agriculture, while most
of poultr y, eggs and tomatoes come from
peri-urban areas of the cit y. 201

A large portion of the world’s urban population
lives in informal settlements on the urban
peripher y, ranging from 20 percent in Latin
America to 55 percent in sub-Saharan Africa,
and as much as 65 percent for all low-income

POOR ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND LONG DISTANCES CAUSE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE COST
OF HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
six components of a healthy diet (i.e. starchy staples,
dairy, proteins, fruits, vegetables and oils), the prices
of starchy staples and vegetables are the main drivers
behind the high cost. For instance, in the city of Dar es
Salaam, which is the main market but located far from
the producing regions, starchy staples are the most
expensive food component of a healthy diet at a cost
26 percent higher than the national average.49
The most important staple food marketing corridor
in the country leads to Dar  Salaam from the four
surplus producing regions Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma and
Rukwa – the so-called “Big Four regions”, located in
the south-western part of the country.193 The Big Four
are more than 500 kilometres from Dar  Salaam
and do not have convenient access to a port or to the
main export market to the north: Nairobi in Kenya.194
The long distances between markets and producers,
combined with poor road conditions and limited
market information, hinder the efficient flow of staple
foods from surplus-producing areas, where prices are
lowest, to urban and deficit markets, where prices
are highest.
Similarly, as an important component of a
healthy diet, vegetables contribute to the high costs
of this diet in regions that do not produce a high
variety of horticultural products and are far away
from producing regions. Vegetables are the most
expensive in Lindi, Mtwara and Pwani regions.
In these regions, the average cost of vegetables in a
healthy diet is USD 0.76, which is 72 percent higher
than the national average of USD 0.44.49 In Lindi and
Mtwara, for instance, the production of cashew nuts
and sesame as cash crops are the main source of
livelihood, while frequent drought conditions further
contribute to the higher cost of vegetables.195,196
This also applies to the cost of protein-rich foods and
dairy products, which is highest in the urban and
deficit markets of Lindi, Dodoma and Dar  Salaam.
For protein-rich foods other than dairy, the cost is
lowest in the major producing regions of Ruvuma and
Kagera; for dairy production, the cost is lowest in
Mara, Tanga and Mbeya.193

The United Republic of Tanzania is characterized
by long distances between rural agricultural areas
and urban centres and ports. Poor road conditions
cause food losses en route to markets, especially
for perishable goods. Paved roads represent only
31 percent of the total classified road network, with
the country’s rural roads remaining largely unpaved,
of which 90 percent are in poor or very poor
condition.191 The poor infrastructure and resulting high
transportation costs are an important driver of food
prices not only for net-buyers of food in urban centres,
but also for rural farmers with small marketable
surpluses who sell most of their produce at the farm
gate, rather than incur high transportation costs to
move their products to distant markets.
Nearly two-thirds of Tanzanian smallholder farmers
sell their produce at the farm gate with very low profit
margins, while final consumers face high food prices
largely due to the high transaction and transportation
costs.192 These domestic factors contribute to
remarkable cross-regional variability in the cost of the
different diets (as defined in Box 10). The average daily
cost of an energy sufficient diet in the United Republic
of Tanzania is estimated at USD 0.53, representing
about 30 percent of the average national food
expenditure.49 Hence, the majority of the population
has access to a starchy diet but cannot afford diets that
include more nutritious foods.
In 2011, approximately 68 percent of the
Tanzanian population (31 million people) could not
afford a healthy diet (as defined in Box 10).49 Differences
in the cost of diets across the country’s regions are
driven by high local cost variability, given that specific
food components contribute differently to the cost of a
healthy diet in each region. More specifically, the cost
of a healthy diet is highest in the south-eastern regions
of Lindi, Mtwara and Pwani, which include the largest
city of Dar  Salaam, and also in the east-coast region

Consumer demand as a cost driver

Another structural change in food culture and
demand relates to the increase in incomes in
low- and middle-income countries. This rise in
income leads to a well-documented change in
diet composition, including a growing demand
for animal source foods in the middle-income
classes of those countries in both urban and
rural areas. 3,86,203,204 In addition, it is generally
accepted that today’s consumers increasingly
care about the safet y and qualit y of the food
they eat, how their food is produced, and the
impact that food production and consumption
have on the environment and on societ y. 205
The latter concern is particularly relevant to
higher-income consumers. As a result, there is
an increased demand by these consumers for
“ecological” products that include information
about the products’ origins, including the har vest
methods used in their production. This is seen in
high-income countries, where consumer demand
has led to increased production and certification
of these ecological products, which has
significantly reduced their prices. For example,
the organic premium for products like coffee
or spinach has shrunk significantly in the past
decade. In 2004, organic spinach cost 60 percent
more than conventional products; today this
differential has been reduced to 7 percent. 206

The rapid rate of urbanization, combined with
changing lifest yles and increasing involvement
of women in economic activities, is leading
to structural changes in consumer behaviour
and food culture. As such consumer demand
is also an important cost driver to consider.
These changes are making it more difficult,
especially for women with jobs, to be able to
afford the time that it takes to prepare a healthy
meal, and prior to that, to buy the needed
nutritious redients. The opportunit y cost of
eating healthy in the face of these changes is
too high, because of the availabilit y of cheap
energ y-dense fast foods of minimal nutritional
value and easy-to-prepare, highly processed
foods, already half cooked to reduce the time
spent on preparation.152
A study for high-income countries suggests
that lack of time was the leading barrier to
adopting dietar y g uidance. As cited by adults
and in analyses of United States consumer
expenditure data, spending at quick-ser vice
outlets was strongly and positively associated
with hours spent in paid employment.
Likewise, low- and middle-income working
parents in Europe cope with time pressures
by relying more on take-outs and restaurant
meals and basing family meals on prepared
entrees and other quick options. 202

Even with adequate access to various points
of purchase, including fresh markets,
neighbourhood stores and supermarkets, several
factors inf luence consumer choices from the large
variet y of foods offered. These include different
t y pes of promotion, including price promotions,
product packaging and claims, as well as product
positioning in stores, all of which are linked to
the cost of food items promoted. In addition,
there are still other measures that affect the cost
of nutritious foods and the cost of energ y-dense
foods of minimal nutritional value differently, as
described next.

Time constraints include shopping for food,
preparing it and cleaning up afterwards – all
time burdens that often fall disproportionately
on women. Fruits and vegetables, for example,
tend to have shorter shelf lives and require
frequent purchases, and need more time for
preparation; beans also take a long time to
cook. None of these time constraints are
trivial. It has been estimated that the labour
costs of a healthy diet for a single-headed
household recipient of the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly
the Food Stamp Program) in the United States
of America would represent 60 percent of
the total cost of food (defined as the sum of
the cost of food items and preparation time).
Time constraints help explain why even those
who can afford a healthy diet spend their
income on less healthy but more convenient
alternatives. 202

The political economy as a cost driver
Food and agricultural policies – as well as
other policies, including in the health and
environmental realms – have the power, either
directly or indirectly, to affect the cost of food.
They are not exclusively based on technical
considerations. Rather, they are the outcome of
a complex decision-making process that can be
| 130 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

influenced by a variety of objectives and interests.
In particular, the food and agriculture policy
framework, which is the focus of this subsection,
encapsulates the difficult balancing act required
when choosing between actions in agriculture
versus other sectors; among different government
objectives and fiscal policies; between benefits
for producers, consumers and intermediaries; and
even between different agricultural subsectors.
Generally, policymakers seek to achieve this
balance through a set of policies that either
provide incentives to agriculture through subsidies
or penalizes the sector or some of its actors in one
form or another. In doing so, government policy
decisions impact directly or indirectly the cost of
nutritious foods of different population groups.

overall, agricultural production in low-income
countries is penalized as suggested by a negative
NRP, while in middle- and high-income countries,
it is supported (Table 11).
This means that in low-income countries,
agricultural policy depresses prices at the farm gate
level, which, in principle, would favour consumers
if it were not for the fact that lower prices
effectively discourage agricultural production.
Lower levels of production lead to higher consumer
prices. In middle- and high-income countries, on
the other hand, government policy tends to favour
agricultural producers.
When the agricultural sector is penalized (or
taxed indirectly) by prevailing government
policies, as in the case of low-income countries,
the resulting decline in prices negatively impacts
the affordabilit y of healthy diets also in rural
areas. First, the depressed food prices reduce the
income of smallholders, thus compromising their
abilit y to afford nutritious foods. Second, the
decline in prices discourages farming activities,
which negatively affects consumers, as rural
populations are increasingly reliant on local food
markets for access to nutritious food. There are
further negative effects of indirect taxation of
agricultural production as well, including reduced
demand for farm labour and reduced wages for
unskilled workers in both farm and non-farm
jobs. Thus, even though poor households stand
to benefit from government policies, if indirect
taxation contributes to reduced food prices,
suppliers of unskilled labour in rural areas will
lose earnings. 207 Hence, the net effect on the
affordabilit y of healthy diets depends on the
relative importance of the agricultural sector.
In low-income countries, where the agricultural
sector accounts for the majorit y of employment,
it is reasonable to assume that the net impact
of agricultural taxation on the affordabilit y of
nutritious foods is negative. 208

A key indicator that shows to what extent
the agricultural sector is either penalized or
supported by trade and market policies is the
nominal rate of protection (NRP), ap which
compares farm gate prices with international
reference prices. The reference price is the
benchmark price adjusted for market access costs
associated with bringing the commodity from
the border to the farm gate. It is considered the
undistorted price that would prevail in absence
of policies and under perfect market conditions.
As such, it measures the extent to which domestic
policies, including trade, marketing or exchange
rate measures, distort the prices that farmers
receive for their products. Data provided by the
International Consortium for Measuring the
Policy Environment for Agriculture aq show that,
ap The nominal rate of protection (NRP) reflects the extent to which
agricultural trade and market policies, coupled with market dynamics,
affect commodity prices. When negative, it signals that policies in place
have led to farm gate prices lower than the international-equivalent
(reference) price, which is considered to be undistorted by national
policies and free of influence of domestic market failures. In general,
policies depressing farm gate prices are usually export barriers, as well
as price interventions to protect consumers. Lack of regulations
addressing value chain inefficiencies, which constrain price
transmission, can also determine price disincentives at the farm gate.
When the NRP is positive, this indicates that trade protection, through
import tariffs or quotas, and price support policies have sustained
domestic prices, thus subsidizing the agricultural sector.

The above is one example of the delicate
balancing act between producer and consumer
interests. On the one hand, higher food prices
ser ve as incentives for farmers, traders and
processors to produce. On the other hand, food
prices are also a major determinant of the real
incomes of poor producers, who devote a large
proportion of their revenues on food purchases.

aq The Ag-Incentives Consortium is a collective effort of international
institutions that have assembled a database of agricultural policy
indicators with the objective of providing a tool to analyse the policy
environment and political economy phenomena of food systems.
Partner institutions are the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank
Group (WB).

Impact of trade policies on the cost of food

agricultural export subsidies with the objective
of creating a fair trade environment for food
producers around the world, particularly for
those in low- and middle-income countries, who
could not compete against their counterparts in
high-income countries that artificially boosted
exports through subsidies. 211 Nevertheless, some
governments continued to put in place export
bans and controls, often on ad-hoc basis, in
order to reduce and stabilize domestic prices
of staple foods. However, such restrictions
have often proven to be ineffective in reducing
domestic food prices, and tend to increase price
instabilit y. 212,213,214 In addition, when trade
policies are used to shield the domestic market
from unfavourable developments in the world
market, these policies have a multiplier effect.
Specifically, high food prices may trigger a series
of export restrictions that exacerbate the rise
of the world food price that, in turn, feeds into
even more restrictive policies. Similarly, low food
prices may lead exporting governments to set
export promotion measures that in turn lower
the world price and lead to further promotion
measures. 215 Since the adoption of the “Nairobi
Package” by the W TO in 2015, such subsidies are
no longer allowed under W TO rules.

Trade is a central element to global food securit y.
Agricultural trade has increased substantially
over the past decade, resulting in almost
20 percent of all dietar y energ y supply worldwide
being derived from imported food. 209 Much of this
expansion in food trade and consumption of food
imports is driven by low- and middle-income
countries. A large proportion of exports are
provided by a small number of net-exporting
emerging economies. Five countries (China,
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan,
Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia) are
responsible for about 40 percent of all global food
imports. Seven countries (Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and
the United States of America) account for about
55 percent of total food exports. As a result, the
impact of these main players on the international
market stabilit y and prices is large. 209
Trade policy commonly refers to border policies
as well as domestic support measures that
affect trade f lows. The discussion below focuses
on the impact of the former, which include
measures that directly affect imports, such as
tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs), and
exports, including export taxes or restrictions.
Obser vers point out that challenges related
to escalating food prices may be partly due to
trade policies. 210 In 2015, members of the World
Trade Organization ( W TO) agreed to eliminate

Regarding food imports, trade policies affect the

measures, with over 16 000 measures registered
in the WTO database for these products alone. 216
NTMs can negatively affect the affordability of
diets. For example, exporters and importers may
face additional costs to comply with regulatory
requirements, driving up the cost of trade. This in
turn would increase food prices and make diets
less affordable. On the other hand, NTMs can
play an important role in raising food safety and
quality levels, and improve the nutritional content
of diets. Tariffs and non-tariff measures are a
source of concern for food exporting countries that
face an uncertain market outlook, which weakens
government incentives to prioritize agricultural
production as a major source of economic growth
and development. A direct consequence of this
is the low levels of agricultural investments in
infrastructure and innovation. 209

discourage imports are among the most used
policy instruments to protect domestic producers
and food processing industries. Generally, tariff
barriers remain higher for agricultural products
than any other product group, increasing the cost
of food in countries applying those restrictions,
and leading to a misallocation of resources that
reduces global welfare. Worldwide, governments
support the production of sugar, rice and animal
products the most through inter ventions, while
penalizing the production of more nutrient-rich
fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes and
bananas, the most (Table 12).
Besides tariff barriers, governments also
implement non-tariff measures, such as sanitary
and phyto-sanitary measures (SPS) and technical
barriers to trade (TBT). As trade liberalization
has progressed over the past decades, the
number of regulatory policies pertaining to
product quality, health and safety standards has
increased. Animal products and vegetables are
the product groups most subjected to non-tariff

Protectionar y trade measures such as import
tariffs and quotas, together with input subsidy

strategies. In low-income countries, this policy
has protected and incentivized the domestic
production of staple foods such as rice (Figure 39)
and maize but often to the detriment of vitaminand micronutrient-rich foods (i.e. fruits and
vegetables). ar This can have an adverse effect on
the affordabilit y of more nutritious foods.

to import tariffs, shielding domestic poultr y
producers from cheaper imports from Brazil and
the United States of America. Although these
policies have been effective in eliminating
imports, they have also driven up the local
retail price of chicken, making one of the main
sources of animal protein less affordable for
consumers. 217

As mentioned, trade policy often involves
significant trade-offs. For example, across
many countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean, poultr y meat imports are subject

The case of rice within the Eastern Africa
Communit y (EAC) demonstrates a similar
dilemma. In Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and
Uganda, the EAC imposes a Common External
Tariff on sensitive products, including rice, of
up to 75 percent. Although this protects the
EAC’s rice farmers and processors from cheaper
imports, evidence indicates that this support
leaves consumers paying more for rice in the
retail market. 217

ar A graphical representation of the nominal rate of protection for
high value commodities (e.g. fruits and vegetables) is challenged by a
serious lack of sufficient data for low-income countries. For staple foods
such as rice and maize, not only are data available for all low-income
countries but the policy environment around these commodities is
relatively homogenous in all of these countries, with strong tariff
protection, which offers a meaningful interpretation of the very positive
nominal rate of protection values.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Other domestic support measures
affecting food prices

There is widespread consensus regarding the
importance of public spending. It is important to
ensure that scarce resources are invested in those
areas where returns are higher. Certain t y pes of
expenditure that are proven to have high returns,
such as agricultural R&D and extension, tend
to be sorely underfunded. 223 Conversely, while
subsidies can have positive effects in enhancing
productivit y, their long-term returns have been
estimated to be lower than those of public goods.

Beyond the trade and market policies discussed
above, there are other measures that national
governments may put in place that influence
food prices, which represent trade-offs
between supporting agricultural producers and
consumers. Managed price policies have been
adopted by countries throughout the world.
High-income countries, including United States
of America and those in the European Union,
maintained price measures to support their
farmers for several decades during the post-war
period, even though recently they have largely
replaced them with direct payments decoupled
from prices and production. 218 In middle- and
low-income countries, governments still revert
to some of these measures to either protect
consumers from high food prices or incentivize
domestic agricultural production and prevent
profit losses. In the former, interventions usually
take the form of food price controls, reduction
of consumption taxes, interventions to limit
monopoly or oligopoly positions and release of
food stocks. In the latter, policymakers stimulate
production through price-setting mechanisms that
fix minimum and reference prices, or commodity
board procurement at supported prices. 219

According to the public expenditure data 224 in
selected sub-Saharan African countries, limited
resources available to the region’s governments
are mainly absorbed by investments in food
production, which continues to take up the largest
share of agricultural investments at the expense
of other segments of the food system (Figure 40).
As discussed, farmers in low-income countries
are largely penalized by trade and market policies
that suppress prices. Conversely, they seem to
benefit from significant budgetary transfers,
mainly in the form of input subsidy programmes
and a few other farm income support measures. 225
These expenditures are often preferred by
policymakers, as they represent an immediate,
liquid and targetable benefit for the rural
population, which constitutes a large electoral
base in these countries. However, input subsidies
are also difficult to phase out, even when costs
exceed benefits. 226 Spending a large proportion
of the budget on input subsidies may not be the
most efficient approach to ensure sectoral growth
and affordability of food. 226

No matter what the policy objectives are, there
will be winners and losers in the population
from each of these inter ventions, and the
affordabilit y of healthy diets will be affected
as well. For instance, preventing food price
increases through price controls may make
healthy diets more affordable for the most
v ulnerable citizens. Nevertheless, the same
inter vention can reduce incentives for farmers
to produce nutritious foods, as retail prices are
controlled, subsequently reducing the overall
availabilit y of nutritious foods in the countr y.

As shown in Figure 40, post-production
facilities, like storage and marketing, remain
under-supported. Expenditures that benefit
consumers (e.g. school feeding and cash
transfers) are also limited compared with
expenditures targeting producers, although a
reversal in this trend is visible in some African
countries, more recently. In countries like
Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique, increasing
emphasis has been given to social protection
programmes, in particular cash transfers
targeting the poorest. 225 Expenditure of this t y pe
and marketing and storage expenditures, to a
lesser extent, can address constraints faced by the
poor in accessing nutritious food. Investments in
agricultural R&D have also proven to be highly
effective in reducing malnutrition, compared with

Public expenditure and investments
Public expenditure and investments also affect
the cost of food. Public expenditure is a powerful
instrument by which governments can shape and
develop their food systems. 220,221,222 Public spending
can be used as an equity tool in reallocating
resources in favour of the poorest family farmers
and smallholder producers or to address market
failures or overcome the under provision of public
goods in the food and agriculture sectors. 222

non-agricultural R&D spending. For example,
the introduction of improved seed varieties can
lead to a positive supply shock, which decreases
prices and increases consumption, leading
to an improvement in selected nutritional
outcomes. 227,228

Although the pro-producer bias in public
budgets can partially compensate for the
negative nominal rate of protection that
producers in low-income countries face, a
rebalancing of allocations towards more
efficient expenditures with longer-term impacts
on food securit y and nutrition is desirable.
Investments in public goods, such as roads and
storage infrastructure, and in food assistance
programmes (food aid, cash transfers and
school feeding, captured under “consumer
transfers” in Figure 40) are fundamental to
ensuring affordabilit y of healthy diets, when
nutrition-sensitive components are included.

Other investments with great potential to enhance
affordability of nutritious foods are those in road
infrastructure, as noted earlier. Only 16 percent
of expenditure, on average, was allocated to
infrastructural projects in the countries analysed
(Figure 40). However, several studies confirm that
improved roads can reduce prices of local crops,
with greater effects in less productive areas and
moderate food price volatility. 229,230

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Globalization and the transformation
of food systems

smallholders have benefited, others have found
the contractual conditions unfavourable and
risky. 233 In these cases, not only can small
farmers be left out of business, but traditional
local food commercialization routes might also
be broken, including for fruits and vegetables.
In other parts of the world, contract farming with
supermarket chains has brought lower prices, but
the prices have also been more stable. 234

Food systems worldwide experienced major
transformations, in particular during the 1990s
and 2000s, as a wave of globalization in the
food industr y marked by urbanization, rising
incomes, market liberalization and foreign direct
investment reached the developing world. 231 This
globalization was accompanied by a massive
growth of investments by transnational food
corporations and rapidly increasing levels of food
sold through supermarkets, referred to as the
“supermarket revolution”. 232

In middle-income countries of Asia, in particular
in India and South-eastern Asian countries, the
penetration of the modern retail sector in the
form of supermarkets has been less pronounced
than in other countries, such as in Mexico and
South Africa.198 In India, rural business hubs
have facilitated linking smallholder farmers
to rapidly growing urban markets. Apart from
procuring food products from the farmers,
these hubs provide ser vices such as farm inputs
and equipment, as well as access to credit.
Having food processing, packaging and cooling
facilities at the same location allows consumers
to benefit from economies of agglomeration
and, on the whole, reduce transaction costs
throughout the food supply chain. This model in
India has given rise to rural supermarkets that
provide cheaper staple foods. 232 Consumers have
been drawn to supermarkets providing fresh
fruits and vegetables, eggs, dair y, meats and fish,
because they are without food safet y concerns
linked to traditional wet markets.

These developments represent a key aspect of
the political economy that drive food systems
transformation and influence the cost and
affordability of food. For example, as economic
power becomes increasingly concentrated
into fewer transnational corporations in
the food sector, these corporations engage
in policy-making processes and lobby for a
reduction in regulations that apply to them,
promote regulations that apply to other sectors
(e.g. trade and investment agreements that bind
governments to protect corporate investment
interests), resist or reject taxes that apply to their
products and lobby policymakers for subsidies
that benefit their businesses. Thus “market power
therefore readily translates into political power”145
and has kept prices of highly processed foods,
often high in fats, sugar and/or salt extremely low.

Nevertheless, while modern food retail stores
and supermarkets have changed food systems
worldwide and have had a large inf luence on how
people access nutritious foods, traditional food
markets and small, independent retail stores also
remain important sources of affordable nutritious
foods in many countries. In India, Indonesia and
Viet Nam, for example, traditional food retail
outlets still represent more than 80 percent of
the food retail share, and about 60 –70 percent
of the food retail share in upper-middle-income
countries like China and Turkey.198

No doubt, when market power and globalization
lead to lower prices of energ y-dense foods of
minimal nutritional value, this can result in
major changes in dietar y consumption patterns

drivers has been important in identif ying the
specific policies that can help reduce the cost
of nutritious foods and improve affordabilit y
of healthy diets, which are presented in the

challenges in quantif ying cost drivers of
nutritious foods, more research is urgently
needed to ensure a more solid knowledge base
on which to inform policy.

2.4

KEY MESSAGES
è Reducing the costs of nutritious foods and ensuring

the affordability of healthy diets for everyone requires
significant transformations of existing food systems
worldwide, including strengthening their resilience in
the face of shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic.

è Given the diversity and complexity of food

systems, countries will need to implement a set
of context-specific policies and strategies, and
step up public and private sector investments with
significant policy coherence, improved planning and
coordination across sectors and actors.

As seen in this section, some of the factors
driving the cost of nutritious foods are a result
of environmental degradation and climate
change challenges. This, along with the
hidden environmental costs discussed in the
previous section, provides further justification
in addressing the environmental externalities
associated with current food systems. This can
create an important potential synerg y to help
reduce the cost of nutritious foods and ensure
affordabilit y of healthy diets for all, while at the
same time transforming food systems to become
more sustainable. n

è Policy options and investments must enable

transformations that will help reduce the cost of
nutritious foods and strengthen the purchasing power
of the poor.

è This starts with an urgent rebalancing of

agricultural policies and incentives towards more
nutrition-sensitive investment in food and agricultural
production, especially fruits and vegetables,
protein-rich plant-based and animal source foods,
such as legumes, poultry, fish and dairy products.

è Policy actions across food supply chains are

critical in reducing the costs of nutritious foods.
Such actions should enhance efficiencies in food
storage, processing, packaging, distribution and
marketing, while also reducing food losses.

è The efficiency of internal trade and marketing

mechanisms are key to reducing the cost of food to
consumers and avoiding disincentives to the local
production of nutritious foods, are important to
improve the affordability of healthy diets for both
urban and rural consumers.

the impacts of the rising number of barriers to
international trade on the affordability of nutritious
foods (including non-tariff measures put in place to
ensure food safety), as restrictive trade policies tend
to raise the cost of food, which can be particularly
harmful to net food-importing countries.

è Raising the affordability of healthy diets

requires policies that enhance employment and
income-generating activities, reduce income
inequality and ensure that no one is left behind.
Nutrition-sensitive social protection programmes will
be particularly necessary to support the poor and
those living through humanitarian crises, without
basic access to sufficient nutritious food to meet
dietary requirements.

These estimates, together with the most recent
data on food securit y and nutritional status
presented in Part 1 of this report, demonstrate
the tremendous challenges policymakers face in
transforming their countries’ food systems by
2030. COV ID-19 will exacerbate these challenges
as it negatively affects food supply chains and
people’s access to nutritious foods. In spite of
great uncertaint y and the likelihood of a deep
global recession, countries can take action to
soften the impact of the pandemic on food and
nutrition securit y.

è Additional policy measures that are beyond

the scope of this report, but are designed to
promote healthy diets, need to be put in place as
well. These include the promotion of healthy food
environments, taxation of energy-dense foods, food
industry and marketing regulation, and policies
supporting nutrition education, sustainable food
consumption and food waste reduction.

This section provides g uidance on policy
instruments and strategies to prioritize actions
and investments. The emphasis is on reducing
the cost of nutritious foods and ensuring
affordabilit y of healthy diets in the broader
context of food systems transformation. Some of
the policies and strategies discussed in this
section can form a critical part of broader efforts
towards strengthening the resilience of food
systems against shocks the size of the COV ID-19
pandemic. More specific policy recommendations
for governments are presented in Box 21.

è There are significant opportunities to address both

the health and environmental challenges through
changes in dietary patterns that have a lower impact
on human health and the environment.

Results from the analyses in earlier sections
of this report highlight the many challenges
in providing the world’s populations with
access to healthy diets to meet their nutrient
requirements and lead an active and healthy
life. The sobering statistics call for the urgent
transformation of food systems towards diets
that are affordable, predominantly plant-based
and sustainable. To summarize the key results:

As elaborated in Section 2.2 of this report, healthy
diets can play an important role in an overall
strateg y towards reducing diet-related health
costs and environmental costs. Addressing these
“hidden costs” to society requires a range of
policy measures and investments beyond the
immediate focus of this report.

 Estimates of the cost and affordabilit y of
diets around the world suggest that at more
than 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy
diet; more than 1.5 billion cannot afford a
diet that meets required levels of essential
nutrients; 185 million cannot even access a
diet with sufficient dietar y energ y.

IMPACT OF COVID-19: POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT COST INCREASES OF
NUTRITIOUS FOODS AND ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS
The following recommendations for governments
can help ensure that food systems provide sufficient,
diverse and nutritious foods to enable access to
healthy diets for all.

 Expand and improve emergency food assistance
and social protection programmes to ensure access
to nutritious food for the poor and vulnerable, as
they have been hardest hit by the pandemic.235
 Coordinate action to provide life-saving
humanitarian assistance and avoid widespread
famine, especially for millions of civilians living
in conflict situations, including many women and
children.236
 Enact trade and tax policies to keep global
trade open;237 restrictions on movement of goods
will cause food losses and disrupt production,
processing, distribution and sales of diverse, safe
and nutritious foods.
 Focus on key logistics bottlenecks in the food value
chains to avoid unnecessary spikes in the cost of
food,237 in particular the affordability of diversified
safe and nutritious food for all.
 Step up direct support to smallholders to enhance
their productivity, reduce pre-harvest and

post-harvest losses, and ensure access to food
markets, also through e-commerce channels.235
Scale up “double-duty actions” in the COVID-19
response to reduce negative impacts on food
security and nutrition (e.g. exclusive breastfeeding
promotion, maternal nutrition and antenatal care
programmes, adapted school feeding programmes,
food and agriculture policies that support healthy
diets, universal healthcare).238
Consider initiating and/or maintaining food
fortification programmes in line with international
guidance to counteract worsening diet quality
during the pandemic, as the consumption of
unfortified food or non-perishable foods with lower
levels of micronutrient content could rise.239
Put in place economic stimulus measures for proper
recovery and with strengthened food access, as
the pandemic widely lowers people’s purchasing
power, especially for the increasing numbers of
unemployed.240

A ROADMAP TOWARDS ENSURING THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHY DIETS –
KEY STEPS IN FOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION
The following recommended high-level policy consultations, analyses and actions represent key steps to transforming
food systems at all levels to enable the provision of affordable healthy diets for all.

STEP 1

Comprehensive situation analysis. Governments must have a thorough understanding of the food
security and nutrition situation, in addition to the capacity of food systems to deliver nutritious
foods and at what level of affordability, to all segments of the population.
Cost drivers of healthy diets. Identify cost drivers of nutritious foods along the food supply chains,

and to what extent the food environments facilitate or hinder people’s physical, economic and
social access to healthy diets. Ensure cross-sectoral consultation, including representatives
from public and private sectors, and civil society, while ensuring robust safeguards to manage
conflicts of interest.

Address urgent needs of the most vulnerable. While preparing for food systems transformation, ensure
that adequate social protection mechanisms and emergency support are in place to help
reduce the still unacceptably high levels of hunger and malnutrition in all its forms.

Identify policies and investments to leverage food systems transformation. Agree upon a set of well-designed
policies and investment opportunities across social and economic sectors towards more
nutrition-sensitive food systems that provide greater access to affordable healthy diets for the
entire population.
Implement policy recommendations and monitor adherence and impact. Ensure policy measures and

investment are implemented in accordance with agreed priorities, backed by appropriate
legislation, regulation and investment plans from all actors in the public and private sectors;
establish an evidence-based monitoring system to monitor progress towards SDG targets.

effective transformation of food systems

food systems, each situation will require a
context-specific set of coordinated policy
instruments and strategies, as well as public
and private sector investments for food systems
to be transformed. To be effective, proposed
policy measures must first recognize the current
state of food securit y and nutrition of any one
countr y or communit y, as well as the specific
food systems context within which the policy
recommendations are made.

During the food systems transformation process
recommended in Box 22, the following are
important principles to follow.

systems play in driving the rural economy, in
particular. Equally important, given rapid rates
of urbanization and the increasingly complex
web of food supply chains expected to deliver
safe and nutritious foods to rising numbers of
urban consumers, strong rural-urban linkages
are critical.
Following an improved understanding of the
overall challenges, governments, regional and
global institutions in consultation with all
concerned actors should work towards putting in
place a comprehensive set of policy measures that
will enable a rapid and efficient transformation
of food systems. This should include a full
understanding of the extent to which the political
economy and potential trade-offs will either
promote or hinder affordabilit y of healthy diets
that include sustainabilit y considerations.

Consider temporal dimensions of transformation
There is a temporal dimension that must be
considered when devising policies towards
successful food systems transformation.
Policy effectiveness towards achieving
development objectives will depend on the
identification of which challenges are to be
tackled more boldly at the beginning of the
transformation process, where there is more
room for rapid progress. This is an important
aspect because public expenditures and
investments towards transformative policies
may face increasing marginal returns in
addressing hunger, food insecurit y and all forms
of malnutrition only during a certain period of
time. as Public expenditures in particular are a key
instrument to achieve systemic change.

Strengthen policy alignment through improved
planning and coordination
Given the complexit y and diversit y of existing
food systems, and the political economy that has
shaped them in often undesirable ways, concerted
efforts are needed across many different
sectors of the economy: health, agriculture,
environment, forestr y, fisheries and aquaculture,
the food industr y, trade and marketing, finance
and development, infrastructure, retail and
education. All actors, including government,
private sector, research and academia, civil
societ y, the media, and the food producers and
consumers themselves, have to work together.
This includes actors of the global value chains
with monopolistic and oligopolistic power that
exert inf luence on the domestic food systems
of countries.

As short-term inter ventions aim to meet the
immediate needs of the poorest and most food
insecure, it is important not to lose sight of
the nutritional needs of these most v ulnerable
during the transformation process, even if it
means increasing the countr y’s env ironmental
footprint. Not meeting nutrient requirements
during critical phases of the life cycle, as in
infancy, early childhood and adolescence, or
during pregnancy and lactation, will have
lifelong and intergenerational consequences.
Hence the importance of immediate food
consumption and nutrition needs being
addressed adequately at the beg inning of the
food systems transformation process, even if
it entails certain trade-offs (env ironmental,
in this case).

Certain policy measures or investments will
have a greater impact on the transformation of
food systems than others, prompting some sector
representatives to advocate for these measures
only. However, given the inter-connectivit y of
different actions in a food systems context, only
concerted efforts across sectors will be helpful.
While most investments in food systems are
made by the private sector, the public sector
holds primar y responsibilit y for providing public
goods and enhancing social values by filling
gaps (e.g. investment in road networks and social
protection mechanisms) and addressing market

as Empirical evidence and analysis emanating from a number of
country studies for Latin America and the Caribbean 352 and for Africa,
Asia and the Middle East 353 recognizes the importance of considering
decreasing marginal returns in the effectiveness of social spending over
time. Sánchez and Cicowiez 354 have added analysis to demonstrate
that, in the very long run, the payoff of past policies will depend on
labour market changes and the efficiency of service delivery.

The public sector has primar y responsibilit y for
longer-term investments towards food systems
transformation, such as infrastructure for water
and roads, and other measures that create the
enabling environment for cost efficiencies to be
realized along the value chains. Governments can
also deploy investment decisions through
co-investing, taxing, subsidizing or reg ulating
to encourage private sector investments in food
systems for healthy diets, while accounting for
their environmental footprint. These investments
should be complemented by reg ulator y and

challenge the need for expansion in
agricultural production. The above trends call
for substantial policy changes in food and
agriculture, and along the entire food supply
chain, in order to meet rising food demand.

Strategies and policies that include both shortand longer-term perspectives are needed to help
prioritize investments and inter ventions, while
avoiding unfavourable trade-offs as countries
transform their food systems. In spite of the
many challenges in ensuring that appropriate
policy decisions are made at the right time,
many opportunities exist for strengthening
food value chains that deliver fresh, nutritious
foods at affordable prices in markets around
the world. Below, various policy instruments,
inter ventions and investments are suggested
that could transform existing food systems
towards more affordable healthy diets.

Policies and investments to reduce the cost of

cost of nutritious foods and increasing the
affordabilit y of healthy diets must start with a
reorientation of agricultural priorities towards
more nutrition-sensitive food and agricultural
production. Public expenditures will need to
be stepped up to enable many of the policy
decisions and investments needed to raise
productivit y, encourage diversification in food
production and ensure that nutritious foods
are made abundantly available. In some cases,
this will require expenditure reallocations
for a better prioritization and strengthened
effectiveness of public expenditures as part
of an overall food and agriculture sector
strateg y. In this regard, it is also essential that
governments carefully consider trade-offs in
their policy decisions and assess the impact of
alternative policy measures towards the ultimate
objective of eradicating hunger and all forms
of malnutrition. Such a shift should consider
the overarching aspects of food and agriculture
policy and investments outlined below.

Policy options to reduce the cost and enhance
affordability of healthy diets
A rising and ever more urbanized world
population, combined with increasing levels
of income, is placing tremendous pressure on
the food and agriculture sectors to increase
production to keep food prices from rising.103
In order to offset this upward pressure on
prices and increase affordabilit y of healthy
diets, food and agricultural policies and
incentives must help accelerate productivit y
and production of vegetables and fruits,
and protein-rich foods. Importantly, some
estimates suggest that increased agricultural
productivit y alone will help raise incomes
of nearly 80 percent of the world’s extreme
poor who live in rural areas, most of whom
rely on farming for their livelihoods.149
The impacts of climate change and natural
resource constraints, however, will further

incentives to improve access to healthy diets
must start at the producer level. Investments that

important to provide greater access to healthy

» and maintaining profitabilit y, and producing

Avoiding taxation of nutritious foods. In low-income
countries, where growth in food production
is most needed, the agricultural sectors are
often penalized as a result of, for example,
exchange rate f luctuations, price controls
or weak bargaining power of farmers.
Policy inter ventions that tend to depress prices
of agricultural commodities not only reduce
farmers’ incomes and incentives to produce, but
also reduce the affordabilit y of healthy diets for
some of the most marginalized populations (the
rural poor). Therefore, policies that penalize
food and agricultural production (through direct
or indirect taxation) should be avoided, as they
tend to have adverse effects on the production
of nutritious foods.

marketable surpluses at reduced costs, while
increasing the resilience of food systems.
Policies and investments must also focus on
improving nutrition outcomes among the
population.182,244 These include policies that
facilitate diversified and integrated food and
agricultural production systems, empower women
and youth in food and agriculture, and provide
incentives for increased production of fruits
and vegetables, as well as small-scale livestock,
agroforestr y, aquaculture and fisheries products.
Agricultural policies that encourage a move
away from monoculture towards more
integrated production techniques, such as
agroforestr y and rice-fish farming, should
be considered as this helps reduce the cost of
production, increase food producers’ incomes
and resilience, provide ecosystem ser vices, and
increase dietar y diversit y. In recognition of the
positive impact of integrated approaches on food
securit y and nutrition, the inclusion of nutrition
objectives in food and agriculture policies and
ensuring access for all to safe and sustainable
healthy diets are emphasized under the action
area on “sustainable, resilient food systems for
healthy diets” under the United Nations Decade
of Action on Nutrition 2016 –2025. 245

Subsidy levels in the food and agriculture
sectors should also be revisited, especially
in low-income countries, to avoid taxation of
nutritious foods. A FAO analysis shows that
across a group of 68 countries, subsidies are
highest for sugar, followed by subsidies for
animal products and staple foods (mainly
rice). Among the same group of countries,
fruits and vegetables are among the most
penalized (through various policy measures that
disincentivize production). Governments should
conduct an objective review of current
agricultural policies to ensure the production of
nutritious foods is supported rather than taxed.

Promotion of urban and peri-urban agriculture.

Other policy and structural impediments,
including a weak private sector in many
low-income countries, have limited the
supply responsiveness of vegetables and other
non-staple foods. In India, policies that promote
staple crop production, such as fertilizer and
credit subsidies, price supports and irrigation
infrastructure (particularly for rice), have tended
to discourage the production of traditional
non-staple crops, such as pulses and leg umes. 248
A bias in irrigation infrastructure development
in favour of staple crops has been maintained
in many other regions. Instead, policies should
promote investment in irrigation infrastructure
specifically targeting strengthened capacit y
for all-season vegetable production, and other
high-value commodities to increase availabilit y
of nutritious foods.

Production of diverse, nutritious foods should
also be expanded in peri-urban and urban
settings through investment in horticultural
crop production to provide easier access to
fruits and vegetables, while reducing the risk
of food losses along the shortened food supply
chains. The wide variet y of urban agriculture
production systems, and a general lack of
understanding of the relative importance,
nature and food securit y implications of urban
agriculture 246 make it difficult to provide
specific policy recommendations. Meanwhile, in
order to ensure that the potential of urban
agriculture in supporting food securit y and
nutrition can be fully exploited, appropriate
mechanisms of governance and institutional
support for urban agriculture, including
supportive legislation, need to be developed. 247

PART 2 TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS FOR ALL

Investment in research, innovation and extension to raise
productivity of nutritious foods in the food and agriculture
sectors. National food and agricultural strategies

Policy options along the food value chain. Designing and
implementing the aforementioned policy
directions, aimed at raising productivit y of
nutritious foods, also requires taking into
consideration the critical aspects of the supply
chain (or value chain) of each product. In this
regard, the value chain approach is useful for
navigating the complexit y of food systems
and identif ying opportunities for enhanced
nutrition at different stages. 252 For any one
food product, all actions along the food value
chain ultimately affect the consumer price, and
hence the affordabilit y of food (depending on
the consumer’s income or purchasing power).
Key policy actions and both public and private
sector investments can increase agricultural
productivit y, reduce food losses and enhance
efficiencies in food storage, processing,
packaging, distribution and marketing across
the food value chains, all of which translate
into lower food prices. In many countries,
larger public and private sector investments in
food value chains are needed as food systems
are becoming increasingly more complex and
intertwined, especially in rapidly growing
metropolitan areas.

and programmes should step up investment in
R&D to raise productivit y of nutritious foods
and help reduce their cost, while enhancing
access to improved technologies, especially for
smallholders, to maintain adequate levels of
profitabilit y. This should be accompanied by
research and extension ser vices that make it
possible for producers to adopt more sustainable
production methods that conser ve natural
resources, in particular soil and water, 249 as well
as biodiversit y. 250 Furthermore, collaboration
with regional and international research
and extension organizations and networks is
important to strengthen capacities of national
agricultural research and extension systems,
and to facilitate sharing of knowledge and
best practices and innovations for increased
production and productivit y.
Public investment in demand-driven research and
extension should be complemented by investment
in rural electrification programmes, irrigation
infrastructure and increased mechanization
to further raise productivit y. In parallel with
R&D in food and agriculture, low-income
countries need to enable and promote inclusive
agricultural innovations to meet the rising food
demand. Agricultural innovation takes place
most effectively in a system where research
organizations, extension and advisor y ser vices
and other key institutions interact with each
other and are strongly connected to family
farmers, enabling them to raise productivit y,
strengthen resilience to shocks and enhance
sustainable natural resource management. 251

Modern food supply chains, with increasingly
diverse and differentiated food products, have
brought tremendous opportunities to “add
value” to food items. At the same time, they
have increased costs to the consumer. As this
report presents various policy options below,
it is important to recognize that policies that
inter vene directly in agricultural production to
promote healthy eating habits are unlikely to
be effective or efficient if they do not take into
account how foods are processed, distributed
and marketed throughout the entire food supply
chain, 253 and how the inter vention will affect
each stage. Policy actions and investments that
specifically help increase the affordabilit y of
healthy diets – as well as healthy diets that also
include sustainabilit y considerations – within a
food systems context and across the food value
chains are discussed below.

Innovation in agriculture takes on many
possible forms, including inter alia labour-saving
mechanization; crop and animal breeding;
the use of biological control agents and the
management of soil biodiversit y to improve soil
fertilit y, in addition to hydroponics to produce
food in water-limited areas; the development of
vaccines against livestock and aquatic animal
diseases; the increased use of information
and communication technologies (ICTs); the
use of drones for aerial sur veys in combating
deserts locusts; and novel ways for farmers to
access markets.

Policies and investment for nutrition-sensitive value chains.
Globally, there has been a growing interest
among governments and development
institutions in using nutrition-sensitive value
chains as a means to improve nutrition. 254
| 146 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

food commodities that could address nutrition
gaps of these girls, as well as other family
members, were identified – and included
bananas, cassava, maize, spinach, sweet
potatoes and fish – which also presented a
profitable business opportunit y for smallholders.
The applied nutrition-sensitive approach
helped empower women and generate increased
income, laying foundations for a local food
system that sustainably delivers nutritious
foods that contribute to healthy eating habits.
Thus investments spanning across multiple
value chains helped diversif y diets and sources
of income. 257

Examples include investments in improved
storage, processing and preser vation to retain the
nutritional value of food products. As discussed
above, at the production level, broadening the
mix of crops produced and diversif ying into
agroforestr y, livestock and/or fisheries products
is also important to raise incomes, as well as
nutritional outcomes of small-scale producers. 255
The need for stronger policies towards
more nutrition-sensitive value chains
has been advocated especially for highand middle-income and rapidly g row 
low-income countries, where the ag ricultural
sector has become a supplier of raw materials
for the food processing industr y, and where
the food system policies promote inexpensive
calories and expensive nutrients.186 It has
also been obser ved that highly processed
energ y-dense foods are increasingly marketed
and made available in low- and middle-income
countries, demanding increased production of
redients for these foods (primarily refined
starches, oil and sugars) while at the same time
the supply of nutritious, minimally processed
foods is being constrained. 256 A mong others,
these developments have underscored the
need for policy inter ventions that promote
nutrition-sensitive food systems from the
production level throughout the food value
chain.186

Policies and investments to reduce food losses. These policies
and investments can increase affordabilit y of
nutritious foods in two ways. First, by focusing
on the earlier (production) stages of the food
supply chain, as this tends to boost supplies
and hence reduce food prices at the farm gate.181
This is particularly important for the reduction
of losses in perishable commodities, such as
fruits and vegetables, dair y, fish and meat.
Second, by targeting the parts of the food supply
chain where food losses are greatest, as this will
more likely have a greater impact on reducing
the cost of the targeted food item. The overall
price effect will differ from one commodit y to
the next and also across countries.181 In many
low- and middle-income countries, food losses
of perishable commodities are greatest where
markets are absent, road infrastructure is poor
and cold storage facilities are poorly developed.
Investment in improved storage facilities, as well
as post-har vest preser vation and conser vation
techniques, will not only reduce food losses, but
also help maintain the nutrient content of food
and improve food safet y.

For example, given the unique challenges
faced by SIDS, the Global Action Programme
on Food Securit y and Nutrition in Small
Island Developing States highlights the
importance of developing more resilient and
nutrition-sensitive food systems and their value
chains. Among others, the nutrition-sensitive
approach aims to address growing malnutrition
and health costs due to the emergence of
and preference for more energ y dense and
highly processed foods; significant levels
of food loss and waste; increased incidence
of food safet y issues and trans-boundar y
diseases, as well as environmental and natural
resource degradation.175 In another example,
the Smallholder Livelihood Development
Project in eastern Indonesia has adopted a
nutrition-sensitive value chain approach to
address a “nutrition gap” found to be particularly
severe for adolescent girls. Under the project,

Policies and investment in nutrition-sensitive handling and
processing. In addition to food storage, appropriate
food handling and processing facilities are
central to increasing efficiencies along the
value chain. If passed on to the consumer (in
the form of cost savings), these efficiency gains
contribute towards increasing the affordabilit y of
healthy diets. Improved storage, processing and
preser vation may also increase incomes of food
producers, in addition to reducing the negative
effects of seasonalit y on food insecurit y and
malnutrition.182 In Indonesia, supporting fisher y

INVESTING IN THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE VALUE CHAINS RESULTS IN MORE EQUITABLE
INCOMES AND HEALTHY DIETS IN INDONESIA
There is tremendous potential for fisheries and
aquaculture to raise incomes and dietary diversity,
especially among the poor and malnourished,258
as demonstrated by a project supporting fishing
communities in Indonesia. Over the past few decades,
fish consumption worldwide has grown at a rate twice
as fast as global population growth,259 and in 2015
it accounted for 17 percent of total animal protein
consumed,260 demonstrating its potential to provide
greater availability and access to nutritious food.
Indonesia is the world’s second largest fish
producer after China, producing 6.1 million tonnes
in 2016 (accounting for about 8 percent of the
world’s total). Small-scale fishers raise and/or
harvest most of the fish produced in the country.259
However, unsustainable production practices, in
particular in aquaculture, have undermined the sector’s
performance261 as it only contributed to approximately
3 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.
Further, only 28 percent of the country’s total fish
production is processed after harvesting, due
to lack of post-harvest processing facilities and
infrastructures. The sector is also increasingly affected
by overexploitation, pollution and climate change.
Addressing these challenges, the Government of
Indonesia and development partners implemented
the Coastal Community Development Project (CCDP)
between 2013 and 2017 in coastal and small
island communities of Indonesia. The project aimed
at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable
economic growth by providing fishery and aquaculture

inputs (e.g. fish feed, fishing gear and motorized
engines for fishing boats) and training, while
establishing processing and marketing facilities (e.g.
through investment in fish smokehouses, processing
warehouses, cooler boxes, marketing facilities and
information centres) that engage primarily women.
Furthermore, protection of marine areas, rotational
fishing activity plans, awareness raising campaigns
and community-based integrated coastal management
plans helped to support policies that promote
local ownership and sustainable management of
natural resources.
The CCDP was successful in increasing fish
production and productivity without inducing
overfishing, increasing incomes from fisheries through
value addition and reduced post-harvest losses,
while also improving dietary diversity of fishers in
targeted areas. Results from an impact assessment
indicate that fisheries productivity increased by
78 percent, post-harvest losses fell by 5 percent and
total income increased by 33 percent among fishers.
Dietary diversity expanded by 6 percent, mainly
driven by increased consumption of fish, seafood,
dairy and fruits. Furthermore, it was observed that
women’s empowerment was improved, among others
through an increase of the engagement of women in
fisheries processing by 27 percent.262 A key factor
driving CCDP’s success has been strengthened
linkages between fishers and processors, in addition
to strengthened local ownership and capacities of
fisheries management processes.

and aquaculture production, and processing
and marketing in coastal and small island
communities has led to increased productivit y,
incomes, dietar y diversit y, as well as women’s
empowerment, as illustrated in Box 23.

reg ularly consumed foods (such as iodization of
salt), and fortification of staple foods (through
biofortification at the production level or through
post-har vest fortification) is recommended
as a cost-effective measure to reduce these
deficiencies. 263 For example, biofortified crops are
those which have been nutritionally enhanced
using agronomic practices, conventional plant
breeding, or modern biotechnolog y to increase
the densit y of micronutrients, thus ensuring the

Food fortification. More than 2 billion people in
the world today suffer from micronutrient
deficiencies caused largely by a dietar y deficiency
of vitamins and minerals. Food fortification of

grown domestically, mainly by smallholders, and
is supplied to rural and urban markets by small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through
informal supply chains. 270 Policies, as well as
public and private sector investments aimed
at strengthening road networks and transport
and market infrastructure enhances a countr y’s
capacit y to raise the variet y of food available on
rural and urban markets and reduce the cost of
nutritious foods.

staple crop component of a diet is as nutritious
as possible. 264 This is particularly important for
the rural poor and small farming families in
low- and middle-income countries whose diets
continue to be dominated by staple foods and
are not yet able to access a diversified healthy
diet. Given that fortified foods provide a higher
micronutrient content at marginally increased
prices, it allows households to reduce the overall
cost of a healthy diet. National standards, with
qualit y assurance and qualit y control systems, as
well as reg ulator y and public health monitoring,
are needed to ensure qualit y fortification in line
with international g uidelines. 265,266,267,268

As was obser ved in Bangladesh, for example,
public investments increased access to markets
in strengthening communit y markets and
market-connecting roads, all of which improved
food securit y and nutrition outcomes of targeted
beneficiaries. 271 In Nepal, strengthening
linkages between producer organizations
of high value crops and local traders also
improved food securit y outcomes of targeted
producers. 272 And in the United States of
America, government incentives to encourage
weekly farmers’ markets and reg ulating local
supermarkets to stock fresh produce helped
raise access to nutritious food options in “food
deserts” – often identified in low-income
neighbourhoods where affordable nutritious
foods are out of reach. 273

Investment in road networks, transport and market infrastructure.
Improving the national road network, as well as
transport and market infrastructure, requires
large amounts of public and private sector
investment, but this can go a long way towards
ensuring greater affordabilit y of healthy diets.
Transport costs are a bottleneck to increasing the
affordabilit y of healthy diets in many countries,
particularly in the lower income brackets.
Beyond the farm gate, investment in an array of
physical infrastructure can help reduce the cost
of bringing farm produce to market, especially
of perishable nutritious foods. In addition,
improvements of all-weather rural roads and
the national road network can facilitate farmers’
access to markets and reduce pre-har vest and
post-har vest losses, all of which eventually
contribute to reducing consumer prices (see
Section 2.3, Box 19).

Ensuring trade and marketing policies balance producer and
consumer interests. Trade and marketing policies
aimed at decreasing the cost of food to
consumers, while avoiding disincentives to the
local production of nutritious foods, are often
difficult to balance. Nevertheless, the efficiency
of internal trade and marketing mechanisms are
possibly just as important as measures to support
international trade – if not more – in determining
the cost of healthy diets for both urban and rural
consumers, while also ensuring that food safet y
standards are met. This is particularly relevant
given rapid rates of urbanization, the lengthening
of food value chains, and generally, increased
demands placed on local food systems, in terms
of consumer demand for greater diversit y in the
choice of food commodities available, and for
adequate food safet y standards and sustainabilit y
issues to be addressed.

Furthermore, improvements in physical rural
and urban market infrastructure increase access
for agricultural producers to markets where
they can sell their wares in a competitive and
clean environment. It raises competitiveness
in price formation and strengthens the food
environment where consumers access food,
including a variet y of fresh produce and
other nutritious foods. The potential of these
improvements is substantial if one considers
the growth of urban markets. For example, in
Asia, currently about 60 –70 percent of the food
supply passes through urban markets, 269 while
urban food markets in Africa have grown rapidly
and now provide half or more of overall food for
consumption. In Kenya, more than 95 percent
of the fresh fruits and vegetables consumed is

TRADE LIBERALIZATION HELPS TO REDUCE THE COST OF NUTRIENT ADEQUATE DIETS
IN CENTRAL AMERICA
with milk prices 35 percent higher and poultry prices
75 percent higher than international market prices.276
Currently, Central American countries are
approaching the end of the trade liberalization
process that was initiated under the 2006 free trade
agreement between the United States of America, the
Dominican Republic and Central America (DR-CAFTA).
Under the DR-CAFTA agreement, trade in agricultural
products is to be fully liberalized (i.e. tariffs removed).
However, there is a separate schedule for products
considered sensitive to the local economies, including
for milk, maize, poultry, sugar and meat, under which
a gradual reduction of tariffs for each product group
was agreed upon. Except for milk, tariff protection for
most other products will end in 2021 (15 years after
the agreement’s entry into force). Evidence shows that
the agreement has led to an average annual growth
of 8.5 percent of agricultural exports from Central
American countries.277
Based on recent data, it is estimated that removing
trade protection across Central America (excluding
Belize), observed during the 2008–2014 period,
would reduce the cost of a nutrient adequate diet* by
USD 0.12 (lower bound) to USD 0.24 (upper bound)
per day, or between USD 44 and USD 88 annually.
This would represent an average reduction of 4.4 to
8.7 percent of the total cost of a nutrient adequate
diet in the region.** The gains from removing tariffs
would be highest in the countries that have the lowest
incomes. In Nicaragua and Honduras, the cost of diets
would reduce by USD 0.16–0.32 and USD 0.14–0.28
per day, respectively.

Trade liberalization can play a key role in making
diets more affordable. Evidence from Central America
shows that tariff removal has had a positive impact on
the affordability of nutrient adequate diets and helped
improve nutrition in a region that is characterized
by the coexistence of undernutrition and obesity.274
Governments in this region have traditionally used
trade policy to protect domestic producers and
processors from imports. Across the region, tariffs
are applied to several strategic products, resulting
in higher farm-gate prices for those products.
According to estimates from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), the total value of this
protection amounted to USD 13.53 billion during
the 2014–2017 period. By comparison, in the same
period, the total budget expenditure in support
of the food and agricultural sectors amounted to
USD 4.03 billion.275
The products that benefit most from trade protection
in the region include poultry, meat, sugar, milk, maize,
beans and rice. These reflect the range of policy
objectives and political economy factors that influence
trade policy: achieving food self-sufficiency (maize),
maintaining on-farm rural employment and powerful
processing industries (sugar) and protecting farmers
from more competitive, low-cost imports (poultry
and milk). However, these tariffs also drive up food
prices. In El Salvador, prices of maize are on average
30 percent higher than those on the international
market; in Honduras, milk prices are 19 percent
higher, and poultry and meat prices are 56 percent
higher. In Costa Rica, the disparity is even greater,

* The nutrient adequate diet analysed here is defined as in Box 10. See Box 11 for a brief description of the cost methodology, and Annex 3 for a full description of the simulation

** The estimated potential decrease in the cost of a nutrient adequate diet due to the removal of trade protection policies is derived from the database on price incentive indicators

imported and import-competing foods (Box 24).
As discussed in Section 2.3, protectionar y
trade policies (i.e. import tariffs, non-tariff
measures and quotas), as well as input subsidy
programmes tend to protect and incentivize

domestic production of staple foods, such as
rice and maize that mainly provide calories,
often to the detriment of nutritious products,
such as fruits and vegetables that provide
vitamins and minerals. Furthermore, non-tariff

measures that impose excessive food safet y
standards may unduly affect the cost of
nutritious foods. This can therefore also have
significant adverse effects on the affordabilit y
of healthy diets. Hence, it is essential that
governments carefully consider the impacts
of non-tariff measures on the affordabilit y of
nutritious foods, and avoid creating reg ulator y
barriers to trade that negatively affect poor
households’ access to a healthy diet. In general,
but also at times of food crises in particular,
such as during the unfolding of the COV ID-19
pandemic, protectionism is likely to increase
the costs of healthy diets, and agricultural trade
restrictions should therefore not be imposed.

at reducing poverty and income inequality, while
enhancing employment and income-generating
activities, are also key to raising people’s
incomes and hence the affordability of healthy
diets. Today, more than 700 million people, or
10 percent of the world’s population, still live in
extreme poverty. 280 Approximately 80 percent
of the extreme poor live in rural areas. 281
Moreover, according to the analysis presented
in Section 2.1, none of these 700 million people
can afford nutrient adequate nor healthy diets.
“Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere”
under SDG 1 remains a major task requiring
substantial policy interventions, as well as
public and private sector investments across the
socio-economic sectors of many countries, in close
coordination with in-country efforts addressing
SDG 2 and most other SDGs. This is particularly
true nowadays, as the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic risks reversing the steady decline in the
prevalence of poverty achieved in most countries
over the past number of decades,142 threatening
also people’s capacity to access healthy diets.

Strengthening food supply chains under humanitarian
conditions. Many of the above recommendations
can be ver y challenging in certain contexts
when, for example, established food supply
chains are disrupted because of major natural
or man-made disasters (e.g. large-scale f loods,
earthquakes, armed conf lict or civil strife).
Under such circumstances, food supply
chains may initially break down, until local
marketplaces and strained supply chains
start delivering food supplies again to reach
v ulnerable populations, including displaced
populations living under humanitarian
conditions. The often limited production
capacit y of local communities, poor market
infrastructure, bottlenecks in supply chains
and limited market competition will most likely
result in high food prices for some of these
most v ulnerable population groups with little
or no source of income. Limited availabilit y of
nutritious foods, such as fresh produce, fish
and meat, apart from staple foods provided
as food aid, pose further challenges to
increasing affordabilit y of nutrient adequate,
let alone healthy diets under such conditions.
Under these contexts, it is important that key
actors across the food value chain help provide
better access to nutritious foods at affordable
prices to the most v ulnerable, as demonstrated
with the example of the Kakuma refugee camp
in Kenya (Box 25).

While there are important synergies between
policies enhancing employment and reducing
income inequalit y for increased food securit y
and better nutrition, including social protection,
these have been addressed in depth in the 2019
edition of this report. Moreover, that edition
comprehensively addressed the challenges
in safeg uarding food securit y and nutrition
as they relate to measures for also protecting
incomes in the context of economic slowdowns
and downturns, such as the global economic
downturn caused by COV ID-19.
This year’s edition of the report also
highlights the importance of social protection
policies, although exclusively those that are
nutrition-sensitive. These t y pes of policies are
most appropriate to provide better access to
nutritious foods to lower-income consumers and
thus raise their affordabilit y of healthy diets.
They can be particularly important in the face
of adversit y, as we are seeing today during the
COV ID-19 pandemic.

DIETS FOR SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN A REFUGEE CAMP IN KENYA

pay suppliers up front. Thus, identifying reliable
wholesalers who can supply retailers with
commodities at negotiated prices can help small
retailers meet consumer demand. As wholesalers
develop relationships with the small retailers,
this facilitates trust and transparency to extend
further credit. As of October 2019, four selected
wholesalers extended USD 460 000 worth of
credit monthly to small shops in Kakuma Camp.278
 Assisting medium-sized wholesalers to purchase
their wares from large-scale food manufacturers
and importers can help reduce wholesale prices.
Savings can then be passed on to retailers and
consumers, increasing the value for money of cash
assistance, while also strengthening collaboration
between small and large market players.
 Linking refugee camp traders to local neighbouring
farms can bring new business opportunities for
farmers into these camps, while ensuring fresh
produce is accessible and affordable for refugees.
For example, in linking local farmers and irrigation
schemes with traders in Kakuma, the price of
tomatoes decreased by 30 percent.
 Facilitating common market days can connect
local traders, suppliers, transporters, farmers and
fishers across markets. Communication among
market actors can help attract new suppliers,
as often suppliers are unaware of the scale of a
camp market and the business opportunities it
offers. In Kakuma, the supply of fresh produce
increased from two trucks prior to common market
days to seven trucks daily.279

Humanitarian conditions and protracted crisis
situations present particular challenges to many of
the most vulnerable populations to access healthy
diets. While some of their most urgent needs may
be covered by humanitarian assistance, many
people rely on poorly functioning food supply
chains to access some of the food they most urgently
need. Actions towards supporting more efficient
food value chains under humanitarian conditions
help ensure improved nutrition among these most
vulnerable populations.
Kakuma Camp in Northern Kenya is the largest
refugee camp in the world with 191 500 refugees and
asylum-seekers. Because of its size and remoteness,
this camp faces significant challenges in accessing
food. Poor market infrastructure, bottlenecks in supply
chains, high rents and high energy costs for traders,
limited competition and limited local production
capacity often result in high food prices, decreasing
the purchasing power of the cash assistance provided
to refugees. Other consequences include a limited
and unreliable assortment of foods in shops, and low
quality and availability of fresh produce and meat.
Hence, interventions that increase efficiency of value
chains in such context can have significant payoffs.
In 2015, a retail engagement programme was
begun with local government aimed at optimizing
existing camp markets and improving “value for
money” for refugees shopping with cash-based
assistance, and for all consumers in Kakuma.
By working with local retailers and encouraging
more transparent and collaborative market practices,
business improved for actors along the food supply
chain, while consumers gained better access to
affordable healthy diets. Through retail engagement
activities, the following lessons were learned to help
improve value chains and access to healthy diets:

The local Turkana county government is in the
process of taking over the retail engagement
activities and monitor market conditions in Kakuma,
gradually increasing its capacity to facilitate
smallholder producers and traders’ access to markets
and optimize food supply chain management.
Given the good practices developed from
the retail engagement programme in Kakuma
Camp, and the policy guidance it is providing,
this successful model has been adopted in other
humanitarian contexts. This includes communities
in Lebanon, where Syrian Arab Republic refugees
reside, and those for Rohingya refugees in Cox’s
Bazar, Bangladesh.

 Directly linking small retailers to wholesalers and
manufacturers helps increase availability and
affordability of nutritious foods. This is because
when intermediaries are cut from the value chain,
the mark-ups on commodities decrease and the
savings can be passed on directly to the customer.
 Access to credit for small retailers is critical to
improving the supply of goods, because small
retailers often cannot afford to buy in bulk or to

more diverse, nutritious foods in their diet in
order to reduce dependence on starchy staples
and reduce consumption of foods high in fats,
sugars and/or salt. In El Salvador, for example,
policy recommendations to raise the affordability
of healthy diets, especially of poor households,
included nutrition-sensitive social protection
programmes (Box 26).

In examining the affordabilit y of the three
different diets under consideration, previous
sections have provided evidence that even
energ y sufficient diets are out of reach of
millions of people due to high cost barriers.
Raising the purchasing power of the poorest
through various social protection mechanisms
is common practice around the world for
improved food securit y, nutrition and health. 282
Social protection mechanisms represent a set of
policies and programmes that address economic,
environmental and social v ulnerabilities to
povert y, food insecurit y and malnutrition
by protecting and promoting livelihoods, in
particular through the reduction of financial
and social barriers to accessing food. 283

Cash transfer programmes. Among the different
kinds of social protection programmes, the
effectiveness of cash transfer programmes
depends on: (i) the level of income they
complement; (ii) how much of the food
affordabilit y gap they close; (iii) the availabilit y
of nutritious foods in local markets; or
(iv) whether transfers are conditional on the
use of a particular ser vice, such as antenatal
care. Cash transfers are used in a wide range of
programmes including government social safet y
nets, child grants or old age pensions, as well
as food assistance programmes. These last are
designed to meet food needs directly, whereas
the first three provide a transfer to meet a
household’s most immediate income needs, part
or all of which can be spent on food.

These mechanisms can be particularly important
in the face of adversit y, as we are seeing today
during the COV ID-19 pandemic. A recent review
of social protection policy measures from the
World Bank and UNICEF shows that a total
of 151 countries have introduced or adapted
these measures. 284 Cash transfers have been
the most common, in additional to in-kind food
and voucher schemes, as well as school feeding
programmes. A review of policy examples reveals
that the number of countries providing some form
of social protection mechanism increased steadily
throughout the month of April 2020, for example
in low-income countries, with some important
gaps in Middle and Eastern Africa, including
countries with a protracted crisis situation
(Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and
South Sudan). This is worrisome, considering
that the highest prevalence of undernourishment
worldwide is found in sub-Saharan Africa. 284
Overall, while the increased investment in social
protection mechanisms is laudable, this has also
led to the overburdening of these mechanisms in
many countries.

The contribution of these ver y different
prog rammes towards meeting people’s
affordabilit y of a nutrient adequate or healthy
diet is usually limited, because their objectives
are t y pically desig ned around meeting dietar y
energ y requirements, rather than aiming
to prov ide healthy diets. However, when
desig ned appropriately, social protection
prog rammes can also help make healthy diets
more affordable, prov ide specific ser v ices to
nutritionally v ulnerable g roups, and reach
under-ser ved populations. 287
In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the
implementation of well-designed cash transfers
with adequate and reliable transfers has resulted
in significant improvements across a range of
dietar y diversit y measures. 288 Factors that help
improve nutrition outcomes of cash transfer
programmes include: easily accessible and
affordable food stores, 289,290 a nutrition-sensitive
approach and the combination of the transfer
with other initiatives such as nutrition
education. 291 Cash transfer programmes can
also help improve the dietar y diversit y of

Especially under these circumstances, social
protection mechanisms that are nutrition-sensitive
are most appropriate to provide better access to
nutritious foods to lower-income consumers, as
in school feeding programmes through public
procurement. Micronutrient supplementation
should be promoted where required, 285 and the
creation of healthy food environments should be
fostered by encouraging consumers to include

A SOCIAL PROTECTION APPROACH TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHY DIETS
IN EL SALVADOR
In El Salvador, a large proportion of the population
cannot afford healthy diets, mainly because of
high income inequality, prompting the government
to assess the nutrition situation and decide upon
corrective policy action. While relying largely on
imports of staple foods (maize, rice and beans),
local diets in El Salvador have increasingly become
energy-dense and are not diversified enough to meet
all nutrient intake requirements of the population.
A majority of households consume few fruits and
vegetables despite their wide availability. Lack of
dietary diversity and a shift in dietary habits towards
greater consumption of highly processed foods and
energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt,
including sugary drinks, appear to be driven by the
high cost of nutritious foods.286
A more detailed Fill the Nutrient Gap (FNG)
analysis68 conducted with the Ministry of Social
Inclusion (MIES) revealed that: (i) healthy diets are
out of reach for a wide range of households (9 to
44 percent, depending on the administrative area);
(ii) a large segment of the population cannot afford a
nutrient adequate diet, mainly because of high income
inequality; (iii) nutritious foods rich in micronutrients
are purchased less frequently by poorer households;
(iv) among extremely poor households, cereals and
sugars contribute about 70 percent of total energy
intake, instead of the recommended 50–55 percent;

and (v) the proportion of energy from protein intake
is very low in poorer households (about 8 percent
instead of the recommended minimum of 12 percent),
while in wealthier households, the contribution of
protein consumption to dietary energy is typically
twice as high.286
The FNG nutrition analysis also gauged the
impact of a variety of interventions on households’
and individuals’ ability to access healthy diets.
Interventions included cash transfers, fresh food
vouchers and other social protection programmes
that include complementary, nutrient adequate foods.
Policy dialogue between nutrition, social protection,
education, agriculture and other sectors on the findings
of the analysis helped define strategies to overcome
the unaffordability of healthy diets.
Recommended policy actions to raise the
affordability of healthy diets in the short term included
nutrition-sensitive social protection programmes
in support of poorer households. Furthermore, a
national-level joint project for child development
(“Misión Ternura”), including food supplements for
mothers and children, school feeding and social
protection packages, was established. Results from
the FNG analysis helped decide which foods should
be included in school meals and at what cost, and
increased support for developing a pilot for providing
cash transfers targeting adolescent girls.

diets; apart from providing food, these
programmes also free up household income to
spend on other nutritious foods. Hence, these
inter ventions directly increase household food
consumption and intake of dietar y energ y, while
also supporting dietar y diversit y. Under certain
circumstances, the use of cash transfers is
more cost-efficient than in-kind transfers,
given the cost of procurement and logistics in
food distribution. Under other circumstances,
economies of scale could offset the logistics
costs of in-kind programmes, making them
more efficient than cash transfers in achieving

cash transfer programmes are considered an
appropriate instrument to increase dietar y

contexts, while in-kind transfers are more
appropriate for remote areas, where access to

mechanisms, which added to the success of the
integrated programmes. 303 A nutrition-sensitive
approach is key to fighting malnutrition
through school feeding programmes. 295
Linkages with local producers are especially
important in the contexts of weak market access
and inefficiencies of the food supply chain.
Positive synergies associated with predictable
and continued demand from schools, as well as
other public institutions such as local hospitals,
can improve the livelihoods of smallholders,
creating shorter supply chains and reducing
transaction costs for both producers and
consumers. 304

In India, for instance, the countr y’s Targeted
Public Distribution System represents the
largest social protection programme in the
world, reaching 800 million people with
subsidized cereals that can be purchased from
more than 500 000 fair price shops across
the countr y. 297 Evidence of the impact of the
programme on dietar y diversit y and nutrition
is mixed, although it showed some positive
impact on the intake of macronutrients. 297,298,299
Other studies found that the programme
still faces efficiency problems, particularly in
regard to targeting food insecure and poor
population groups. 299

Subsidization of nutritious foods. The promotion of
healthy eating habits through subsidies on
grocer y store purchases of nutritious foods,
such as fruits and vegetables, can be an effective
policy towards raising affordabilit y of healthy
diets. Food subsidies are used in many parts
of the world to decrease the cost of food for
the most v ulnerable. While they are generally
considered a distortive measure compared with
cash transfer programmes, 295 targeted food
subsidies can be effective in promoting healthy
diets. 305,306 A systematic study covering mainly
high-income countries found that a decrease of
10 percent in the price of foods that contribute to
a healthy diet would increase their consumption
by 12 percent. 305 In low- and medium-income
countries, large-scale untargeted subsidies
of staple foods tend to be more common than
targeted subsidies of nutritious foods such as
fruits or vegetables. Faced with high and rising
levels of overweight and obesit y, several lowand middle-income countries in Northern Africa,
and parts of Western and Southern Asia have
been adjusting their food policies, including
their food subsidy programmes, to discourage
the consumption of products high in saturated
and trans fats, sugars and/or salt (Box 27).

School feeding programmes. Apart from increasing
school enrolment, school feeding programmes
aim at improving nutrition though access to
healthy school meals. School meals provided to
millions of children worldwide also represent an
important contribution to reducing the cost of
food, in particular for low-income families, who
already cannot afford healthy diets. As such,
school meals represent a transfer of the value of
the food distributed to households. It has been
estimated that with school closures during the
COV ID-19 pandemic, more than 320 million
children around the world are missing out on
school meals. As many of these children depend
on the daily meals they receive at school for a
large part of their daily nutrient requirements,
the pandemic is aggravating the unaffordabilit y
of healthy diets to poor households. 300
Improving dietar y diversit y through school
meal programmes has been successful in
Ethiopia, 301 while in Ghana, the school menus
still face some challenges in offering diverse
enough menus to ensure sufficient intake of
micronutrients. 302 In Brazil, the National School
Feeding Programme increased the quantit y
of fruits and vegetables in its menus and
reduced the presence of highly processed foods
containing high amounts of sugar and/or salt.

All of these nutrition-sensitive social policy
options can be ver y effective in helping
increase the purchasing power of the poor
and v ulnerable groups, so as to increase their
affordabilit y of healthy diets. Nonetheless, given
different starting points and challenges in each »

REVISED FISCAL POLICIES AIMED AT ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY OF MINIMUM FOOD
REQUIREMENTS AND HEALTH CONCERNS IN NORTHERN AFRICA AND WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ASIA
In countries of Northern Africa and some parts of
Western and Southern Asia, there has been a long
tradition of food subsidies funded by governments
to address poverty and improve food security.
Commonly subsidized foods include wheat, wheat
flour, bread, oils, rice, sugar and powdered milk.307
These subsidies have been important contributors to
increased food intake, providing for example, up to
45 percent of the calorie intake of poor populations in
urban Egypt and up to 60 percent in Tunisia.
Food subsidy programmes are, however,
expensive – costing, on average, 1 percent of GDP
in 2011307 – and have not always been well-targeted
to reach those most in need. Furthermore, as many
countries in this region have undergone a nutrition
transition, many households now suffer from the
multiple burdens of malnutrition. Over 20 million
children in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region
are stunted, while half of the region’s adult population
is overweight or obese.308 Subsidies have not always

been designed to promote or enable access to
affordable healthy diets.
Given the high costs and the need to improve
support for the poorest populations,309 many countries
in the region, such as Algeria, Egypt, Iran (Islamic
Republic of), Jordan, Tunisia and Yemen, have
revised their subsidy programmes in recent years
in favour of better-targeted mechanisms.310 This has
resulted in elimination of many of the subsidies that
were not well-aligned with healthy diets; nonetheless,
some subsidies for oils, sugar and white flour or
bread have persisted.311
Faced with high and rising levels of overweight
and obesity (figure below), several countries are
now using policy instruments to discourage the
consumption of products high in unhealthy fats, sugars
or salt. Most commonly, taxes have been levied on
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and carbonated or
energy drinks. Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and United Arab Emirates have implemented taxes

at a rate of 50 percent, while Iran (Islamic Republic
of) has introduced a 20 percent tax.312,313,314 In Saudi
Arabia, after the introduction of the 50 percent tax on
carbonated soft drinks and a 100 percent tax on energy
drinks in 2017, per capita purchases declined by
41 percent and 58 percent, respectively, the following
year.315 In December 2019, the tax was extended to
other SSBs that had not been initially covered.
Fiscal policies are being reinforced by other
measures to foster healthy food environments and
promote healthy diets. In Saudi Arabia, the package
of measures includes, among others, elimination
of industrial trans fats,316 front-of-pack traffic light

labelling on pre-packaged foods and calorie labelling
on menus,317 an upper limit for salt content in bread,318
and a voluntary reformulation programme to reduce
salt, sugar and saturated fats in other foods.319 These
measures have been accompanied by awareness
campaigns on what constitutes a healthy diet.
This combination of different approaches to
promoting healthy diets is in line with the new WHO
Regional Strategy for Nutrition 2020–2030 for the
WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region,308 which will
guide Member States’ implementation of action
over the second half of the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition in the region.

» countr y, as well as the potential trade-offs,

As has been pointed out, to achieve healthy
dietar y patterns, large transformative changes in
food systems will be needed at all levels.
It is important to underscore that, although there
are some overlaps, these changes go beyond the
policy options and investments that are explicitly
designed and implemented to reduce the cost of
and increase the affordabilit y of healthy diets.
That is to say, other conditions must also be met,
requiring a whole range of other policies that
are more explicitly tailored to raise awareness
and inf luence consumer behaviour in favour of
healthy diets, possibly with important synergies
for environmental sustainabilit y (Box 28).
Hence the importance of policy coherence and
coordination across all relevant sectors and
involving all stakeholders of which we made
reference at the beginning of this section.

including those for the livelihoods of people
who rely on the rural economy, a combination
of complementar y policy inter ventions towards
reducing the cost of nutritious foods, while
enhancing the affordabilit y of healthy diets
is likely to be more effective than any single
policy measure.

Complementary policies that promote healthy diets
Earlier parts of this report have highlighted
that what people eat, and how that food is
produced, not only affects their health, but
also has major implications for the state of
the environment and for climate change.
The analysis presented suggests that, unless
we change our current food consumption
patterns, the cost in terms of health for people
and climate change to societ y could together
amount to USD 3 trillon per year by 2030 –
which is an underestimation, given that other
environmental costs are not being accounted
for. This is a tremendous cost for individuals
and for societ y, and unless addressed by
governments worldwide, it not only threatens
the future food securit y, nutrition and health
status of hundreds of millions of people, but
will almost certainly prevent a number of SDGs
from being achieved by 2030.

Such a policy framework could be supported
at the national level in ensuring that national
food-based dietar y g uidelines (FBDGs) fully
consider sustainabilit y dimensions. While some
countries still need to develop their FBDGs,
existing g uidelines could be used to align policies
in different sectors (nutrition, health, agriculture,
education, fiscal, trade policies, etc.) with
national health and sustainabilit y objectives; for
example, to help shape food production strategies
towards more sustainable practices.

BOX 28

COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY DIETS

mobilization of civil society has spurred government
commitment to policy change – in this case, the
introduction of a national tax on SSBs in 2014.145
Another study in the United States of America found
that a tax on the consumption of energy-dense foods of
minimal nutritional value is a cost-effective intervention
to prevent and control diet-related NCDs. In addition
to generating approximately USD 13 billion in annual
tax revenue, a modest tax on SSBs could reduce
the adverse health and cost burdens of obesity,
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by as much as
USD 17 billion.322

Further to a number of policy measures and
investments to reduce the cost of nutritious foods for
greater affordability of healthy diets outlined above,
the following are complementary policies that if
implemented will support healthy diets.
Promotion of healthy food environments. Safe and
supportive food environments provide physical
access to nutritious foods for healthy diets that
reduce the risk of all forms of malnutrition, including
undernutrition, overweight, obesity and diet-related
NCDs. By implementing a broad-based strategy across
different sectors, governments can create supportive
environments for healthy diets in hospitals, schools,
workplaces and other public institutions, and address
the high burden of hidden costs associated with
unhealthy diets highlighted in this report. “Best buys”
recommended by WHO for promoting healthy diets
include reducing salt intake through programmes
that encourage reformulation of food products and
introducing front-of-pack nutrition labelling.320
WHO also recommends measures to eliminate
industrial trans fats through the development of
legislation to ban their use in the food chain and to
restrict the marketing of foods or beverage products
high in fats, sugars and/or salt to children.321 Other
policy options available to national, subnational
or local authorities to promote healthy food
environments include the use of planning and zoning
rules to minimize food deserts and food swamps104
and to control the type of food outlets permitted in
the vicinity of schools.

Food industry regulations to help ensure easier
and more affordable access to healthy diets,
by reducing the content of fat, sugar and salt in
foods or increasing access to foods fortified with
micronutrients. Recommended regulation measures
include the introduction of legislation to ban the use
of industrial trans fats, encouraging the reformulation
of processed foods, the introduction of improved
nutrition labelling (including simplified front-of-pack
labelling) and the use of fiscal or agricultural
policies to replace trans fats and saturated fats with
unsaturated fats, in addition to policies that limit
portion and package size.320
Regulation of food marketing. Introducing measures
on the marketing of energy-dense foods of
minimal nutritional value to children should form
part of comprehensive strategies directed at
promoting healthy diets that include sustainability
considerations.323 These foods include SSBs,
pre-sugared cereals, confectionery, snacks and highly
processed foods served in fast food restaurants.324
Children in particular are influenced by marketing
strategies. Marketing and communication channels
include TV, radio, the Internet, social media, online
games, poster sites, magazines and newspapers,
in addition to in-store displays and packaging,
celebrity endorsements, sports sponsorship and price
promotions. Since 2010, WHO has recommended
that countries implement measures to reduce the
marketing of foods and non-alcoholic drinks to

Taxation of energy-dense foods and beverages with
minimal nutritional value. Increasingly, governments
are implementing tax policies to increase the price of
highly processed, energy-dense foods with minimal
nutritional value (see also Box 27). The introduction of
taxes on beverages containing high amounts of sugar
in an effort to reduce obesity and NCDs has been
especially effective in recent years, with the taxation
of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) becoming one
of the most common fiscal policies in a number of
countries. Mexico is a good example of how the

(CONTINUED)

children,321 and more than 40 countries now have
such measures in place.243
Similarly, food packaging directed at children
is often designed to promote the purchase of
energy-dense foods high in unhealthy fats, sugar
and/or salt.323,325,326,327 Such marketing techniques have
implications for the consumption and affordability of
healthy diets, in particular for low-income households,
as income spent on highly processed energy-dense
foods can divert spending from other nutritious foods
and/or increase overall family expenditure on food.
Therefore, food regulations should also discourage
marketing strategies that promote consumption of
these foods. In several Latin American countries,
policies that regulate food packaging and labelling
have been introduced, covering food products,
including beverages.

Promote breastfeeding, regulate marketing of breastmilk
substitutes and ensure access to nutritious foods by
infants. WHO and UNICEF recommend exclusive
breastfeeding for children for the first six months
and then continued breastfeeding combined with
appropriate complementary feeding until two years
of age or older. This should be supported with labour
conditions that provide for maternity leave and
continued income. The promotion of breastfeeding
provides short-term and long-term health and economic
and environmental advantages to children, women
and society. However, to realize these gains, policy
support, regulatory measures and financial investments
are needed, in particular given the global food
industry’s large competitive claim on infant feeding,
in terms of marketing breastmilk substitutes.328 Sales
in the global market for infant formula reached
USD 45 billion in 2018 and are expected to surpass
USD 100 billion by 2026,329 which demonstrates the
leverage of this industry.
For infants, aggressive marketing of breastmilk
substitutes continues to negatively affect breastfeeding,
and hence governments should adopt stricter
regulatory frameworks. These should be based on full
implementation of the International Code of Marketing
of Breast-milk Substitutes330 and subsequent relevant

World Health Assembly resolutions, coupled with
independent, quantitative monitoring and compliance
enforcement, to counter the impacts of formula
marketing globally.331,332 In addition, they should
include measures to end the inappropriate promotion
of foods for infants and young children.333,334

Policies supporting nutrition education. Policies, legislation and
other interventions to transform food systems and create
healthy food environments need to be accompanied
by the provision of food and nutrition education (FNE)
and behaviour change communication, in addition
to the implementation of mass media campaigns
to promote healthy diets.320 Policy options include
integrating effective FNE into national plans and
programmes to influence consumer awareness
and foster nutritious food choices and behaviours.
FNE with a focus on food budgeting and resource
management skills can be integrated into the national
school curriculum, social protection and agriculture
programmes, and food labelling and taxation schemes.
Combining school food environment policies (such
as nutrition standards for meals) and school-based
food and nutrition education can help children build
the motivation and skills necessary to make nutritious
food choices. Such initiatives should be included in
state laws and regulations to protect them from shifting
political priorities.

Policies in support of sustainable food consumption and food waste
reduction. Policy measures directed at the consumer
to encourage healthy diets that include sustainability
considerations, include at the individual level, dietary
changes towards predominantly plant-forward diets73
with limited amounts of animal source foods, while the
amount of dietary energy derived from starchy staple
foods is also capped (e.g. at 50 percent of total dietary
energy requirements). At the retail and household
levels, policy measures directed at the reduction of
food waste, including through awareness campaigns,
informing consumers and advocating for behaviour
change towards healthy choices through education and
communication strategies that involve different media
and interpersonal communication, are critical.

FURTHER RESEARCH TO SUPPORT POLICIES TOWARDS ENSURING AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS
THAT INCLUDE SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
supply chains, the food environments, as well as
consumer demand and the political economy of
food. Nevertheless, there is currently very little food
systems research that identifies the most important
cost drivers and how these can best be addressed
through various policy measures. Research must
hence focus on the complex supply and demand
forces that determine food prices, which develop
throughout the food value chain, as well as various
determinants that help ensure physical, social and
economic access to food.
3. Most national food-based dietary guidelines
(FBDGs) do not include environmental sustainability
considerations. Results presented in Section 2.2
indicate that healthy diets can present important
opportunities for reducing GHG emissions in
some contexts. As such, dietary shifts that include
sustainability considerations can play an important
role as part of a broader strategy, including a
combination of approaches for increasing the
environmental sustainability of food systems.
To include sustainability aspects, quantifiable
recommendations for food groups would be
needed, which would allow the use of FBDGs to
shape agricultural production strategies and plans,
agro-ecological approaches for more diverse food
production in support of sustainable agriculture, as
well as other policies and programmes in support
of food systems transformation. Research is
needed on how FBDGs could best be improved
along these lines.

1. Need for nutrition-sensitive poverty lines. In many
countries, poverty lines form the basis for social
protection programmes and the targeting of
beneficiaries. As shown in Section 2.1, current
poverty lines are insufficient to support even
the least-cost versions of healthy diets. That is,
they do not provide adequate guidance for
the formulation of policies and programmes
designed to achieve food security and nutrition.
Typically, food consumption patterns are used
to determine national food poverty lines through
what is called a “cost of basic needs” approach.
This approach normally calculates the food
poverty line as the cost of a basket of foods
consumed by relatively poor households, scaled
to meet only dietary energy requirements.
The analysis in this report shows that the poverty
line, which includes a provision for basic food
needs, does not support a nutrient adequate or
a healthy diet in most countries. Thus, there is a
strong justification for national poverty lines to
be adjusted to account for nutritional needs, for
example using alternative compositions of food
baskets, which would require further research.336
2. Limited data on cost drivers of healthy diets.
Analysis in this report has highlighted that,
globally, more than 3 billion people cannot afford
a healthy diet because of the high cost of nutritious
foods. The analysis of cost drivers in Section 2.3,
shows that the factors driving the high cost of
nutritious foods are found throughout the food
systems, related to food production, the food

to support policies towards ensuring

sustainabilit y considerations, is needed.
Three specific areas have been identified in
Box 29, for which adequate funding should be
allocated for successful implementation.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Conclusion

The analysis conducted and policy
recommendations provided should furthermore
help set the agenda for the first UN Food
Systems Summit, which will take place in
2021. The summit’s overarching goal is to help
stakeholders better understand and manage
complex choices that affect the future of food
systems and accelerate progress towards
achieving the SDGs by 2030.

In summar y, making healthy diets more
affordable for ever yone, while reducing the
consumption of energ y-dense foods of minimal
nutritional value and foods with a negative
impact on human health and the environment,
requires significant transformations of existing
food systems worldwide. Given unique countr y
contexts and different starting points for the
various transformative processes that need
to happen, it is hoped that the recommended
policy measures and investments in this last
section will prove useful. Furthermore, while
acknowledging the data and research gaps,
a number of policy options and investments
for reducing the cost of nutritious foods and
increasing the affordabilit y of healthy diets have
been discussed, in particular those with potential
for diets to be environmentally sustainable,
and whose effectiveness have been proven by
a myriad of case studies. The complementar y
policy environment that needs to be enabled
to simultaneously promote healthy diets has
also been highlighted, which further justifies
the need for policy coherence and coordination
across all relevant sectors and involving all
key stakeholders.

The importance of the policy g uidance currently
being negotiated under the Committee on
World Food Securit y (CFS) based in Rome
towards “Voluntar y Guidelines on Food
Systems for Nutrition” is also fully recognized.
The objective of the Voluntar y Guidelines
are “to contribute to the transformation of
food systems and promoting sustainable food
systems to ensure that the food that contributes
to sustainable healthy diets is available,
affordable, accessible, safe, and of adequate
quantit y and qualit y while conforming with
beliefs, culture and traditions, dietar y habits,
and preferences of individuals, in accordance
with national and international laws and
obligations.”337 The g uidance provided by these
Guidelines, once fully negotiated and endorsed,
will be of great interest to governments and
development partners on the formulation and
implementation of a comprehensive set of
policies towards the transformation of food
systems. n

The g uidance provided in this report is in
line with key recommendations under the
United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition,
2016 –2025, including Action Area 1 covering
“Sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy
diets”, Action Area 3 on “Social protection and
nutrition education”, as well as Action Area 5 on
“Safe and supportive environments for nutrition
at all ages”. The remaining years of the Decade
of Action present an opportunit y to accelerate
action in these areas.

Regional estimates were included when more than 50 percent
of population was covered. To reduce the margin of error,
estimates are presented as three-year averages.
2
FAO estimates of the percentage of people in the total
population living in households where at least one adult has
been found to be food insecure.
3
Country-level results are presented only for those countries
for which estimates are based on official national data (see
note c) or as provisional estimates, based on FAO data
collected through the Gallup ® World Poll, for countries whose
national relevant authorities expressed no objection to their
publication. Note that consent to publication does not
necessarily imply validation of the estimate by the national
authorities involved and that the estimate is subject to revision
as soon as suitable data from official national sources are
available. Global, regional and subregional aggregates are
based on data collected in approximately 150 countries.
4
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model
predicted estimate for the year 2019. For countries, the latest
data available from 2014 to 2019 are used.
5
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model
predicted estimate for the year 2012. For countries, the latest
data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.

Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent
of population is covered. For countries, the latest data
available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
7
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent
of population is covered. For countries, the latest data
available from 2014 to 2019 are used with the exception of
China where the latest data are from the year 2013.
* Wasting, stunting and overweight under 5 years of age and
low birthweight regional aggregates exclude Japan.
** The Northern America estimates are derived applying
mixed-effect models with subregions as fixed effects; for
stunting, wasting and severe wasting, data were available only
for the United States of America, preventing the estimation of
standard errors (and confidence intervals). The Australia and
New Zealand estimates are based only on Australian data
applying linear regression; for stunting, only two data points
were available, and thus estimation of standard errors (and
confidence intervals) was not possible. Further details on the
methodology are described in De Onis, M., Blössner, M.,
Borghi, E., Frongillo, E.A. & Morris, R. 2004. Estimates of
global prevalence of childhood underweight in 1990 and 2015.
Journal of the American Medical Association, 291(21):
2600–2606. Model selection is based on best fit.

Consecutive low population coverage; interpret with caution.
The Central Agency for Public Mobilization & Statistics
(CAPMAS) reports an estimate of severe food insecurity of
1.3 percent for 2015, based on HIECS data, using the WFP
consolidated approach for reporting indicators of food security.
Note that the two estimates are not directly comparable due to
different definitions of "severe food insecurity".
c
Based on official national data.
d
For years when official national data are not available, the
estimates are projected using FAO data. See Annex 1B for
further details.
e
Based on official national data collected in 2019 through
EU-SILC. 2019 national estimates of prevalence of food
insecurity are 8.1 percent at moderate or severe level and
1.5 percent at severe level.
a
b

<2.5 = proportion of undernourishment less than 2.5 percent;
<0.5 = prevalence of severe food insecurity less than
0.5 percent.
n.a. = data not available.

Regional estimates were included when more than 50 percent
of population was covered. To reduce the margin of error,
estimates are presented as three-year averages.
2
FAO estimates of the number of people living in households
where at least one adult has been found to be food insecure.
3
Country-level results are presented only for those countries
for which estimates are based on official national data (see
note c) or as provisional estimates, based on FAO data
collected through the Gallup ® World Poll, for countries whose
national relevant authorities expressed no objection to their
publication. Note that consent to publication does not
necessarily imply validation of the estimate by the national
authorities involved and that the estimate is subject to revision
as soon as suitable data from official national sources are
available. Global, regional and subregional aggregates are
based on data collected in approximately 150 countries.
4
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model
predicted estimate for the year 2019. For countries, the latest
data available from 2014 to 2019 are used.
5
For regional estimates, values correspond to the model
predicted estimate for the year 2012. For countries, the latest
data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
6
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent
1

of population is covered. For countries, the latest data
available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
7
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent
of population is covered. For countries, the latest data
available from 2014 to 2019 are used with the exception of
China where the latest data are from the year 2013.
* Wasting, stunting and overweight under 5 years of age and
low birthweight regional aggregates exclude Japan.
** The Northern America estimates are derived applying
mixed-effect models with subregions as fixed effects; for

for the United States of America, preventing the estimation of
standard errors (and confidence intervals). The Australia and
New Zealand estimates are based only on Australian data
applying linear regression; for stunting, only two data points
were available, and thus estimation of standard errors (and
confidence intervals) was not possible. Further details on the

Data sources: Different data sources are used to
estimate the different parameters of the model.

UNDERNOURISHMENT

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER): Human

where θ is a vector of parameters that
characterizes the pdf. The distribution is assumed
to be lognormal, and thus fully characterized by
only two parameters: the mean dietar y energ y
consumption (DEC), and its coefficient of
variation (C V ).

Definition: Undernourishment is defined as the

energ y requirements for an individual in a given
sex/age class are determined on the basis of
normative requirements for basic metabolic rate
(BMR) per kilogram of body mass, multiplied by
the ideal weights that a healthy person of that
sex/age class may have, given his or her height,
and then multiplied by a coefficient of physical
activit y level (PAL) to take into account physical
activit y. at Given that both healthy BMIs and PALs
var y among active and healthy individuals of the
same sex and age, a range of energ y requirements
applies to each sex and age group of the
population. The MDER for the average individual
in the population, which is the parameter used
in the PoU formula, is obtained as the weighted
average of the lower bounds of the energ y
requirement ranges for each sex and age group,
using the shares of the population in each sex
and age group as weights.

condition of an individual whose habitual food
consumption is insufficient to provide, on
average, the amount of dietar y energ y required to
maintain a normal, active and healthy life.

How it is reported: The indicator is reported as a
prevalence and is denominated as “prevalence
of undernourishment” (PoU), which is an
estimate of the percentage of individuals in
the total population that are in a condition
of undernourishment. National estimates are
reported as three-year moving averages, to
control for the low reliabilit y of some of the
underlying parameters, such as the year-to-year
variation in food commodit y stocks, one of the
components of the annual FAO Food Balance
Sheets for which complete, reliable information
is ver y scarce. Regional and global aggregates,
on the other hand, are reported as annual
estimates, on account of the fact that possible
estimation errors are expected not to be
correlated across countries.

Information on the population structure by
sex and age is available for most countries
in the world and for each year from the UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs
(DESA) Population Prospects, revised ever y two
years. This edition of The State of Food Security
and Nutrition in the World uses the 2019 revision
of the World Population Prospects.1

Methodology: To compute an estimate of the
prevalence of undernourishment in a population,
the probabilit y distribution of habitual dietar y
energ y intake levels (expressed in kcal per
person per day) for the average individual
is modelled as a parametric probabilit y
densit y function (pdf ), f(x). 6,7 The indicator is
obtained as the cumulative probabilit y that the
habitual dietar y energ y intake (x) is below the
minimum dietar y energ y requirements (MDER)
(i.e. the lowest limit of the range of energ y
requirements for the population’s representative
average individual) as in the formula below:

Information on the median height in each sex
and age group for a given countr y is derived from
a recent demographic and health sur vey (DHS)
or from other sur veys that collect anthropometr y
data on children and adults. Even if such
sur veys do not refer to the same year for which
at A person is considered healthy if his or her body mass index (BMI)
indicates neither underweight nor overweight. Human energy requirement
norms per kilogram of body mass are given in FAO and WHO (2004).64

directly. It is estimated indirectly or imputed
for the years when no suitable sur vey data
are available.

the PoU is estimated, the impact of possible
small inter vening changes in median heights
over the years on PoU estimates is expected to
be negligible.

In the past, FAO had made attempts at estimating
the C V as a function of macroeconomic variables,
such as per capita GDP, inequalit y in income
(captured by the Gini index) and an index of
the relative price of food. 3 However, the abilit y
to correctly project the C V of habitual food
consumption in a population with such a model
is questionable, due to the sparsit y of data on
the Gini index and to reser vations on the way
in which the index of the relative price of food
is compiled. We therefore reverted to a simpler
(and arg uably more robust) method to linearly
interpolate values of the C V|y in the years
between sur veys. The main drawback of such
modelling choice is that, when only one sur vey is
available over the monitored period, the resulting
value of the C V|y is kept constant over the entire
period of assessment, and in any case from the
year of last available sur vey up to the year 2015.
Possible changes over time in the abilit y to
access food by different strata of the population
that are not fully ref lected in changes in the
average national food consumption are therefore
not captured in PoU estimates. Since the last
edition of this report, 25 new sur veys from the
following 13 countries have been processed
to update the C V|y: Bangladesh, China,
Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Mexico, Mongolia,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Sudan and
Thailand. That makes for a total of 79 sur veys
of 51 countries for which C V|y is based on the
national sur veys.

Dietary energy consumption (DEC): Ideally, data on food
consumption should come from nationally
representative household sur veys (such as
Living Standard Measurement Sur veys or
Household Incomes and Expenditure Sur veys).
However, only ver y few countries conduct such
sur veys on an annual basis. Thus, in FAO’s PoU
estimates for global monitoring, DEC values
are estimated from the dietar y energ y supply
(DES) reported in the Food Balance Sheets (FBS),
compiled by FAO for most countries in the world
(see FAO, 2020 2).
Since the last edition of this report, the FBS
series used to estimate the average DES has
been revised with improved methods for most
countries. In December 2019, a new FBS domain
was added to FAOSTAT, presenting series from
2014 to 2017. Work is ongoing to extend the series
to 2018 for all countries by the end of the year
2020. At the time of this report, the FBS series
were updated for the following 50 countries
with the largest number of undernourished
people, bringing them up to date through 2018:
Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh,
Bolivia (Plurinational State of ), Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, China (mainland),
Colombia, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Eswatini,
Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India,
Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of ), Iraq,
Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mexico, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal,
Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan,
Thailand, Togo, United Republic of Tanzania,
Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of ),
Viet Nam and Zimbabwe.

In the FAO PoU parametric approach, the C V due
to body weight and life st yle, a.k.a. C V due to
requirement (C V|r), represents the variabilit y of
the distribution of dietar y energ y requirements of
a hy pothetical average individual representative
of a healthy population, which is also equal to
the C V of the distribution of dietar y energ y
intakes of a hypothetical average individual
if the population is perfectly nourished.
The distribution of dietar y energ y requirements
of a hy pothetical average individual can be
assumed to be normal, thus its variabilit y can
be estimated if at least two percentiles and their

Coefficient of variation (CV): When reliable data on food
consumption are available from aforementioned

dietar y energ y consumption (DEC) by income
decile from the CHNS 2011 and the average food
expenditure (FOOD_EXP) by income decile from
the CHFS 2011 for the provinces included in
both sur veys. Using this estimated relationship,
and using data on FOOD_EXP by income decile
available for all provinces from the CHFS,
we predicted the average DEC by income decile
in provinces not covered by the CHNS in 2011,
and in all provinces in 2013, 2015 and 2017.

values are known. As a result, given that we are
interested in deriving the theoretical distribution
of dietar y energ y requirements for healthy
hypothetical average individuals to estimate the
C V|r, the MDER and the average dietar y energ y
requirement (ADER) can be used to approximate
the 1st percentile and the 50th percentile of
the distribution of energ y requirements of the
hypothetical average individual as they are built
on the same principles of a weighted average
from sex-age-physiological status groups. 4
Therefore, the value of C V|r is derived as the
inverse cumulative standard normal distribution
of the difference between the MDER and the
ADER. Similar to the MDER, the ADER is
estimated using the average of the minimum and
the maximum values of the PAL categor y “Active
or moderately active lifest yle”.

The results, properly weighted by the current
population in each income decile by province,
were used to compute estimates of C V|y in 2011,
2013, 2015 and 2017. These estimates were then
used to update the series of PoU for China
(see details in Cafiero, Feng & Ishaq [2020] 5).

PoU projections for 2019–2030: Using the methods
described above, PoU estimates are produced
for all countries for which reliable FBS data are
available up to 2018.

The total C V is then obtained as the geometric
mean of the C V|y and the C V|r:

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = �(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶|𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦)2 + (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶|𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)2

To generate national level three-year averages
for 2017–2019 and annual values at regional
and global level in 2019, projections are needed.
Furthermore, for the SDG progress assessment,
projections to 2030 are needed.

Challenges and limitations: While formally the state of
being undernourished or not is a condition that
applies to individuals, given the data usually
available on a large scale, it is impossible to
reliably identif y which individuals in a certain
group are actually undernourished. Through the
statistical model described above, the indicator

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Using sophisticated statistical techniques
based on the Rasch measurement model, the
information obtained in a sur vey is validated
for internal consistency and converted into a
quantitative measure along a scale of severit y,
ranging from low to high. Based on their
responses to the FIES-SM items, the individuals
or households inter viewed in a nationally
representative sur vey of the population are
assigned a probabilit y to be in one of three
classes: food secure or only marginally
insecure, moderately food insecure and severely
food insecure as defined by two globally
set thresholds. Based on FIES data collected
over three years from 2014 to 2016, FAO has
established the FIES reference scale, which is
used as the global standard for experience-based
food-insecurit y measures, and to set the two
reference thresholds of severit y.

Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference
and the margins of uncertaint y associated with
estimates of each of the parameters in the model,
the precision of the PoU estimates is generally
low. While it is not possible to formally compute
margins of error around PoU estimates, these are
expected to likely exceed 5 percent in most cases.
For this reason, FAO does not consider PoU
estimates that result to be lower than 2.5 percent
as sufficiently reliable to be reported.

SDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated
probabilit y to be in the two classes of moderate
and severe food insecurit y. A separate indicator
(FI sev ) is computed by considering only the severe
food-insecurit y class.

How it is reported: In this report, FAO provides
estimates of food insecurit y at two different
levels of severit y: moderate or severe food
insecurit y (FI mod+sev ) and severe food insecurit y
(FI sev ). For each of these two levels, two estimates
are reported:
 the prevalence (%) of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure;
 the estimated number of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure.

India (6 000), Nigeria (3 000), Philippines (2 000),
Russian Federation (3 000), Thailand (2 000),
Turkey (2 000) and Viet Nam (2 000).

Methodology: The data were validated and used
to construct a scale of food-insecurit y severit y
using the Rasch model, which postulates that the
probabilit y of obser ving an affirmative answer by
respondent i to question j is a logistic function of
the distance, on an underlying scale of severit y,
between the position of the respondent, a i , and
that of the item, b j .

For Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile,
Ecuador, Ghana, Greece (2019), Indonesia, Israel,
Kazakhstan, Kyrg yzstan, Kenya, Palestine,
Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Saint Lucia,

Sudan, Republic of Korea (2014 and 2015),
Russian Federation (2018), Uganda, United
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America
and Viet Nam, national government sur vey
data were used to calculate the prevalence
estimates of food insecurit y by applying
FAO’s statistical methods to adjust national
results to the same global reference standard,
covering approximately 20 percent of the world
population. Countries are considered for the
year/years when national data are available,
informing the regional and subregional
aggregates assuming a constant trend in the
period 2014–2019. Exceptions to this rule
are: Burkina Faso, Chile, Ghana, Indonesia,
Israel, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria and Sierra
Leone. In these cases, the following procedure
was followed:

Prob(X i,j = Yes) =

exp(a i – b j)
1 + exp(a i – b j)

By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it
is possible to estimate the probabilit y of being
food insecure (p i,L) at each level of severit y of
food insecurit y L (moderate or severe, or severe),
for each respondent i, with 0 < p i,L < 1.

The prevalence of food insecurity at each level of severit y
(FI L) in the population is computed as the
weighted sum of the probabilit y of being severely
food insecure for all respondents (i) in a sample:
FI L = ∑p i,L w i

 Use national data collected in one year to
inform the corresponding year.
 For the remaining years, apply the smoothed
trend coming from the data collected by
FAO through the Gallup ® World Poll to the
national data to describe evolution over time.
Smoothed trend is computed by taking the
mean of the average rate of change between
consecutive three-year averages.

where w i are post-stratification weights that
indicate the proportion of individuals or
households in the national population
represented by each record in the sample.
As only individuals aged 15 or more are sampled
in the GWP, the prevalence estimates directly
produced from these data refer to the population
15 years and older. To arrive at the prevalence
and number of individuals (of all ages) in the
population, an estimate is required of the number
of people living in the households where at
least one adult is estimated to be food insecure.
This involves a multistep procedure detailed in
Annex II of the Voices of the Hungry Technical
Report (see link in the “References” section,
below).

The motivation behind this procedure was
the strong evidence found in support of the
trend suggested by data collected by FAO (for
instance, evolution of povert y, extreme povert y,
employment, food inf lation, among others),
allowing to provide a more updated description
of the trend in the period 2014–2019.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Regional and global aggregates of food insecurit y
at moderate or severe, and severe levels, FI L , are
computed as:
FI L,r =

the identification of a number of “anchoring”
points. In the FIES methodolog y, these anchoring
points are the severit y levels associated with
the items whose relative position on the scale
of severit y can be considered equal to that of
the corresponding items on the global reference
scale. The “mapping” of the measures from one
scale to the other is then obtained by finding
the formula that equates the mean and the
standard deviations (SD) of the common items’
severit y levels.

∑ c FI L,c × N c
∑ c Nc

where r indicates the region, FI L,c is the value
of FI at level L estimated for countr y c in the
region and N c is the corresponding population
size. When no estimate of FI L is available for
a countr y, it is assumed to be equal to the
population-weighted average of the estimated
values of the remaining countries in the same
region. A regional aggregate is produced
only if the countries for which an estimate
is available cover at least 80 percent of the
region’s population.

Challenges and limitations: When food-insecurit y
prevalence estimates are based on FIES data
collected in the GWP, with national sample sizes
of about 1 000 in most countries, confidence
inter vals rarely exceed 20 percent of the
measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of
50 percent would have margins of error of up to
plus or minus 5 percent). Confidence inter vals
are likely to be much smaller, however, when
national prevalence rates are estimated using
larger samples and for estimates referring to
aggregates of several countries. To reduce the
impact of year-to-year sampling variabilit y,
countr y-level estimates are presented as
three-year averages, computed as averages of all
available years in the considered triennia.

Universal thresholds are defined on the FIES
global standard scale (a set of item parameter
values based on results from all countries
covered by the GWP in 2014–2016) and converted
into corresponding values on local scales.
The process of calibrating each countr y’s scale
against the FIES global standard can be referred
to as equating, and permits the production
of internationally comparable measures
of food-insecurit y severit y for individual
respondents, as well as comparable national
prevalence rates.

The problem stems from the fact that, when
defined as a latent trait, the severit y of food
insecurit y has no absolute reference against
which it could be evaluated. The Rasch model
enables identification of the relative position
that the various items occupy on a scale that
is denominated in logit units, but whose
“zero” is arbitrarily set, usually to correspond
to the mean estimated severit y. This implies
that the zero of the scale changes in each
application. To produce comparable measures
over time and across different populations
requires establishing a common scale to use
as a reference, and finding the formula needed
to convert measures across different scales.
As it is the case for converting measures of
temperature across difference measuring scales
(such as Celsius and Fahrenheit), this requires

ANNEX 1

Methodology: National household sur veys (MICS,
DHS, national nutrition sur veys, etc.) and
national nutrition sur veillance systems are the
preferred primar y data sources for child nutrition
indicators. For entr y in the database, they must
be nationally representative, population-based
sur veys which present results based on the W HO
Child Growth standards or provide access to the
raw data enabling re-analysis.

STUNTING, WASTING AND OVERWEIGHT
IN CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE
Definition of stunting (children under 5 years of age):
Height/length (cm) for age (months) < -2 SD
of the W HO Child Growth Standards median.
Low height-for-age is an indicator that ref lects
the cumulative effects of undernutrition and
infections since and even before birth. It may be
the result of long-term nutritional deprivation,
recurrent infections and lack of water and
sanitation infrastructures.

A weighted analysis was carried out to account
for the different countr y populations and ensure
that the inf luence in the regional trend analysis
of a countr y’s sur vey estimate was proportional
to the countr y’s population. The population
weights were derived from the UN Population
Prospects, revision 2019. For each data point, the
respective under-5 population estimate for the
specific sur vey year was obtained. If a sur vey was
performed over an extended period, for example
November 2013 to April 2014, the mean year
in which most of the fieldwork was completed
(in this case 2014) was used as the year from
which to choose the respective population
estimate. Weights of countries with single data
points were derived by dividing the under-5
population at the time of the sur vey by the sum
of the countries’ mean population in the whole
region. For countries with multiple data points,
the weights were calculated by dividing the
mean of the countr y’s under-5 population (over
the obser ved years) by the sum of those mean
populations of countries within the whole region.

How it is reported: The percentage of children
aged 0 –59 months who are below -2 SD from
the median height-for-age of the W HO Child
Growth Standards.

Definition of wasting: Weight (kg) for height/length
(cm) < -2 SD of the W HO Child Growth
Standards median. Low weight-for-height is an
indicator of acute weight loss or a failure to gain
weight and can be consequence of insufficient
food intake and/or an incidence of infectious
diseases, especially diarrhoea.

How it is reported: The percentage of children aged
0 –59 months who are below -2 SD from the
median weight-for-height of the W HO Child
Growth Standards.

Definition of overweight: Weight (kg) for height/
length (cm) > +2 SD of the W HO Child Growth
Standards median. This indicator ref lects
excessive weight gain for height generally
due to energ y intakes exceeding children’s
energ y requirements.

A linear mixed-effect model was applied for each
region or income group, using logistic transform
of prevalence and results back-transformed
to original scale. The final models were then
used to project the trend of malnutrition in
children from 1990 to 2019. Using the resulting
prevalence estimates (after back-transformation),

prevalence of severe wasting, prevalence of
overweight, countr y population of under 5 years
of age.

Definition: Exclusive breastfeeding for infants
< 6 months of age is defined as receiving only
breastmilk and no additional food or drink,
not even water. Exclusive breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child sur vival and is the best food
for newborns, as breastmilk shapes the baby’s
microbiome, strengthens the immune system and
reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases.

Challenges and limitations: The recommended
periodicit y for countries to report on stunting,
overweight and wasting is ever y three to five
years; however, for some countries, data are
available less frequently. While ever y effort has
been made to maximize the comparabilit y of
statistics across countries and over time, countr y
data may differ in terms of data collection
methods, population coverage and estimation
methods used. Sur vey estimates come with levels
of uncertaint y due to both sampling errors and
non-sampling errors (technical measurement
errors, recording errors, etc.). Neither of the two
sources of error has been fully taken into account
for deriving estimates at countr y or regional and
global levels.

Breastfeeding also benefits mothers by
preventing postpartum haemorrhage and
promoting uterine involution, decreasing
risk of iron-deficiency anaemia, reducing the
risk of various t y pes of cancer and providing
psychological benefits.

How it is reported: Percentage of infants aged 0 –5
months who are fed exclusively on breastmilk
with no additional food or drink, not even water,
in the 24 hours preceding the sur vey. 8

For the prevalence of wasting, as sur veys are
generally carried out during a specific period
of the year, the estimates can be affected by
seasonalit y. Seasonal factors related to wasting
include food availabilit y (e.g. pre-har vest periods)
and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria,
etc.), while natural disasters and conf licts
can also show real shifts in trends that would
need to be treated differently than a seasonal
variation. Hence, countr y year estimates for
wasting may not necessarily be comparable over
time. Consequently, only the most recent (2019)
estimates are provided.

and 2019. Global and regional estimates were
calculated as weighted averages of the prevalence
of exclusive breastfeeding in each countr y,
using the total number of births from the World
Population Prospects, 2019 revision (2012 for the
baseline and 2019 for the current) as weights.
Estimates are presented only where the available
data are representative of at least 50 percent of
corresponding regions’ total number of births,
unless otherwise noted.

Definition: Low birthweight is defined as a weight at
birth of less than 2 500 grams (less than 5.51 lbs),
regardless of gestational age. A newborn’s weight
at birth is an important marker of maternal and
foetal health and nutrition. 9

Methodology: Nationally representative estimates

of low birthweight prevalence can be derived
from a range of sources, broadly defined as
national administrative data or representative
household sur veys. National administrative
data are those coming from national systems
including Civil Registration and Vital Statistics
(CRVS) systems, national Health Management
Information Systems (HMIS) and birth
registries. National household sur veys which
contain information about birthweight as well
as key related indicators including maternal
perception of size at birth (MICS, DHS) are also
an important source of low birthweight data
especially in contexts where many births are
unweighted and/or data heaping is a problem.
Prior to entr y into the countr y data set, countr y
data are reviewed for coverage and qualit y and
adjusted where the source is a household sur vey.
Administrative data are categorized as (i) high
coverage, if representing ≥90 percent of live
births; (ii) medium coverage, if representing
between 80 and 90 percent of live births; or (iii)
not included, if covering <80 percent of live
births. To be included in the data set, sur vey data
need to have:

Using the previous day’s feeding as a basis may
cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed
infants to be overestimated, as some infants
who may have been given other liquids or foods
irreg ularly may not have received these on the
day before the sur vey.

from estimates reported by countries in
administrative and sur vey reports, especially
given that the household sur vey estimates
are adjusted for missing birthweights and
heaping, while sur vey reports often present a
low birthweight estimate just for the children
with a birthweight and with no adjustment for
data heaping.
 No estimate: countries for which low
birthweight input data were not available
and/or did not meet inclusion criteria are
indicated in the database as “no estimate”.
A total of 54 countries in the current countr y
database were reported as having “no
estimate”. Despite not presenting an estimate
for these individual 54 countries, annual low
birthweight estimates were derived for them
using the hierarchical regression methods
detailed above but used only to input into
regional and global estimates.

a minimum of 200 birthweights in the
data set;
iii. no indication of severe data heaping – this
means that: a) ≤55 percent of all birthweights
can fall on the three most frequent birthweights
(i.e. if 3 000 g, 3 500 g and 2 500 g were the
three most frequent birthweights, when added
together, they have to make up ≤55 percent of
all birthweights in the data set); b) ≤10 percent
of all birthweights are ≥4 500 g; c) ≤5 percent of
birthweights fall on tail ends of 500 g and 5 000
g; and
iv. undergone an adjustment for missing
birthweights and heaping.11
Modelling methods were applied to the accepted
(and for household sur vey data, accepted and
adjusted) countr y data to generate annual
countr y estimates from 2000 to 2015, with
methods var ying by availabilit y and t ype of input
data as follows:

Modelled annual countr y estimates are used
to generate regional and global estimates from
2000 –2015. Global estimates are derived by
summing the estimated number of live births
weighing less than 2 500 g for 195 au countries
with an estimate in the United Nations regional
grouping for each year, and then dividing by all
live births in each year in those 195 countries.
Regional estimates are similarly derived,
based on countries in each regional grouping.
To obtain the global and regional level estimates
of uncertaint y, 1 000 low birthweight point
estimates were made for each countr y for each
year using either b-spline (by randomly sampling
from a normal distribution plotted using the
calculated standard error) or hierarchical
regression approach (using a bootstrap approach).
The countr y low birthweight estimates for each
of the 1 000 samples were summed at worldwide
or regional level and the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles
of the resulting distributions were used as the
confidence inter vals.

 b-spline: data for countries with ≥8 data points
from higher coverage administrative sources
≥1 point prior to 2005 and ≥1 point more
recent than 2010 are smoothed with b-spline
regression to generate annual low birthweight
estimates. A b-spline regression model
was used to predict the standard error and
calculate 95 percent confidence inter vals for
the countr y-level low birthweight estimates.
These low birthweight estimates follow ver y
closely those included in the countries’ own
administrative reports.
 Hierarchical regression: data for countries not
meeting requirements for b-spline but with
≥1 low birthweight data point from any source
meeting inclusion criteria are fitted into a
model using covariates to generate annual low
birthweight estimates, as well as uncertaint y
ranges, using a bootstrap approach. The model
includes natural log of neonatal mortalit y
rate; the proportion of children underweight
(weight-for-age z score below -2 SD from
median weight for age of reference population);
data t ype (higher qualit y administrative, lower
qualit y administrative, household sur vey); UN
region (e.g. Southern Asia, Caribbean); and
a countr y-specific random effect. These low
birthweight estimates may var y substantially

au While the world comprises 202 countries (as per the full set of
countries in the regional grouping with the largest set of countries – i.e. the
UNICEF regional grouping), seven countries did not have low birthweight
input data or covariate data. It was therefore not possible to generate any
estimates for these seven countries and they are not included in the regional
and global estimates.

ANNEX 1

Challenges and limitations: A major limitation of

ADULT OBESITY

monitoring low birthweight globally is the
lack of birthweight data for many of the
world’s children. There is a notable bias among
the unweighted, with those born to poorer,
less-educated, rural mothers being less likely to
have a recorded birthweight when compared to
their richer, urban counterparts with more highly
educated mothers.10 As the characteristics of
the unweighted are risk factors for having a low
birthweight, estimates that do not well represent
these children may be lower than the true value.
Furthermore, poor qualit y of available data
with regard to excessive heaping on multiples of
500 g or 100 g exists in the majorit y of available
data from LMICs 10 and can further bias low
birthweight estimates. The methods applied to
adjust for missing birthweights and heaping for
sur vey estimates in the current database 11 are
meant to address the problem; however, there
were a total of 54 countries for which it was
not possible to generate a reliable birthweight
estimate. In addition, the confidence limits of the
regional and global estimates may be artificially
small given that about half of the modelled
countries had a countr y-specific effect generated
at random for each bootstrap prediction, some of
which were positive and others negative, making
the relative uncertaint y at the regional and global
level tend to be less than that at the individual
countr y level.

Definition: BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2 . The body mass index
(BMI) is the ratio of weight-to-height commonly
used to classif y the nutritional status of adults.
It is calculated as the body weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the body height in
metres (kg/m 2). Obesit y includes individuals with
BMI equal to or higher than 30 kg/m 2 .

How it is reported: Percentage of population

population-based studies with more than

measured in 186 countries).
Methodology: A Bayesian hierarchical model was
applied to selected population-based studies
that had measured height and weight in adults
aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from
1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalence
of BMI categories (underweight, overweight
and obesit y). The model incorporated nonlinear
time trends and age patterns; national versus
subnational and communit y representativeness;
and whether data covered both rural and urban
areas versus only one of them. The model
also included covariates that help predict
BMI, including national income, proportion of
population living in urban areas, mean number
of years of education and summar y measures
of availabilit y of different food t y pes for
human consumption.

against nutrition targets at the regional and
global level

Calculated based on available data between the
starting year 2008 and the latest, considered
as the “recent trend” period, using a log-linear
regression (exponential growth model). That is,

The current Average Annual Rate of Reduction (AARR):

General method for assessment of progress against the targets:
For all targets except wasting, the assessment
of progress is done using an Average Annual
Rate of Reduction (AARR). aw First an AARR
for the current trend is calculated using
estimates from the UN databases which
provides an assessment of the rate of progress
being made between the baseline year and
most recent estimate. The AARR required to
reach the target is then calculated using the
baseline (2012) estimate from the UN databases
and the target. The current AARR is then
compared to the required AARR using cut-offs
presented in Table A2.1 to classify each subregion
or region into their corresponding progress
assessment category.

A A RR = 1 - exp(β)
where β is the slope in the model Y=a+ β*X, Y
is natural logarithm of the prevalence and X the
sur vey year (X).16

The current Average Annual Rate of Increase (AARI) for exclusive
breastfeeding (EBF): Calculated based on available
survey data between the starting year 2008 and
the latest, in this case, estimates derived for
years 2012 and 2019, considered as the “recent
trend” period, using a log-linear regression
(exponential growth model). That is,
A A RI = exp(β) - 1

Baseline year: The baseline reference year for all

where β is the slope in the model Y=a+ β*X, Y
is natural logarithm of the prevalence and X the
sur vey year (X). 2 [It is the opposite of AARR, that
is, multiplying by -1].

the nutrition targets is 2012.

Number of stunted children: The numbers of children
under 5 years who are stunted are derived
multiplying the prevalence estimates by the

Number of years to achieve the target, starting from the baseline:
Starting from the baseline year, the number of
years to achieve the target is given by:

aw For exclusive breastfeeding, the Average Annual Rate of Increase
(AARI) is used instead of AARR since targets for this indicator require
prevalence to increase.

n = ln (P target / P 0 )/ln(1+AARR/100)

C2. Regression analysis
The text following Figure 9 in the report
describes an analysis that aims at better
understanding the determinants of gender
gaps in accessing food, once controlling for
other factors. The analysis is performed by
pooling together individual-level FIES data
collected by FAO in 145 countries, from 2014
to 2018, with the purpose of assessing the
extent of any differences in the food-insecurit y
status of men and women, after controlling for
socio-economic factors. A logistic regression
is applied using the food-insecurit y status as a
dependent variable, established by considering
the cross-countr y comparable probabilit y of
being food insecure at moderate or severe level
for each countr y. If the probabilit y is larger
than 50 percent, the individual is classified as
“food insecure” and the dependent variable
takes the value of 1; otherwise it assumes a
value of 0. Gender, area of residence, povert y
and employment status, education level,
age, marital status, perceived health of the
respondents and household size are included
as independent variables. The year of data
collection (between 2014 and 2018) and
geographical subregion are also included as
covariates. Results show that, after controlling
for area of residence, povert y status and
education level of the respondents, the odds
of being food insecure are still approximately
13 percent higher for women than for men at
moderate or severe level, and 27 percent at
severe level.

A A R R = 1- (1-Target reduction)(1/n)
where target reduction is given by 30 percent, for
both 2025 and 2030, thus n equals to 13 and 18,
respectively.
The criteria used to classif y the progress of
regions and subregions towards achieving the six
nutrition targets are presented in Table A2.1.

C. Gender gap in accessing food
This section provides additional details about
the analysis performed in the section “Gender
differences in food insecurit y” of Section 1.1.

C1. Prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity among adults by gender
Figure 9 is derived using data collected by FAO.
These data are collected at individual level.
Each respondent (adult – 15 years or older)
answers the FIES sur vey module by referring
to his/her own individual food-insecurit y
condition. For this reason, it is possible to
disaggregate the results of food insecurit y
by male and female respondents. To do so,
first, the possible presence of differential item
functioning between men and women was
checked, to make sure that differences between
men and women in food-insecurit y levels was
not due to the fact that they may experience
in a different way the same food-securit y
conditions or that they may interpret the
same question in a different way. Results (not
shown) point to no significant differential

percentage weight contribution of food
groups in FBDGs from Australia, China
and Thailand

obtained in this manner was 56.6 g for the cereal
group. For the lean meats and alternatives group,
using serving sizes expressed as cooked meat
amounts, ~65 g was obtained for the serving size
(which was the same for both the food composite
of poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, legumes and
food composite of red meats). For the dairy and
alternatives group, the serving size was calculated
to be 243 g, based on the average for Medium
fat dairy foods (241 g) and Lower fat dairy foods
(245 g). Guidance documents referred to were
“A Modelling System to Inform the Revision of
the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating”,17 “Eat
for Health Educator Guide – Information for
nutrition educators”,18 and the “Eat for Health
Australian Dietary Guidelines Summary”.19

This note refers to the calculations used to create
the pie charts in Figure 16, Section 1.3. Three sets
of FBDGs were compared by looking at the
percentage weight contribution of each food
group to the total diet.

D1. Assumptions made in calculating the percentage
weight contribution of food groups to each FBDG
Australia:

The “Total Diet” for adults, omnivore pattern
for women aged 19–50 years was used as a base.
Since this corresponds to an energ y requirement
of 7 100 –7 300kJ (average 7 200kJ or ~1 720 kcal),
and the Australian FBDGs suggests that for taller
or more active women, additional calories needed
can be obtained from any preferred combination
of foods from the various food groups; 0.5
ser vings more were added to each of the five
recommended food group amounts in this pattern
to obtain a diet of approximately 2 000 kcal.

China:

For each food group, a range of ser vings per
day are given in the Chinese FBDGs, e.g.
“Cereals, tubers and leg umes” 250 – 400 g.
These are based on an average adult who requires
daily energ y intake of 1 400 –2 600 kcal. 20 On
the assumption that the lower limit given for a
food group is applicable for 1 400 kcal and the
upper limit for 2 600 kcal, the average was used,
which would correspond to 2 000 kcal. Thus, for
example, for the “Cereals, tubers and leg umes” a
ser ving size of 325 g was used.

The serving sizes for fruits group and vegetables
and legumes/beans group are expressed in
grams in the guide, and these values were
used. The remaining three food groups “Grain
(cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain and/or high
cereal fibre varieties” (cereals); “Lean meats
and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds and
legumes/beans” (lean meats and alternatives);
and “Milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives,
mostly reduced fat” (dairy and alternatives) are
presented in the FBDGs with different serving
size weights depending on the food. Thus, it was
necessary to calculate a representative serving
size per each food group according to the actual
frequency/amounts of each food consumed in the
country. The food consumption patterns observed
for women aged 19–30 years was used for this
purpose. In addition, for the cereal group, since
the guidelines specif y that 2/3 of the food should
be wholegrains, the serving size for the group
was calculated by assigning 2/3 of the value to
the wholegrain serving size and 1/3 to the refined
grains serving size obtained. The serving size

Thailand:

The 2 000 kcal pattern given in the FBDGs
manual was used, 21 together with information
in Sirichakwal et al. (2011). 22 For the fruit group,
the serving size was not expressed in grams, so
the weight of a small banana (40 g according to
Sirichakwal et al., 2011 22) was used. This results in
a total of 160 g for fruits, which when considered
with the 240 g for vegetables, gives a total of
400 g of fruits and vegetables needed to meet the
FAO/WHO daily recommendation. Similarly, for
milk, the size of the glass was not specified in the
manual but given as 200 g in the published paper.

D2. Description of the differences in the FBDGs
1. The way foods are grouped is not the same in
the FBDGs:
 Australia and China both use five food
groups, although they are not exactly the
same. Thailand uses six food groups.
| 206 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

 Australia counts leg umes/beans with both
animal foods and with vegetables while
nuts and seeds are with animal foods.
Thailand includes leg umes and pulses
with animal foods (nuts and seeds are not
mentioned). China has leg umes with the
staples but also includes soybeans and nuts
with milk and dair y.
 Australia includes milk alternatives in
the dair y group, while suggesting that
people who choose not to eat dair y foods
can consider fortified soymilk, sardines
and some nuts as calcium sources.
(China includes soybeans and nuts with
dair y.) In the case of Thailand, people
having lactose maldigestion or intolerance
are advised to eat alternative sources of
calcium such as small fish with bone or
fish meal.
 Thailand groups oil, sugar and salt as one
group. China has oil and salt together.
In Australia, foods containing saturated
fat, added salt, added sugars and alcohol
are placed outside the main five food
groups, to convey the idea that they
should be consumed infrequently and in
small amounts.
 Both Australia and Thailand count fruits
and vegetables as two separate food groups,
while China considers them as one group
(although separate ser ving sizes are given
for them in the pagoda image).
 Tap water is indicated in the Australian
FBDGs, while a glass of water is seen
in the Chinese FBDGs. In addition,
physical activit y is also promoted in the
Chinese FBDGs.

 The larger proportion of staples and “oil,
sugar, salt” in Thailand can be linked to
the nutritional problems that were targeted
when the FBDGs were developed, mentioned
as both undernutrition and overweight
and obesit y.
3. The foods depicted in the FBDGs are different:
 Each countr y graphic shows foods that
are commonly available and consumed in
the countr y.

E. Strengths and limitations of different data
sources for global assessment of diet quality
Table A2.2 summarizes some of the strengths and
limitations of different sources of data for global
assessment of food and nutrient intake and
diet qualit y.

F. Analysis of the trends in food availability
using Supply Utilization Accounts data
This section refers to the analysis in Section
1.3 entitled “Trends in global and regional food
availabilit y”.

F1. Data
The data come from the Supply Utilization
Accounts (SUA) database of the FAO Statistics
Division (currently not in the public domain).
Data for 184 countries and territories for the
years 2000 to 2017 were used.
FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) are generated
based on the SUA, which are more detailed lists of
over 400 different foods. FAO has been compiling
SUA and FBS annually for most countries and
territories (currently, 184) since 1961.

2. The relative proportions of the food groups
var y among the three FBDGs:
 The proportion of the cereal (staple) group
is quite different in the three FBDGs,
being largest in Thailand and smallest
in Australia.
 Fairly large differences are obser ved in the
recommended proportions for the milk,
dair y (and alternatives) group.
 Combined fruits and vegetables are
similar in Australia and China but smaller
in Thailand.

Both SUA and FBS present a comprehensive
picture of the pattern of a countr y’s food
availabilit y during a specified reference period,
t y pically a year. The fig ures are produced by
balancing the data on a countr y’s food supply
(production, imports and opening stocks) with
its food utilization (exports, availabilit y for
human consumption, seeds, feed, post-har vest
losses, other utilizations and closing stocks) 23,24

» for different foods and commodities. For the

Nevertheless, bearing in mind the caveats
outlined above, it is nonetheless possible to
use SUA and FBS data to show trends in food
available for consumption at the global level, or
aggregating countries into regions or by countr y
income group. The advantage of using SUA
instead of FBS data is that it gives the user the
possibilit y of classif ying the various food items
into food groups of choice.

purpose of analysing global food availabilit y
for human consumption, the main difference
lies in FBS providing information on quantities
expressed in terms of equivalents of primar y
crops, livestock products and fish commodities,
while SUA provide more granular information
in terms of official or assessed quantities of
commercialized food products. For instance,
while the SUA ref lect the amount of wheat
f lour available for consumption, in the FBS, this
amount is converted into equivalents of wheat
grain (i.e. the primar y crop).

F2. Food groupings
Food items were classified into 19 groups on the
basis of their nutritional relevance following the
classifications used in the FAO/W HO Global
Individual Food consumption data Tool (GIFT), 25
with some exceptions. Some modifications
were made to cater to the nature of SUA data
and the purpose of this analysis, for example:
(1) several food groups in the FAO/W HO GIFT
(e.g. food supplements, composite dishes) feature
food items not included in the SUA database,
so these groups were not created; (2) for this
analysis, the meat subgroups “Red meat” and
“Processed meat” were created following the
definition of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer. 26

Nevertheless, while the two sets of data
(SUA and FBS) are internally consistent by
construction, users should be aware that none
of them is based solely on directly measured
variables. The reason is that the database is
constructed by combining information on official
domestic production of primar y commodities
(e.g. wheat, milk), with data on internationally
traded food products (e.g. pasta, cheese).
Balancing requires either the aggregation of
imported SUA-level food items into quantities of
their primar y commodit y equivalent (for example,
expressing quantities of pasta and biscuits into
wheat equivalents to be able to meaningfully
sum them up) or the disaggregation of the
domestic supply of primar y commodities into
SUA-level food items (that is, estimating how
much of the national net supply of wheat goes
into pasta and biscuit production and converting
units of wheat into the corresponding units of
derived products). This means that part of the
SUA data derive from assumptions regarding
the way in which the domestic supply of primar y
commodities is disaggregated up to the level
of traded food products, which may be only
approximately correct.

For these analyses we considered 13 out of the
19 GIFT food groups (see Table A2.3). However, in
the analysis of the trends of availability of selected
food groups, estimates are shown for 10 food
groups (cereals; fruits; vegetables; roots, tubers
and plantains; pulses, seeds and nuts; eggs; fish
and shellfish; dairy products; fats and oils; and
sugars and sweeteners) and 3 meat subgroups
(red meat, processed meat and poultry).
Whereas, in the analysis of the contribution of
food groups to the total food and dietary energ y
available, estimates represent the 13 food groups
combined into 7 groups.

It should also be noted that national SUA
(as well as FBS) rely on official data from
countries, which in some cases might not
ref lect production from some small farms and/
or private households. Furthermore, reliable
data on national stock levels, industrial
non-food utilization and post-har vest losses
are lacking.

The classification of SUA items into food
groups for this analysis differs slightly from
the FBS classification, particularly for the
following subgroups: (1) plantains, in the FBS
classification, are grouped together with fruits,
whereas in this analysis, plantains have been
grouped together with roots and tubers; (2) fruit
juices (100 percent, nectars and concentrate),
in the FBS classification, are grouped together

F3. Analysis

For a full description of the methodolog y
(including a detailed list of the SUA food items
and inedible portion factors used) and results, see
Gheri et al. (forthcoming). 29

SUA data were used to depict trends in
availabilit y of selected food groups (cereals;
fruits; vegetables; roots, tubers and plantains;
pulses, seeds and nuts; eggs; fish and shellfish;
dair y products; fats and oils; and sugars and
sweeteners) and subgroups (red meat, processed
meat and poultr y) at global level, by region and
by countr y income classification for the years
2000 –2017. Estimates are presented as daily
average per capita edible quantities.

G. Analysis of the association between
food insecurity and food consumption
This section refers to the analysis in Section 1.3
entitled “How does food insecurit y affect what
people eat?”

Per capita per day estimates were obtained by
dividing total food availabilit y for a particular
group by the total population in that year 1
and by the number of days in a year. To derive
estimates expressed in quantities that are closer
to the food available for consumption, food
quantities were first adjusted for losses that
may occur at the retail level estimated based
on information published at global-regional
level, 27 and then converted into corresponding
edible quantities by applying inedible portion
factors (i.e. refuse factors). It is worth noting
that SUA (and FBS) data exclude food losses at
the production and post-har vest level. Thus, the
estimates presented herein are net of food losses
up to the retail level. However, they are not net
of potential food wastage that may happen at the
household level.

G1. Data sets
The data sets used in the analyses were three
Household Consumption and Expenditure
Sur veys (HCES): Kenya Integrated Household
Budget Sur vey 2015/16, Sudan Study of
Consumption Patterns and Nutrition 2018, and
Samoa Household Income and Expenditure
Sur vey 2018; and one individual-level dietar y
intake sur vey: Mexico National Health and
Nutrition Sur vey (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y
Nutrición [ENSANUT]) 2012.

G2. Definition of variables
Food insecurit y was constructed as a
trichotomous variable (food secure/mildly food
insecure; moderately food insecure; severely
food insecure), based on experience-based
food insecurit y scale data from the Kenya,
Mexico and Sudan data sets. For Samoa, food
insecurit y was constructed as a dichotomous
variable, because the number of sampled
households with severe food insecurit y
was extremely low, thus, to provide reliable
estimates of food consumption by class of food
securit y, the severe food insecure class was
combined with the moderate food insecure
class – the two combined classes are referred to

The contribution of all 13 food groups (cereals;
fruits; vegetables; roots, tubers and plantains;
pulses, seeds and nuts; meat; eggs; fish and
shellfish; dair y products; fats and oils; sugars
and sweeteners; beverages; and others) to the
total food available and to the dietar y energ y
availabilit y in 2017 are also presented, by
countr y income classification. Estimates are

only. Only the statistically significant results are
reported within the text.
The design of the food consumption modules in
the four sur veys analysed differed substantially.
Attempts were made to make food consumption
statistics comparable across countries to the
extent possible. Nevertheless, comparison of
levels of consumption across countries should be
done considering this limitation.

The average consumption of selected food
groups was estimated in daily grams per capita.
Foods were classified into 19 groups on the
basis of their nutritional relevance following the
criteria used in the FAO/W HO Global Individual
Food consumption data Tool (GIFT), 25 with a few
exceptions to cater for the nature of household
consumption data. For these analyses, we
considered 11 (cereals; roots, tubers, plantains;
pulses, seeds and nuts; dair y products; eggs;
fish and shellfish; meat; fruits; vegetables;
fats and oils; and sweeteners and sugars) out
of the 19 food groups. All estimates represent
edible quantities.

For a full description of the methodolog y
and results, see Alvarez-Sanchez et al.
(forthcoming). 35

H. Analysis of association between food
insecurity based on the FIES and new metrics
of diet quality: evidence from Ghana and
the United Republic of Tanzania

The average apparent intake of dietar y energ y
was estimated in daily kilocalories per capita.
In the case of the three HCES data sets, the
dietar y energ y estimate refers only to the
at-home consumption. Foods which only had
information on the monetar y value (t ypically,
food consumed away from home), were excluded.
In Mexico’s data set, all foods (consumed at home
and away from home) were reported in terms of
quantities, thus, they were all considered in the
estimate of apparent dietar y energ y intake.

This section provides additional details about the
analyses presented in Box 9.

H1. Data sets
The data used to estimate the diet qualit y
indicators presented in the analysis were
collected through the Gallup © World Poll in the
context of the Global Diet Qualit y Project 69 along
with the data used to estimate the prevalence
rates of food insecurit y. The sur veys, conducted
in 2019 in both countries, included the FIES
sur vey module and Diet Qualit y Questionnaire
(DQ-Q). 70

G3. Analysis
Average food group consumption and dietar y
energ y intake estimates were obtained by food
insecurit y level in each countr y. The statistics
from HCES data were obtained using the
ADePT-FSM software. 31,32 Using Mexico’s data
set, estimates were obtained applying the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) method for
usual intake of episodically consumed foods and
for usual dietar y energ y intake, 33 implemented
through the Mixtran and Distrib SAS macros. 34

H2. Definition of variables
Three diet qualit y indicators were constructed:
 Food Group Diversit y Score (FGDS)
 Score of consumption of nutritious foods that
contribute to healthy diets (FLAVOURS)
 Score of consumption of dietar y components
that should be limited or avoided (FAD)
Each indicator was produced using different
combinations of food groups. The FGDS indicator
is based on ten groups: grains, white roots and
tubers, and plantains; leg umes/pulses; nuts and
seeds; dair y; meat, poultr y and fish; eggs; dark

Comparison of means was conducted with
regression analysis followed by Tukey’s pairwise
post-hoc tests (family error rate of 5 percent),
except for Samoa, where differences across
groups were assessed with regression analysis

Food insecurit y was constructed as a
trichotomous variable (food secure/mildly food
insecure; moderately food insecure; severely
food insecure), using the FIES data from each
data set. Each countr y’s food insecurit y scale
was equated to the global reference scale

food insecurit y.

green leaf y vegetables; other vitamin a-rich
fruits and vegetables; other vegetables; and
other fruits. In FGDS, each group counts as one
point. The FLAVOURS indicator is based on
nine groups: whole grains; leg umes/pulses; nuts
and seeds; vitamin A-rich orange vegetables;
dark green leaf y vegetables; other vegetables;
vitamin A-rich fruits; citrus fruits; and other
fruits. In FLAVOURS, each group counts as one
point, with the exception of “whole grains” that
gets two points. The FAD indicator is based on
six groups: sugar-sweetened beverages; sweets;
processed meat; unprocessed read meat; deep
fried food; and fast food (highly processed
foods high in fat and sugar/salt purchased at a
franchise/chain business) and instant noodles.
In FAD, each group counts as one point, with
the exception of sugar-sweetened beverages
and processed meat which each get two points.
All the dependent variables were ordinal
variables based on food group scores.

H3. Model specification
Ordinal logistic regression equations were
used to estimate the likelihood of an individual
having a one point higher score for each of the
three diet qualit y indicators, given his/her food
insecurit y status. Regressions were estimated
for each diet qualit y indicator separately (FGDS,
FLAVOURS and FAD). The analyses were
conducted controlling for age, sex, education,
income, area of residence, household size and
marital status.

AND METHODOLOGY
OF SECTION 2.1

nutrient requirements, is ver y close to the cost
for this reference woman. The estimated energ y
requirement (EER) for a non-pregnant and
non-lactating woman aged 30 with moderate
physical activit y is determined using the
Dietar y Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed
by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) with the
following formula:

A. Description of the three diets
A1. The energy sufficient diet: definition and cost
The energy sufficient diet provides adequate
calories for energ y balance for work each day,
achieved using only each countr y’s basic starchy
staple (e.g. maize, wheat, or rice). In this report,
the benchmark requirements for an energ y
sufficient diet and the other two diets refer to the
dietary needs of an adult reference non-pregnant
and non-lactating woman aged 30 doing
moderate physical activit y.

EER=354 - 6.91*age + PAL*(9.36*Weight (kg) +
726 *Height (m))
where the weight of 57 kg and the height of
1.63 m are the median values for an adult woman
from the W HO growth chart, indicating a median
body mass index (BMI) of 21.5; and the Physical
Activit y Level (PAL) equal to 1.27 is the Active
PAL coefficient from DRIs. Thus, the same energ y
intake value based on the median W HO weight
and height, and also a recommended active
PAL on physical activit y level are applied to all
countries and do not ref lect countr y-specific
population characteristics.

The cost of the energ y sufficient diet is
computed to identif y the absolute lowest cost
of meeting calorie needs from the cheapest
starchy staple available in a countr y. The cost
of the energ y sufficient diet is not intended to
create a realistic or t ypical cost of a diet; rather
it represents the absolute lowest cost of calorie
sufficiency. In fact, the purpose of calculating
this hypothetical benchmark is to establish a
lower bound on the cost of short-term sur vival
at each place and time, and to identif y the
additional cost required to achieve longer-term
goals specified in the other two diets.
This benchmark is used in the report as a point
of comparison for discussing affordabilit y of
the cost of nutrient adequate and healthy diets
(see below).

Based on this formula, the energ y intake of the
reference population is estimated to be 2 329 kcal
per day. This calorie content is applied across all
three diets and all countries for comparabilit y.

A2. The nutrient adequate diet: definition and cost
The nutrient adequate diet provides not only
adequate calories but also adequate levels of
all essential nutrients for a healthy and active
life, through a balanced mix of carbohydrates,
protein, fat, vitamins and minerals, within the
upper and lower bounds needed to prevent
deficiencies and avoid toxicit y. The cost of this
diet is computed to identif y the minimum cost
of foods that meet all known requirements for
essential nutrients as well as the dietar y energ y
requirement of 2 329 kcal for a reference woman
aged 30.

A 30-year-old woman is chosen as a reference
to cost the three diets since preliminar y
analyses show that each countr y’s weighted
average of the cost of the diets, obtained by
calculating age- and sex-specific calorie and
| 214 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

The purpose of calculating this diet is to
identif y the cost and affordabilit y of acquiring
all nutrients in the required proportions, so as
to identif y the abilit y of each countr y’s food
system to deliver nutrient adequate diets at
all times and places. The minimum cost of a
nutrient adequate diet also provides a useful
lower bound on the cost of nutrients in order to
identif y the additional cost required to achieve
additional goals specified in other diets, such
as long-term health protection and culturally
preferred diet patterns.

For half the population, true nutrient needs are
lower, so the true cost of a nutrient adequate
diet would be lower; for the other half of the
population, true nutrient needs are higher, so
the true cost of a nutrient adequate diet would be
higher. For people who are less physically active,
energ y needs and therefore costs are lower, and
for people who are more physically active, energ y
needs and therefore costs are higher. The aim is
to provide the best estimate of the average cost of
meeting energ y, macronutrient and micronutrient
needs within the population.

The cost of the nutrient adequate diet is
defined as the minimum cost to meet the EER
needed for the energ y sufficient diet, as well
as relevant daily nutrient intake values of
23 macronutrients and micronutrients for the
reference group (Table A3.1). Global harmonized
average requirements (H-A Rs) are applied,
which are the levels of nutrients that meet the
needs of 50 percent of the healthy population.
Furthermore, harmonized upper level of intake
(H-ULs) are applied, representing the highest
level that is likely to avoid risk of adverse
health effects, 36 and the Chronic Disease Risk
Reduction Intake (CDRR) for sodium. 37,38

In a sensitivit y analysis, the cost of a nutrient
adequate diet is also calculated using the IOM
Recommended Dietar y Allowances (RDAs),
or Adequate Intakes (AIs), if the latter is not
larger than the H-A Rs, to determine the cost
of a nutrient adequate diet that would cover
97.5 percent of nutrient needs of the population.
In Figures 30 and 31, the cost of the nutrient
adequate diet is estimated for a household of five
specific individuals and it is then expressed as
a per capita average. The modelled household
varies by countr y, but t y pically includes
one breastfed child aged 12–23 months, one
school-aged child (6 –7 years), one adolescent
girl (14–15 years), one lactating woman and
one adult man. Unaffordabilit y is measured
by the proportion of households in a countr y
whose food expenditure is not sufficient to
afford a nutrient adequate diet in their local
environment. The nutrient adequate diet
includes, per person, the average energ y needs
and the recommended intake for protein, fat,
four minerals and nine vitamins. The reference
nutrient intake (RNI) is applied, which is the
amount of nutrients that meet the needs of
nearly all the population (97.5 percent).

To calculate the cost of nutrient adequate diets,
a linear program selects foods to provide
nutrient content above the H-A Rs and below
the H-ULs and the CDRR for sodium, while
specif ying that the macronutrient intakes
are within the Acceptable Macronutrient
Distribution Range (A MDR) set by the IOM, 39
and meeting the energ y content of 2 329 kcal.
The result is a basket representing the lowest
cost of meeting average energ y, macronutrient
and micronutrient needs in the population.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

A3. The healthy diet: definition and cost

For each countr y, ten costs of the healthy diet
are calculated by applying these ten FBDGs.
The local cost and affordabilit y of the healthy
diet is calculated for each countr y based on
the two least-expensive retail items in each
food group, in the total quantit y recommended
by each FBDGs for that food group, in order
to provide an energ y intake of 2 329 kcal.
The retail food items considered are those
locally available at each time when prices are
reported, and by marketplace. ax This calculation
is done for each unique set of the ten
recommendations, to produce a range of costs
associated with a range of ways to meet healthy
diets as they have been defined by Member
States. Finally, the mean of the ten least
expensive baskets is taken as a point estimate
of the cost of healthy diets.

The healthy diet provides not only adequate
calories but also adequate levels of all essential
nutrients for a healthy and active life. As per
the two diets above, the reference group is an
adult woman aged 30. The methodolog y used
here does not test for nutrient adequacy, but
ensures that a more diverse variet y of foods
from different food groups are consumed.
The cost of a healthy diet is defined as the
minimum cost of foods that meet a set of
dietar y recommendations based on FBDGs
and intended to provide adequate calories
and nutrients. This diet also includes a more
diverse intake of foods from several different
food groups. Although the healthy diet is
not selected on the basis of nutrients but is
determined by FBDGs, this diet meets on
average 95 percent of nutrient needs, and it
can be therefore almost always considered as
nutrient adequate. 40

Given that there is no one way to define a
healthy diet, this method is a more robust way
of estimating the least-cost of a healthy diet
rather than applying a single definition of a
healthy diet. Sensitivit y analysis was carried
out on three variant models of the cost of the
healthy diet which are described with results
presented in Annex 4. The finding shows that
healthy diets by any definition are unaffordable
to a ver y large number of people.

While the detailed g uidance of national FBDGs
are designed to be specific to the countr y, in
most cases the definitions of food groups used
to define a healthy diet pattern are broadly
similar, usually consisting of common 5 – 6
food groups.

The choice of the ten FBDGs results from
a combination of four factors: a) clear
quantification of food groups; b) recency of
publication; c) representativeness of regions
and countries with large populations; and
d) representativeness of distinctive dietar y
patterns. For instance, since more than half
of all people in the world live in Asia, and
dietar y patterns var y significantly between the
subregions in Asia, three FBDGs that represent
three Asian subregions are considered in
this analysis.

For this global analysis, it is not possible to
apply a countr y specific FBDGs to each countr y
because not ever y countr y has defined its own
national FBDGs, and even where they exist,
only a few FBDGs are quantifiable. To overcome
this limitation, and given that there is no
single way to define a healthy diet, ten national
FBDGs are selected for this analysis which
explicitly report recommended food quantities
for each food group and provide a wide regional
representation: Benin ( Western Africa), Oman
( Western Asia), Malta (Southern Europe),
Netherlands ( Western Europe), India (Southern
Asia), Viet Nam (South-eastern Asia), China
(Eastern Asia), United States of America
(Northern America), Jamaica (Caribbean) and
Argentina (South America).

ax Prices fluctuate, so the least-cost set of items will vary by time, and by
marketplace; there is no constant set of items that are always least-cost. In
the price data used for the analysis,“each time” refers to the time period for
which prices were reported. For the monthly data within countries, that is
usually one market visit per month, but sometimes is based on one visit per
week, and in the ICP data, it is a single average price for the entire year.
Similarly, “each place” refers to the physical market locations at which prices
were observed, where data used are typically an average over several
vendors at open markets and grocery stores in each rural town or city.

| 217 |

ANNEX 3

In addition, by applying different FBDGs to
different countries, cross-countr y comparabilit y
could not be pursued. Instead, by applying all
ten FBDGs to each countr y, a range is produced
as each FBDG is associated with a slightly
different cost. It should be noted that the cost of
the healthy diet is sensitive to the definition and
choice of FBDGs. For instance, if the FBDGs for
Malta and Oman are removed from the analysis,
the cost of a healthy diet becomes USD 3.72 as
compared with USD 3.75 when ten FBDGs are
used. See Annex 4 for specific g uidelines of
each of the ten FBDGs and a cost comparison of
each, including a comparison to four EAT-Lancet
healthy and sustainable diets.

Coherently with W HO g uidelines, the selected
ten FBDGs recommend at least 400 g of fruits and
vegetables, less than 10 percent of dietar y energ y
from sugar and less than 5 g of salt, as all sugar y
and salt y snack foods are excluded and treated as
non-required foods. The least-cost items selected
are generally raw commodities such as beans,
maize, bread, oranges, papayas, onions, spinach,
milk and sunf lower oil. They almost always
include leg umes; they sometimes but not always
include nuts, because some FBDGs do not include
nuts. Whether or not they include whole grains is
more difficult to determine, because many of the
grain items in the ICP list are not specified as to
whether or not they are whole grain.

Out of the ten FBDGs used:

The purpose of calculating the cost and
affordabilit y of this diet is to identif y the abilit y
of each countr y’s food system to deliver diets
that meet dietar y needs beyond nutrients,
which encompass acceptable dietar y patterns
and protection of long-term health at the lowest
possible cost. The minimal cost of a healthy
diet provides a useful lower bound on the cost
of achieving food securit y through market
purchases. This is an important benchmark
because it allows an estimate of whether all
people can access a diet that meets minimum
standards for healthy and active lives, as defined
by Member States.

 six use exactly the same six food groupings
(starchy staples, protein-rich foods including
leg umes/f lesh/egg, dair y, vegetable, fruit and
fats/oils); one of those six also includes nuts
as an additional food group recommended
daily (two in Asia, two in Europe, Africa and
Northern America);
 two use the same six food groupings, except
that leg umes are grouped with starchy staples
instead of protein foods (one in Asia, one in
Latin America and the Caribbean);
 one uses the same six food groupings,
except that leg umes and f lesh/egg are both
required subgroups of the protein categor y
( Western Asia);
 one uses the same six food groupings, except
that dair y and f lesh/egg are grouped together,
and leg umes are a separate required group
(one in Latin America and the Caribbean);
 in contrast, the EAT-Lancet reference diet
has 12 food groups (including requirements
for an exact amount of consumption of red
meat, poultr y, fish, eggs, leg umes and starchy
roots, each; food groups var y within four
diet patterns). In most cases, the least-cost
EAT-Lancet reference diet pattern is vegan.

B. Data and methodology for estimating
costs and affordability of the three diets
The analysis on cost and affordabilit y of
the three diets is focused on 170 countries
for which data are available in year 2017.
Following the 2017 World Bank classification
of income, out of the 170 countries, 27 are
low-income, 37 are lower-middle-income, 43 are
upper-middle-income and 63 are high-income
countries. Although the work from Herforth et al.
(2020) 40 includes 173 countries, three countries
are excluded from the analysis presented in
Section 2.1 (Ang uilla, Bonaire and Montserrat),
since the World Bank’s classification of income
is not available for them. See Table A3.2 for a
description of the countries.

The way foods are grouped in these ten FBDGs
are only some of the possible ways foods can be
grouped, which is done primarily based on how
foods are used culinar y. Globally, approximately
half of FBDGs use six food groups.
| 218 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

standardized items (one nationally representative
price per item) for 2017. 43 The ICP data
are based on each United Nations member
countr y’s national statistical agency, which
may also provide prices for more diverse items
at multiple market locations each month for
several years. ICP reports data for 737 items in
2017, but 57 were alcohol and tobacco, leaving
680 food and non-alcoholic beverage items.
Furthermore, non-caloric food items were also
excluded from the analysis, such as baby food
formula, condiments, and items with unclear
composition. Therefore, the analysis focuses
on food prices in local currency units (LCU)
for 680 foods in 170 countries, from the ICP’s
global and regional item lists. Prices expressed in
2017 LCU are converted to international dollars
using purchasing power parit y (PPP). Prices are
measured at retail marketplaces, defined as
the locations where people t ypically acquire
their food.

The cost and affordabilit y analysis focuses
on sufficient quantities of the least-cost food
items that are available at retail markets in
each time and place to meet specified energ y
and nutritional requirements. More expensive
items are usually also available in the markets
and would be counted in a countr y’s CPI, but
they are omitted from these cost calculations.
Therefore, the resulting least-cost diets are
hypothetical diets. In fact, the purpose of this
analysis is to measure whether the food system
brings healthy diets within reach of the poorest,
using those foods that meet each standard at the
lowest possible cost.
The reference population chosen to measure
the cost and affordabilit y of the three diets
is a non-pregnant and non-lactating woman
doing moderate physical activit y. There are
two reasons behind the choice of calculating
affordabilit y indicators based on a reference
woman of reproductive age. First, the least-cost
to meet energ y and nutrient requirements for
this reference group is approximately at the
median level of the least-costs for all sex-age
groups over the life cycle. 40 Therefore, this
reference group is a good representation of the
population as a whole.

These locations range from open markets with
multiple vendors to small neighborhood shops
and grocer y stores of all sizes. Retail markets
may offer thousands of distinct items at different
prices that var y over time and space. To compare
prices across and within countries, national
statistical agencies identif y representative items
at widely used marketplaces, and obser ve their
price at reg ular inter vals. All prices reported
by those national agencies are used, counting
items with missing prices as not available (or
equivalently, having an infinitely high price).

Second, women of reproductive age are t ypically
a nutritionally v ulnerable population group,
due to important consequences of energ y and
nutrient deficiencies on both women and infants,
as well as increased risk of dietar y inadequacies
due to social practices and norms that often
disadvantage women and girls. Previous studies
have also based cost of nutrient adequate diet
findings on this reference group. 41,42 It should
be considered, however, that other population
groups, such as women during pregnancy and
lactation, may have higher energ y requirements.

A key feature of the least-cost diets for each
nutritional standard is that the food items chosen
may var y over time and place, drawing on locally
available or seasonal items as needed to meet
dietary requirement. For caloric adequacy, the
least-cost diet allows for substitution among the
starchy staples based only on the energ y content
of each food. For the nutrient adequate diet, the
least-cost diet recognizes substitution among
alternative sources of each essential nutrient; for
example, month-to-month variation in Vitamin
A sources is allowed when different fruits and
vegetables are in season, and there is a similar
substitution within each food group for healthy
diets as defined by dietar y g uidelines.

To estimate cost and affordabilit y of the three
diets, four kinds of data are used: i) retail prices;
ii) dietar y requirements; iii) food composition
and classification; and iv) welfare indicators.
Retail prices of each food item available for
purchase in each market are obtained from
the World Bank’s ICP for internationally
| 219 |

ANNEX 3

Food composition and classification of each item
is t ypically obtained from the nutrient data
bank for internationally standardized items
implemented by the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA), complemented by
other food composition data. The food group
classification of each item, for its contribution to
a healthy dietar y recommendation, is based on
the definitions used for each dietar y g uideline.
Each FBDG’s specification of the amount of
food that meets the recommended amount is
followed. If foods are cooked, yield factors are
applied, which are from the Western African
Food Composition Table (FCT). In all three diets,
the edible portions applied are mostly from
the USDA FCT, supplemented by the Western
African FCT and others for some fish and
raw meats.

income distribution was applied only to
India, as this is the most recent distribution
available in the countr y. Since all data
from the PovcalNet tool 44 are expressed in
USD 2011, the costs of the diets measured
in 2017 were adjusted to USD 2011 costs.
CPI inf lation from the Federal Reser ve
Economic Data were used to make this
adjustment for each year between 2012 and
2017. 45
Using the data described above, to calculate
least-cost diets for the energ y sufficient and
nutrient adequate diets, linear programming
is used to select foods in the quantities needed
to minimize the cost subject to caloric and
nutrient constraints. For the cost of the healthy
diet, rank-order optimization method is used
to select two foods in each group that fill each
categor y at the lowest cost.

Classif ying foods in the ICP table into food
group definitions of the selected FBDGs is
quite straightforward. The main assumptions
involve the exclusion of certain grain foods
(such as biscuits and cakes) from the starchy
staple group, as well as fruit juices from the
fruit group unless it was explicitly included in
the countr y’s FBDGs. In one countr y’s FBDGs,
nuts were not mentioned and were therefore
excluded from that particular definition of a
healthy diet.

To determine affordabilit y, the cost of the
three diets is compared with povert y lines,
food expenditures and income, to create three
measures of affordabilit y:
1. Affordability as the cost of the diets compared with poverty
line: the cost of the diets is compared with
63 percent of the international povert y line
set at USD 1.90 per day, which is equal
to USD 1.20. The 63 percent accounts
for a portion of the povert y line that can
be credibly reser ved for food, based on
obser vations that the poorest segment of the
population in low-income countries spend,
on average, 63 percent of their incomes on
food ( World Bank Global Consumption
Database). 46 It is thus assumed that a
minimum of 37 percent of expenditures
must be reser ved for non-food items
(such as housing, transport, school, farm
inputs). In realit y, 37 percent of non-food
expenditures is a conser vative assumption,
for instance, in high-income countries, where
non-food expenditures may be a higher share.
Under this measure, affordabilit y is defined
when the cost of each diet per person per
day is lower or equal to USD 1.20. When the
cost of each diet is greater than USD 1.20,
denoting unaffordabilit y, this measure tells

Data on welfare indicators are used for the
affordabilit y analysis, to test if diets are within
reach. Three sources are used:
 The global World Bank’s povert y line set at
USD 1.90 per capita per day expressed in
PPP terms.
 National average food expenditures per capita
per day in year 2017 from the ICP, calculated
by Herforth et al. (2020), 40 based on ICP data. ay
 Income distributions from the World Bank's
PovcalNet tool are available for year 2018 (not
for year 2017), and are based on household
sur veys across 164 economies. The 2015
ay The sources for national accounts data on total and food expenditures
are the WB ICP reports as per the UN System of National Accounts. These
are the same data used to compute “gross national income” (GNI) and
GDP, and are based on a variety of sources in each country. For further
details on data sources and methodology, see Alemu et al. (2019).68

available can be spent on food, and this gives
a ver y conser vative estimate. For upper-bound
estimates, the income needed is defined as the
income required to purchase a given diet as
well as other non-food needs:

2. Affordability as the cost of the diets compared with
average country’s food expenditure: the cost of the
diets is compared with the t ypical daily per
capita food expenditures in each countr y.
Under this measure, affordabilit y is defined
when the cost of each diet per person per
day is lower or equal to the average food
expenditure in each countr y. When the cost
of each diet is greater than this threshold,
denoting unaffordabilit y, this measure tells
how many times a diet is more expensive
than the average countr y-specific food
expenditure per person per day. Table A3.2
reports this measure for the 170 countries in
the analysis.
3. Affordability as the percentage and number of people not
able to afford the diets: the cost of the diets is
compared with the average income in each
countr y using income distributions from the
World Bank PovcalNet interface. 44 A diet
is considered unaffordable when its cost
exceeds the 63 percent of the average income
in a given countr y. Based on this threshold,
this measure identifies the percentage of
people for whom the cost of a specific diet
is unaffordable. These proportions are
multiplied by the 2017 population in each
countr y using the World Development
Indicators ( W DI) of the World Bank, to obtain
the number of people who cannot afford
a given diet in a given countr y. Note that,
out of the 170 countries in the analysis,
information on the percentage and number
of people who are not able to afford the diets
is available for 143 countries. Table A3.2 reports
this measure for the countries in the analysis.

Needed income = cost of the diet / food
expenditure share in World Bank’s classification
of income
Food expenditure shares identif y the average
proportion of expenditures that are reser ved
for food, and these var y by countr y income
group. Specifically, food expenditures represent,
on average, 15 percent, 28 percent, 42 percent
and 50 percent of total expenditures in high-,
upper-middle-, lower-middle- and low-income
countries, respectively. For example, if the cost of
a healthy diet is USD 3.00 in a given low-income
countr y where food expenditures are on average
50 percent of total expenditures, income would
need to be USD 6.00 for people to afford the
healthy diet as well as non-food needs.
For a full description of the methodolog y, see
Herforth et al. (2020). 40

C. Data and methodology of the simulation of
policy impact and transport cost reduction on
the cost of the nutrient adequate diet
For the simulation of policy impacts on the cost
of the nutrient adequate diet (Box 24), estimates
of nominal rates of protection (NRP) are used
and expressed as the percentage change in a
commodit y’s farm gate price attributable to
government restrictions on international trade
and other market price inter ventions. In fact,
the NRP is calculated using the difference
between the obser ved border price and
farm gate price of a given food commodit y,
after accounting for market access costs.
Therefore, it represents the effect of trade policy
and domestic price support. Simulation results
in this box are shown for Central America
countries, under the assumption that trade
distortions (protection) are removed, meaning
that the NRP is made equal to zero.

To give a range of confidence to the third
measure, the prevalence and number of
people who cannot afford the three diets
are also computed using lower-bound and
upper-bound estimates that are shown in
Table A3.3 by region and development status. az
Lower-bound estimates assume that all income
az The median food expenditure shares are 14 percent, 25 percent,
41 percent and 51 percent for the four income levels, which are quite close
to the mean.

World Bank Logistics Performance Index of the
respective countr y to South Africa, which is the
most efficient countr y in the region in terms of
transport networks.

NRP estimates are compiled and published by
the AgIncentives Consortium with input from
the World Bank, the OECD, the Agrimonitor
Initiative of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and the Monitoring and Analyzing
Food and Agricultural Policies (M A FAP)
programme of FAO. NRPs are available in each
countr y for 57 distinct commodit y products that
are then grouped into nine food group (dair y,
fruits, vegetables, grains, leg umes, poultr y
and eggs, red meat, starchy roots and tubers,
and sweeteners). Retail price data is from the
2017 round of the World Bank’s International
Comparison Project (ICP). In order to reduce
measurement error and the inf luence of extreme
values, the first step of the analysis is to smooth
variation over time and space by collapsing
NRP obser vations from 2008 to 2014 for all
food products into the mean NRP for each
food group for each countr y. Subsequently,
the NRPs (percentage of farm gate price) are
converted into changes in the retail prices of
final products that are reported through the ICP.
Our upper bound on price effects represents
a scenario where farm gate commodit y prices
account for one-half of retail prices paid, and
our lower bound represents a scenario where
that fraction is one-fourth. For each scenario
we identif y the quantities of items needed to
meet nutrient requirements at lowest total cost
per day, and show the added expense imposed
by the countr y’s agricultural trade restrictions.
Retail prices include the cost of ser vices at the
point of sale, plus transport from the farm gate
to retail outlet, none of which are changed by
the underlying commodit y’s farm gate NRP.

In order to simulate the transport cost reduction
scenario, the transport shock, originally
expressed as share of the farm gate price, is
averaged by food group, and then applied to the
retail prices from ICP of all food items in the food
group, in order to compute annual cost savings
for a nutritionally adequate diet (per person and
in constant 2017 USD). The different responses
between the 14 sub-Saharan countries stem from
differences in the countr y-specific foods that
make up the least cost diet.
The transport cost shock is re-computed at the
retail level applying two margin ranges: 100 and
300 percent. In the upper bound (100 percent)
transport shock is applied to half the retail price
(a scenario where farm gate commodit y price
accounts for one-half of retail price). In the lower
bound (300 percent) it is applied to a quarter of
the retail price (farm gate price is one-fourth
of the retail price). The quantities of food items
needed to meet nutrient requirements at the
lowest total cost per day, are identified for each
scenario. Subsequently, the potential (annual)
savings generated by the potential reduction in
transport costs are estimated.
For a full description of the methodolog y, see
Herforth et al. (2020). 40

For the simulation of transport cost reduction
on the cost of nutrient adequate diet (Box 19),
the analysis is conducted on 14 sub-Saharan
countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda
and United Republic of Tanzania). The transport
cost reduction, representing a positive shock,
is derived from the average transport cost data
collected by the M A FAP for the 24 value chains
analysed in the 14 countries for the period
2014–2017. Such costs are adjusted downward
using the average ratio (2014–2017) of the

Cost and

energy sufficient diet

NOTES: The table shows the cost and affordability of the three reference diets (energy sufficient, nutrient adequate and healthy diet) for 170 countries in year 2017. Cost and
affordability are shown by region (column 2), development status (column 3) and population in year 2017 (column 4). The cost of the three diets is based on retail food price
data obtained from the World Bank’s International Comparison Program (ICP) for internationally standardized items, converted to international dollars using purchasing power
parity (PPP). Two measures of affordability are presented. One shows the cost of each diet as a percentage of average food expenditure per capita per day in a given country
(columns 6, 9 and 12): each diet is unaffordable for values greater than 100 percent. The other measure shows the percentage of people who cannot afford the three reference
diets: each diet is unaffordable when its cost exceeds the 63 percent of the average income in a given country (columns 7, 10 and 13). The 63 percent accounts for a portion of
average income that can be credibly reserved for food.

NOTES: The table reports lower- and upper-bound estimates of the percentage (%) and total number (million) of population in each region and country income group who cannot afford the three reference diets (energy sufficient diet, nutrient adequate diet and the healthy diet)
in the year 2017. Lower-bound estimates are calculated assuming that 100 percent of income is spent on food, thus, these estimates count the number of people who have a daily income lower than the cost of each diet. Upper-bound estimates account for the fact that a portion of
income can be spent on non-food items, and are computed using average food expenditure shares that vary according to the World Bank’s classification of income. They represent, on average, 15 percent, 28 percent, 42 percent and 50 percent of total expenditures in high-,
upper-middle-, lower-middle- and low-income countries, respectively.

COMPUTE THE COST
OF A HEALTHY DIET

and USD 3.61 for the least-cost versions of
the EAT-Lancet reference diet variants, giving
a point estimate based on median cost of
USD 3.44. This is slightly higher than the
estimated cost of a EAT-Lancet reference diet
which was recently published, estimated at
USD 2.89 per day (based on 2010 prices). 42
The EAT-Lancet diets in Figure A4.1 are based
on the EAT-Lancet recommendations for an
exemplar y diet of 2 500 kcal per person per day
and are not comparable to the EAT-Lancet diets
analysed in Section 2.2 and discussed in Annex 7.
However, by applying the same methodolog y
of least-cost estimation, it is useful to provide
a simple comparison between the ten FBDGs
and the EAT-Lancet diets. The EAT-Lancet
diets analysed in Section 2.2 differ as they
apply ser ving-size recommendations based on
the epidemiological literature, and the energ y
intake is based on recommendations for each
countr y-specific age and sex structure (resulting
in an average global intake of 2 100 kcal per
person per day) (Table A7.2). Table A4.1 provides a
detailed description of the ten FBDGs that are
used to construct the healthy diet, as explained
in Annex 3.

Figure A4.1 shows different ranges of cost for
a healthy diet, corresponding to different
definitions of a healthy diet. These ranges
are obtained by costing recommended food
quantities published across ten FBDGs (blue
bars), as well as across four EAT-Lancet
reference diets (green bars) (f lexitarian,
pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan). Each bar
corresponds to the average cost in 2017 obtained
when a particular diet pattern is applied to the
170 countries in the data set. The cost is seen
to var y depending on the definition applied.
Across the ten different definitions of a healthy
diet published in the FBDGs, the cost of a
healthy diet ranges from USD 3.27– 4.57 per day,
giving a point estimate based on median costs
of USD 3.75 (blue horizontal line in Figure A4.1).
This compares to a range of between USD 3.31

NOTES: The figure shows the average cost of a healthy diet across different possible definitions. The blue bars show the cost of a healthy diet across the 170 countries analysed by
applying the ten national FBDGs that are used to cost the healthy diet in Section 2.1. The horizontal blue line represents the global cost of a healthy diet in year 2017 (USD 3.75),
estimated as the median cost of the ten FBDGs and shown in Table 7. The green bars denote the average global cost of a healthy diet by applying the four variants of the EAT-Lancet diet:
the flexitarian (FLX), the pescatarian (PSC), the vegetarian (VEG) and the vegan (VGN) diet. See Table A4.1 for a description of these diets. See Box 10 for the definition of the three
diets and Box 11 for a brief description of the cost methodology. For the full methodological notes and data sources, see Annex 3.

NOTE: The table shows recommended food quantities and kilocalorie intake by food group that are published in the ten FBDGs used to cost the healthy diet in Section 2.1. For the United States of America, three FBDGs are available that reflect different eating patterns in the country:
American, Mediterranean and vegetarian style. Since by definition, any of these eating patterns meets American FBDGs, the cost of the American healthy diet is computed using the least-cost dietary pattern, out of these three. The table also shows a description of the four EAT-Lancet
diets presented in Figure A4.1.

ADDITIONAL TABLES AND
FIGURES TO SECTION 2.1

Engel and Bennet’s laws imply that increases in
income associated with economic development
are expected to lead first to a decrease in
the share of expenditures devoted to food
consumption, and then to a decrease in raw
products among food expenditures. Thus, food
demand becomes less responsive to income and
price changes as income rises. 49

This section provides additional tables and
fig ures for the analysis presented in Section 2.1.
Table A5.1 shows average predicted own-price
elasticities at two levels: the aggregate food group
level and the product level. Table A5.2 shows ownand cross-price elasticities estimated by Green
et al. (2013) 47 and Cornelsen et al. (2015) 48 by
countr y economic development. Although both
price and income elasticities are systematically
higher for some products (e.g. meat) than for
others (e.g. oils and fats), they tend to decrease
with GDP per capita in absolute terms. 49 In fact,

Additional fig ures show the cost of a healthy
diet by food group categor y (Figure A5.1) and the
contribution of each food group to the final cost
of a healthy diet across countr y income groups
(Figure A5.2). Finally, world maps in Figure A5.3
describe the percentage of people in each
countr y who were not able to afford the three
diets in 2017.

assistance for food. 50
3. The countr y received more than 10 percent
of total ODA in the form of humanitarian
assistance between 2009 and 2017. 51

A. Definition of countries with a protracted
crisis situation
The 2017 edition of this report defines protracted
crisis situations as “characterized by recurrent
natural disasters and/ or conf lict, longevit y
of food crises, breakdown of livelihoods and
insufficient institutional capacit y to react
to the crises.” There are three criteria used
to define a countr y with a protracted crisis:
(i) longevit y of the crisis; (ii) humanitarian
aid f low to the countr y; and (iii) the countr y’s
economic and food securit y status. Specifically,
the list of countries with a protracted crisis
situation includes those that meet the following
three criteria:

In 2020, there are 22 countries that meet the
above three criteria (see Box 13), but information
on cost and affordabilit y is not available for
seven of them (Afghanistan, Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Somalia,
South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen).
See the 2017 edition 52 of this report for an
extended analysis of countries with a protracted
crisis situation.

B. Definition of countries in the Global South
According to the United Nation Office for
South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC), the Global
South includes Asia (with the exception of
Hong Kong, SA R, Japan, Macau, SA R, Republic
of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, Province
of China), Central America, South America,
Mexico, Africa and the Middle East (with the
exception of Israel). 71

ANNEX 7
DESCRIPTION, DATA
AND METHODOLOGY
OF SECTION 2.2

Baseline food consumption is referred to as
the benchmark diet (BMK) and represents a
business-as-usual diet. Underlying the analysis,
there are estimates of current and future
food consumption as well as four alternative
consumption scenarios that have been devised
as being healthy and more sustainable.
Starting from food availabilit y estimates from
the FBS, the International Model for Policy
Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade
(IMPACT) 56 was used to simulate the benchmark
scenario as well as the four alternative healthy
diet patterns ba in 157 countries in year 2030. 57
Projections were also carried out for year 2050 for
sensitivit y analysis.

A. Description of the five dietary patterns
For the analysis of Section 2.2, five dietar y
patterns are constructed to measure health
and climate-change costs of baseline and
alternative dietar y consumption patterns.
For the baseline diet, food availabilit y estimates
in the year 2010 are taken from a harmonized
data set of FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) that
includes the full set of 16 food commodities.
Food availabilit y estimates are used as a prox y
for national average food consumption, after
applying regional data on food wastage at the
consumption level combined with conversion
factors into edible matter. 27 Food waste at other
stages of the production chain is accounted for in
the FAO estimates 53 including food processing,
which separates the edible parts from non-edible
ones. FAO food balance sheet data are
aggregated to 16 commodities (vegetables, beef,
wheat, roots, fruits, pork, rice, pulses, sugar,
poultr y, maize, other commodities, oils, eggs,
other grains and dair y) for 157 countries in order
to match the detail of data used in the health
and environmental analysis. 57

To construct the BMK, baseline food
consumption was estimated using food
availabilit y from FAO Food Balance Sheets and
adjusting for the amount of food wasted at the
point of consumption. An alternative option
would have been to rely on a set of consumption
estimates based on a variet y of data sources,
including dietar y sur veys, household budget
and expenditure sur veys, and food availabilit y
data. 3,4 However, neither the exact combination
of these data sources nor the estimation model
used to derive the data have been made publicly
available. For some individual countries,
using dietar y sur veys would also have been
an alternative. However, underreporting is a
persistent problem in dietar y sur veys, 58,59 and
regional differences in sur vey methods would
have implied non-comparabilit y of results
between countries. In contrast to dietar y sur veys,
waste-adjusted food-availabilit y estimates
indicate levels of energ y intake per region
that ref lect differences in the prevalence of
overweight and obesit y across regions.13

The analysis presented in Section 2.2 considers
current estimates of national average food
consumption in baseline year 2010, which are
projected to future food consumption referred
to year 2030, considering estimated expected
changes in income, population and dietar y
preferences. 55 Since models are calibrated to give
projections for future years in line with trends
in income and population, changing the baseline
year from 2010 to more recent years would have
not changed the projected results for 2030.

Benchmark (BMK)

Global energy intake is estimated for an average of 2 300 kcal per
person per day in year 2010; in year 2010, per-capita consumption
is of approximately 354 g of fruits and vegetables, 50 g for sugar,
28 g of oils, 68 g for red meat, 31 g for poultry, 243 g for eggs and
dairy, 134 g for roots and pulses, 297 for cereals (see Table A7.2 for
the composition of the BMK diet in year 2010).

Based on projections by the Food and

waste and food conversion into edible
parts.26

Flexitarian (FLX)

Max 860 kcal/day for energy balance from staple foods; min
125 g/day from legumes and nuts and seeds; min 500 g/day of
fruits and vegetables; max 31 g/day from sugar, max 87 g/day
from oil; max 43 g/day from poultry and lamb, max 13 g/day for
eggs, max 250 g/day for milk; min 28 g/day from fish.

In line with observed dietary
patterns.60,61

Pescatarian (PSC)

It is a variant of the flexitarian (FLX) diet where animal products are
completely replaced by fish products (see Table A7.2 for the difference
between the composition in g/day of the FLX and PSC diets at the
world level). This diet can also replace animal products with a mix of
fish products or legumes and either fruits and vegetables or whole
grains, but these variants are not considered in this report.

In line with observed dietary
patterns.60,61

Vegetarian (VGT)

Min six portions per day of fruits and vegetables (~660 g/day),
legumes (~95 g/day), no red meat or poultry or fish, sugar (~27 g/
day) and total energy intake as recommended for a moderately
active population (~2 100 kcal/day) (see Table A7.2 for the composition
of the VGT diet at the world level).

In line with observed dietary
patterns.61,62,63

Vegan (VGN)

Min seven portions per day of fruits and vegetables (~770 g/day),
legumes (~110 g/day), no red meat, poultry, dairy, eggs or fish;
sugar (~27 g/day) and total energy intake as recommended for a
moderately active population (~2 100) (see Table A7.2 for the
composition of the VGN diet at the world level).

The four alternative healthy diet patterns bb
that include sustainability considerations
(or diet scenarios) conform to the general
recommendations of the EAT-Lancet Commission
on healthy diets that differ by age and sex
and take into account regional preferences for
specific staple crops, fruits, vegetables and other
food categories, as well as population-specific
calorie requirement. These diets differ from the
EAT-Lancet diets presented in Annex 4 since
bb

they use countr y-specific kilocalorie intake that
ref lects population age and sex structure to
achieve an average global intake of 2 100 kcal per
person per day (Table A7.1). On the contrar y, the
EAT-Lancet diets in Annex 4 (Figure A4.1) are based
on the EAT-Lancet recommendations for an
exemplar y diet of 2 500 kcal per person per day. 42
Table A7.1 provides descriptions of the diet
scenarios and sources on which dietar y
recommendations are based for the analysis in

oil), and starchy foods which have a relatively
high glycemic index. Based on the f lexitarian
diets, we constructed more specialized diets. 60,61

full description of the methodolog y and data
sources, see Springmann (2020). 57
As previously estimated and used by the
EAT-Lancet Commission, 60 the average calorie
needs differ by countr y based on its age and
sex composition, ending up with a diet whose
world-level average provides 2 100 kcal per
person per day. Table A7.2 provides information
at the world level on the average quantities
(grams per day), and on average kilocalorie
intake (kcal per day) for each food item across
the five diets in year 2010. By taking the average
of the kilocalorie intake across the five diets, a
global average of 2 100 kcal per person per day
is reached. It should be noted that, however,
kilocalorie requirements per person per day
differ by countr y and by age and sex group, and
Table A7.2 provides only a summar y at the world
level. For the calculations of calorie intakes,
which require estimates of healthy body weights
(or BMIs), physical activit y levels and heights
as inputs, it was assumed that BMIs are in line
with W HO recommendations, 64 and moderately
physical activit y levels are maintained as
recommended. In addition, the United States
characteristics for height were used, 65 which can
be seen as an upper bound that does not penalize
future growth of populations. According to the
estimates, calorie needs reach a maximum of
2 500 kcal/day for ages 20 –24 (average between
men and women) but are reduced to 2 000 kcal
for ages 65 and older. Health and environmental
criteria captured in the healthy diets are based
on scientific evidence from a list of systematic
reviews, meta-analyses and pooled analyses of
primar y data used to set the scientific targets for
healthy diets. 57

The pescatarian diet (PSC) replaces (on a
kcal basis) meat-based protein sources in the
f lexitarian diet by three quarters with fish and
seafood, and by one quarter with either fruits and
vegetables or whole grains.
The vegetarian diet (VEG) replaces (on a
kcal basis) meat-based protein sources in
the f lexitarian diet by three quarters with
plant-based proteins, and by one quarter with
either fruits and vegetables or whole grains.
The vegan diet (VGN) replaces (on a kcal
basis) all animal-based protein sources in
the f lexitarian diet by three quarters with
plant-based proteins, and by one quarter with
either fruits and vegetables or whole grains.
The range of dietar y patterns described above
and developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission
are adopted to analyse to what extent the
health and environmental costs of diets can be
reduced. The baseline year of analysis is 2010,
but the focus is on health and climate-change
burden in year 2030, as this is a politically
relevant year in light of the Sustainable
Development Goals for 2030. Therefore, future
dietar y patterns and their impacts on health
and environment are projected using years 2030
and 2050, the latter being used for sensitivit y
analysis. Health and climate-change costs
are evaluated for the benchmark diet (BMK)
that approximates current and future food
consumption, and for four healthy dietar y
profiles: f lexitarian (FLX), pescatarian (PSC),
vegetarian ( V EG) and vegan ( VGN). For a

set is based on detailed cost-of-illness estimates
for cardiovascular diseases and cancer across
the European Union, which were transferred to
other non-European countries bc by scaling the
base values by the ratio of health expenditure
per capita for direct costs and by the ratio
of GDP per capita (adjusted for PPP) for
indirect costs.

exposure. For this analysis, we used as minimal
risk exposure that dietar y pattern out of the
set of healthy dietar y patterns that include
sustainabilit y considerations that was associated
with the greatest health benefits,
i.e. the vegan pattern.
To analyse the implications of dietar y change
for chronic disease mortalit y, mortalit y
attributable to seven dietar y risk factors and
four disease endpoints was computed by
calculating population impact fractions, i.e.
the proportion of cases of disease that are
avoided when the risk exposure is changed
from a baseline (benchmark current diet) to the
four alternative diet scenarios. The assessment
included four disease endpoints: coronar y
heart disease, stroke, t ype 2 diabetes mellitus
and cancer (in aggregate and as site-specific
ones, such as colon and rectum cancer), in
line with available cost-of-illness estimates.
The risk factors included seven dietar y risks:
low intake of fruits, vegetables, leg umes, nuts
and whole grains, as well as high intake of
red meat and processed meat. The risk factors
included also three weight-related risks: being
underweight, overweight or obese. The relative
risk estimates that relate the risk factors to
the disease endpoints were adopted from
meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies.

C. Data and methodology for the valuation
of climate-change impacts
For estimating the climate-change costs of
diets, we first calculated the GHG emissions
associated with food consumption and then
paired those with cost estimates of climate
damages. For the former, we adopted a set
of emissions factors derived from life-cycle
assessments, including a global life cycle
assessment with regional detail covering
livestock products that was undertaken by
FAO and a comprehensive meta-analysis of
life cycle assessments of other food products.
The assessments included all main emissions
(carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) and
sources along the food supply chain from
the farm gate to the retail point, including
production, processing, transport (including
international trade) and, for livestock products,
land use and feed production.
To measure climate-change impact in future
years, we accounted for improvements in
the emissions intensities of foods over time
by incorporating the mitigation potential of
bottom-up changes in management practices
and technologies from marginal abatement
cost cur ves. Improvements in the emissions
intensities of foods over time are accounted for
by incorporating the mitigation potential of
bottom-up changes in management practices
and technologies from marginal abatement
cost cur ves, in line with previous assessment.
The mitigation options include changes in
irrigation, cropping and fertilization that

Data from the Global Dietar y Database 66 were
used to allocate total red meat consumption
into unprocessed red meat and processed red
meat, and to allocate total grain consumption
into whole grains and processed grains.
For estimating the health costs of diets, the
estimates of cause-specific attributable deaths
obtained from the comparative risk assessment
were paired with cost-of-illness estimates.
The latter capture both the direct and indirect
costs associated with treating a specific disease,
including medical and healthcare costs (direct),
and costs of informal care and from lost working
days (indirect).

bc Extrapolating direct medical costs from European countries to low- and
low-middle-income countries could result in an overestimate, as low- and
low-middle-income countries, in general, would not have access to the level
of medical care for NCDs and cancers as in Europe.

For calculations, a global set of countr y-specific
cost-of-illness estimates developed by
Springmann et al. (2016) 54 was used. The data

reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions
for rice and other crops, as well as changes
in manure management, feed conversion and
feed additives that reduce enteric fermentation
in livestock. In line with commitments
made as part of the SDGs, we also include a
halving of food loss and waste by 2030 in our
development pathway.

To contextualize the health and climate-change
costs estimated in Section 2.2, it is useful to
compare the “hidden” health and environmental
costs with the wholesale cost of the diets,
estimated at the consumption level and valued
based on estimates of commodit y prices by
countr y. Wholesale cost are a prox y for the cost
of diets assessed at the consumption level when
hidden costs are not included.

For monetizing GHG emissions, estimates
of the social cost of carbon (SCC) were used,
which represents the economic cost caused
by an additional tonne of GHG emissions.
Estimates were used from a fully revised
version of the Dynamic Integrated model
of Climate and the Economy (DICE) for a
scenario that constrains future temperature
rise to 2.5 degrees (with the temperature limit
averaged over 100 years), in line with stated
policy goals (the “Dice 2016 T2.5” scenario).
The SCC values in this scenario were USD/
tCO 2-eq 107, 204 and 543 for the years 2015,
2030 and 2050, respectively. Although the
quantification of GHG emissions in Section 2.2
is based on the “Dice 2016 T2.5” scenario, Figure
A8.3 shows the social cost of GHG emissions in
year 2030 under alternative climate scenarios.

Regional commodit y prices were determined
by market-clearing, i.e. at the equilibrium
price where the quantit y demanded for each
commodit y is equal to the quantit y supplied.
Prices were adjusted for trade policies and
costs, producer and consumer support measures
in national markets, and supply and demand
relationships. Countr y- and commodit y-specific
wholesale prices estimated in this way do not
include additional mark-ups at the processing
and retail levels and are not directly comparable
to the consumer prices used in Section 2.1 on
the cost and affordabilit y of diets. However, they
are a useful prox y for quantif ying the cost
externalities of the food system in relationship to
the basic cost of diets.

(2.4 percent). The remaining 32 percent of
the avoided deaths were due to imbalanced
weight levels, including under weight
(0.5 percent), over weight (2.3 percent) and
obesit y (4.8 percent) (see Annex 8, Table A8.1,
last column).
Note that while, on average, 16.5 percent of
avoided deaths were related to the combination
of all dietar y risk factors, this percentage is
smaller than the sum of individual percentages
by food group, since it accounts for co-exposure
of risks. It means that people can be exposed to
multiple dietar y risk factors, but each recorded
death must be allocated to one risk factor only,
so that there is no overlap between risks and
deaths. On the contrar y, the combination of all
weight-related risk factors (7.7 percent) is exactly
equal to the sum of individual percentages
related to underweight, overweight and obesit y,
since these risk factors are mutually exclusive,
i.e. each death is exclusively allocated to one
risk factor only. Furthermore, it should be noted
that weight-related factors in Table A8.1 show the
same values across four alternative healthy diet
patterns, indicating that all these diets are based
on optimal energ y intake and, therefore, there
are no risks associated with imbalanced weight.

A. Additional figures on hidden health costs
Figure 32 shows the number of deaths
avoided in year 2030 when mov  from the
benchmark diet to the four alternative healthy
diet patterns bd that include sustainabilit y
considerations. Furthermore, it is important
to see the contribution of weight-related
(obesit y, over weight and under weight) and
diet-related (by food g roup) risk factors
to the total avoided deaths. Table A8.1 shows
imbalance in the consumption of food g roups
(diet-related risk factors) and imbalances in
weight levels (weight-related risk factors)
associated to deaths that could be avoided in
2030 by mov  from the benchmark scenario
to the adoption of the four alternative healthy
diet patterns. On average, 16.5 percent of
avoided deaths in 2030 are due to diet-related
risk factors, and 7.7 percent to weight-related
risk factors. The remaining percent of deaths
are attributed to non-dietar y risks that are
not accounted for in this analysis. 67 This
differentiation by risk factor shows that the
majorit y of avoidable deaths, on average
68 percent, were due to imbalances in dietar y
composition, as opposed to weight-related
risk factors. These imbalances included
too-low average consumption of whole g rains
(6.7 percent), fruits (2.2 percent), vegetables
(2.4 percent), leg umes (2.5 percent), nuts
(2 percent), and too-high consumption of
red meat (2.4 percent) and processed meat
bd

Figure A8.1 shows health costs (direct and indirect)
at the global level and across countr y income
groups in 2030 (USD billion), if current food
consumption patterns continue (benchmark
diet). Direct costs include direct medical and
healthcare costs and indirect costs refer to
loss of productivit y per working days and the
costs of informal care associated with each
specific disease.

GLOSSARY

the qualit y and quantit y of food consumption for
an active and healthy life.

Acute food insecurity

Diet quality

Food insecurit y found in a specified area at
a specific point in time and of a severit y that
threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless
of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance
in providing strategic g uidance to actions that
focus on short-term objectives to prevent,
mitigate or decrease severe food insecurit y that
threatens lives or livelihoods.

Is comprised of four key aspects: variet y
and/or diversit y (within and across food groups),
adequacy (sufficiency of nutrients or food groups
compared to requirements), moderation (foods
and nutrients that should be consumed with
restraint), and overall balance (composition of
macronutrient intake). Exposure to food safet y
hazards is another important qualit y aspect.

Affordability

Dietary diversity

Refers to the abilit y of people to buy foods in
their local environment. In this report, it refers
to the abilit y to buy the least cost version of the
three diets presented in Section 2.1: the energ y
sufficient, the nutrient adequate, and the healthy
diet. Affordabilit y is determined in three ways: i)
by comparing the cost of the three diets with the
international povert y line set at USD 1.90 PPP
per capita per day; ii) by comparing the cost of
the three diets with countr y-specific average food
expenditure; iii) by computing the percentage and
number of people in each countr y who are not
able to afford the three diets.

A measure of the variet y of food from different
food groups consumed over a reference period.

Dietary energy intake
Energ y content of food and beverages consumed.

Dietary energy requirements

All t ypes of meat, poultr y, fish, eggs, milk,
cheese and yoghurt and other dair y products.

The amount of dietar y energ y required by an
individual to maintain body functions, health
and normal activit y. Dietar y energ y requirements
are dependent upon age, sex, body size and level
of physical activit y. Additional energ y is required
to support optimal growth and development in
children and in women during pregnancy, and
for milk production during lactation, consistent
with the good health of mother and child.

Anthropometry

Dietary energy supply (DES)

Use of human body measurements to obtain
information about nutritional status.

Food available for human consumption, expressed
in kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/
day). At the country level, it is calculated as the
food remaining for human use after deduction of
all non-food utilizations (i.e. food = production +
imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial
use − animal feed – seed – wastage − additions to
stock). Wastage includes loss of usable products
occurring along distribution chains from farm gate
(or port of import) up to retail level.

Animal source foods

Chronic food insecurity
Food insecurit y that persists over time
mainly due to structural causes. Can include
seasonal food insecurit y found in periods with
non-exceptional conditions. Has relevance in
providing strategic g uidance to actions that focus
on the medium- and long-term improvement of
| 253 |

ANNEX 9

Double-duty actions

or not households and individuals have sufficient
access to that food.

Double-dut y actions include inter ventions,
programmes and policies that have the potential
to simultaneously reduce the risk or burden of
both undernutrition (including wasting, stunting
and micronutrient deficiency or insufficiency)
and overweight, obesit y or diet-related NCDs
(including t ype 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and some cancers). Double-dut y actions
leverage the coexistence of multiple forms of
malnutrition and their shared drivers to offer
integrated solutions.

c. Utilization – If food is available and households
have adequate access to it, the next question
is whether or not households are maximizing
the consumption of adequate nutrition and
energ y. Sufficient energ y and nutrient intake
by individuals is the result of good care and
feeding practices, food preparation, dietar y
diversit y and intra-household distribution of
food. Combined with good biological utilization
of food consumed, this determines the nutritional
status of individuals.

Energy-dense foods of minimal nutritional value
Food with a high content of calories (energ y)
with respect to its mass or volume

d. Stabilit y – If the dimensions of availabilit y,
access and utilization are sufficiently met,
stabilit y is the condition in which the whole
system is stable, thus ensuring that households
are food secure at all times. Stabilit y issues
can refer to short-term instabilit y (which can
lead to acute food insecurit y) or medium- to
long-term instabilit y (which can lead to chronic
food insecurit y). Climatic, economic, social and
political factors can all be a source of instabilit y.

Flesh foods
Are meat, fish, poultr y and liver/organ meats.

Food Insecurity Experience Scale
An experience-based food securit y scale used to
produce a measure of access to food at different
levels of severit y that can be compared across
contexts. It relies on data obtained by asking
people, directly in sur veys, about the occurrence
of conditions and behaviours that are known to
ref lect constrained access to food.

Food systems
The entire range of actors and their interlinked
value-adding activities involved in the
production, aggregation, processing, distribution,
consumption and disposal of food products.
Food systems comprise all food products that
originate from crop and livestock production,
forestr y, fisheries and aquaculture, as well as
the broader economic, societal and natural
environments in which these diverse production
systems are embedded.

Food security
A situation that exists when all people, at all
times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets
their dietar y needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life. Based on this definition,
four food securit y dimensions can be identified:
food availabilit y, economic and physical access to
food, food utilization, and stabilit y over time.

Healthcare

Food security dimensions

The organized provision of medical care to
individuals or a communit y. This includes
ser vices provided to individuals or communities
by health ser vice providers for the purpose
of promoting, maintaining, monitoring or
restoring health.

Refers to the four dimensions of food securit y:
a. Availabilit y – This dimension addresses
whether or not food is actually or potentially
physically present, including aspects of
production, food reser ves, markets and
transportation, and wild foods.

Healthy diet
A balanced, diverse and appropriate selection of
foods eaten over a period of time. A healthy diet
protects against malnutrition in all its forms, as

b. Access – If food is actually or potentially
physically present, the next question is whether

of macronutrients and/or micronutrients.
Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child
stunting and wasting and vitamin and mineral
deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesit y.

well as NCDs, and ensures that the needs for
macronutrients (proteins, fats and carbohydrates
including dietary fibres) and essential
micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and trace
elements) are met specific to the person’s gender,
age, physical activity level and physiological state.
For diets to be healthy: 1) daily needs of energy,
vitamins and minerals should be met, but energy
intake should not exceed needs; 2) consumption of
fruits and vegetables is at least 400 g per day;
3) intake of fats is less than 30 percent of total
energy intake, with a shift in fat consumption away
from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and the
elimination of industrial trans fats; 4) intake of free
sugars is less than 10 percent of total energy intake
or, preferably, less than 5 percent; 5) intake of salt is
less than 5 g per day. A healthy diet for infants and
young children is similar to that for adults, but the
following elements are also important: 1) infants
should be breastfed exclusively during the first
6 months of life; 2) infants should be breastfed
continuously until 2 years of age and beyond;
3) from 6 months of age, breast milk should be
complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and
nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be
added to complementary foods.

Micronutrients
Include vitamins and minerals and are required
in ver y small (micro) but specific amounts.
Vitamins and minerals in foods are necessar y
for the body to grow, develop and function
properly and they are essential for our health
and well-being. Our bodies require a number of
different vitamins and minerals, each of which
has a specific function in the body and must be
supplied in different, sufficient amounts.

Moderate food insecurity
The level of severit y of food insecurit y, based on
the Food Insecurit y Experience Scale, at which
people face uncertainties about their abilit y to
obtain food and have been forced to reduce,
at times during the year, the qualit y and/or
quantit y of food they consume due to lack of
money or other resources. It thus refers to a lack
of consistent access to food, which diminishes
dietar y qualit y, disrupts normal eating patterns,
and can have negative consequences for nutrition,
health and well-being.

Hunger
Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical
sensation caused by insufficient consumption of
dietar y energ y. In this report, the term hunger is
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.

Multiple burden of malnutrition
The coexistence of forms of undernutrition
(child stunting and wasting and vitamin and
mineral deficiencies) with overweight and obesit y
in the same countr y, communit y, household
or individual.

Macronutrients
Are needed in larger quantities (in gram range)
and are the major source of energ y and bulk
(volume) in our diets. They include carbohydrates,
protein and fats. They are the only nutrients that
contain energ y from food, which is measured in
calories. Getting sufficient energ y is essential for
ever yone in order to maintain body growth and
development and good health. Carbohydrates,
protein and fats, in addition to providing energ y,
each have ver y specific functions in the body and
must be supplied in sufficient amounts to carr y
out those functions.

Nutrition security
A situation that exists when secure access to
an appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with
a sanitar y environment and adequate health
ser vices and care, in order to ensure a healthy
and active life for all household members.
Nutrition securit y differs from food securit y in
that it also considers the aspects of adequate
caregiving practices, health and hygiene, in
addition to dietar y adequacy.

Malnutrition

Nutrition-sensitive intervention

An abnormal physiological condition caused by
inadequate, unbalanced or excessive consumption

An action designed to address the underlying
determinants of nutrition (which include
| 255 |

ANNEX 9

household food securit y, care for mothers and
children, and primar y healthcare and sanitation)
but not necessarily having nutrition as the
predominant goal.

Plant-forward strategies

Nutrition transition

Predominantly staple-based diets

As incomes rise and populations become more
urban, diets high in complex carbohydrates and
fiber give way to more energ y-dense diets high
in fats, sugars and/or salt. These global dietar y
trends are accompanied by a demographic
transition that is a shift toward increased life
expectancy and reduced fertilit y rates. At the
same time, disease patterns move away from
infectious and nutrient-deficiency diseases
towards higher rates of childhood obesit y,
coronar y heart disease, and some t ypes
of cancer.

Diets where one or more staple foods supply a
disproportionately large share of energ y and are
low in dietar y diversit y.

Nutritional status

The level of severit y of food insecurit y at which
people have likely run out of food, experienced
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for
days without eating, putting their health and
well-being at grave risk, based on the Food
Insecurit y Experience Scale.

Promoting diets where whole grains, fruits,
vegetables, nuts and leg umes comprise a greater
proportion of foods consumed.

Prevalence of undernourishment
An estimate of the proportion of the population
that lacks enough dietar y energ y for a healthy,
active life. It is FAO’s traditional indicator used
to monitor hunger at the global and regional
level, as well as Sustainable Development Goal
Indicator 2.1.1.

Severe food insecurity

The physiological state of an individual that
results from the relationship between nutrient
intake and requirements and the body’s abilit y to
digest, absorb and use these nutrients.

Nutritious foods
Are those foods that tend to be high in essential
nutrients such as vitamins and minerals
(micronutrients), as well as proteins, unrefined
fibre-rich carbohydrates, and/or unsaturated fats
and are low in sodium, free sugars, saturated fats
and trans fats.

Staple food

Overweight and obesity

Low height-for-age, ref lecting a past episode or
episodes of sustained undernutrition. In children
under five years of age, stunting is defined
height-for-age less than -2 standard deviations
below the W HO Child Growth Standards median.

A staple food is one that is eaten reg ularly and in
such quantities as to constitute the dominant part
of the diet and supply a major proportion of the
total energ y.

Stunting

Body weight that is above normal for height
as a result of an excessive accumulation
of fat. It is usually a manifestation of
expending less energ y than is consumed.
In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI
of 25 kg/m 2 or more, and obesit y as a BMI
of 30 kg/m 2 or more. In children under
five years of age, overweight is defined
as weight-for-height greater than 2
standard deviations above the W HO Child
Growth Standards median, and obesit y as
weight-for-height greater than 3 standard
deviations above the W HO Child Growth
Standards median.

Undernourishment
Undernourishment is defined as the condition in
which an individual’s habitual food consumption
is insufficient to provide the amount of dietar y
energ y required to maintain a normal, active,
healthy life. For the purposes of this report,
hunger is defined as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment.

| 256 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2020

Undernutrition

Wasting

The outcome of poor nutritional intake in
terms of quantit y and/or qualit y, and/or poor
absorption and/or poor biological use of nutrients
consumed as a result of repeated instances of
disease. It includes being underweight for one’s
age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously
thin for one’s height (suffering from wasting)
and deficient in vitamins and minerals
(micronutrient deficiency).

Low weight-for-height, generally the result
of weight loss associated with a recent period
of inadequate dietar y energ y intake and/or
disease. In children under five years of age,
wasting is defined as weight-for-height less
than -2 standard deviations below the W HO
Child Growth Standards median.

2020
THE STATE OF

FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
IN THE WORLD
TRANSFORMING FOOD SYSTEMS
FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS

Updates for many countries have made it possible to estimate hunger in the world with greater
accuracy this year. In particular, newly accessible data enabled the revision of the entire series of
undernourishment estimates for China back to 2000, resulting in a substantial downward shift of
the series of the number of undernourished in the world. Nevertheless, the revision confirms the
trend reported in past editions: the number of people affected by hunger globally has been slowly
on the rise since 2014. The report also shows that the burden of malnutrition in all its forms
continues to be a challenge. There has been some progress for child stunting, low birthweight and
exclusive breastfeeding, but at a pace that is still too slow. Childhood overweight is not improving
and adult obesity is on the rise in all regions.
The report complements the usual assessment of food security and nutrition with projections of
what the world may look like in 2030, if trends of the last decade continue. Projections show that
the world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030 and, despite some progress, most
indicators are also not on track to meet global nutrition targets. The food security and nutritional
status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the health and
socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report puts a spotlight on diet quality as a critical link between food security and nutrition.
Meeting SDG 2 targets will only be possible if people have enough food to eat and if what they
are eating is nutritious and affordable. The report also introduces new analysis of the cost and
affordability of healthy diets around the world, by region and in different development contexts.
It presents valuations of the health and climate-change costs associated with current food
consumption patterns, as well as the potential cost savings if food consumption patterns were to
shift towards healthy diets that include sustainability considerations. The report then concludes with
a discussion of the policies and strategies to transform food systems to ensure affordable healthy
diets, as part of the required efforts to end both hunger and all forms of malnutrition.
