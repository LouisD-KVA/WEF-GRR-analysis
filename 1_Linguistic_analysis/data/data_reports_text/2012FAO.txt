The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient
to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition
The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012 presents new estimates of
undernourishment based on a revised and improved methodology. The new
estimates show that progress in reducing hunger during the past 20 years has
been better than previously believed, and that, given renewed efforts, it may be
possible to reach the MDG hunger target at the global level by 2015. However, the
number of people suffering from chronic undernourishment is still unacceptably
high, and eradication of hunger remains a major global challenge.
This year’s report also discusses the role of economic growth in reducing
undernourishment. Economic growth is most effective in reducing poverty and
hunger when it increases employment and income-earning opportunities that the
poor can take advantage of. Sustainable agricultural growth is often effective in
reaching the poor because most of the poor and hungry live in rural areas and
depend on agriculture for a significant part of their livelihoods. However, growth
will not necessarily result in better nutrition for all. Policies and programmes that
will ensure “nutrition-sensitive” growth include supporting increased dietary
diversity, improving access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health services
and educating consumers regarding adequate nutrition and child care practices.
Economic growth takes time to reach the poor, and may not reach the poorest of
the poor. Therefore, social protection is crucial for eliminating hunger as rapidly as
possible. Furthermore, when properly structured, social protection also promotes
economic growth by building human capital and helping farmers manage risk so
that they can adopt improved technologies. Finally, rapid progress in reducing
hunger requires government action to provide key public goods and services within
a governance system based on transparency, participation, accountability, rule of
law and human rights.

NOTES for Annex 1

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012 presents
new estimates of the number and proportion of
undernourished people going back to 1990, defined in
terms of the distribution of dietary energy supply. With
almost 870 million people chronically undernourished in
2010–12, the number of hungry people in the world
remains unacceptably high. The vast majority live in
developing countries, where about 850 million people,
or slightly fewer than 15 percent of the population,
are estimated to be undernourished.

Economic and agricultural growth should be
“nutrition-sensitive”. Growth needs to result in better
nutritional outcomes through enhanced opportunities for
the poor to diversify their diets; improved access to safe
drinking water and sanitation; improved access to health
services; better consumer awareness regarding adequate
nutrition and child care practices; and targeted
distribution of supplements in situations of acute
micronutrient deficiencies. Good nutrition, in turn, is key
to sustainable economic growth.

Improved undernourishment estimates, from 1990,
suggest that progress in reducing hunger has been more
pronounced than previously believed.

Social protection is crucial for accelerating hunger
reduction. First, it can protect the most vulnerable who
have not benefited from economic growth. Second, social
protection, properly structured, can contribute directly to
more rapid economic growth through human resource
development and strengthened ability of the poor,
especially smallholders, to manage risks and adopt
improved technologies with higher productivity.

Most of the progress, however, was achieved before
2007–08. Since then, global progress in reducing hunger
has slowed and levelled off.
The revised results imply that the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the
prevalence of undernourishment in the developing world
by 2015 is within reach, if appropriate actions are taken
to reverse the slowdown since 2007–08.
Despite significant improvements this year to the FAO
methodology for estimating undernourishment, further
improvements and better data are needed to capture the
effects of food price and other economic shocks.
Therefore, the undernourishment estimates do not fully
reflect the effects on hunger of the 2007–08 price spikes
or the economic slowdown experienced by some
countries since 2009, let alone the recent price increases.
Other indicators are also needed to provide a more
holistic assessment of undernourishment and food
security.
In order for economic growth to enhance the nutrition of
the neediest, the poor must participate in the growth
process and its benefits: (i) Growth needs to involve
and reach the poor; (ii) the poor need to use the
additional income for improving the quantity and quality
of their diets and for improved health services; and
(iii) governments need to use additional public resources
for public goods and services to benefit the poor and
hungry.
Agricultural growth is particularly effective in reducing
hunger and malnutrition. Most of the extreme poor
depend on agriculture and related activities for a
significant part of their livelihoods. Agricultural growth
involving smallholders, especially women, will be most
effective in reducing extreme poverty and hunger when it
increases returns to labour and generates employment
for the poor.

To accelerate hunger reduction, economic growth needs
to be accompanied by purposeful and decisive public
action. Public policies and programmes must create a
conducive environment for pro-poor long-term economic
growth. Key elements of enabling environments include
provision of public goods and services for the
development of the productive sectors, equitable access
to resources by the poor, empowerment of women, and
design and implementation of social protection systems.
An improved governance system, based on transparency,
participation, accountability, rule of law and human
rights, is essential for the effectiveness of such policies
and programmes.

Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the
latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the United
Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of
undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to
changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of The State of
Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data published in
editions for different years.

Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between 1990 and
2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Indicator 1.9:
Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy
consumption (undernourishment). The results are obtained following a
harmonized methodology and are based on the latest globally
available data averaged over three years. Some countries may have
more recent data which, if used, could lead to different estimates of
the prevalence of undernourishment and consequently of the progress
achieved.
The latest report period refers to 2010–12 provisional estimates and
the baseline refers to 1990–92. For countries that did not exist in the
baseline period, the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based
on 1993–95 and the number of undernourished is based on this
proportion applied to their 1990–92 population.

he 2012 edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World focuses on the importance of
economic growth in overcoming poverty, hunger and malnutrition. We are pleased to note that
many, though not all, developing countries have enjoyed remarkable rates of growth during
recent decades. High growth rates of GDP per capita are a key factor in reducing food insecurity and
malnutrition. However, economic growth per se does not guarantee success. As Jean Dreze and Amartya
Sen stated recently, it “requires active public policies to ensure that the fruits of economic growth are
widely shared, and also requires – and this is very important – making good use of the public revenue
generated by fast economic growth for social services, especially for public healthcare and public
education.”1 We fully agree.
There are still too many circumstances in which the poor do not sufficiently benefit from economic
growth. This may happen because growth originates in sectors that do not generate sufficient
employment for the poor, or because they lack secure and fair access to productive assets, in particular
land, water and credit. Or it may happen because the poor cannot immediately make use of the
opportunities provided by growth as a result of undernutrition, low levels of education, ill health, age
or social discrimination.
However, one lesson that we have learned from success stories coming from all developing regions
is that investment in agriculture, more so than investment in other sectors, can generate economic
growth that delivers large benefits to the poor, hungry and malnourished. We recognize, nonetheless,
that this is not universally true. With urbanization continuing in developing countries, future efforts to
address poverty and food insecurity will have to focus also on urban areas. However, agriculture is still
the dominant source of employment in the economies of many low-income countries, and the urban
poor spend most of their income on food. Moreover, for the foreseeable future, the majority of the
poor and hungry will continue to live in rural areas and depend directly or indirectly on investments in
rural infrastructure and smallholder-based agriculture to improve their livelihoods.
This edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World draws attention to the potential to invest in
smallholder-centred agricultural growth. In recognition of the dual need to protect the environment
and reduce hunger, poverty and malnutrition, we call on all stakeholders to promote practical solutions
that aim to promote sustainable intensification of food production systems, ensure a strong
involvement of smallholder farmers and other rural poor, and preserve natural resources – including by
minimizing post-harvest losses and waste throughout the food chain. Higher prices of agricultural
commodities provide positive incentives for increased investment in agriculture. However, better policy
responses and improved governance are needed to ensure sustainability and to address the effects of
increased price volatility and of higher costs of the food basket for the poor, most of whom are net
food buyers.
This report provides convincing evidence that poor, hungry and malnourished people use some of
their additional income either to produce or purchase more food, aiming to increase their dietary
energy intake and to diversify their diets. Against this background, we are glad to note significant
improvements in food security and nutrition outcomes worldwide. The trend in the prevalence of
undernourishment has been declining, and we have seen some progress in key anthropometric
indicators of child underweight, stunting and nutrition-related child mortality. There has also been
progress in overcoming some types of micronutrient deficiencies or “hidden hunger” in a number of
countries. These encouraging developments are made possible by the combined effects of increased
attention to world hunger, overall economic and agricultural growth, and targeted policy interventions.
Nevertheless, as is also documented in this report, 868 million people continue to suffer from
undernourishment, and the negative health consequences of micronutrient deficiencies continue to
affect around 2 billion people. In today’s world of unprecedented technical and economic
opportunities, we find it entirely unacceptable that more than 100 million children under the age of
five are underweight, and therefore unable to realize their full socio-economic and human potential,
and that childhood malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 2.5 million children every year.
Hunger and malnutrition can be a significant obstacle to economic growth.
We are concerned that most rural people do not enjoy decent working conditions or adequate and
effective social protection. We call on national governments to use the additional public resources

generated by economic growth, inter alia, to build comprehensive social protection systems to support
those who cannot help themselves in their efforts to secure adequate nutrition. This report devotes a
section to recent experience of social protection as a foundation for both agricultural growth and food
security. Such approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality,
enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty.
While The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012 recognizes the potential of economic growth
to accelerate reductions in hunger, poverty and malnutrition, it also draws attention to the association
of globalization and economic growth with the trend towards overnutrition, even in low-income
countries. The societal transformations that have been observed in the process of economic growth,
modernization and urbanization, have led a growing number of people to adopt lifestyles and diets
that are conducive to overweight and related non-communicable diseases. The negative implications
for public health systems are already significant in many countries. Together with post-harvest losses,
excessive consumption and waste draw on scarce resources that could be used to improve the nutrition
of the poor and hungry while reducing the food system’s environmental footprint.
Working with national governments and the international community, our three organizations are
committed to developing better-integrated approaches to food security and nutrition and promoting
cooperation among all relevant stakeholders. In order to contribute to improving all dimensions of food
insecurity, policies, strategies and programmes must not only be “pro-poor,” they also must be
“nutrition-sensitive,” by promoting positive and sustainable interactions among all three key sectors
that need to be involved: agriculture, nutrition and health.
In view of the importance of economic growth for today’s low-income countries, we note with
particular concern that the recovery of the world economy from the recent global financial crisis
remains fragile. We nonetheless appeal to the international community to make extra efforts to assist
the poorest in realizing their basic human right to adequate food. The world has the knowledge and
the means to eliminate all forms of food insecurity and malnutrition. We therefore consider no
ambition in achieving this aim too high, and warmly welcome the recent “Zero Hunger Challenge”
announced by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012
presents new estimates of the number and
proportion of undernourished people going
back to 1990, defined in terms of the
distribution of dietary energy supply. With
almost 870 million people chronically
undernourished in 2010–12, the number of
hungry people in the world remains
unacceptably high. The vast majority live in
developing countries, where about 850 million
people, or slightly fewer than 15 per cent of the
population, are estimated to be undernourished.
Improved undernourishment estimates, from 1990,
suggest that progress in reducing hunger has been
more pronounced than previously believed.
Most of the progress, however, was achieved
before 2007–08. Since then, global progress in
reducing hunger has slowed and levelled off.
The revised results imply that the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the
prevalence of undernourishment in the
developing world by 2015 is within reach, if
appropriate actions are taken to reverse the
slowdown since 2007–08.
Despite significant improvements this year to
the FAO methodology for estimating
undernourishment, further improvements and
better data are needed to capture the effects of
food price and other economic shocks. Therefore,
the undernourishment estimates do not fully reflect
the effects on hunger of the 2007–08 price spikes or
the economic slowdown experienced by some
countries since 2009, let alone the recent price
increases. Other indicators are also needed to provide
a more holistic assessment of undernourishment and
food security.

represents 12.5 percent of the global population, or one in
eight people. The vast majority of these, 852 million, live in
developing countries, where the prevalence of
undernourishment is now estimated at 14.9 percent of the
population (Table 1).
The updated figures emerging as a result of improvements
in data and methodology indicate that the number of
undernourished people in the world is estimated to have
declined more steeply than previously estimated until 2007,
although the rate of decline has slowed thereafter (Figure 1). As
a result, the developing world as a whole is found to be much
closer to achieving the MDG target of reducing by half the
percentage of people suffering from chronic hunger by 2015.
The current assessment pegs the undernourishment estimate
for developing countries at slightly more than 23.2 percent of
the population in 1990–92 (substantially higher than previously
estimated), thus implying an MDG target of 11.6 percent for
2015. If the average annual decline of the past 20 years
continues to 2015, the prevalence of undernourishment in
developing countries would reach 12.5 percent, still above the
MDG target, but much closer to it than previously estimated.
Regionally, the rate of progress in the reduction of
undernourishment has been higher in Asia and the Pacific and
in Latin America and the Caribbean (Figure 2, page 10).
Considerable differences among regions and countries remain,
however, and some have moved even further away from their
MDG trajectory. A reduction in both the number and
proportion of undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific has
continued in recent years, meaning that the region is almost on
track for achieving its MDG hunger target. The same holds true
for Latin America and the Caribbean. South-Eastern Asia has
shown the most rapid reduction (from 29.6 to 10.9 percent),
followed by Eastern Asia and Latin America (Figure 3, page
10). Undernourishment in sub-Saharan Africa has improved,
but less rapidly, while Western Asia has seen an increase in the
prevalence of undernourishment over this period.

Undernourishment around the world in 2012

Different rates of progress have led to significant changes in
the distribution of the undernourished in the world between
1990–92 and 2010–12 (Figure 4, page 11). The share of the
world’s undernourished people has declined most rapidly in
South-Eastern Asia and Eastern Asia (from 13.4 to 7.5 percent
and from 26.1 to 19.2 percent, respectively), while declining
from 6.5 to 5.6 percent in Latin America. Meanwhile, the share
has increased from 32.7 to 35.0 percent in Southern Asia,
from 17.0 to 27.0 percent in sub-Saharan Africa and from
1.3 to 2.9 percent in Western Asia and Northern Africa.
Trends in undernourishment presented in this report are
broadly consistent with those of other food security and
development indicators (Figure 5, page 11). Particularly interesting
in this context is the evolution of the new undernourishment
estimates in comparison with poverty and child mortality, which
suggests that undernourishment has evolved in line with global
and regional poverty estimates: for developing countries as a
whole, the prevalence of undernourishment has fallen from
23.2 to 14.9 percent over the period 1990–2010, while the
incidence of poverty has declined from 47.5 to 22.4 percent,
and that of child mortality from 9.5 to 6.1 percent.

The new estimates suggest that the increase in hunger
during 2007–10 – the period characterized by food price and
economic crises – was less severe than previously estimated.
There are several reasons for this. First, the methodology
estimates chronic undernourishment based on habitual
consumption of dietary energy and does not fully capture
the effects of price spikes, which are typically short-term. As
a result, the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator
should not be used to draw definitive conclusions about the
effects of price spikes or other short-term shocks. Second,
and most importantly, the transmission of economic shocks
to many developing countries was less pronounced than
initially thought. More recent GDP estimates suggest that the
“great recession” of 2008–09 resulted in only a mild
slowdown in GDP growth in many developing countries, and
increases in domestic staple food prices were very small in
China, India and Indonesia (the three largest developing
countries). Past estimates of undernourishment assumed that

developing countries and their most vulnerable populations
were much more exposed to the economic downturn.
Although the estimates of the prevalence of
undernourishment are lower than previous calculations, the
period 2007–10 is characterized by a significant slowdown
in progress towards lower hunger rates, bringing hunger

reduction essentially to a halt for the developing countries
as a whole. Again, the overall picture masks very different
trends across regions and countries. In Western Asia, the
prevalence of undernourishment was increasing before
2007 and continued its upward trend. In sub-Saharan
Africa, the modest progress achieved during 2002–05 was
reversed, with hunger rates rising by 2 percent per year
since 2007. Progress slowed in Latin America and the
Caribbean, from an average annual rate of reduction of
1.9 percent per year in 2002–05 to 0.9 percent in 2006–09.
Eastern Asia and South-Eastern Asia, by contrast, managed
to accelerate their hunger reduction rates. South-Eastern
Asia was able to speed up hunger reduction from
3.1 percent per year before 2007 to 4.6 percent afterwards,
while Eastern Asia improved the pace from 0.1 percent to
over 4 percent.
Behind these regional divergences stand markedly
different capacities to deal with economic shocks (such as
price increases and economic recessions), including vastly
different levels of vulnerability in the face of global recession
and differences in the ability to take advantage of higher
prices through increased supply response, depending on
market infrastructure, technology levels and natural resource
endowments. (Some indicative comparisons were presented
in the 2011 edition of this report.) Some countries in Asia
managed to mitigate international price pressure through
border measures and counter-cyclical measures to avert the
worst impacts of the recession. In those countries, domestic
rice prices rose only slightly. Many African countries, by
contrast, were fully exposed to both price hikes and the

BOX 1

Improvements in data and methodology

This year’s edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the
World presents new estimates of the number and
proportion of hungry people in the world going back to
1990, reflecting several key improvements in data and in
FAO’s methodology used to derive its prevalence of
undernourishment indicator (PoU). The new estimates
incorporate
• the latest revisions of world population data;
• new data from demographic, health and household
surveys that suggest revised minimum dietary energy
requirements, by country;
• new estimates of dietary energy supply, by country;
• country-specific estimates of food losses at the retail
distribution level; and
• technical improvements to the methodology.
(For more detail on these changes, see pages 13–14 and
the technical annex.)
Notwithstanding these improvements, it is important
to note several caveats. First, the PoU indicator is
defined solely in terms of dietary energy availability and
its distribution in the population and does not consider
other aspects of nutrition. Second, it uses the energy

global recession, with limited access to the means and
measures necessary to mitigate hardships for their
populations. All this suggests that additional regionally
focused efforts are required. These efforts should be led by
national governments and fully supported by the
international community.
The lesson to be learned from these diverse experiences is
that, even in cases where a sharp reduction in the total
amount of dietary energy consumed by the population as a
result of higher food prices cannot be detected, higher food
prices may nevertheless have had other negative impacts.
These may include a deterioration in dietary quality, as well
as reduced access to other basic needs such as health and
education. In response to income losses and/or higher food
prices, for example, poor consumers in many countries may
have had to compromise on the quality and diversity of the
food they consumed by reverting to cheaper and less
nutritious foods. Such impacts are difficult to quantify with
the information currently available in most countries, and
certainly cannot be captured by an indicator based only on
the adequacy of dietary energy.
Also, significant short-term hardships that many of the
poor may have endured when food prices spiked in the short
run, or when the economic recession left them without jobs
and livelihoods for months, will not be fully captured by an

12

T H E S T A T E O F F O O D I N S E C U R I T Y I N T H E W O R L D 2 0 12

requirements for minimum activity levels as a benchmark
for dietary energy adequacy, whereas many poor and
hungry people are likely to have livelihoods involving
arduous manual labour. And third, the current
methodology does not capture the impact of short-term
price and other economic shocks, unless these are
reflected in changes in long-term food consumption
patterns. These limitations are consistent with definitions
used previously, but they underline the need to consider
the PoU indicator as a conservative estimate of
undernourishment. Further improvements and a broader
set of indicators are necessary to reach a more holistic
understanding of undernourishment and food insecurity.
For example, alternative indicators could include those
using a higher minimum energy requirement threshold
corresponding to higher activity levels. These would
imply very different levels and trends in
undernourishment, as discussed further in the technical
annex.

indicator of chronic undernourishment based on annual
average consumption. The poorest of the poor were unlikely
to have had either food stocks or financial savings to draw
upon and, where public safety nets were unavailable or illfunctioning, they may have been exposed to severe shortterm food deprivation that would only be revealed if timely
and frequent assessments of acute food insecurity were
possible for representative samples of the population.
To summarize, the experience of recent years has
demonstrated that the consequences of food price rises and
other economic shocks are diverse and complex, involving
more than simply total dietary energy intake; they range
from a deterioration of dietary quality to possible cuts in
other types of consumption that are fundamental for
human development and growth in both the short and
longer term. Further improvements in the methodology,
better data and a wider suite of indicators are needed to
fully capture these effects. Although the data and
methodology used to derive the PoU indicator do not allow
estimation of the impact of short-term price spikes (and
dips), it is clear that progress in reducing the prevalence of
undernourishment has slowed considerably since 2007, and
many regions are unlikely to achieve the MDG hunger target
without early resumption of progress, requiring inclusive
economic recovery as well as food price stability.

Undernourishment around the world in 2012

Improvements in data and methodology
■■ Improving the prevalence of undernourishment
indicator
Over the past two years, FAO has overhauled the
methodology used to estimate its PoU indicator. The
proposed changes were noted in the 2011 edition of this
report and have been presented at various scientific fora,
including the National Academy of Sciences in Washington
DC in February 2011, a Round Table of the Committee on
World Food Security in Rome in September 2011, and the
International Scientific Symposium on Food and Nutrition
Security Information in Rome in January 2012.
These changes are wide-ranging and include a
comprehensive revision of food availability data (including
improved estimation of food losses), improved parameters
for dietary energy requirements, updated parameters for
food access and a new functional form for the distributions
used to estimate the prevalence of undernourishment.
Some of the changes pertain to regular data updates
carried out almost every year (population estimates, revision
of food availability data), while others are the outcome of
intensive efforts, aimed at substantially improving the
methodology currently used. Essentially, all the updates and
improvements were contingent upon the availability of new
data sources.
For the first time, sufficient data on food supply and
consumption are available to assess comprehensively and in
a methodologically consistent way trends in dietary energy
availability up to the current year. New food balance sheets
have been compiled, up to 2009, and food supply
projections have been made for the period 2010–12 that
reflect the most up-to-date evidence on food production,
trade and uses during recent years. In addition, household
survey data on food consumption for a number of countries
have enabled revisions to be made that estimate more
accurately the inequality of food access in many countries,
although these surveys cover different years (between 1995
and 2010) for different countries.
While data remain scarce, recent analyses indicate that
food losses and waste can be significant. Among the
methodological changes introduced thus far, accounting for
food losses at the retail level is the single most important
factor affecting the new hunger estimates, lifting them by
117 million in 2008 compared with the estimates reported in
the 2011 edition of this report. In the past, food losses
incurred at the retail level were not captured by the
methodology.

The new undernourishment estimates also incorporate
the effects of population data revisions. While these
revisions had little impact on global estimates, they have
been pronounced for certain countries and regions.
China’s population estimate for the 1990s, for example,
has been revised upwards by as much as 25 million
people, while Bangladesh’s population has been revised
downwards by about 11 percent (or 17 million people), all
the way back to 1990. Such changes in estimated
population size affect estimates of undernourishment in
two ways. First, they make the same amount of food
available to a different number of people, thus changing
the estimates of dietary energy supply for the average
consumer, which in turn alters the estimated prevalence
of undernourishment. Second, they change the total
number of people for which the prevalence level applies,
thus leading to a different number of undernourished
people.
All other data and methodological revisions result in a
reduction in the estimated number of undernourished
people in developing countries. These other revisions are
also larger in recent years than in 1990, which results in a
stronger decline in the prevalence of undernourishment
over time compared with the estimates published
previously. More detail on these changes and their impacts
on the prevalence of undernourishment are presented in
the technical annex.
Despite these enhancements, important data gaps and
data quality problems nevertheless remain. Key
improvements that are still needed include:
• A concerted effort to improve the quality of basic data
on food production, utilization, storage and trade. To
this end, FAO is leading the implementation of the
Global Strategy for the Improvement of Agricultural
Statistics to address the declining capacity of many
developing countries to produce basic statistics and to
address emerging data needs.
• A continuous effort to maintain an up-to-date
parameter base for undernourishment estimates, with
regular “health checks” of the parameters for food
requirements and access. Methodological and data
revisions are a normal feature of any statistical domain,
and are the result of ongoing efforts to constantly
improve the quality of available data.
In addition, further efforts are needed to more explicitly
incorporate the impacts of price and income shocks into
the analysis.

Undernourishment around the world in 2012

■■ … and moving towards a suite of food security
indicators
Notwithstanding improvements in data and methodology,
the PoU indicator alone is clearly not sufficient to provide a
comprehensive picture of the food security situation in every
country. For this reason, a preliminary set of more than 20
indicators, available for most countries and years, has been
identified, including measures of dietary energy supply, food
production, food prices, food expenditures, anthropometric
indicators and volatility. These indicators are presented in the
State of Food Insecurity in the World companion website
(www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/) to allow food security
analysts and policy makers to make a more comprehensive

assessment of the various dimensions and manifestations of
food insecurity, and thus inform policy for more effective
interventions and responses.
Plans are underway to expand and improve the indicator
base. To this end, FAO is launching an initiative to create an
“experience-based” food security indicator (similar to the
Latin American and Caribbean Food Insecurity Scale) for a
large number of countries, available on an annual basis. The
initiative is based on a global poll that will monitor food
insecurity based on short interviews. Such an indicator would
ensure timely monitoring of the difficulties that individuals
and households face in accessing food, thus providing a
direct basis for food security interventions.

Economic growth, hunger and malnutrition
Income growth and changes in food consumption
Key message
In order for economic growth to enhance the
nutrition of the neediest, the poor must
participate in the growth process and its
benefits: (i) Growth needs to involve and reach the
poor; (ii) the poor need to use the additional income
for improving the quantity and quality of their diets
and for improved health and sanitation services; and
(iii) governments need to use additional public
resources for public goods and services to benefit the
poor and hungry.

E

conomic growth in recent decades has provided
considerable scope for reducing hunger and
malnutrition. Between 1990 and 2010, real per
capita incomes grew by nearly 2 percent per year globally,
though with major differences among countries and
between decades. Growth rates for all groups of developing

countries were more rapid in the 2000s than in the 1990s,
with the most dramatic turnarounds taking place in subSaharan Africa and in Europe and Central Asia (developing
countries only for both groups; Figure 6). The most rapid
growth rates (by far) occurred in East Asia and the Pacific in
both periods. Growth rates for high-income countries slowed
in the 2000s.
In order for economic growth to enhance access to food
that is adequate in quantity (dietary energy) and in quality
(diversity, nutrient content and safety), three key steps are
required. First, growth needs to reach and involve the poor
and provide increased employment and income-earning
opportunities for the poor. Second, the poor need to use
their additional income for improving the quantity and
quality of their diet, water and sanitation as well as on
improved health services. (The role of women is crucial in
ensuring that these spending patterns are realized.) Third,
governments need to spend additional public revenues on
safety nets and key public goods and services such as
education, infrastructure and public health measures.

Before discussing these key steps in more detail, the
report will first review some broad trends in dietary
energy and nutrition during the past two decades.

■■ Trends in dietary energy supplies
The 2 percent per annum increases in real per capita
incomes between 1990 and 2010 resulted in increased
demand for dietary energy. On average, for the entire
world, dietary energy supplies (DES) increased by about
210 kcal per person per day, or 8 percent (Figure 7).
The increase was larger in the developing countries
(275 kcal/person/day) than in the developed countries
(86 kcal/person/day). Across developing country regions,
the largest absolute increases (260 to 270 kcal per day)
were in Asia (where economic growth was most rapid)
and Latin America and the Caribbean, while the
smallest increases (less than 130 kcal per day) were in
Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa (where economic
growth was slow). Figure 8 shows graphically how
demand for energy is greater at higher levels of income.
It also shows how the impact of additional income is
greater at lower levels of income (in which case the
slope of the line is steeper).

■■ Changes in food consumption patterns
The rise in available food energy has been accompanied by
changes in the composition of diets. Hence, the source of
DES shifts over time as incomes grow. Figure 9 illustrates
these changes at the regional level in terms of the shares of
major food groups in total dietary energy availability.
Worldwide, the shares of cereals, roots and tubers declined
significantly, whereas the shares of fruits and vegetables and
of animal products, including fish, increased.
Regionally, there are contrasts between regions with
rapid economic growth and regions that have grown less
rapidly. Per capita dietary energy from cereals, roots and
tubers declined in rapidly growing Asia, despite an increase
in total per capita dietary energy availability. At the same
time, dietary energy from animal-source products and fruits
and vegetables increased noticeably. In sub-Saharan Africa,
however, dietary energy availability from cereals, roots and
tubers increased while dietary energy from animal-source
foods and fruits and vegetables was essentially constant.
Numerous studies have shown a statistically significant
positive association between total household per capita
income and dietary diversity, defined as the number of
individual foods or food groups consumed over a given
period of time.2 The close association between income and
diets can be shown by using household consumption
surveys. Figure 10 presents the results of an analysis of

59 household surveys conducted in 47 developing countries
in recent years, showing the lowest (Q1) and highest (Q5)
quintiles according to per capita income. Despite regional
differences in diets, the survey results confirm that diets in
the higher-income groups are more diversified, irrespective
of the region. As incomes grow, the contribution of cereals,
roots and tubers to total per capita DES decreases whereas
the contributions of animal-source foods and of fruits and
vegetables increase significantly. The relative contribution
from sugars to overall DES is also clearly rising with
increasing incomes, in most regions.
The shifts in diet composition with income are reflected
in changes in the availability of nutrients. As shown in
Figure 11, the relative importance of carbohydrates from
cereals, roots and tubers is much smaller in the diets of
higher-income households. Conversely, the relative
importance of carbohydrates from sugars and other foods is
higher in higher-income households, as is the contribution
of fats. These are all indicators of a major nutrition transition
(discussed further below). There are both positive and
negative aspects to these changes. An increase in the share
of DES from foods other than staples (e.g. animal-source
foods, fats and oils, legumes, vegetables and fruits) is
generally beneficial to health and nutrition. Increases in the
share of fats for people with low fat intake may be good –
fats are high in calories and they are required for
bioavailability of some micronutrients (those that are fat-

soluble). However, for individuals who have higher levels of
fat in their diets, a further increase may be detrimental to
health.
Finally, there is also some increase in the relative
contribution of protein to total dietary energy supplies, but
this increase is relatively small compared with the other
changes.
As shown in Figure 10, consumption of animal-source
foods (including fish) increases significantly as per capita
incomes grow. In fact, with the longer-term economic
growth observed worldwide since the early 1960s, growth
in consumption of animal-source foods has markedly
outpaced growth in that of other major food groups.3
Consumption of milk per person has almost doubled in
developing countries, meat and fish consumption has
tripled, and egg consumption has increased by a factor of
five. Growth has been strongest in Eastern and SouthEastern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean,
whereas it stagnated in sub-Saharan Africa. The rates of
growth were generally lower in developed countries, where
consumption levels were already higher than in developing
countries.
Expressed as the relative contribution of animal-source
foods to total per capita DES availability, diets seem to be
converging to a more uniform pattern, as Figure 12 shows
for a selected number of countries. Whereas only small
increases (or even a decrease, in the case of the United

18

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

States of America) were observed in countries that already
had relatively high shares of 20–25 percent in the early
1960s (e.g. France, Germany, United States of America), the
increases were significant in countries with lower initial
shares and fast economic growth during this period. The
latter group includes some developed countries (e.g. Italy,
Spain) as well as various developing countries (e.g. Brazil,
China). Generally, the levels of per capita consumption of
animal-source foods are still rather low in most developing
countries, in spite of high growth rates.
Meat, fish, milk and eggs provide proteins containing a
wide range of amino-acids as well as bioavailable
micronutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium and vitamins A
and B12, in which many malnourished people are deficient.4
Several of these (e.g. iron and zinc) may be difficult to
obtain in sufficient amounts from plant-based diets (owing
to poor bioavailability). Young children in particular benefit
from animal-source foods. However, there are concerns that
excessive consumption of meat (especially red meat), dairy
products and eggs by older children and adults can have
detrimental health effects and increase the risk of chronic
non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer,
diabetes and obesity.
Fruits and vegetables are an important component of a
healthy diet. WHO and FAO recommend a minimum daily
intake of 400 g of fruits and vegetables (excluding potatoes
and other starchy tubers); levels lower than this are thought

to increase the risk of chronic diseases.5 An adequate intake
of fruits and vegetables also contributes to the prevention of
micronutrient deficiencies.
A recent study found that almost 80 percent of the
population of 52 mainly low- and middle-income
countries consumed less than the minimum
recommended levels of fruits and vegetables.6 The
prevalence of the population with below-minimum intake
levels ranged from 37 percent in Ghana to 99 percent in
Pakistan (the range was similar for men and women
separately). It was also found that fruit and vegetable
consumption tends to decrease with age and increase
with income. While average daily per capita availability
levels have been increasing in many regions, especially in
Asia, regional average levels are still below the
recommended minimum levels in Africa, where daily fruit
and vegetable availability has stagnated at levels far below
the recommendations (Figure 13).

How does economic growth contribute
to hunger reduction and improved nutrition?
Key message
Economic and agricultural growth should be
“nutrition-sensitive”. Growth needs to result in better
nutritional outcomes through enhanced opportunities
for the poor to diversify their diets; improved access to
safe drinking water and sanitation; improved access to
health services; better consumer awareness regarding
adequate nutrition and child care practices; and
targeted distribution of supplements in situations of
acute micronutrient deficiencies. Good nutrition in turn,
is key to sustainable economic growth.

Over the long term, it is obvious that higher levels of per
capita income help to reduce the proportion of the
population who suffer from insufficient food energy intake –
FAO’s estimate of undernourishment in developed countries
is an order of magnitude below that of developing countries
(Figure 14). The previous section showed that economic
growth leads to improvements in the composition of diets
and, ultimately, better nutrition. But how does economic
growth help to reduce undernourishment for the poorest of
the poor? And what additional steps need to be taken to
reduce hunger and malnutrition more quickly?

20

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

There are several key steps in the process that links
economic growth (i.e. growth in GDP per capita) to a
reduction in undernourishment and malnutrition. First,
economic growth must reach the very poor. To reduce
poverty and hunger, growth should generate demand for the
assets controlled by the poor. Second, poor households must
use some of their increased income to increase their intake
of dietary energy and other nutrients and to make private
investments in health, sanitation and education; women’s
involvement is crucial to realizing these spending patterns.
Third, a large share of the additional public revenues
generated by economic growth must be used to make
public-sector investments in social protection systems/safety
nets, nutrition, health and education, so as to increase the
human capital of the poor. Governments should also invest
in public goods and services that promote growth in the
sectors in which the poor are employed, for example the
agriculture sector (see “Contribution of agricultural growth
to reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition”, pages
28–35). In order to ensure that these three key steps are
indeed effective and sustainable, good governance at the
national level is also essential. Good governance extends to
the provision of a wide range of essential public goods,
including political stability, rule of law, respect for human
rights, control of corruption, and government effectiveness.

who own very little capital. However, state revenues from
such sectors can be used in favour of the poor, as was the
case in Indonesia, where government money from oil exports
in the 1970s and 1980s was used to improve rural
infrastructure, including health clinics and roads.
The impacts of economic growth depend on the source of
that growth. There is strong evidence that the incomes of
the very poor respond more to agricultural growth than to
non-agricultural growth.10 One reason why agricultural
growth is likely to generate income for the poor is that in
many countries where poverty is high, poor people are often
concentrated in rural areas, and agricultural growth more
directly affects the rural economy than do other types of
growth. This issue is discussed in more detail in the section
“Contribution of agricultural growth to reduction of poverty,
hunger and malnutrition”, pages 28–35.

■■ How do the poor use their additional income?

■■ Does economic growth reach the poor?
People who do not have sufficient food intake to lead active
and healthy lives are among the poorest in the world.
Fundamentally, the poorest do not have the resources either
to grow an adequate quantity of food or to purchase it in
the market. Thus, the first requirement for economic growth
to help reduce undernourishment is that it reaches these very
poor people.
Turning to the evidence on the poverty-reducing impact
of growth, most research on this issue has found that
economic growth leads to increases in the incomes of both
the top and bottom quintiles of the income distribution.7
There are, however, many exceptions – the poor do not
benefit from all types of growth under all conditions. The
extent to which the poor will benefit from growth depends
on initial levels of inequality, the extent to which growth
generates employment for the poor, and the sector of the
economy in which growth occurs.
The greater the inequality in distribution of assets such as
land, water, capital, education and health, the more difficult
it will be for the poor to participate in the growth process,8
and progress in reducing undernourishment is likely to be
slow. For example, poor people often have little education,
which prevents them from participating in new dynamic
labour markets that offer higher wages. Inequality can also
reduce the rate of overall economic growth,9 further harming
the poor. Economic growth that is attributable to
exploitation of minerals and petroleum, for example, is less
likely to directly reduce poverty. Such sectors are capitalintensive and thus lead to less income growth for the poor,

Even when economic growth does reach the poor, other
factors are also important in order to reduce
undernourishment as rapidly as possible. The poor must use
that additional income to purchase more food energy or
nutrients. In the case of the very poor, most research shows
that the income elasticity of demand for dietary energy is
indeed positive, and in fact is greater than that for the notso-poor or the rich.11 In other words, while the poor use
additional income to purchase more food energy, the rich do
so to a much lesser extent, if at all.
Not all of the additional income used by the poor to
purchase additional food is oriented to increasing energy
intake, however. Even poor consumers will use some of their
additional income to shift to more expensive staple foods,
for example from cassava to rice or from rice that is less
thoroughly milled to rice that is whiter and more polished.
Some of these shifts may do nothing to increase energy
intake or improve nutrition, but reflect consumer preferences
for attributes such as taste, smell and appearance.
As consumers become wealthier, they tend to increase
their consumption of foods other than staple foods (see
Figure 10 on page 18, which shows that the rich spend a
much larger share of their food budgets than the poor on
animal-source foods and fruits and vegetables). Again, some
of these foods will enhance nutritional status, but others will
not. People do place value on being better nourished, but
they also want to eat better-tasting food. Moreover, they
may be unaware of the health problems associated with
consuming certain foods (leading to obesity) and of the
importance of certain micronutrients such as iodine, iron,
zinc or vitamin A (the lack of which causes “hidden
hunger”).
Finally, consumers will also choose to spend some of their
additional income on a wide range of non-food items, such
as education, clothes, health or cellular phones. These
choices can be influenced by information campaigns or

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

21

Economic growth, hunger and malnutrition

school curricula that promote the benefits of such key
investments. As a result of investments in additional health
measures such as sanitary toilets and more frequent trips to
the doctor (especially by pregnant women) the impact of
economic growth on nutrition will be strengthened. These
spending patterns mean that the impacts of food price and
income shocks (whether positive or negative) are not limited
only to dietary energy intake or food consumption levels, but
that adjustments take place in other areas as well.
How additional household income is spent is strongly
influenced by the share of income that accrues to women
(see Box 6 on page 37). Research has shown that when
women have more control over household income, more
money tends to be spent on items that improve nutrition and
health.12 During the past two decades, women’s participation
in the labour force has increased significantly, especially in
developed regions such as Europe and North America, and
to some extent in the urban areas of developing countries.
Female labour force participation is likely to increase with
further economic growth and, if accompanied by female
empowerment and women’s increasing control over
household income, may provide further impetus to
improving children’s nutrition and health.

■■ How do governments use their additional
resources?
Besides increasing private incomes, economic growth also
increases public resources. Governments can use these
resources in numerous ways to initiate and support
institutional reforms and programmes in favour of the poor
and hungry, including measures to enable more equitable
access to productive resources, investment in rural
infrastructure and measures to ensure the sustainability of
agro-ecosystems – which are the main source of livelihoods
for the poor. A large share of public revenues from economic
growth should be used to finance education, skills
development and a wide variety of public health measures.
Possible examples include improved access to safe drinking
water; an increased density of health clinics, especially in
rural areas; targeted distribution of vitamin supplements; and
information dissemination campaigns promoting improved
child care practices such as breastfeeding, complementary
feeding and increased birth spacing.
Empirically, higher levels of income are associated with
higher levels of such inputs into food security and nutrition,13
although some countries have done a better job than others
at providing such public goods. While it is true that a
reorientation of government budgetary expenditures would
be helpful for reducing undernourishment even in the
absence of economic growth, there is little doubt that
economic growth provides more scope to increase sensible
social spending. Thus, growth with redistribution is more
likely to be effective in reducing undernourishment than
either growth or redistribution on their own.

■■ What is the role of good governance?

Key message
To accelerate hunger reduction, economic growth
needs to be accompanied by purposeful and
decisive public action. Public policies and
programmes must create a conducive environment for
pro-poor long-term economic growth. Key elements
of enabling environments include provision of public
goods and services for the development of the
productive sectors, equitable access to resources by
the poor, empowerment of women, and design and
implementation of social protection systems. An
improved governance system, based on transparency,
participation, accountability, rule of law and human
rights, is essential for the effectiveness of such policies
and programmes.

As is evident from the first section of this report, a number
of countries did not succeed in reducing hunger and
malnutrition in line with earlier commitments and stated
goals. They either had slow growth or the linkages between
growth and reductions in hunger and malnutrition were not
strong. One reason for this could be weak government
structures and lack of political will to put hunger reduction
higher on the list of political priorities. As stated in the
second draft of the Global Strategic Framework for Food
Security and Nutrition, the causes of hunger and
malnutrition include: “lack of good governance to ensure
transparency, accountability and rule of law, which underpin
access to food and higher living standards; lack of high-level
political commitment and prioritization of the fight against
hunger and malnutrition, including failure to fully implement
past pledges and commitments and lack of accountability;
lack of coherence in policymaking within countries, but also
globally and regionally; lack of prioritization of policies,
plans, programmes and funding to tackle hunger,
malnutrition and food insecurity, focusing in particular on
the most vulnerable and food insecure populations; war,
conflict, lack of security, political instability and weak
institutions; and weak international governance of food
security and nutrition.”14
In order to ensure that economic growth does indeed
contribute to food security and improved nutrition on a
sustainable basis, good governance is essential. This extends
to providing essential public goods, including political
stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, control of
corruption and government effectiveness. Effective
institutions are a key feature of good governance.
Realization of the right to food can add value to an effective
food-security strategy by ensuring transparent policy
processes, accountability of public institutions and

Economic growth, hunger and malnutrition

clarification of government obligations and of the rights and
obligations of rights-holders.
If the poor are to benefit from economic growth, it is vital
that they have a say in the decisions that affect them. Experience
shows that involvement of all stakeholders – including

vulnerable women, youth, indigenous people and other
marginalized population groups – in the formulation, planning,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of development
activities results in more equitable access to resources and
greater benefits for the poor from economic growth.

Nutrition outcomes – global progress,
but many problems remain
There are various indications that the observed increase in
per capita food energy availability and in dietary diversity in
many countries has contributed to an overall improvement of
nutrition globally.15 A recent assessment found that
adherence to the dietary recommendations established by
WHO has improved worldwide over the past two decades,
although with significant discrepancies across regions.16
Children’s nutrition has also improved. The percentage of
underweight children (low weight for age) declined from
25 percent in 1990 to 16 percent in 2010, and stunting (low
height for age) in children under the age of five has
decreased globally from 39 to 26 percent over the same
period. Progress in the prevalence of child underweight has
been rather slow in Africa and most rapid in Asia, particularly
China and South-Eastern Asia, where stunting declined from
49 to 28 percent between 1990 and 2010 (see Box 1 for the
example of Bangladesh).17 The highest rates of child
underweight and infant and child mortality are in subSaharan Africa, but in recent years there have been
substantial declines of child mortality in many individual
countries in this region.18
Some progress has also been made over the past two
decades with regard to the reduction of micronutrient
deficiency, or “hidden hunger”. Progress in eliminating
Vitamin A deficiency was remarkable in Eastern Asia and
much of Central and South America, although it has lagged
behind in sub-Saharan Africa and in Central and Southern
Asia. With the effective expansion of salt iodization
programmes, the prevalence of iodine deficiency seems to
have declined significantly around the world.
Although more rapid economic growth accounts for some
of the improved outcomes in Asia, there are substantial
differences in child undernutrition levels across countries that
cannot all be explained by differences in economic growth.
One factor is whether or not growth is accompanied by
poverty reduction. Other factors include prioritization within
agricultural strategies between staple grains, fruit,
vegetables, livestock and fisheries, access to clean water,
health and sanitation and cultural traditions. Even when the

poor participate in income growth, they need assistance
through effective policies and institutions, particularly
relating to health services and nutrition education, to ensure
that child nutrition improves. For example, one study found
that the absence of such favourable conditions may explain
why the notable economic growth in India has not led to a
uniform reduction in childhood undernutrition in the various
states of the country.19
Despite the improvements in nutrition outcomes in many
countries, underweight (low weight-for-age) remains the
single largest risk factor contributing to the global burden of
disease in the developing world. In 2010, more than
100 million children under the age of five in developing
countries were still underweight. Children in the poorest
households are twice as likely to be underweight as those in
the least-poor households. Childhood malnutrition is an
underlying cause of death in an estimated 35 percent of all
deaths among children under the age of five.20
Micronutrient deficiencies (“hidden hunger”) still affect
over 30 percent of the world’s population, causing increased
morbidity and mortality, impaired cognitive development and
reduced learning ability and productivity, reduced work
capacity in populations due to high rates of illness and
disability, and tragic loss of human potential. Overcoming
micronutrient malnutrition is a precondition for ensuring
development. In the case of iron deficiency anaemia,
prevalence has not changed substantially; it has even
increased in some countries.21 In India, stunting and iron and
iodine deficiencies result in productivity losses equivalent to
2.95 percent of GDP annually.22 In Sierra Leone, iron
deficiency among women working in agriculture will cost
US$94.5 million over five years.23
More rapid economic growth can generate opportunities
for more effective action to prevent and control micronutrient
deficiencies. Agricultural development strategies that promote
high-value activities, both nutritionally and in terms of
income, such as production of livestock, fruits and vegetables,
result in more diversified diets. Additionally, supplementation,
targeted towards the most vulnerable, particularly in the first

BOX 1

Economic growth and nutrition in Bangladesh

Bangladesh has experienced rapid economic growth
during the past two decades, and also performed relatively
well in terms of nutrition improvements, particularly in the
1990s. Per capita GDP doubled between 1990 and 2010
(see Figure), and agricultural growth averaged 3.3 percent
per year (driven by impressive gains in rice yields). Poverty
rates declined substantially during that time, indicating
that economic growth had reached the poor. Significant
declines in the prevalence of stunting (height for age, an
indicator of chronic malnutrition) and underweight
(weight for age) in children under the age of five were
achieved in the 1990s, although progress stalled between
1999 and 2004. Thus, stunting declined by 12 percentage
points from 63 percent in 1990 to 51 percent by 1999,
with underweight registering an even larger fall from 62
to 43 percent, but between 1999 and 2004 no progress
was recorded. Progress has since resumed, although in
some cases at a slower rate: between 2004 and 2011, the
underweight rate fell by 7 percentage points, with most of

the decline concentrated between 2007 and 2011, and
stunting fell by 10 percentage points, of which 8 points
were achieved between 2004 and 2007. Current estimates
indicate that Bangladesh has already achieved a
50 percent reduction in undernourishment and is likely to
achieve the same reduction for underweight, thus meeting
the hunger target of the first MDG.
Nutritional successes are stronger when economic
growth that reaches the poor is coupled with more

6–59 months (which started in the 1990s) is now nearly
universal, and consumption of iodized salt has also
increased substantially in recent years. The use of oral
rehydration salts to treat diarrhoea has nearly doubled,
from 35 percent in 2000 to 68 percent in 2007.
Immunization rates for measles accelerated sharply from
65 to 94 percent in 2002 and 2005, respectively, with
coverage largely maintained to the present. More recently,
there has also been a substantial increase in exclusive
breastfeeding during the first six months of life, from
43 percent in 2007 to 64 percent in 2011. These factors
may have contributed to the reduction in stunting, given
the vulnerability of children in the first 1 000 days
following conception.
Much more remains to be done, however. Malnutrition
in Bangladesh costs an estimated US$1 billion a year in
lost economic productivity.1 The prevalence of wasting, an

1 000 days from conception to two years of age, and national
fortification of key commodities have proven to be highly
cost-effective strategies.24

■■ The nutrition transition and the double burden
of malnutrition
As incomes and urbanization increase, people gradually
adopt a lifestyle with reduced physical activity, less time for
household work, and more meals away from home. Diets
increasingly contain more energy-dense, semi-processed
foods, and become higher in saturated fats, sugars and
cholesterol. This shift is referred to as the nutrition
transition.25 While initially associated with richer urban
populations, experts agree that the nutrition transition is
rapidly affecting all societies.26
The nutrition transition is associated with an increase in
overnutrition and obesity. It also appears to bear a causal
relationship to the disease burden and mortality transition
referred to as the “epidemiological transition”.27 This is the
shift in disease profile from one dominated by mortality
largely attributable to infectious and communicable diseases
to one characterized by an increase in non-communicable
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
According to the WHO, overweight (body mass index [BMI]
≥25) and obesity (BMI ≥30) are the fifth-leading risk factor
for global deaths.28
Globally, the number of overweight people has reached
more than 1.4 billion adults,29 surpassing the number of
undernourished worldwide. The costs of being overweight
(as opposed to being obese), however, are arguably less than
the costs of being undernourished. Worldwide, obesity has
more than doubled since 1980, although the prevalence of

indicator of acute malnutrition, declined from 1990 to
2000, but then increased steadily until 2007 when it
reached 17 percent, exceeding the 15 percent emergency
threshold. This spike is a concern given that there were no
major disasters during that period in Bangladesh. (In 2008
following cyclone Sidr and the food price crisis, some
studies indicated that wasting rose to 25 percent). The
latest figure in 2011, at 16 percent, still exceeds the
emergency threshold, and continues to give cause for
concern. Additionally, levels of stunting (41 percent) and
underweight (36 percent) remain very high and constitute
significant public health issues.

adult obesity is currently much higher in developed countries
than in developing countries (Figure 15). The highest rates
are observed in North Africa and the Near East, North
America, the Pacific Islands and South Africa.
The world is increasingly faced with a double burden of
malnutrition, whereby undernutrition, especially among
children, co-exists with overweight and diet-related chronic
diseases and micronutrient malnutrition.30 Figure 16 shows
selected low and middle-income countries in different
regions that have a significant prevalence of both
undernutrition and overnutrition in their populations,
measured respectively as adult obesity and stunting of
children under the age of five.31
These two dimensions of the double burden have long
been perceived as being caused by distinct factors: poverty on
the one hand and affluence on the other. However, such a
categorization is too simplistic. Today, high prevalence rates
of overweight are also found in low-income countries or even
within the same household as undernutrition. The reason for
this co-existence is that being overweight is not necessarily a
matter of eating too much food, but eating food that is not
nutritious, and poor consumers may have less education and
access to information about nutrition. Another part of the
explanation may be the rapidly growing supply of previously
unavailable products (e.g. some processed foods, soft drinks
and snacks) in the modern retail chains of many developing
countries. In many cases, such products replace traditional
foods, including street foods in urban areas.
Today, it is increasingly evident that the double burden
of malnutrition often manifests itself as a life-cycle problem
in low-income families. Poor women suffering from
undernutrition during pregnancy give birth to undernourished
babies. If inadequate nutrition during prenatal development

and infancy is followed later in life by an excessively
increased intake of dietary energy, this could result in an
increased propensity to be overweight or obese.
Undernutrition (as measured by stunting) during childhood
can lead to the risk of greater susceptibility to obesity and
diet-related non-communicable diseases later in life as
adults. This explains why, in many developing countries,
undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies
are often all rooted in poverty. A double burden, for example
in terms of stunted children and overweight mothers, is thus
closely associated with economic development and is
increasingly being observed even within the same lowincome households.32

■■ Conclusion: improving nutrition as rapidly as
possible
Dietary changes observed over the past two decades have
had both positive and negative impacts on nutrition. On the
positive side, the quality of diets at the aggregate global level
has improved, and nutritional outcomes have improved in
most parts of the world. Mortality rates and the proportion
of underweight children under the age of five have declined.
There has also been progress in reducing the prevalence of
some micronutrient deficiencies, although with large
variations across regions.
On the negative side, however, the global number of
children who are underweight and/or stunted remains
unacceptably high. Moreover, the global number of
overweight (but not obese) people has surpassed the

number of undernourished and the number of people
suffering from micronutrient deficiencies remains high in
many countries.
There is a wide and growing consensus that strong
economic growth can lead to significant improvements in
nutrition. To achieve this as rapidly as possible, the process of
growth must benefit the poor, but it must also be “nutritionsensitive”.33 To date, the linkage between economic growth
and nutrition has been weak, with long lags before real
changes in nutritional status occur. Policies in support of
such objectives should be pursued within an integrated
agriculture–nutrition–health framework. Improving food
security and nutrition is about more than just increasing the
quantity of energy intake – it is also about improving the
quality of the food in terms of dietary diversity, variety,
nutrient content and safety. Measures to achieve greater
dietary diversity and adequate intake of micronutrients may
include the judicious use of targeted supplementation for the
poorest until the cost of a diversified diet becomes
affordable. Overnutrition should be addressed through
changes in lifestyle and healthier diets.
While economic growth is important for progress in
improving people’s nutrition, the links run in the other
direction as also – nutritious diets are vital for achieving
people’s full physical and cognitive potential and health, thus
contributing to economic growth. Improved childhood
nutrition and access to education can improve cognitive
development and thereby raise levels of income when those
children become adults – with benefits at the individual level
as well as for society as a whole.34

Contribution of agricultural growth to
reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition
The role of agricultural growth in economic
growth, and poverty and hunger reduction
Key message
Agricultural growth is particularly effective in
reducing hunger and malnutrition. Most of the
extreme poor depend on agriculture and related
activities for a significant part of their livelihoods.
Agricultural growth involving smallholders, especially
women, will be most effective in reducing extreme
poverty and hunger when it increases returns to labour
and generates employment for the poor.

T

he importance of agriculture in national economies
varies widely, but relatively predictably – the relative
importance of agriculture declines as GDP per capita
increases and the economy undergoes a structural
transformation. In some of the world’s poorest countries,
agriculture accounts for more than 30 percent of economic
activity, and in the least-developed countries as a group, it
accounts for 27 percent of GDP (2009 figures). By contrast, in
OECD economies, agriculture accounts for less than 1.5 percent
of overall economic output. Thus, the role of agriculture in
driving overall economic growth will vary from country to
country, and it is generally more important in poorer countries.
Growth in agriculture over the past few decades has
largely been driven by growth in labour productivity and,
perhaps surprisingly, labour productivity in agriculture has on
average been growing faster than labour productivity outside
agriculture since the 1960s.35 This rapid growth in labour
productivity has been driven by labour movements out of
agriculture, in response to both “industrial pull” and
“agricultural push” dynamics. In addition, annual growth of
total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture has been up to
1.5 percentage points higher than in non-agriculture,
countering the notion of agriculture as a backward sector
where investments and policies are automatically less
effective in generating growth than other sectors.

28

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

Overall, the role of agricultural growth in reducing poverty
is likely to be greater than its role in driving economic
growth. This is likely to be the case because the share of the
labour force that works in the agriculture sector is much
larger than the share of economic output that comes from
agriculture. For the least-developed countries, the share of
the total economically active population in agriculture was
66 percent in 2009, more than double the share of
agriculture in GDP. The implication is that the people who
work in agriculture tend to have lower incomes, which is
consistent with the fact that poverty is concentrated in rural
areas. Because so many of the poor work in agriculture,
agricultural growth is more likely to involve and benefit the
poor than is non-agricultural growth.
A recent detailed analysis of data on cross-country
growth experience has shown that, provided income
inequality is not excessive, agricultural growth reduces
poverty among the poorest of the poor.36 In resource-poor
low-income countries (excluding sub-Saharan Africa), a
given rate of GDP growth due to agricultural growth
reduces poverty five times more than does an identical
dose of GDP growth due to non-agricultural growth. In
sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural growth is 11 times more
effective. Thus, raising agricultural production and
productivity remains crucial for reducing poverty in a costeffective manner, especially in low-income countries.
The ability of agriculture to generate overall GDP growth
and its comparative advantage in reducing poverty will vary
from country to country. In this regard, a typology introduced
in the World Development Report 2008 (see Table 1) stresses
that in agriculture-based economies (most of them in subSaharan Africa), agriculture contributes significantly to
economic growth, and, because the poor are concentrated
in rural areas, it will also contribute significantly to poverty
reduction.37 The key policy agenda in these countries is to
enable agriculture to work as an engine of growth and
poverty reduction. In transforming economies (mainly in

Contribution of agricultural growth to reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition

Asia, North Africa and the Near East) agriculture contributes
less to economic growth, but since poverty remains
overwhelmingly rural, agricultural growth, as well as growth in
the rural non-farm economy, has strong poverty reduction
effects. In urbanized economies (mainly in Eastern Europe and
Latin America), where poverty is primarily urban, a more

productive agriculture sector can help to cap food price
increases and improve the purchasing power of the urban
poor, who spend a large portion of their income on food.
In addition to the type of economy the agriculture sector
is embedded in, the propensity for agriculture to contribute
to poverty reduction is also a function of the structure of the
sector, especially with regards to the distribution of land. For
example, in a smallholder-based and labour-intensive
agriculture sector, higher land and labour productivity lead to
rapid reductions in poverty (e.g. Eastern and South-Eastern
Asia). China cut poverty extremely rapidly during the 1980s
to mid-1990s during a period of strong agricultural growth,
as it started from a situation of relatively equal access to
farmland and human capital.38 As inequality increased over
time, poverty reduction slowed. In parts of Latin America,
however, because of an unequal distribution of land and the
dominance of mechanized farming, the relationship between
productivity and poverty reduction is much weaker: yields
have grown rapidly but rural poverty has changed little.39
In order for agricultural growth to include the poor, it
should utilize the assets typically owned by the poor. In all
cases, the poor own their own labour, and in some cases this
is all they own. Thus, growth that generates employment,
increases wages and upgrades the quality of jobs (see Box 2),
especially for unskilled labour, is of crucial importance for
reducing poverty and increasing access to adequate food in
terms of both quantity and quality. Poor access to food can
cause low labour productivity, which in turn hampers
economic growth, especially in agrarian-based contexts.40

BOX 2

Promoting decent employment in agriculture and rural areas for achieving food security

According to the ILO’s definition, “decent work sums up
the aspirations of people in their working lives. It involves
opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a
fair income, security in the workplace and social
protection for families, better prospects for personal
development and social integration, freedom for people
to express their concerns, organize and participate in the
decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity
and treatment for all women and men.”1
Rural labour markets are highly informal, with a
prevalence of casual work arrangements and information
asymmetries, as well as gender and age-based
inequalities. Rural working conditions are often poor,
access to social protection is limited, and labour legislation
is often not enforced; rural workers are the least
organized and least protected by legislative frameworks.2
Policies and programmes should aim not only at more
but also at better employment in the farm and non-farm

sector.3 For instance, integrated production and pest
management (IPPM) helps reduce the overall use of
pesticides and selection of less hazardous products when
pesticide use is necessary. Equipped with knowledge of
IPPM techniques, agricultural workers can better
negotiate clauses requiring the use of IPPM in collective
bargaining agreements with employers.4 Likewise,
providing support to formal trade unions (e.g. the General
Agricultural Workers Union of Ghana) to facilitate the
inclusion of self-employed farmers and agricultural
workers, including seasonal workers, can give such
workers a stronger voice in social dialogue and bargaining
processes. As a final example of improving the condition
of employment in the agriculture sector, the Ministry of
Agriculture in Thailand is designing a scheme to provide
rice farmers with pensions and disability compensation.

Contribution of agricultural growth to reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition

Employment-enhancing growth is widely recognized as a
necessary condition for achieving sustainable economic
development. Countries that have been successful in
reducing poverty in relatively short periods of time went
through employment-centred structural transformations, in
which industrial and agricultural policies as well as active
social policies were used in synergy.41 Employmentenhancing policies include tackling constraints to
entrepreneurship development, improving literacy and
education, as well as skills development to increase the
employability of the workforce, especially the youth.
In countries with a relatively equal distribution of land,
many of the poor also have access to some land, which

allows them to benefit from growth that increases its value
(e.g. through higher yields). Thus, for example, yield growth
and poverty reduction have gone hand in hand in China,
where the distribution of land is relatively equal.42 By
contrast, in India, land distribution is more unequal, and yield
growth has not sparked as much reduction in poverty and
undernourishment. In situations where a large share of
production growth occurs on large farms, the poor can still
participate in growth if crop production is labour-intensive
and serves to increase rural wages – however, the benefits to
the poor will still be less than if the poor owned the land. If
the growth occurs on large mechanized farms, there will be
little scope for participation of the poor.

Smallholders’ contribution to increasing
agricultural production and productivity43
The global demand for food is expected to increase by
60 percent by 2050. Given climate change, natural resource
constraints and competing demands, especially for the
production of biofuels, among other factors, this presents a
considerable challenge for the agriculture and food systems
worldwide. Smallholders will need to play a key role in
meeting these requirements, if for no reason other than the
sheer magnitude of their production in developing
countries.
Historically, smallholders have proved to be key players in
meeting food demand. In Asia during the Green Revolution,
smallholder farmers adopted new technical innovations,
increased productivity, and produced enough food to lower
the real prices of staple foods for consumers. The demand
for labour in rural areas increased, generating jobs for the
rural poor and increasing wages for unskilled workers. This
combination of factors helped to improve food security for
all. Many of the development success stories of the past
20–40 years were based on smallholder production (e.g.
China, Indonesia, and Viet Nam; see Box 3). During this time,
smallholders were also typically more efficient than large
-scale farmers.44 Looking ahead, smallholder production is
likely to be more efficient for labour-intensive products such
as vegetables.
Despite these past successes, smallholders will need to
overcome considerable constraints if they are to compete in
many modern markets. Within developing countries,
changes in the agricultural and food-marketing, processing
and retail sectors have resulted in increased private-sector
investments, both domestic and foreign, in agro-food
industries.

30

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

Sales through more sophisticated channels, such as
supermarkets, require greater managerial and logistics skills
from farmers and an ability to provide continuity of supply
and to meet demanding food safety and quality
requirements. Agricultural research and extension are
becoming increasingly private and globalized, focusing on
technologies that are knowledge-intensive and require
management skills and effective learning. This could limit
small farms’ access to innovative inputs. Smaller farms face
difficulties in accessing credit, as financial institutions are
often reluctant to lend due to poor collateral and lack of
information on the creditworthiness of the potential
borrower. Small women farmers face even greater
disadvantages than their male counterparts as they typically
have even less access to financial and social capital, market
information and productive resources such as land.
Smallholders are capable of meeting these challenges, but
they need an appropriate “enabling environment” in order
to do so. Provision of better rural infrastructure, such as
roads, physical markets, storage facilities and communication
services, will reduce transaction costs and enable farmers to
reach markets. Interventions to ensure land tenure and
property rights security will encourage smallholders to invest
in land improvements. Provision of education in rural areas is
essential if smallholders are to participate in markets, as
small farmers cannot trade in sophisticated chains if they are
neither literate nor numerate and/or lack the ability to
organize supplies and the confidence to partner with buyers.
It is also imperative that policies redress gender and other
inequalities regarding access to assets and resources in order
to bring long-term benefits to women and their families.

Agricultural growth in Viet Nam

Viet Nam has experienced rapid economic growth overall
(5.8 percent per capita per year from 1990 to 2010), and
rapid growth in agriculture also. Between 1990 and 2010,
agricultural growth averaged 4.0 percent per year, one of
the best performances in the world during that period.
Total factor productivity growth in agriculture was also
quite rapid at 3.1 percent per year from 1991 to 2000
and 2.4 percent per year from 2001 to 2009.1
Most of the production growth derived from increased
yields. Yields of rice, the most important crop, increased by
50 percent, but yields of maize, rubber, cashews and cassava
all more than doubled. However, area harvested also
increased: areas under maize and rubber cultivation more
than doubled, that for cashews more than tripled, and the
area under coffee cultivation increased by a factor of eight
(from about 60 000 hectares in 1990 to more than half a
million by 2008). Aquaculture production has also grown
extremely rapidly, by about 12 percent per year since 1990.
Because land distribution in Viet Nam is relatively equal
compared with most countries, the growth in yields has
benefited many small landowners. The growth in area
harvested has also increased demand for labour, one of the

key assets of the poor. This growth pattern has contributed
to rapid reductions in poverty, undernourishment, stunting
and underweight (the latter two referring to children under
the age of five). Indeed, Viet Nam has already achieved
several of the Millennium Development Goals.
Market-oriented agricultural households benefited the
most during the mid-1990s, with the poverty rate for these
households falling by more than 40 percent in just five
years. But subsistence-oriented agricultural households also
benefited – their poverty rate fell by 28 percent over five
years. For households that were initially subsistenceoriented but strongly increased their participation in
markets during the 1990s, the poverty decline was
35 percent. All these household types experienced an
increase in non-agricultural income, thus underlining the
importance of a dynamic non-farm economy.2

Agricultural growth in the United Republic of Tanzania

The United Republic of Tanzania’s agriculture sector grew at
an annual average rate of 3.8 percent per year between 1990
and 2010, placing it among the top 15 performers worldwide
during that period. The prevalence of undernourishment,
however, first increased and then stagnated during the past
20 years, and progress in reducing stunting and poverty has
been very slow. Thus, rapid agricultural growth in and of itself
is not sufficient to improve nutrition.
Production growth in agriculture during the past 20
years was accounted for primarily by increased area
harvested, with relatively little deriving from higher yields.
Four-fifths of the increased area harvested has come from
eight crops: maize, dry beans, groundnuts, rice, bananas,
coconuts, sorghum and cassava. But yields for maize,
coconuts, sorghum and cassava have declined during the
past two decades and those for rice have increased only
slightly. The declining yields possibly reflect expansion into
marginal lands with lower soil fertility and yield potential.
Reflecting the reliance on land expansion, growth of total
factor productivity in agriculture, while positive, was not
especially noteworthy during this time – it averaged
0.4 percent per year from 1991 to 2000, and 1.0 percent
per year from 2001 to 2009.1

A growth pattern based on land expansion raises
questions of sustainability. In addition, the extent to which
the benefits are captured by the poor depends on the
extent to which the additional land brought under
cultivation is fertile and is owned by the poor.
There has been some rapid export growth of cotton
and tobacco in recent years, both of which are crops
grown by smallholders. But these are non-food crops, and
their production is concentrated in relatively small parts of
the country. A growth strategy focusing on maize, root
crops, pulses and oilseeds would be more effective in
reducing poverty and undernourishment, because these
crops are more widely grown by poor farmers and
account for a larger share of poor people’s budgets.2
Increased spending on agricultural research and extension
focused on these crops will be needed if such a growth
strategy is to be pursued.

smallholder development by, for example, ensuring highquality agricultural research is clearly targeted towards
smallholder and consumer needs, where possible in
partnership with the private sector. Government extension
services will need to focus more on production, but also on
marketing and food safety.

A greater focus on integrating smallholders into markets will
provide several benefits. Not only will it help meet future food
demand; it will also contribute to improving food security and
nutrition in rural and urban areas. In addition, it will open up
increased opportunities for linkages with the rural non-farm
economy, as smallholders are likely to use most of their additional
income to purchase locally produced goods and services.

Hunger, agriculture and sustainable
development
If the world is to succeed in overcoming hunger and
malnutrition and meeting the demand of today’s and future
generations, fundamental changes in the agricultural and
food systems are needed. At the recent Rio+20 Summit,
world leaders reconfirmed that “poverty eradication,
changing unsustainable and promoting sustainable patterns
of consumption and production and protecting and
managing the natural resource base of economic and social
development are the overarching objectives of and essential
requirements for sustainable development.”45 Success in
achieving these objectives is literally vital for food security
and adequate nutrition for all.
This is particularly relevant for the way countries seek to
enable their agricultural and food systems to meet the
needs of today’s and future generations. Sustainable
development and the Rio vision cannot be achieved unless
hunger and malnutrition are eradicated. It is essential that
national governments and all stakeholders promote the
gradual realization of the right to adequate food, establish
and protect rights to resources, especially for the most
vulnerable; incorporate incentives for sustainable
consumption and production into food systems; promote
fair and well-functioning agricultural and food markets;
reduce risk and increase the resilience of the most
vulnerable; and invest public resources in essential public
goods, including innovation and infrastructure.
On the consumption side, there is a need to contribute
to sustainable use of resources by reducing overconsumption, shifting to nutritious diets with a lower
environmental footprint and reducing food losses and
waste throughout the food chain. Regarding food and
agricultural production, there is great potential for

sustainable intensification. Adequate and stable agricultural
productivity growth depends critically on the health of agroecosystems and their capacity to provide services such as soil
fertility, resistance to pests and diseases and overall
resilience of the production system. Healthy ecosystems can
also provide important benefits beyond the farm, reducing
agricultural pollution that has high costs, and contributing
to climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and
watershed protection. Often, farmers, fishermen and forest
dwellers lack the capacity and incentives to adopt the
practices needed to achieve sustainable and healthy agroecosystems.
Thus governments, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations are increasingly interested and
engaged in building the needed technical, policy and
financing frameworks to support more sustainable forms of
production. There are a range of possible approaches to
incorporating environmental values in agricultural policymaking to explicitly recognize and reduce the costs of
agricultural pollution and increase the external
environmental benefits the agriculture sector can provide. It
is critical to evaluate such approaches in terms of their
equity impacts as much as their efficiency, as they involve
transfers of costs and benefits amongst groups in society.
Some successes with approaches that combine poverty
reduction and environmental sustainability have been
achieved and these need to be built upon and expanded.
In view of this vision, the four Rome-based organizations
– FAO, IFAD, WFP and Bioversity International – have
identified ten key priorities and calls for action, which
formed their contribution to the outcome document of the
Rio+20 Summit (see Box 5).

The importance of the rural non-farm economy
and its links with agriculture46
In spite of its importance, agriculture will not be a way out of
poverty for all rural people. On the one hand, some smallholder
farmers – particularly those with adequate levels of assets and
access to transforming agricultural markets –will be able to
develop sustainable, commercialized production systems. These
systems will allow them to move up and work their way out of
poverty. Acquiring new land that enables them to expand their
production and marketed surplus will, in many cases, be part of
that process. On the other hand, many poor rural people have
extremely limited, or no, access to land and markets; they will
not be able to rely on farming alone to exit poverty. In addition,
in countries where the supply of land is limited, not all farmers
can expand their landholdings. Instead, some will need to seek
opportunities in the rural non-farm economy, either through
wage employment or self-employment, which can provide
them with their main route out of poverty. For youth, many of
whom aspire to move beyond agriculture, the rural non-farm
economy will be of particular importance.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

As an economy grows and GDP per capita increases, the nonfarm economy also grows in importance within the rural
economy as a whole. In agriculture-based economies, the share
of rural income derived from non-agricultural sources may be
only 20 to 30 per cent, but in urbanizing economies it can be as
high as 60 or 70 per cent (see Figure 17). An analysis of RIGA
(Rural Income Generating Activities) data show that a majority of
households participate in rural non-farm income generating
activities:47 in Asia and Latin America, typically between 50 and
60 percent and in sub-Saharan Africa, between 25 and
50 percent. However, only 20–25 percent of rural households in
Asia and Latin America, and 10–20 percent of households in subSaharan Africa derive more than three-quarters of their income
from the non-farm economy. For a majority of households, then,
participation in the non-farm economy is either part-time or
seasonal, and it serves to manage risk and diversify income
sources. Essentially, most rural households have one foot in
farming and the other in the non-farm economy.

Contribution of agricultural growth to reduction of poverty, hunger and malnutrition

Agricultural development has long been recognized as
playing an important role in fostering development in the rest
of the economy through a series of linkages between it and
other sectors.48 Agriculture also generally plays a predominant
role in influencing the size and structure of the rural non-farm
economy, by supplying raw materials for agro-processing,
providing a market for agricultural inputs and consumer goods
and services, releasing labour into other sectors of the
economy and supplying – and reducing the price of – food to
the non-farm economy.
In regions where agriculture has grown robustly, the rural
non-farm economy has also typically enjoyed rapid growth.
The literature suggests that each dollar of additional value
added in agriculture generates another 30–80 cents in secondround income gains elsewhere in the economy,49 depending on
factors such as population densities and surplus labour
availability. The relationship between agriculture and other
sectors evolves through different levels of development: at low
levels of development it encourages growth elsewhere in the
economy; as countries grow, there is a more mutually
beneficial relationship; and eventually, agriculture is of little
importance as a motor of economic growth.50 Conversely, slow
income growth in agriculture leads to weak consumer
demand, limited agricultural input requirements, limited
growth in agro-processing and stagnant wages. Under these
circumstances, little dynamism can be expected in the nonfarm economy, and poor rural households will be pushed
towards survival strategies that will include low-return, nonfarm activities and migration. All this suggests that, particularly

in agriculture-based countries, where there is growth in the
agriculture sector there are likely to be opportunities to catalyse
the growth of the non-farm economy and create a virtuous
cycle of rural growth and employment generation.
In addition to agriculture, however, other factors may
influence the shape and development of the rural non-farm
economy. These include urbanization and improved transport
and communication linkages between rural and urban areas.51
Migration out of agriculture into the rural non-farm economy
and secondary towns is strongly associated with rural poverty
reduction. For example, Indian villages close to towns and cities
have a better record of reducing poverty than others,52 and this
is common in other countries too. Improved transport and
communication linkages between rural and urban areas offer
new opportunities for rural households, particularly in
transforming and urbanizing economies. In China and SouthEastern Asia, high population densities and low transport costs
have led to labour-intensive manufacturing for export markets
being subcontracted to rural industries.53

■■ Conclusion: promoting poverty reduction
through agricultural growth while preparing
rural populations for structural transformation
of the rural economy
Ultimately, the role of agriculture in reducing poverty and
undernourishment will depend on the specific context. In
many cases, especially in poorer ones, it can serve as an
engine of economic growth. As was shown, governments,
interacting with all stakeholders, can support and enhance this
role in many ways. Strengthening the chances of smallholders
to take part in the sustainable development of agriculture and
rural areas is vital in this regard.
However, as GDP per capita increases, agriculture becomes
less important both to the economy overall and to the poor,
and non-agricultural growth becomes a more powerful engine
of poverty alleviation for people who are poor but not very
poor. Thus, growth in the non-agriculture sector is also crucial
for food security. For example, it can provide a source of
employment, particularly for youth, that facilitates employment
transitions from the agriculture sector to higher-productivity
jobs in industry and services, whether those higher-productivity
jobs are in urban or rural areas. Governments of the countries
concerned need to envisage this structural transformation and
take early steps, especially through investments in infrastructure,
education and training, to ensure that the rural poor are well
prepared to participate in the transformation process and
enabled to take advantage of emerging income-earning
opportunities. Country-owned and inclusive agricultural
development strategies, such as the Comprehensive Africa
Agricultural Development Programme, should meet the
challenge of designing, implementing and evaluating such a
coherent policy framework, in order to achieve productivity
growth and sustainability, while paying due attention to the role
of smallholders and rural poor in the transformation process.

Social protection for the poor and vulnerable
A foundation for reducing hunger and malnutrition
Key message
Social protection is crucial for accelerating hunger
reduction. First, it can protect the most vulnerable,
who do not benefit from economic growth. Second,
social protection, properly structured, can contribute
directly to more rapid economic growth through human
resource development and strengthened ability of the
poor, especially smallholders, to manage risks and adopt
improved technologies with higher productivity.

E

quitable and strong economic growth based on
growth of the agricultural and rural economy of
low-income countries goes a long way in enhancing
access to food and improving nutrition of the very poor.
However, some of the changes made possible through
economic growth take time to bear fruit and the neediest
population groups often cannot take immediate advantage of
the opportunities it generates. Therefore, reducing hunger
requires specific attention to both short- and longer-term

interventions, often referred to as the “twin-track
approach”.54 Social protection instruments can establish a
bridge between the two tracks,55 because they play a crucial
role in ensuring that economic growth contributes to
reducing hunger and malnutrition as rapidly as possible.
Social protection contributes in two distinct ways. First, it can
help countries to reduce undernourishment more rapidly than
would otherwise occur. Second, if properly structured, it can
contribute directly to more rapid economic growth. It is
helpful to conceptually distinguish these two contributions;
however, any given policy or programme can make
contributions in both of these areas simultaneously.
A wide range of policies and instruments fall within the
remit of a social protection system (Figure 18). Safety nets, or
social assistance/transfers normally targeted at the poor and
not requiring a financial contribution from the beneficiaries,
are only one component of social protection. In addition,
social protection includes aspects of labour market policies
and insurance options, such as contributory pensions and
health insurance, as well as aspects of sectoral policies for
education, health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS and agriculture.56

Social protection for the poor and vulnerable

Safety nets to improve food security
and nutrition
Safety nets aimed at the poor and smallholder farmers have
traditionally been non-contributory, requiring no financial
contributions by the beneficiaries. There is a broad spectrum
of such instruments, including transfers (conditional or nonconditional, cash or in-kind), subsidies and public works.
However, an increasing number of governments are using
contributory micro-insurance schemes in health and/or
agriculture for the poor. The recent national social protection
strategy developed by the Cambodian Government
prioritizes provision of safety nets for the poor and
vulnerable, but also includes community-based health
insurance requiring financial contributions by the poor, as
one part of social protection (Figure 18).

Transfers can be delivered directly as cash or in-kind, or
increasingly as a hybrid of cash and in-kind transfers (see Box
6). Cash transfer programmes provide people with money,
while vouchers include the provision of coupons to purchase
a fixed quantity of food (commodity-based vouchers) or food
for a fixed monetary value (value-based vouchers) and can be
electronic or paper-based. Vouchers can also be used to
target agricultural input support, such as vouchers for
improved seeds, fertilizer, or access to services, more
effectively.
Food and cash distributions can be conditional or
unconditional. Conditional transfers are frequently based on
beneficiaries complying with certain conditions, such as

BOX 6

Designing transfers to promote women’s social and economic empowerment

A substantial and growing body of evidence has shown
that increasing resources in the hands of women (rather
than men) has a positive impact on family welfare, in
particular children’s health (child survival and nutrition
rates) and education.1
• Evidence from Sri Lanka shows that household food
consumption is more diversified when women have
more control of household income.2
• In Brazil, the Bolsa Familia programme increased the
labour participation of women by 16 percent between
beneficiary and non-beneficiary households.3 Cash
transfers that put money directly in the hands of
women have also increased women’s status within the
household (Brazil’s Bolsa Familia4) and promoted their
self-esteem and economic empowerment (Mexico’s
Progresa/Oportunidades programme5).
• The Social Cash Transfer Scheme in Malawi also reduced
women and children’s risk-coping activities such as
engaging in transactional sex6 or in hazardous child labour.
• Programmes conditional on child school attendance have
also been shown to increase girls’ school attendance in
Nicaragua7 and an evaluation of India’s Mid-Day Meals
Programme found that girls in the programme were
30 percent more likely to complete primary school.8

The type of food transferred can also make a difference
in terms of relative impact on different household
members. Evidence from an IFPRI study in Bangladesh
showed that women’s dietary energy intake increased
relatively more when a less preferred staple (atta flour)
was distributed, while men’s dietary energy intake
increased relatively more when the more preferred staple
(rice) was distributed.9
In order to increase women’s control over transfers, it
may make sense in some circumstances to distribute
transfers in the form of food, because in many societies
food is seen as the domain of women. Women are
therefore more likely to have control over the use of
transfers of food, and of cash-like instruments tied to
food.10 Making transfers conditional on activities in
women’s domain, such as taking children to health clinics,
can also ensure that a cash transfer is given to women as
opposed to the household head (who is generally male).
However, it is important that programmes take into
consideration the time demands placed on women,
because evidence shows that time constraints can affect
nutritional outcomes.11

Social protection for the poor and vulnerable

attending health clinics, enrolment and attendance at
school, or receiving nutrition education, thus implementing
the twin-track approach of both short- and long-term
objectives. Such conditional transfers include school-feeding
(school meals, snacks such as high-energy biscuits and/or
take-home rations that can be provided in the form of either
food or cash) as well as health-based conditional cash or
in-kind transfers (see Box 7). In a recent study, the authors
argued that while school feeding programmes can influence
the education outcomes of schoolchildren and, to a lesser
degree, augment nutrition for families of beneficiaries, they
are best viewed as transfer programmes that can provide
both a social safety net and human capital investments.57
The value transfer in school-feeding enhances the ability of
households, including farmers, to cope with shocks and
manage risks. Through greater levels of education it can
lead to higher productivity and improved gender
outcomes.58

Unconditional transfers include general food distribution,
supplemental and emergency feeding and cash transfer
programmes, usually targeted at vulnerable groups, but
without requiring the recipients to undertake certain actions.
Supplemental and emergency feeding targets pregnant and
lactating women or children under two years of age within
the “1 000 day” window of opportunity. Programmes may be
preventive or palliative, determining whether it serves an
insurance or assistance function.
Subsidies that affect prices paid by the poor can also act
as indirect safety nets by augmenting household purchasing
power through the sale of certain foods and agricultural
inputs at lower prices. They are widely used in Bangladesh,
India and throughout the Near East. Subsidies can be
generalized (universal) or targeted and are often advocated as
a way to protect the poor. Universal subsidies available to all
are the easiest to administer and obtain the most political
support. Critics argue, however, that universal subsidies are

BOX 7

Are cash transfers enough to improve nutrition?

Whether or not cash transfers can achieve nutritional
objectives is a much debated topic. For example, research
on Indonesia has found that the income elasticity of some
key micronutrients (e.g., iron, calcium, vitamin B1) was
significantly higher during the 1997–98 crisis than in a
normal year.1 When staple food price shocks hit poor
households, they will protect staple food consumption but
are unable to protect dietary diversity, resulting in adverse
effects on nutritional status.2 Population groups most
affected are those with the highest nutrient requirements,
including young children, pregnant and lactating women
and the chronically ill. As a result, marked increases in
child wasting and child anaemia are often found to be the
first consequences of food crises. Under such conditions, a
simple cash transfer during a price spike (or income shock)
may be enough to protect the consumption of some, but
not all, essential micronutrients.
But the debate goes beyond the appropriateness of cash
transfers during episodes of high food prices. In contexts
where production, access and utilization are poor,
concerns have been raised regarding whether or not cash
transfers can have a positive impact on nutrition, as
consumption of some key nutrients seems to be not
particularly responsive to income.3 Under these conditions,
specific nutritional supplementation programmes are likely
to be needed. Cash transfers are also unlikely to be
appropriate to prevent growth failure for children under
the age of two, when a highly nutrient-dense diet is
required but may not be available in the local market.

38

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

Findings from the Productive Safety Nets Programme in
Ethiopia on the impacts of food and cash transfers during
a period of high food prices indicate that food transfers or
“cash plus food” packages are superior to un-indexed
cash transfers when it comes to self-reported food
security.4 The authors conclude that any social protection
programme that aims to enhance or protect household
food security must introduce mechanisms that buffer
social transfers against shocks such as high food prices.
Thus, during a price spike, commodity-based vouchers
may be more appropriate than cash vouchers.
A further study, on the impact of a cash and food
transfer pilot in post-tsunami Sri Lanka, found that cashreceiving households were more likely than food-receiving
households to spend some of their resources on
improving the diversity of their diets by buying more
expensive cereals and greater amounts of meat, dairy
products and processed foods.5 The increased diversity in
consumption was achieved at the expense of reduced
consumption of the two basic staples – rice and wheat.
These effects mainly occur among the poorest beneficiary
households. However, work in progress in Niger,
comparing food and cash transfers, shows that the
majority of households prefer food, and that foodreceiving households tend to have more diverse diets and
less damaging coping strategies.

Social protection for the poor and vulnerable

generally regressive in that the benefit of the subsidy
disproportionately reaches the rich rather than the poor
(because the rich consume more than the poor in total),
and that they are extremely expensive and crowd out
spending on public goods that are essential for long-term
economic growth. In 2008, for example, Egypt introduced
additional bread subsidies with an annual cost of
US$2.5 billion.
Sometimes an attempt is made to design subsidies that
are, in principle, open to all but are implicitly targeted to
the poor because they are for goods consumed
preferentially by the poor.59 For example, the Tunisian
Government has subsidized smaller cartons of milk that are
typically bought by poorer households.60 Subsidies that are
implicitly targeted are similar to transfers, which were
discussed earlier, but such subsidies can result in very high
leakages to the non-poor. Depending on the product
subsidized, it can also result in very low value transfers to
the poor, and always requires the poor to have sufficient
resources to buy the product in question.

■■ Targeting and modalities are important
According to newly released World Bank data, safety nets
are insufficient or non-existent in many developing countries.
At least 60 percent of people in developing countries – and
nearly 80 percent in the world’s poorest countries – lack
effective safety net coverage.61 Recently, in the face of rising
human-rights-based approaches to social protection, the
universalist agenda has gained a strong voice advocating
minimum levels of social protection for all.62
Scarcity of resources and the need to maximize costeffectiveness, however, has meant that targeted safety nets
within social protection remain relevant because the majority
of financing of safety net programmes comes from
international aid including official development assistance,
grants and loans. The ability to raise revenue through
domestic taxation is often limited, and when such sources do
exist they are frequently diverted to other priority areas.
According to one study, the return on investment in social
protection cannot justify by itself a greater claim for limited

Fighting malnutrition in urban areas: the pioneering food security system of Belo
Horizonte
Belo Horizonte is the third-largest city in Brazil, with a
population of about 2.5 million. In the early 1990s,
about 38 percent of its inhabitants lived below the
poverty line and close to 20 percent of children under
the age of three suffered from malnutrition. The
magnitude of this problem prompted the development
of a multifaceted structural response by the government
that successfully transformed the human right to foods
that are adequate in both quantity and quality into
reality.
The programme reduced child mortality by 60 percent
and substantially influenced Brazil’s national Zero Hunger
Policy, using only around 2 percent of the city’s annual
budget. It has received awards from the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and from the World Future Council (WFC).
The overall system consists of more than 20 highly
interconnected programmes that foster and complement
one another. The key elements are:
• Central project management by means of a specially
created department within the municipality.
• Supporting urban agriculture with community gardens
in poor districts and with training workshops to
promote successful cultivation.
• Provision of special sales outlets to commercial
greengrocers in the most popular markets if they offer
at least 25 healthy products at a fixed low price.

• Provision of market stalls to small-scale farmers from
the surrounding area, so that they have a chance to
sell directly to consumers.
• A nutrition information programme targeted to poorer
areas of the city, including free cooking lessons. The
programme is coordinated by a team consisting of
employees from the departments for health, education,
sports, social work and food security.
• Free school meals that supply fresh products with high
nutritional value.
• Supply of affordable, healthy and nourishing meals for
low-income citizens in so-called Public Restaurants,
subsidized by the municipality. Belo Horizonte has five
of these, providing 4 million meals a year. As people
with average incomes can also eat there, the poor
don’t have the feeling of being stigmatized.
The food security system of Belo Horizonte could, with
some adaptation, become a successful model for other
cities around the world. Work will soon be starting to
bring this approach to Cape Town, South Africa and
other selected African city governments.

public funds as there are more productive forms of
government spending.63 For example, a typical economic
internal rate of return for social protection projects is between
8 and 17 percent, while the median rate of return for all
sectors is about 25 percent (for all World Bank projects across
all sectors for which it was estimated over 2005–07).64 What
makes social protection more desirable than other forms of
spending is their strong direct effect on poverty reduction, but
these benefits are dependent on effective targeting.
It is widely recognized that the choice of the most
appropriate modality depends on a proper assessment of
context-specific factors. When choosing the delivery modality
within public works programmes or non-contributory direct
transfers, decision-makers should take into account a
number of factors: the programme objectives (e.g. if there is
a specific nutritional objective then specialized food products
may be more appropriate than cash); the functioning of
markets including the availability of food; the preferences of
beneficiaries;65 the cost-effectiveness of alternative
modalities; and gender and the intra-household distribution
of transfers.66

■■ Impact of transfers on food security
and nutrition
Most evidence on the impacts of social protection
programmes in poor and middle income countries comes
from conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America,
many of which have been rigorously evaluated.67 While many
of these programmes achieved short-term outcomes in terms
of increased household food consumption, the impacts on
nutrition, as measured by anthropometric outcomes68 or
reduced prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, are mixed.
Programmes in Mexico and Nicaragua showed improvements
in child height, but in Brazil and Honduras hardly any effects
on pre-school nutritional status were found. Improvements
in iron status were observed in Mexico, but not in the other
countries (Honduras and Nicaragua) where this outcome was
studied.69 Furthermore, the pathways through which these
results occurred, and the role of different programming
components, are unclear. An open question in this regard is
whether it was the transfer itself or the conditionalities that
drove the impact.

Social protection and economic growth
Social protection and economic growth are closely
interlinked, and each has effects on the other. Economic
growth increases the financial and human resources available
to support social protection: for example, developed
countries, with higher levels of GDP per capita, usually have
more comprehensive social security systems than do
developing countries. Safety net programmes within social
protection are also a key factor in driving economic growth.
They can allow for the acquisition of the human capital (for
both children and adults) that leads to increased productivity.
They can buffer the poor from economic or climatic shocks,
leading to investment in agriculture and greater adoption of
improved technologies that increase farm income. In
addition, they can contribute to the construction of
infrastructure through public works programmes, thus
providing public goods that are essential for increases in GDP
per capita. Working together, social protection and economic
growth provide essential building blocks for eliminating
hunger worldwide.

■■ Building human capital
Some research has been able to investigate the long-term
effects of nutritional interventions in early childhood,

40

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

including the impact on nutrition outcomes, the pathways
through which these occurred and the impact on adult
economic productivity (see Box 9 on page 41). Evidence
outside Latin America includes a study of the Child Support
Grant in South Africa that found beneficiary children to be
3.5 cm taller as adults.70
These studies provide evidence of a causal link between
undernutrition (as measured by stunting), schooling and
adult wages through two main pathways. First, children
who were well nourished grew up to be taller and stronger,
increasing their ability to earn high wages at manual
labour. Second, well-nourished children started school
earlier and had fewer absences from school while enrolled,
leading to improved cognitive skills and higher wages. The
key message is that investments in early childhood nutrition
can spur economic growth, as these investments have
long-term effects on cognitive skills and productivity. Thus,
social protection is about more than just providing welfare
payments – it is also about driving economic growth by
improving diets and raising levels of nutrition, reducing
illness and absenteeism, improving cognitive skills,
increasing the returns to education and the ability to do
work. These features of social protection programmes are
discussed next.

Nutritional interventions in the “1 000 day window” in Guatemala

A study in Guatemala examined the direct effect of a
nutrition intervention in early childhood on adult
economic productivity. The study is based on data from
1 424 Guatemalan individuals (aged 25–42 years)
between 2002 and 2004. They accounted for 60 percent
of the 2 392 children (aged 0–7 years) who had been
enrolled in a nutrition intervention study during 1969–77.
In this initial study, two villages were randomly assigned a
nutritious supplement (atole) for all children aged six
months to three years and two villages were assigned a
less-nutritious one (fresco). The outcome variables
estimated in 2002–04 were annual income, hours
worked, and average hourly wages from all economic
activities.

■■ Risk, insurance and technology adoption
Agriculture is inherently risky, and may be even more so in
the future with an increasing frequency of extreme climate
events. A farmer may do everything right but as a result of
the vagaries of nature produce very little. For poor farmers
growing familiar crop varieties, taking on new crops or new
varieties may be beyond their tolerance for risk, given that
failure may be catastrophic. Managing hazards and risks
adequately and enabling the poor to adopt higher risk but
also higher return strategies is an important dimension of
enabling them to adopt better livelihood strategies that lead
to an escape from poverty. Provision of good safety net
programmes with clearly articulated, transparent and nondiscriminatory eligibility mechanisms can facilitate this
adoption process by providing a basic level of consumption
below which they know they cannot fall.
A simple example may be a household with insecure land
tenure living in a drought-prone area. Income profile A
(Figure 19) represents a household growing cassava, a food
crop that is drought-tolerant with a fairly short maturation
period and is locally marketed. Income profile B represents
one growing coffee, a long-gestation cash crop that is less
drought-tolerant and is exported to world markets. The
income from coffee is typically higher but carries greater
risks – yield losses due to drought, potentially losing the land
before the coffee plants reach maturity, or the harvest
occurring at a trough in the international coffee price. Any
one of these events (or worse, some combination) will result
in the very low troughs in income profile B. The possibility of
such troughs means that a household will be discouraged
from adopting coffee growing without some protection
against the troughs. Such risk aversion, while

The results suggest that receiving atole before the age of
three years was associated with 46 percent higher hourly
wages for men. There was also a tendency for hours
worked to be reduced and for annual incomes to be greater
for those who received atole, although the effect was not
statistically significant (perhaps because of an insufficiently
large sample). Ultimately children who did not suffer growth
failure in the first three years had more years of schooling,
scored higher on adult cognitive tests, were more likely to
work in white collar jobs or as skilled labour, were less likely
to live in poor households, and, for women, to have had
fewer pregnancies, fewer miscarriages, and fewer stillbirths.

understandable, will hinder the escape from hunger for the
individual household, as well as slowing agricultural growth
that has the potential to provide multiplier effects
throughout the economy and promote food security more
broadly.
Managing these risks can be done in several ways. First,
the probability of shocks occurring can be reduced, thereby
reducing the frequency and/or magnitude of the troughs in
Figure 19. Examples of risk reduction activities include
irrigation schemes; new drought-, salt- or flood-tolerant
seed varieties, and vaccination programmes that reduce the
risk of disease for livestock farmers. A land registration
programme that promotes access by women, and is sensitive
to traditional tenure patterns (as opposed to single-right
privatization), would reduce the risk of negative shocks for
both income profiles.
Second, even if a shock does occur, various types of
insurance (typically requiring contributions by the
beneficiary) can reduce the impact of the shock, in essence
filling the troughs in Figure 19.71 For example, weatherbased index insurance can provide insurance in case of
drought, and commodity risk-management instruments (e.g.
futures contracts) can provide insurance against short-term
price fluctuations, thus reducing the size of the troughs in
income profile B.
Thus, insurance that mitigates the impact of weather
shocks is a key tool for helping farmers avoid poverty traps
and for accelerating the adoption of agricultural
technologies. Traditional insurance schemes have proved to
be very expensive to operate, however, due to high
administrative costs. In response, new forms of insurance are
becoming increasingly popular. For example, weather index
insurance makes payouts based on measurements of rainfall,

temperature or humidity (crop yield over a large area is
another possible index), rather than the actual loss in a
particular farmers field.72 It is designed to trigger
compensation against predefined specific hazards such as
droughts or floods.73 The linking of pay-outs to predetermined
thresholds instead of being based on specific micro-level losses
reduces administrative costs and removes perverse incentives
(moral hazard) whereby farmers could actually prefer that their
crops fail. It also reduces the likelihood of adverse selection,
whereby the only farmers who pay for insurance are those
who have a high probability of crop loss.
The weather risk management facility of IFAD and WFP
provides insurance based on levels of rainfall, thereby
mitigating the impact of weather-related shocks on poor
smallholder farmers and enabling farmers to manage
agricultural risks and build resilience. Another example is the
R4 Rural Resilience Initiative launched by WFP and Oxfam
America (R4 refers to the four risk-management strategies
that the initiative integrates). R4 builds on the initial success
of a holistic risk management framework developed by
Oxfam America and a group of partners including the Relief
Society of Tigray (REST) to enable poor farmers to strengthen
their food and income security through a combination of
improved resource management (risk reduction), microcredit
(prudent risk-taking), insurance (risk transfer), and savings
(risk reserves). Within this initiative, the Horn of Africa Risk
Transfer for Adaptation (HARITA) project allows Ethiopian
farmers to pay for crop insurance with their own labour,

42

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

through a public works programme. An impact evaluation
covering the 2009/10 season found that index insurance had
large positive impacts on crop yields.74 The study found that
significantly more farmers who were buying insurance for
the second time planned to plant different crops, use more
fertilizer and take out loans. The evidence suggests that
farmers are learning that insurance is an effective riskmanagement tool that helps them take prudent risks to
intensify production and build their livelihoods.

■■ Investing in nutrition-sensitive food and
agricultural systems
While ample evidence exists on the impact of conditional
cash transfers in improving human capital,75 fewer studies
have looked at the labour supply or productive impacts.76
Nevertheless, a wide range of research reports little reduction
in adult work (i.e. time allocated to work, or labour supply)
due to receipt of conditional cash transfers.77 In terms of
production, despite the scarcity of available information,
those studies that do exist report positive impact on potential
productive activities, as well as potential conflicts between
social objectives and livelihood activities. Two studies on the
Mexican PROGRESA programme, for example, found that it
led to increased land use, livestock ownership, crop
production and agricultural expenditures and a greater
likelihood of operating a microenterprise.78 Yet, another
study found that agricultural households benefiting from

Social protection for the poor and vulnerable

PROGRESA were less likely to comply with conditionality due
to time conflicts with their livelihood activities.79
In sub-Saharan Africa, the Malawi SCT programme was
found to lead to increased investment in agricultural assets,
including crop implements and livestock, increased
satisfaction of household consumption by own production,
decreased agricultural wage labour and child work off farm,
and increased labour allocation to on farm activities by both
adults and children.80 In Ethiopia, households with access to
both the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) as well as
complementary packages of agricultural support showed no
indication of disincentive effects on labour supply and were
more likely to be food-secure, to borrow for productive
purposes, use improved agricultural technologies and
operate their own non-farm business activities.81 A followup study found that the PSNP has led to a significant
improvement in food security status for those who had
participated in the programme for five years versus those
who had received only one year of benefits.82 Moreover,
households that participated in PNSP as well as the
complementary programmes achieved significantly higher
grain production and made greater use of fertilizer.
Moreover, cash transfers can be an important
complement to a broader rural development agenda. The
importance of a pro-poor growth strategy focusing on
agriculture, and particularly the need for a new Green
Revolution in sub-Saharan Africa, has been widely
discussed.83 Such a strategy would imply a combination of
increased access to a diverse package of modern agricultural
technologies, including an initial fertilizer subsidy, and

investment in rural infrastructure and agricultural research
and extension.84 Yet, a lack of access to agricultural assets,
markets and institutions, and in particular credit, is
constraining potential engagement in agriculture.85 One
mechanism to overcome such constraints, especially among
poor farmers who are most likely to be credit constrained, is
through the provision of cash transfers.86 Thus, cash transfers
can serve not only as a means of social protection but also a
means of promoting farm-level production gains (see Box 10).

■■ Public works programmes
Public works programmes, sometimes referred to as cash-forwork or food-for-work, are best used as a livelihood
protection mechanism and are best implemented with an
employment guarantee, for example India’s National
Employment Guarantee Scheme. A guarantee of
employment when needed effectively provides insurance and
enables households to undertake more risk in their normal
livelihood strategy than they would do in the absence of the
programme. Households can then plant higher-risk and
higher-yield crops, moving from income profile A to income
profile B in Figure 19.87 For example, results from an
evaluation of the PSNP in Ethiopia between 2006 and 2010
showed that participation in the PSNP and the Household
Asset Building Programme raised the likelihood of using
fertilizer by 19.5 percentage points.88
Public works programmes also have the potential to
create indirect benefits. Construction of infrastructure such
as roads, bridges and irrigation systems can lead to

From Protection to Production

FAO has recently joined forces with the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Kingdom
Department for International Development (DFID) and
seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa – the From
Protection to Production (PtoP) Project – to study the
impact of cash transfer programmes on household
economic decision-making and the local economy.1 The
study of the economic and productive impacts is also
important for policy. The perception exists among many
officials in ministries of finance and the economy that
cash transfer programmes are just welfare, charity and/or
handouts, and do not have economic impacts.
This research project seeks to understand the potential
economic development impacts of cash transfers on the
rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa. It aims to enhance the
understanding of how social protection interventions can
contribute to sustainable poverty reduction and economic

growth at the household and community-levels. This will
be documented by the production of case studies and
cross-country comparisons. The project is using a mixedmethod approach, combining econometric, simulation
and qualitative methods to understand the impact on
household decision-making and local economies, taking
advantage of data from ongoing rigorous impact
evaluations for the following programmes: the CT-OVC
programme in Kenya, the Tigray Social Cash Pilot in
Ethiopia, the Malawi Social Cash Transfer programme, the
Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty programme in
Ghana, the Child Grant Programme in Lesotho, the
Zambia Child Grant Programme and the Zimbabwe Social
Cash Transfer Programme.

Designing public works programmes to benefit women

Public works programmes that create community
infrastructure potentially reduce time burdens for women
and girls who collect water and firewood. They also
provide employment opportunities for rural women, which
may have significant impacts on food security and
improvement of nutrition because women’s income is more
likely to be spent on food and children’s goods. Addressing
gender inequality and promoting women’s capacities
through public works programmes requires consideration
of decent work, women’s care responsibilities and their
need to participate on a flexible basis.1 Integrating family
responsibilities with work has been shown to increase
female participation, and incorporation of training has
been shown to increase female employability when the
programme ends.2 Evidence from disaster recovery projects

significant second-round employment benefits and multiplier
effects on local economies and agricultural productivity.
Public works are implemented in both development and
recovery settings and, in theory, have the ability to be scaled
up quickly (see Box 11).

reveals that training females for non-traditional female
jobs, such as construction, and giving females leadership
roles, can improve the long-term effectiveness of such
training for women.3
While public works programmes can benefit women,
attention should be given to the energy costs expended
by women in these programmes. In some cases, women
can use more energy than they receive from the transfer,
depending on the intra-household distribution of the
benefits.4 This happens because the allocation of food
within households may not be gender-equitable, with
women willingly or unwillingly sacrificing food to benefit
other household members.

beneficiary registration, common identification and targeting
methods, common monitoring and evaluation systems, and
integrated and synchronized transfer modalities. The two
most well known examples are Brazil’s Bolsa Familia and
Mexico’s Progresa-Oportunidades, but similar programmes
are being increasingly used in low-income countries as well.

■■ Systems of social protection
Given the range of different (but related) objectives for social
protection, there has been an increasing focus on pursuing a
systems-based approach, as opposed to the ad hoc, projectbased, short-term approach that dominated in the past. The
World Bank’s Social Protection and Labour Strategy 20122022 states that “the main objective of the new strategy …
is to help countries move from fragmented approaches to
harmonized systems”.89 It is based on an understanding that
more systematic and predictable risk-management tools with
a focus on enhancing long-term resilience will lead to
sustainable graduation out of poverty.
Systems will not only vary according to the objective, but
will also depend on the context – whether countries have
high or low capacity and whether they are politically stable
or unstable. The systems approach is relevant not only in
development contexts but also in emergency and early
recovery contexts where shocks can be recurrent (e.g.
Ethiopia, the Sahel, Yemen) or one-off. It is a way to move
beyond a purely relief-focused approach towards multi-year
resilience-building programmes such as the PSNP in Ethiopia
whereby chronically food-insecure households receive
support for up to five years, and the Hunger Safety Net
Programme in Kenya.90 A systems approach also implies the
use of common administrative mechanisms such as unique

■■ Conclusion: social protection – immediate help
for the neediest and a foundation for reducing
hunger and malnutrition in the long run
Even when the poor benefit from economic growth, these
benefits take time to materialize. Thus, in the short-term,
social protection supports the most vulnerable so that
hunger and undernutrition can be reduced now. But social
protection is also a foundation for reducing
undernourishment in the long term. First, it improves
nutrition for young children – an investment that will pay off
in the future with smarter, stronger and healthier adults.
Second, it helps to mitigate the impact of risk to promote
technology adoption and economic growth. A systems
approach is needed to link the various goals in an integrated
and cost-effective manner. Through such an approach,
undernourishment and malnutrition can be eliminated as
quickly as possible.

Annex 2
Updating and overhauling the FAO methodology for assessing
food insecurity – a summary of changes and their impacts
Introduction
During the past five years, the increased volatility of food prices
and the availability of new sources of data on food access have
emphasized the need for a revision of the FAO methodology91 to
improve the estimation of undernourishment. In 2010, the
Committee on World Food Security (CFS) called for a review of the
hunger measure, and an Expert Round Table was held in
September 2011 to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the
existing methodology.92
The Round Table confirmed that the FAO methodology is
fundamentally valid in its statistical principles, and that no viable
alternative has been made available thus far to globally assess the
extent of chronic food deprivation. However, the experts gathered
in Rome also found that the methodology could be improved in
several ways, especially by making fuller use of the increased
number of available household expenditure and living standard
measurement surveys, which could provide more information on
food access distribution in the population.93
The experts also emphasized that the state of food insecurity in
any country cannot be comprehensively assessed by reference only
to the prevalence of undernourishment defined in terms of dietary
energy. It was unanimously felt that a broader core set of food
security indicators is needed to capture other dimensions of food
insecurity beyond that of food energy deprivation. The economic
consequences of maintaining adequate energy intake in the face
of higher food prices, as well as the nutritional implications of diets
that are sufficient in terms of calories but deficient in fundamental
micronutrients (“hidden hunger”), have been identified as two
aspects not captured by the prevalence of undernourishment
indicator that merit proper attention.
In response to the above conclusions and to the explicit request
by CFS, the evidence presented in this year’s edition of The State of
Food Insecurity in the World has been strengthened in two major
ways. First, the entire series of undernourishment figures have
been updated back to 1990, reflecting improvements in both the
data and the methodology used. Second, an initial core set of
indicators has been identified to convey information on various
facets of food insecurity.
Both efforts should be seen as the starting point for a continued
endeavour to improve the monitoring of food security. While both
the methodology and the conceptual framework for food insecurity
assessment have been significantly amended this year to reflect the
improved data and information, further revisions are expected in the
near future, as more reliable data on food waste and more surveys
to assess the distribution of food access become available. Also,
although several additional indicators that can provide useful
information on food security have been identified, coverage in terms
of countries and years for many of these is still far from complete.
This technical annex includes a description of the various data
innovations and methodological improvements included in the
2012 edition of this report, compared to the traditional methods
adopted previously. It provides an assessment of the marginal

50

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

impact of each innovation on the estimated numbers and
prevalence rates, to help explain the considerable differences
between this year’s and last year’s assessments. The traditional
methods used to estimate the prevalence of undernourishment
are described in detail in an extended technical note available
online at www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/.

■■ The FAO methodology in brief
Since its establishment, FAO has been charged with responsibility
for monitoring the world food situation to enable the
international community to appropriately direct actions aimed at
promoting universal achievement of the right to adequate food.
FAO’s food security monitoring work involves, inter alia,
estimation of the prevalence of undernourishment indicator,
published annually in The State of Food Insecurity in the World.
The terms “undernourishment” and “hunger” have been
interpreted as referring to a continued inability to obtain enough
food, that is, a quantity of food energy sufficient to conduct a
healthy and active life. Two issues have to be addressed in
reaching a viable operational definition of undernourishment.
First, considering the complexity of human nutrition, and both
quantitative and qualitative dimensions of food, the expression
“enough food” needs to be qualified. The FAO method has been
based on the measurement of dietary energy intake, with
“enough” defined with reference to a normative dietary energy
requirement benchmark established by nutritionists. Accordingly,
a human being is considered to be undernourished if the level of
his or her habitual dietary energy intake is below the minimum
level nutritionists deem appropriate. As such, “undernourishment”
has been defined as an extreme form of food insecurity, arising
when food energy availability is inadequate to cover even
minimum needs for a sedentary lifestyle.
Second, there is the question of the appropriate time span to
assess undernourishment. For how long should an individual be
deprived of the minimum energy intake before he or she is
considered “undernourished”? If our interest is in highlighting
deep, chronic undernourishment, the reference period should be
long enough for the consequences of low food intake to be
detrimental to health. Although there is no doubt that temporary
food shortage may be stressful, the FAO indicator is based on a
full year, with the average consumption of food over the period
referred to as the habitual level.
Hence, the FAO indicator is designed to capture a clearly – and
narrowly – defined concept of undernourishment, namely a state
of energy deprivation lasting over a year. As such, the FAO
indicator is not meant to capture short-lived effects of temporary
crises. Furthermore, it does not capture inadequate intake of
other essential nutrients; nor does it capture the effects of other
sacrifices that individuals or households may make to maintain
their consumption of dietary energy.

Annex 2
For a more complete description of the state of food (in)
security, the prevalence of undernourishment indicator has to be
supplemented with a broader set of indicators to monitor various
dimensions of food security.

revised downwards by about 11 percent (or 17 million people). The
impact on undernourishment is thus different over the entire period.
If the new population data were to be applied to the other data
used for the estimates presented in 2011, there would have been an
increase of 2.8 percent in the number of undernourished for the
base period of 1990–92, and a reduction of 1.4 percent in 2009.

Summary of changes and impacts

Human stature and energy requirements
A second revision relating to population data has involved the
average physical stature of people by sex and age. New data has
been obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys
programme of the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and from household surveys that report
anthropometric statistics. On the basis of the revised heights, the
reference minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER) for each
country has been re-estimated. In some cases, this has led to
significant changes in MDERs and, therefore, for the prevalence of
undernourishment, especially for countries for which data on
heights were previously absent and therefore assumed to be equal
to those of other countries with similar ethnicities. As the revision
has generally resulted in a reduction of estimated average heights,
compared with those previously assumed (implying a reduction of
dietary energy requirements), the overall impact attributable to this
revision would be a reduction in the estimated number of
undernourished over the entire period, ranging from –2.4 percent
in 1990–92 to –3.1 percent in 2009.

■■ Substantial data innovations embedded in the
undernourishment estimates
The new estimates presented in this year’s report are the result of
considerable efforts to update and improve the database used.
Updates have been obtained for data on food supplies, population
and the intranational food access distribution as recorded by
household expenditure and living standard measurement surveys.
Table A2.1 reports the estimates published in The State of Food
Insecurity in the World 2011, along with estimates produced by
applying each of the revisions in sequence, with some indication
of their effects at the margin, from 1990–92 to 2009 (the latest
year for which an assessment was conducted using the previous
methodology in 2011).

Population size
Updated information on population size and structure has been
obtained from the latest revision of world population estimates.94
This includes substantial revisions of population estimates for some
countries with a large number of undernourished people, such as
Bangladesh and China. China’s population estimate for the 1990s
has been revised upwards by as much as 25 million people, with a
resulting increase of both the prevalence and the absolute number

substantial for the most recent periods. Use of the updated values
of dietary energy supply would result in, everything else unchanged,
an increase in the estimated number of undernourished in the initial
periods (+1.5 percent in 1990–92, and +1.4 percent in 1995–97)
and a reduction in the latest ones (0.2 percent in 2000–02,
–3.8 percent in 2005–07, and –8 percent in 2009).

Food losses
The presence of food losses occurring at the retail distribution level
has been identified in the past as a known source of bias in FAO
estimates of undernourishment, which used the dietary energy
supply obtained from the food balance sheets to estimate the
mean distribution of food consumption.95 Lack of reliable
estimation of the extent of such losses, however, has prevented
their consideration in past estimates. In this year’s edition of The
State of Food Insecurity in the World, a first step has been taken
towards correcting the estimate of mean dietary energy
consumption at household level, by introducing a parameter for
food losses occurring during distribution at the retail level. Countryspecific values of the average per capita loss of calories at various
stages of the commodity chain have been estimated based on data
provided in a recent FAO study of food losses, revealing that
significant food losses may occur during retail distribution, that is,
from the moment food is made available for human consumption
at the wholesale level to the time it reaches the households.96
Estimates vary by region and by food category, ranging from
2 percent for dry grains to 10 percent for fresh fruits and
vegetables. Applied to the various components of the food balance
sheets, these coefficients imply an overall reduction in terms of
calories available for human consumption at the household level,
thus increasing the estimated number of undernourished.
Of all the revisions, this is the one that causes the most
dramatic change in the estimated prevalence of undernourishment
in the world, with impacts ranging from +13.2 percent in 1990–
92 to +16.4 percent in 2007–09. These estimates of food losses
during distribution and storage are still tentative, based on rough
regional aggregates published in the referenced FAO study, and
are expected to be refined in the future as more precise countryspecific estimates become available.

■■ Improvements in estimation methods
The FAO Statistics Division recently conducted a thorough revision of
its undernourishment methodology, elements of which have been
presented and discussed in various fora, including a Round Table
organized by the Committee on World Food Security in September
2011 and at the International Scientific Symposium on Food and
Nutrition Security Information in Rome in January 2012. While the
review confirmed the overall validity of the fundamental approach, it
also revealed scope for improvement. The changes introduced with
this edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World concern:
• the functional form used for the distribution of dietary energy
consumption in the population; and
• the way in which the parameters involved – namely the
average, the coefficient of variation (CV) and the skewness of
the distribution of habitual food consumption in the population
– are estimated.

52

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

These changes strengthen both the methodological soundness
and the empirical validity of the underlying inferential method.

The distributional model
Since it was first adopted in 1996, the lognormal specification for
the distribution has not been changed, and updates have been
limited to revisions of the mean dietary energy consumption (based
on data published in the food balance sheets) and to occasional
revisions of the CV, when data from more recent household
consumption surveys were made available to FAO. In all other cases,
the lack of adequate food consumption data from nationally
representative surveys did not warrant changes in the CV, which
was therefore kept constant. However, raising the mean, while
keeping the assumption of lognormal distribution, has the
consequence of also increasing the implied probability of high levels
of consumption. This raises doubts about the appropriateness of the
distribution used for recent years in many countries, where the
distribution of food access may have become less skewed than
implied by the lognormal model. For this reason, a more flexible
model (the skew-normal introduced by A. Azzalini in 1985) has
been deemed more appropriate to represent the distribution of
habitual food consumption in the population. Compared with the
previous version, the statistical model can now capture changes in
the asymmetry of the distribution of food consumption; such
changes could derive, for example, from targeted food supply
schemes that only affect a specific part of a population and that
could not have been captured by the approach used in the past.

Parameter estimates: mean dietary energy consumption
A known source of bias in the FAO estimates of undernourishment
is the lack of reliable information on the extent of food losses.
Criticisms have therefore been raised regarding the practice of
assuming the mean of the distribution of calorie consumption in
the population to be equal to the average dietary energy supply
from food balance sheets. The estimates reported in this year’s
report reflect the results of an important step to correct this bias.
The estimated mean of the distribution of caloric consumption is
now lower than the dietary energy supply by a coefficient that
reflects food losses incurred during distribution and at the retail
level, and has been estimated using data provided in a recent FAO
study for all regions in the world (see the discussion of food losses
above).

Parameter estimates: coefficient of variation and
skewness of food consumption distribution from
household survey data
In the past, the CV of the distribution of dietary energy
consumption in the population was the only parameter used to
represent the inequality in the distribution of food consumption.
The parameter was estimated differently for different countries,
depending on the availability of data. A revision of these estimates
has been long overdue. Thanks to collaboration with national
statistical offices responsible for household survey data collection
and dissemination, FAO has not only updated the estimates of
coefficients of variation, but for the first time has estimated the
skewness of the distribution of food consumption in the
population.

Annex 2
A total of 47 surveys have been processed, ranging from 1995
through 2010. As most of these surveys are income and
expenditure surveys, they have not been designed to specifically
capture the level of yearly habitual food consumption of
individuals living in the surveyed households; rather, they provide
data on total household acquisition of food during a short
reference period (from one week to one month). In most cases, it
has thus been necessary to re-process available household-level
information to control for excessive variability due to seasonal
variation in food expenditure and to the difference between
reported food acquisition levels over a short period, and the
needed average yearly food consumption levels. Other sources of
variability in the food consumption data obtained from these
surveys include the fact that food acquired may be given out to
guests or people other than household members, and households
may have been using previously stored food during the reference
period or, conversely, purchasing food to build up stocks. All these
problems call for careful procedures to control for data quality and
to process the data available to estimate the CV and skewness of
individual habitual consumption.
In the end, new parameters have been obtained for 37
countries; together, these account for almost 70 percent of the
number of undernourished in the developing world. In the
absence of usable new evidence for the remaining countries, the
coefficients of variation (and implied skewness) have been kept
unchanged from values used in the past.

Projections when data are missing
New data on food supply distribution across households and on
human stature and energy requirements, obtained from surveys,
are not available for all countries and all years covered. This
created the need to devise sound methods to project the new
information to years for which no survey data are available, for
both food distribution and food requirements.

Projection of food distribution parameters
Until the 2011 edition of this report, coefficients of variation of
habitual food consumption were kept fixed at the values
estimated in 1996 in preparation for the World Food Survey.97
Under the assumption of a lognormal distribution, these CV values
also imply a fixed value for the coefficient of skewness.98
As noted, in this year’s edition we have calculated the CV and
the coefficient of skewness for per-person habitual food
consumption in each country and for each year when a suitable
survey was available. For years falling between two surveys, the
missing information on CV and skewness has been estimated with
a simple linear interpolation of the two parameters. The same
linear interpolation has been applied to the five years preceding the
first available survey, by using the old parameters as starting points.
For the years following the latest available survey, the CV and
skewness estimated from the latest available survey have been
retained. These parameters’ values will be changed when new
surveys become available.

Annex 2
Projections of stature and dietary energy requirements
The dietary requirement threshold for a country (the MDER) is
calculated as an average across sex and age groups in the
population. To estimate energy requirements for each sex and age
category, we use the median height of people in that group, as
revealed by surveys reporting anthropometric measures.99 When
more than one survey is available for a country, we project the
heights from the oldest survey retrospectively, and project forward
those from the most recent one. For years in between surveys, we
linearly interpolate the median heights for each sex and age group.
Application of these changes in methodology, including the
changes in the distributional model and the new parameters for

variation and skewness, on top of all the other revisions already
discussed, would have generated changes in the estimated
number of undernourished in the developing world, ranging from
an increase of 2.3 percent in 1990–92 and 2.7 percent in 1995–
97, to reductions of 2.4, 3.9 and 3.8 percent, respectively, for
2000–02, 2005–07 and 2009.
The graphs in Figure A2.1 show the effects of the various changes
described. The results of the comprehensive revision of data and
methodology presented in this report are overall impacts on the
estimated number of undernourished of +17.9 percent in 1990–92
and of –1.5 percent in 2009 compared with the assessment based on
the data published in 2011 with no methodological changes.

■■ Introducing a core set of additional food security
indicators
Following the recommendation that emerged from the CFS Round
Table on hunger measurement, an initial set of suitable indicators
aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity has been
developed (see Table A2.2); the values for these indicators are
available on the State of Food Insecurity in the World website
(www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/).
The choice of indicators has been largely informed by data
availability with sufficient coverage to enable meaningful
comparisons across regions and over the years. While most of
these indicators are already being produced and published by FAO
and other international organizations, other indicators have been
introduced for the first time, to fill some of the recognized gaps in
food security information systems, most notably with regard to
capturing the socio-economic dimensions of food insecurity.
To facilitate interpretation of the proposed indicators, they are
classified along two dimensions. First, a distinction is made
between indicators that describe determinants of food insecurity,
those that describe outcomes, and those that convey information
on vulnerability/stability. The first set includes indicators that
describe structural conditions that are likely to worsen food
insecurity in the absence of adequate policy interventions,
including emergency assistance; the second set aims to capture
the end results of food insecurity, irrespective of policy
interventions or coping strategies put in place. The third set of
indicators aims to capture the conditions that determine the
vulnerability to possible future food insecurity.
Within the first group, indicators are then classified based on
the dimension of food insecurity on which they provide

information, namely availability, physical access, economic access
(or affordability) and utilization. Similarly, outcome indicators are
classified in different groups, depending on whether they refer to
outcomes in terms of inadequate food access, or to
anthropometric deficits due to inadequate food.
The full list of proposed indicators is provided in Table A2.2.
The table highlights the indicators that should form a core set and
those that have been introduced for the first time. These new
indicators are briefly described below.
• Prevalence of food inadequacy. This is conceptually
analogous to the prevalence of undernourishment, but
calculated setting the caloric threshold at a higher level
corresponding to the energy need for moderate (physical
activity level [PAL] = 1.75), normal (PAL = 1.85) and intense (PAL
= 2.25) physical activity. It measures the percentage of the
population at risk of not covering the food requirements
associated with particular levels of physical activity. While the
existing prevalence of undernourishment indicator is a
conservative estimator of chronic food deprivation (“hunger”),
such new estimators are less conservative measures of food
inadequacy (see Figure A2.2).
• Relative dietary supply index. This is the ratio of the dietary
energy supply in the country, expressed on a per capita basis,
net of food losses, normalized by the country’s average dietary
energy requirement (ADER), a measure of the average caloric
needs of the population depending on its age/sex structure and
average height distribution. It provides indications on food
scarcity relative to needs in each country.
• Food price level index. This is an index of the food price level
in each country that is comparable across countries and over
time. It is based on purchasing power parities (PPP) calculated for

Note: The graphs show estimates obtained with alternative definitions of the minimum dietary energy requirements, based on different assumptions of the coefficients for physical activity level (PAL). The
standard prevalence of undernourishment indicator (PoU) assumes a PAL coefficient of 1.55, which corresponds to a sedentary lifestyle. Normal activity is associated with a PAL of 1.85, while intense physical
activity is associated with a PAL of 2.25. The prevalence of food inadequacy (POFI) estimates in the graphic (calculated using PAL coefficients of 1.85 for normal activity and 2.25 for intense activity) appear to
have declined less compared with the PoU (calculated using a PAL coefficient of 1.55 for a sedentary lifestyle).
Lacking disaggregated data on occupational status and physical activity levels by gender and age groups, in all cases shown, the threshold is calculated by applying the same PAL coefficient to the entire
population, irrespective of gender, age and occupational status. For this reason, while the lower threshold yields a conservative estimate of food inadequacy, the higher threshold (corresponding to a PAL of 2.25)
almost certainly overestimates the extent of food inadequacy, even where a large part (but not all) of the population is engaged in heavy physical work.

for 2005, is projected over time by taking into account the
food and general inflation rates for each country, as measured
by the consumer price index (CPI) – both the food CPI and the
general CPI – published by the International Labour
Organization and FAOSTAT.
• Share of food expenditure by the poor. This indicator
measures the average share of total expenditure spent on
food by households belonging to the lowest income quintile
(the first 20 percent). It is compiled based on data from
household expenditure surveys, and aims to capture the
economic consequences of rising food prices and poverty. A
rising share of food expenditure reflects the hardship that
poor families face when trying to maintain food consumption
when either food prices rise or incomes fall, by sacrificing
other household spending, whether for consumption or
investment.
• Domestic food price volatility. This is an index of observed
variability in the annual food price level index, aimed at

capturing the consequences of all factors that determine local
imbalances in the food market. Together with the other two
indicators of variability, in domestic food production and food
supply, it provides an indication of the past ability of a country
to maintain food price stability.

Glossary of selected terms used in the report
Anthropometry. Use of human body measurements to obtain information
about nutritional status.
Dietary energy deficit. The difference between the average daily dietary
energy intake of an undernourished population and its average
minimum energy requirement.
Dietary energy intake. The energy content of food consumed.
Dietary energy requirement. The amount of dietary energy required by an
individual to maintain body functions, health and normal activity.
Dietary energy supply. Food available for human consumption, expressed in
kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/day). At country level, it is
calculated as the food remaining for human use after deduction of all
non-food consumption (exports, animal feed, industrial use, seed and
wastage).
Food insecurity. A situation that exists when people lack secure access to
sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and
development and an active and healthy life. It may be caused by the
unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate
distribution, or inadequate use of food at the household level. Food
insecurity, poor conditions of health and sanitation, and inappropriate
care and feeding practices are the major causes of poor nutritional
status. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.
Food security. A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious
food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active
and healthy life.
Hidden hunger: Refers to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, or micronutrient
deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies can compromise growth,
immune function, cognitive development, and reproductive and work
capacity. Somebody who suffers from hidden hunger is malnourished,
but may not sense hunger. Micronutrient deficiencies can also occur in
people who are overweight or obese.
Kilocalorie (kcal). A unit of measurement of energy. One kilocalorie equals
1 000 calories. In the International System of Units (ISU), the universal
unit of energy is the joule (J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ).
Macronutrients. In this document, the proteins, carbohydrates and fats that
are required by the body in large amounts and are available to be used
for energy. They are measured in grams.

Micronutrients. The vitamins, minerals and certain other substances that are
required by the body in small amounts. They are measured in
milligrams or micrograms.
Minimum dietary energy requirement. In a specified age/sex category, the
minimum amount of dietary energy per person that is considered
adequate to meet the energy needs for light activity and good health.
For an entire population, the minimum energy requirement is the
weighted average of the minimum energy requirements of the
different age/sex groups in the population. It is expressed as
kilocalories per person per day.
Nutrition security. A situation that exists when secure access to an
appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with a sanitary environment,
adequate health services and care, in order to ensure a healthy and
active life for all household members. Nutrition security differs from
food security in that it also considers the aspects of adequate caring
practices, health and hygiene in addition to dietary adequacy.
Nutritional status. The physiological state of an individual that results from
the relationship between nutrient intake and requirements and from
the body’s ability to digest, absorb and use these nutrients.
Overnourishment. Food intake that is in excess of dietary energy requirements
continuously.
Overweight and obesity. Body weight that is above normal as a result of an
excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation of
overnourishment. Overweight is defined here as BMI ≥25–30 and
obesity as BMI ≥30.
Stunting. Low height for age, reflecting a sustained past episode or episodes
of undernutrition.
Undernourishment. Food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy
requirements continuously. This term is used interchangeably with
chronic hunger, or, in this report, hunger.
Undernutrition. The result of undernourishment, poor absorption and/or poor
biological use of nutrients consumed.
Underweight. Low weight for age in children, and BMI <18.5 in adults,
reflecting a current condition resulting from inadequate food intake,
past episodes of undernutrition or poor health conditions.
Wasting. Low weight for height, generally the result of weight loss associated
with a recent period of starvation or disease.

Malnutrition. An abnormal physiological condition caused by deficiencies,
excesses or imbalances in energy, protein and/or other nutrients.

These subsidies are best used for inferior
foods, i.e. foods for which consumption
declines with rising income. However, in
most countries it is difficult to find such
foods, and hence the approach is to use
quality or packaging discrimination to try to
orient consumption away from wealthier
households.

98 As the lognormal distribution is fully
characterized by only two parameters
(μ and σ), the skewness coefficient is a
simple monotonic function of the standard
deviation,
,
and can also be conveniently expressed as a
function of the coefficient of variation,
according to the following formula:
.

This makes it clear that, when assuming a
lognormal model, the skewness cannot be
changed independently of the coefficient of
variation.
99 As energy requirements are provided as a
function of body masses, the median height
of an individual in a group is used to
estimate the minimum body mass
compatible with healthy status for the typical
individual in that group. We do so by
considering the weight that would yield a
body mass index equal to the fifth percentile
of the distribution of normal body mass
indexes, according to the WHO.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2012

Key messages

NOTES for Annex 1

The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012 presents
new estimates of the number and proportion of
undernourished people going back to 1990, defined in
terms of the distribution of dietary energy supply. With
almost 870 million people chronically undernourished in
2010–12, the number of hungry people in the world
remains unacceptably high. The vast majority live in
developing countries, where about 850 million people,
or slightly fewer than 15 percent of the population,
are estimated to be undernourished.

Economic and agricultural growth should be
“nutrition-sensitive”. Growth needs to result in better
nutritional outcomes through enhanced opportunities for
the poor to diversify their diets; improved access to safe
drinking water and sanitation; improved access to health
services; better consumer awareness regarding adequate
nutrition and child care practices; and targeted
distribution of supplements in situations of acute
micronutrient deficiencies. Good nutrition, in turn, is key
to sustainable economic growth.

Improved undernourishment estimates, from 1990,
suggest that progress in reducing hunger has been more
pronounced than previously believed.

Social protection is crucial for accelerating hunger
reduction. First, it can protect the most vulnerable who
have not benefited from economic growth. Second, social
protection, properly structured, can contribute directly to
more rapid economic growth through human resource
development and strengthened ability of the poor,
especially smallholders to manage risks and adopt
improved technologies with higher productivity.

Most of the progress, however, was achieved before
2007–08. Since then, global progress in reducing hunger
has slowed and levelled off.
The revised results imply that the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the
prevalence of undernourishment in the developing world
by 2015 is within reach, if appropriate actions are taken
to reverse the slowdown since 2007–08.
Despite significant improvements this year to the FAO
methodology for estimating undernourishment, further
improvements and better data are needed to capture the
effects of food price and other economic shocks.
Therefore, the undernourishment estimates do not fully
reflect the effects on hunger of the 2007–08 price spikes
or the economic slowdown experienced by some
countries since 2009, let alone the recent price increases.
Other indicators are also needed to provide a more
holistic assessment of undernourishment and food
security.
In order for economic growth to enhance the nutrition of
the neediest, the poor must participate in the growth
process and its benefits: (i) Growth needs to involve
and reach the poor; (ii) the poor need to use the
additional income for improving the quantity and quality
of their diets and for improved health services; and
(iii) governments need to use additional public resources
for public goods and services to benefit the poor and
hungry.
Agricultural growth is particularly effective in reducing
hunger and malnutrition. Most of the extreme poor
depend on agriculture and related activities for a
significant part of their livelihoods. Agricultural growth
involving smallholders, especially women, will be most
effective in reducing extreme poverty and hunger when it
increases returns to labour and generates employment
for the poor.

To accelerate hunger reduction, economic growth needs
to be accompanied by purposeful and decisive public
action. Public policies and programmes must create a
conducive environment for pro-poor long-term economic
growth. Key elements of enabling environments include
provision of public goods and services for the
development of the productive sectors, equitable access
to resources by the poor, empowerment of women, and
design and implementation of social protection systems.
An improved governance system, based on transparency,
participation, accountability, rule of law and human
rights, is essential for the effectiveness of such policies
and programmes.

Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the
latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the United
Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of
undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to
changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of The State of
Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data published in
editions for different years.

Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy

harmonized methodology and are based on the latest globally
available data averaged over three years. Some countries may have
more recent data which, if used, could lead to different estimates of
the prevalence of undernourishment and consequently of the progress
achieved.
The latest report period refers to 2010–12 provisional estimates and
the baseline refers to 1990–92. For countries that did not exist in the
baseline period, the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based
on 1993–95 and the number of undernourished is based on this
proportion applied to their 1990–92 population.

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient
to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition
The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012 presents new estimates of
undernourishment based on a revised and improved methodology. The new
estimates show that progress in reducing hunger during the past 20 years has
been better than previously believed, and that, given renewed efforts, it may be
possible to reach the MDG hunger target at the global level by 2015. However, the
number of people suffering from chronic undernourishment is still unacceptably
high, and eradication of hunger remains a major global challenge.
This year’s report also discusses the role of economic growth in reducing
undernourishment. Economic growth is most effective in reducing poverty and
hunger when it increases employment and income-earning opportunities that the
poor can take advantage of. Sustainable agricultural growth is often effective in
reaching the poor because most of the poor and hungry live in rural areas and
depend on agriculture for a significant part of their livelihoods. However, growth
will not necessarily result in better nutrition for all. Policies and programmes that
will ensure “nutrition-sensitive” growth include supporting increased dietary
diversity, improving access to safe drinking water, sanitation and health services
and educating consumers regarding adequate nutrition and child care practices.
Economic growth takes time to reach the poor, and may not reach the poorest of
the poor. Therefore, social protection is crucial for eliminating hunger as rapidly as
possible. Furthermore, when properly structured, social protection also promotes
economic growth by building human capital and helping farmers manage risk so
that they can adopt improved technologies. Finally, rapid progress in reducing
hunger requires government action to provide key public goods and services within
a governance system based on transparency, participation, accountability, rule of
law and human rights.
