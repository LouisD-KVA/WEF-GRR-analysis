KEY MESSAGES
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition 2016–2025 call on all countries and
stakeholders to act together to end hunger and
prevent all forms of malnutrition by 2030.

Wasting affected one in twelve (52 million) of
all children under five years of age in 2016,
more than half of whom (27.6 million) live in
Southern Asia.
Multiple forms of malnutrition coexist, with
countries experiencing simultaneously high rates
of child undernutrition, anaemia among
women, and adult obesity. Rising rates of
overweight and obesity add to these concerns.
Childhood overweight and obesity are
increasing in most regions, and in all regions
for adults. In 2016, 41 million children under
five years of age were overweight.

This year’s edition of The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World marks the
beginning of a regular monitoring of progress
towards achieving the food security and nutrition
targets set by the 2030 Agenda.
In 2016 the number of chronically
undernourished people in the world is estimated
to have increased to 815 million, up from
777 million in 2015 although still down from
about 900 million in 2000.

The number of conflicts is also on the rise.
Exacerbated by climate-related shocks, conflicts
seriously affect food security and are a cause of
much of the recent increase in food insecurity.

After a prolonged decline, this recent increase
could signal a reversal of trends. The food
security situation has worsened in particular in
parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia
and Western Asia, and deteriorations have been
observed most notably in situations of conflict and
conflict combined with droughts or floods.

Conflict is a key driver of situations of severe
food crisis and recently re-emerged famines,
while hunger and undernutrition are significantly
worse where conflicts are prolonged and
institutional capacities weak.

The apparent halt to declining hunger numbers
is not yet reflected in the prevalence of child
stunting, which continues to fall, though the pace
of improvement is slower in some regions.

Addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in
conflict-affected situations cannot be “business
as usual”. It requires a conflict-sensitive
approach that aligns actions for immediate
humanitarian assistance, long-term development
and sustaining peace.

Globally, the prevalence of stunting fell from
29.5 percent to 22.9 percent between 2005
and 2016, although 155 million children under
five years of age across the world still suffer from
stunted growth.

This report sends a clear warning signal that
the ambition of a world without hunger and
malnutrition by 2030 will be challenging –
achieving it will require renewed efforts through
new ways of working.

FOREWORD
FOREWORD

worrisome finding is that after a prolonged
decline, the most recent estimates indicate
that global hunger increased in 2016 and
now affects 815 million people. Moreover,
although still well below levels of a decade
ago, the percentage of the global population
estimated to be suffering from hunger also
increased in 2016. In parts of the world, this
recent surge in hunger reached an extreme
level, with a famine declared in areas of
South Sudan in early 2017 and alerts of high
risk of famine issued for three other contexts
(northeast Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen).

The transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development calls on all
countries and stakeholders to work together to
end hunger and prevent all forms of
malnutrition by 2030. This ambition can only
be fulfilled if agriculture and food systems
become sustainable, so that food supplies
are stable and all people have access to adequate
nutrition and health. The start of
the 2030 Agenda coincided with the launch of
the United Nations Decade of Action on
Nutrition (2016 –2025), adding impetus to these
commitments by providing a time-bound,
cohesive framework for action.

In 2016, the food securit y situation
deteriorated sharply in parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Western Asia.
This was most notable in situations of conf lict,
in particular where the food securit y impacts
of conf lict were compounded by droughts or
f loods, linked in part to the El Niño
phenomenon. However, worsening food
securit y conditions have also been obser ved in
more peaceful settings, especially where
economic slowdown has drained foreignexchange and fiscal revenues, affecting both
food availabilit y through reduced import
capacit y and food access through reduced
fiscal space to protect poor households against
rising domestic food prices.

This year’s edition of The State of Food Security
and Nutrition in the World marks the
beginning of a new era in monitoring the
progress made towards achieving a world
without hunger and malnutrition, within the
framework of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Specifically, the report will
henceforth monitor progress towards both the
targets of ending hunger (SDG Target 2.1)
and all forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2).
It will also include thematic analyses of how
food security and nutrition are related to
progress on other SDG targets. Given the
broadened scope to include a focus on
nutrition, UNICEF and the World Health
Organization (WHO) have joined the
traditional partnership of FAO, IFAD and
WFP in preparing this annual report.
We hope our expanded partnership will
result in a more comprehensive and integral
understanding of what it will take to end
hunger and all forms of malnutrition,
and in more-integrated actions to achieve
this critical goal.

The rising trend in undernourishment has not
yet been reflected in rates of child stunting,
which continue to fall. Nonetheless, the world
is still home to 155 million stunted children.
Levels of child stunting are still unacceptably
high in some regions, and if current trends
continue, the SDG target on reducing child
stunting by 2030 will not be reached. Wasting
also continues to threaten the lives of almost
52 million children (8 percent of children under
five years of age), while childhood overweight

factors that undermine food security and

societies (SDG 16) is a necessary condition to
that end.

and obesity rates are on the rise in most
regions and in all regions for adults – all of
which highlights the multiple burden of
malnutrition as a cause for serious concern.
The failure to reduce world hunger is closely
associated with the increase in conflict and
violence in several parts of the world. Part 2 of
this year’s report attempts to provide a clearer
understanding of the nexus between conflict
and food security and nutrition, and to
demonstrate why efforts at fighting hunger must
go hand-in-hand with those to sustain peace.
Over the past decade, conflicts have risen
dramatically in number and become more
complex and intractable in nature. Some of the
highest proportions of food-insecure and
malnourished children are found in countries
affected by conflict, a situation that is even
more alarming in countries characterized by
prolonged conflicts and fragile institutions. This
has set off alarm bells we cannot afford to
ignore: we will not end hunger and all forms of

We are more determined and committed than
ever to step up concerted action to fulfil the
ambitions of the 2030 Agenda and achieve a
world free from hunger, malnutrition and poverty.
Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is an
ambitious goal, but it is one we strongly believe
can be reached if we strengthen our common
efforts and work to tackle the underlying causes
that leave so many people food-insecure,
jeopardizing their lives, futures, and the futures
of their societies. It is clear that conflict is a
significant challenge to meeting this goal and
will require multisector humanitarian,
development and peace strategies that address
immediate needs while making the necessary
investments to build resilience for lasting peace
and food security and nutrition for all.

è After a prolonged decline, world hunger

appears to be on the rise again. The estimated
number of undernourished people increased
to 815 million in 2016, up from 777 million
in 2015.

è Much of the recent increase in food insecurity
can be traced to the greater number of conflicts,
often exacerbated by climate-related shocks.

è Even in some peaceful settings, food security
has deteriorated as economic slowdowns
challenge access to food for the poor.

è The worrying trend in undernourishment is not
yet reflected in levels of chronic child malnutrition
(stunting), which continue to fall – but at a slower
rate in several regions.

è Despite the decline, in 2016 stunting still

affected one out of four children under the age
of five years, or 155 million children. In some
regions, stunting affects one-third of children
under five.

ON THE RISE AGAIN

number of violent conflicts around the world has
increased significantly, hitting rural communities
the hardest. More conflict is thus driving greater
food insecurity, fuelling hotbeds of violence and
creating new ones. The situation has also
deteriorated in some peaceful settings, particularly
those affected by economic slowdowns. A number
of countries heavily dependent on commodity
exports have suffered dramatically reduced export
and fiscal revenues in recent years, which has
affected both food availability through reduced
import capacity and food access through reduced
fiscal potential to protect poor households against
rising domestic food prices. n

In 2016, the number of undernourished people in
the world increased to an estimated 815 million,
up from 777 million in 2015 but still down from
about 900 million in the year 2000. Similarly,
while the prevalence of undernourishment is
projected to have increased to an estimated
11 percent in 2016, this is still well below the
level of a decade ago. Nonetheless, the recent
increase is cause for great concern and poses a
significant challenge for international
commitments to end hunger by 2030.

CHILD UNDERNUTRITION
CONTINUES TO DECLINE,
BUT LEVELS OF
OVERWEIGHT ARE
INCREASING

It is not yet clear whether this recent uptick in
hunger and food-insecurity levels signals the
beginning of an upward trend, or whether it
reflects an acute transient situation. However,
reductions in the levels and degree of
undernourishment have slowed significantly since
2010. This sobering news comes in a year in which
famine was declared in one country (South Sudan)
and crisis-level food insecurity situations at risk of
turning into famines were identified in several
others (including Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen).

The worrisome trend in undernourishment
indicators is, however, not reflected in nutritional
outcomes. Evidence on various forms of
malnutrition (outlined further below) points to
continued decreases in the prevalence of child
stunting, as reflected in global and regional
averages. However, stunting still affects almost
one in four children under the age of five years,
increasing their risk of impaired cognitive ability,
weakened performance at school and work, and
dying from infections. At the same time,
overweight among children under five is becoming
more of a problem in most regions, and adult
obesity continues to rise in all regions. Multiple
forms of malnutrition therefore coexist, with
countries experiencing simultaneously high rates
of child undernutrition and adult obesity.

The food security situation has visibly worsened in
parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern
and Western Asia, as detailed in Part 1 of this
report. Deteriorations have been observed most
notably in situations of conflict, often
compounded by droughts or floods (linked in part
to the El Niño phenomenon). Part 2 of this report
analyses in depth how conflict affects food
security and how food insecurity itself can become
a trigger for conflict. Over the past ten years, the

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

It may be difficult to make sense of a situation
in which food securit y in terms of the estimated
adequacy of dietar y energ y intake is
deteriorating globally, though child
undernutrition (stunting) is falling and adult
obesit y is rising. However, food securit y is but
one determinant of nutritional outcomes,
especially for children. Other factors include:
women’s educational level; resources allocated
to national policies and programmes for
maternal, infant and young child nutrition;
access to clean water, basic sanitation and
qualit y health ser vices; lifest yle; food
environment; and culture. More context-specific
assessments are needed to identif y the links
between household food securit y and nutrition
and the causes underlying the apparent
divergence in the most recent food securit y and
nutritional trends. However, overall, these
recent estimates are a warning signal that
achieving the goal of a world without hunger
and malnutrition by 2030 will be challenging.
Accomplishing it will require sustained
commitment and efforts to promote adequate
availabilit y of and access to nutritious food. n

aim set by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development (2030 Agenda). The second
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) calls
on countries to “end hunger, achieve food
securit y and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture” by 2030. Composed of
eight targets, SDG 2 unites hunger, food
securit y, nutrition and sustainable agriculture
under a single objective, compelling the
international communit y to move towards an
understanding of how they are interrelated
and promoting integrated policy approaches
and actions. The start of the 2030 Agenda
coincided with the launch of the United
Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition
(2016 –2025), adding impetus to joint efforts at
eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of
malnutrition worldwide.
Part 1 of this report monitors progress
towards ensuring access to food for all (SDG
Target 2.1), and putting an end to all forms of
malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). For the first
time, this year’s report provides two measures
of food insecurit y. FAO’s traditional indicator
of the extent of hunger, the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU), is complemented
by the prevalence of severe food insecurity,
which is estimated based on data collected
from adult individuals worldwide using the
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES).
The FIES is a new tool, based on direct
inter views, to measure people’s abilit y to
access food. In addition, the report assesses
the trends for six nutrition indicators,
including three SDG 2 indicators of child
malnutrition (stunting, wasting and
overweight). The assessment further aims to
generate a better understanding of the
connections between the first two SDG 2
targets and the action needed to achieve them.
Given its enhanced scope, the traditional

partnership of FAO, IFAD and W FP in
preparing this report has been expanded to
bring in the knowledge and expertise of
UNICEF and W HO as well.
Part 2 of the report links progress towards
improved food securit y and nutrition to
other SDGs. Given recent global trends, this
year’s focus is on the nexus between SDG 2
and SDG 16 – that is, between conf lict, food
securit y and peace. This shows not only how
conf lict affects food securit y and nutrition,
but also how improved food securit y and
more-resilient rural livelihoods can prevent
conf lict and contribute to lasting peace. n

TARGET 2.1

“By 2030, end hunger and ensure access
by all people, in particular the poor and
people in vulnerable situations, including
infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food all year round.”

BOX 1

REVISION OF PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT (PoU)
ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS FOR 2016
These updates and revisions allow for reliable
annualized PoU estimates at the global and
regional level, replacing the three-year averages
of previous publications.
A lack of more recent FBS data required
estimating the PoU for 2016 as follows: the mean
and the coefficient of variation of habitual food
consumption were projected based on two pieces
of auxiliary information. First, mean dietary
consumption levels were updated using commodity
balances available from FAO’s Trade and
Commodities Division (XCBS database). Second,
evidence provided by the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale data collected in 2014, 2015
and 2016 was used to estimate changes in the
coefficient of variation underlying the PoU
estimates for 2016. These projections were
performed for global, regional and subregional
aggregates only, as doing so at the country level
would be subject to larger margins of error. For
this reason, this report does not present single-year
estimates for the PoU at the country level – instead,
Annex Table A1.1 (p. 76) presents three-year
averages at the country level.

FAO continually tries to improve the reliability of the
PoU estimates, which are derived from official country
data on food supply, food consumption, and energy
needs (taking into consideration demographic
characteristics such as age, sex and levels of physical
activity).1 The PoU estimates presented in this report
reflect several updates and revisions of those
presented in past The State of Food Insecurity in the
World reports. The most important are:
 updated estimates of the dietary energy supply
(DES) for 2014 and 2015, based on food balance
sheets (FBS) available for those years;
 more accurate annual estimates of the DES for a
number of countries, resulting from thorough revisions
of the methodology used to compile the FBS;
 updated estimates of the distribution of habitual food
consumption within national populations (measured
through the coefficient of variation), using microdata
from national household surveys for 51 countries;
 updated estimates of the range of normal
requirements for the average individual in a country,
based on new data on the median height in each
sex and age group of the population, derived from
demographic and health surveys.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

Published since 1974, the PoU is the
internationally established indicator to measure
hunger and food insecurit y (see Box 1). As such,
the PoU has been endorsed by the United Nations
Economic and Social Council as an indicator for
monitoring SDG Target 2.1 at the global level.

date – with the latest observed estimates available
for 2016 – while the PoU is derived from data
typically available only after a delay of several years.

Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU)
The most recent PoU estimates (see Table 1) show
that, despite significant population growth, the
share of undernourished people in the world
decreased from 14.7 percent in 2000 to
10.8 percent in 2013 (Figure 1). However, this rate
of reduction has slowed significantly recently,
coming to a virtual halt between 2013 and 2015.
Most worr yingly, FAO estimates for 2016 indicate
that the global prevalence of undernourishment
in 2016 may have actually risen to 11 percent,
implying a return to the level reached in 2012 and
suggesting a possible reversal of the downward
trend sustained over recent decades.

FAO has recently developed a new tool to
complement the information provided by the PoU:
the FIES. Based on data collected directly from
representative samples of individuals in almost
150 countries across the world, this tool measures
people’s ability to obtain adequate food. For the first
time, therefore, this year’s report publishes an
indicator of severe food insecurity. This measure
approximates the PoU, as both indicators reflect the
extent of severe food deprivation; however, they are
based on different sources of data and
methodologies. The FIES estimates are more up-to-

The deterioration was most severe in sub-Saharan

The stagnation of the global average of the PoU

of the population in 2016. The situation is especially
urgent in Eastern Africa, where one-third of the
population is estimated to be undernourished – the
subregion’s PoU increased from 31.1 percent in 2015
to 33.9 percent in 2016. The Caribbean
(17.7 percent) and Asia (11.7 percent overall, with
peaks of 14.4 percent in Southern Asia) also
continue to show a high PoU. In Asia, the most
visible uptick in undernourishment was in
South-Eastern Asia, increasing from 9.4 percent to
11.5 percent from 2015 to 2016, to return near levels
reached in 2011. In contrast, levels remain low in
Latin America, although there are signs that the
situation may be deteriorating, especially in
South America, where the PoU climbed from
5 percent in 2015 to 5.6 percent in 2016.

FAO estimates that in 2016 almost 520 million
people in Asia, more than 243 million in Africa,
and more than 42 million in Latin America and
the Caribbean did not have access to sufficient
food energ y (Figure 2).
The recent increase in the prevalence of
undernourishment is also confirmed by other
data sources (see Box 2). It can be attributed to a
variet y of factors. New information from food
commodit y balances for many countries points to
recent reductions in food availabilit y and
increases in food prices in regions affected by
El Niño / La Niña-related phenomena – most
notably in Eastern and Southern Africa and in
South-Eastern Asia. In addition, the number of
conf licts has increased in the past decade, in
particular in countries already facing high food
insecurit y and with much of the related violence »

Owing in part to the size of its population, the
highest number of undernourished people is in Asia.

ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE ON WHERE FOOD INSECURITY IS ON THE RISE
The ICAs are carried out in countries with chronic
food insecurity that are susceptible to shocks. In 2017,
there were 17 such countries as defined by WFP and
for which time series data were available dating prior
to 2012. A simple piece-wise regression model was
constructed from the combined country data, which
revealed a statistically significant inversion of the
linear trend from mid-2014. While this analysis of
17 countries with chronic food insecurity cannot be
seen as representative of the global trend, it is
consistent with the projected increase in the PoU
described in this report.

The World Food Programme (WFP) conducts
integrated context analyses (ICAs), combining
historical trends of food insecurity indicators with
information on natural shocks and land
degradation to estimate the size and location of
food-insecure populations. The key indicators used
by WFP to measure food insecurity are the food
consumption score and the consolidated approach
for reporting indicators. The latter combines FCS
estimates with measures of coping behaviour in
response to conditions of food and/or
income deprivation.

THE FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE SCALE: ORIGINS AND INDICATORS
and producing measures that can be meaningfully
compared across countries for global monitoring.2
FAO calculates two indicators based on the
FIES methodology: one of the prevalence of food
insecurity in the population that includes both
moderate and severe levels (FImod+sev),3 and
one that refers to severe levels only (FIsev).
The latter is presented in this year’s report.
Thresholds are defined with reference to the
global FIES scale, and the analytic procedures
used to compile the indicators ensure that their
values are comparable across countries.2 People
experiencing moderate levels of food insecurity
will typically have lower-quality diets and may at
times during the year have been forced to also
reduce the quantity of food they would normally
eat; those experiencing severe levels would have
gone for entire days without eating due to lack of
money or other resources.
The ideal source of FIES data is large population
surveys conducted by national institutions, enabling
more detailed, policy-relevant analyses of the
food-insecurity situation by income, gender, age,
race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability,
geographic location, or other policy-relevant
characteristics. This is already the case in a growing
number of countries.
Given that few countries to date have collected
FIES data in national surveys, FAO has produced
provisional baseline country estimates for more than
140 countries using data commissioned to be
collected through the Gallup® World Poll. As the UN
Statistical Commission determined that, when sources
other than official national statistics are used for SDG

The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) is an
experience-based metric of the severity of food
insecurity, relying on direct yes/no responses to
eight questions regarding access to adequate
food. Inspired by evidence from two decades of
applying similar measurement tools in many
countries, FAO developed this analytical
methodology to obtain valid and reliable
population estimates of food insecurity that are
comparable across different countries and cultures.
The FIES survey module is a direct derivation of
the United States Household Food Security Survey
Module and the Escala Latinoamericana y
Caribeña de Seguridad Alimentaria. Respondents
are asked about experiences associated with the
inability to access food, including whether they
have at any time during the previous 12 months,
due to lack of money or other resources: been
worried about not being able to obtain enough
food; been forced to decrease the quality or
quantity of the food they eat; gone for entire days
without eating (for more details see the
Methodological notes in Annex 1).
The questions refer to experiences associated
with different levels of food insecurity severity,
forming a measurement scale when analytical tools
based on Item Response Theory are applied.
Researchers and institutions have been using
questionnaires with similar sets of questions in
countries around the world for more than 20 years,
and it has been shown that they reflect so-called
domains of the experience of food insecurity that
are common across cultures.1 This provided the
foundation for defining a global reference scale

The reason the percentage of moderate food insecurity only is not used as an
indicator for global monitoring is because a change in this percentage would be prone
to ambiguous interpretation; a reduction in moderate food insecurity could be due to
the movement of some of those who were suffering from moderate food insecurity into
the severe category. Combining the moderate and severe food insecurity categories
avoids such ambiguity.

COMPARISON OF ESTIMATES FOR PoU AND SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY
BASED ON THE FIES
While both are measures of the extent of
severe food deprivation in the population,
they are based on very different methods and
sources of data. In the figure, countries are
ranked in order of increasing prevalence of
severe food insecurity, and for each country the
two estimates (FIES-based severe food insecurity
and the PoU) are vertically aligned, making it
possible to easily identify cases where the
two diverge.

The figure illustrates the comparison between the
estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment
(PoU) and the percentage of people affected by
severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES). It can help identify
countries where current data problems may be
leading to biased estimates of one or the other.
Using results for the 129 countries for which both
estimates were available for 2014–16, a strong
correlation is found between the two indicators.

reflect short-term fluctuations in countries’ economic
and social conditions. Meanwhile, owing to a lack
of recent household survey data for many countries,
PoU estimates might not reflect recent changes in
access to food. This could explain the differences
noted in countries in Northern Africa and the
Near East, for example. For some countries in Asia
(area C) where there is a large difference, the
prevalence of food insecurity as measured by the
FIES may be underestimated owing to a possible
under-reporting of food hardship in some Asian
countries – an issue that will deserve close attention
in future research aimed at improving the reliability
of FIES-based estimates.

Analysing the comparison in greater detail by
region, the PoU (coloured dots) is found to be
significantly lower than the prevalence of severe
food insecurity (blue triangles) for a number of
countries in Africa (areas A and B), and significantly
higher for a few countries in Asia (area C). Area A
includes countries in Northern Africa. For the
countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (area B), the
higher estimates of the prevalence of severe food
insecurity for 2014–16 may reflect an improved
ability of the FIES-based indicator to reflect the
impact of three consecutive years of drought in these
countries. These impacts might not yet be fully
captured in current PoU estimates, and will probably
only be reflected in these countries’ food balance
sheets that will be available in the coming years.

sub-Saharan Africa, with an increase of almost
three percentage points from 2014 to 2016.
Higher food insecurit y was also obser ved in
Latin America over the three-year period,
rising from 4.7 percent to 6.4 percent.

TARGET 2.2

“By 2030, end all forms of
malnutrition, including achieving, by
2025, the internationally agreed
targets on stunting and wasting in
children under five years of age,
and address the nutritional needs of
adolescent girls, pregnant and
lactating women and older persons.”

In Asia, the prevalence of severe food
insecurit y decreased slightly between 2014 and
2016, from 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent overall,
driven mainly by the reduction obser ved in
Central Asia and Southern Asia.
As the FIES sur vey was administered to
individual respondents, one important feature
is that the results can be analysed at the
individual level. This makes it possible to
compare food-insecurit y levels among men
and women, inter alia, with three-year
averages showing that the prevalence of food
insecurit y was slightly higher among women
at the global level as well as in ever y region of
the world (Figure 3). n

Sustainable Development Goal 2, Target 2.2,
calls for an end to “all forms of malnutrition”
by 2030, as does the UN Decade of Action on
Nutrition (Box 5). Malnutrition ranges from severe
undernutrition to overweight and obesity. It affects
populations throughout the lifecycle, from
conception through childhood, into adolescence,
adulthood and older age. Malnutrition may be a
reflection of deficiencies in macronutrients

BOX 5

UNITED NATIONS DECADE OF ACTION ON NUTRITION
regional and international policies and programmes to
respect, protect and fulfil “the right of everyone to
have access to safe, sufficient, and nutritious food,
consistent with the right to adequate food and the
fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”,
in line with the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant United
Nations instruments.
The primary objective of the Decade of Action on
Nutrition is to increase nutrition investments and
implement policies and programmes to improve food
security and nutrition within the ICN2 framework.1 The
achievement of other SDGs depends on improved
nutritional outcomes, as improved nutrition is essential
for people’s health, learning and income-earning
abilities, as well as other social and economic
capacities. The Decade of Action on Nutrition provides
an opportunity for all partners to work together,
mobilize action and accelerate efforts towards
eliminating hunger, food insecurity and all forms of
malnutrition, meeting the SDGs by 2030.

In April 2016, the UN General Assembly endorsed the
outcome documents of the Second International
Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), aimed at achieving
the global nutrition targets set by the World Health
Assembly, and declared the period 2016–2025 as the
United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The UN
General Assembly also called on FAO and WHO to
lead its implementation, in collaboration with the
World Food Programme, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development and the United Nations
Children’s Fund, using already-established coordination
mechanisms such as the United Nations System
Standing Committee on Nutrition and multistakeholder
platforms such as the Committee on World Food
Security. The Decade of Action on Nutrition marks a
new ambition and direction with a view to eradicating
hunger and ending all forms of malnutrition, providing
a clearly defined, time-bound, cohesive framework to
implement the ICN2 commitments, along with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Moreover, it
provides an enabling environment for national,

Stunting among children under five years
of age

(carbohydrates, fats or proteins) or micronutrients
(vitamins and minerals). It can be acute – resulting
from an immediate crisis in food accessibility,
inadequate nutrient intake and/or infection – or
chronic, with cumulative deleterious effects over
sustained periods. On the other hand, an excessive
intake of food and calories and/or limited energy
expenditure results in increased body weight and
fat accumulation, which can lead to diet-related
non-communicable diseases and other health
problems. Undernutrition, overweight and their
associated non-communicable diseases now coexist
in many regions, countries and even households.
Six nutrition indicators – three that form part of the
SDG monitoring framework, and three that refer to
global nutrition targets agreed by the World Health
Assembly (WHA) – are described below to better
understand the multiple burden of malnutrition,
which affects all regions in the world.

Children’s linear growth in the first five years
of life is assessed by the stunting indicator.
Stunting is evidence that children are too short
for their age, which in turn is a ref lection of a
chronic state of undernutrition. When children
are stunted before the age of two, they are at
higher risk of illness and more likely than
adequately nourished children to develop poor
cognitive skills and learning abilities in later
childhood and adolescence. This will affect
labour productivit y, income-earning potential
and social skills later in life, with
consequences beyond the individual level. If
widespread, stunting also drags down the
economic development of entire communities
and nations.

Stunting impedes the achievement of other SDG
targets related to child health, educational
attainment, and economic growth. Thus, SDG
Target 2.2 aims to reduce its prevalence by 2025.
Whereas the global nutrition target for stunting
adopted in 2012 by the W H A 3,4 is expressed in
terms of the total number of stunted children, the
SDG indicator measures the prevalence of
stunting: owing to population growth, the

number of stunted children can increase even as
there is a decrease in the prevalence of stunting.
Hence, it is important to assess trends in both
relative and absolute terms.

at a much slower rate. In fact, the rate of
decline in stunting in Africa has not kept pace

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

the number of stunted children has risen, with
Western Africa accounting for half of this
increase. The vast majorit y of stunted children
live in Asia (87 million) and Africa
(59 million) (Figure 4).

The internationally agreed global nutrition
target is to reduce and maintain childhood
wasting to below 5 percent by 2025. In 2016,
wasting affected 7.7 percent (51.7 million) of
children under five years of age worldwide.
About 17 million children suffered from severe
wasting. Southern Asia stands out with a high
prevalence of 15.4 percent – well above that of
any other subregion. At 8.9 percent, SouthEastern Asia is also far off target. While the
prevalence is somewhat lower in Africa, it still
stands above the global nutrition target
(Figure 5).

Among the key determinants of stunting are:
compromised maternal health and nutrition
before and during pregnancy and lactation,
inadequate breastfeeding, poor feeding practices
for infants and young children, and unhealthy
environments for children, including poor
hygiene and sanitation.
Accordingly, stunting (as well as wasting,
overweight and micronutrient deficiencies) can
be addressed through preventive actions,
including by ensuring that pregnant and
lactating mothers are adequately nourished,
that infants receive exclusive breastfeeding
during the first six months of life, and that
complementar y foods are available in adequate
quantities, qualit y, and variet y for children
aged 6 –23 months. To reduce stunting, it is
essential to focus nutrition inter ventions on
the first 1 000 days of life – from conception to
the age of two years – and improve access to
qualit y health ser vices for maternal and child
health. Other steps may be needed to prevent
infections and illnesses from negatively
affecting nutritional status, such as improving
access to safe water, awareness of safe disposal
of child faeces, and basic hygiene (e.g. access
to soap).

Overweight among children under five years
of age

Wasting among children under five years
of age

Worldwide, an estimated 41 million children
(about 6 percent) under five were considered
overweight in 2016, up from 5 percent in 2005
(Figure 6). While this may seem a small increase,
most subregions show an upward trend. In 2016,
the prevalence of childhood overweight reached
almost 12 percent in Southern Africa, 11 percent
in Central Asia, 10 percent in Northern Africa,
8 percent in Northern America, and 7 percent in
South-Eastern Asia and South America. Only
Western Africa, South America and Eastern Asia
recorded slight declines between 2005 and 2016.
In Eastern Africa, the prevalence remained
constant at 4.7 percent. All other regions
registered increases in the prevalence of
childhood overweight, the fastest-rising being in
South-Eastern Asia and Oceania.

Childhood overweight, or being too heav y for
one’s height, ref lects a chronic process of
excessive weight gain. Overweight children are
at a higher risk of developing serious health
problems, including t y pe 2 diabetes, high blood
pressure, asthma and other respirator y problems,
sleep disorders and liver disease. Childhood
overweight also increases the risk of obesit y,
diet-related non-communicable diseases,
premature death, and disabilit y in adulthood.
The economic costs of the rising epidemics of
childhood overweight and obesit y are
considerable, both in terms of the enormous
financial strains on healthcare systems and of
lost productivit y. Reversing obesit y and
overweight is a serious challenge: the emphasis
must be on prevention.

Childhood wasting, or being too thin for
one’s height, ref lects a recent and acute
process that leads to weight loss and/or poor
weight gain. Wasting usually results from low
birth weight, inadequate diet, poor care
practices and infections. It is of critical
importance due to the consequent heightened
risk of disease and death. It will be difficult
to continue improving child sur vival without
investing in preventive inter ventions to
reduce the number of children suffering from
wasting, while ensuring timely and
appropriate life-saving treatment for children
affected by severe wasting.

Many children today are growing up in
obesogenic environments that encourage
unhealthy food preferences and inadequate
physical activit y patterns, which in turn lead to
weight gain and obesit y. Energ y imbalances
have resulted from changes in the availabilit y,
affordabilit y and marketing of highly processed
foods that are high in sugar and fats, often
combined with a decline in physical activit y
owing to more sedentar y lifest yles.

Obesity among adults

Obesit y in adults, or having more weight than
considered healthy, is a long-term consequence
of consuming more energ y than is expended.
It is a major risk factor for non-communicable
diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
diabetes and some cancers. Non-communicable
diseases represent the leading causes of death
and illness worldwide and contribute to social
| 18 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

processed foods are not necessarily unhealthy,
many contain high levels of saturated fats, salt
and sugars, and tend to be low in vitamins
and minerals. As a result, diets have become
less healthy. At the same time, income growth
and urbanization have led to more sedentar y
lifest yles, exacerbating imbalances in food
energ y intake and energ y use. Poor nutrition
in this sense of the word is now considered
the major risk factor for the global burden
of disease. 7

inequities. Available cost estimates also indicate
overweight and obesit y pose increasing burdens
on individuals, families, and societies. 5
While the SDG framework does not include a
specific indicator for adult obesit y, eliminating it
is included in the target to end all forms of
malnutrition. Reducing obesit y will be important
for achieving other SDG targets – such as
ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being
for all (Target 3.4) – as well as for reducing death
rates from non-communicable diseases through
prevention and treatment. 6

Anaemia in women of reproductive age

The global prevalence of obesit y more than
doubled between 1980 and 2014. In 2014, more
than 600 million adults were obese, equal to
about 13 percent of the world’s adult population.
The prevalence is higher on average among
women (15 percent) than men (11 percent).
While it varies widely across regions of the
world (Figure 7), the problem is most severe in
Northern America, Europe and Oceania, where
28 percent of adults are classified as obese,
compared with 7 percent in Asia and 11 percent
in Africa. In Latin America and the Caribbean,
roughly one-quarter of the adult population is
currently considered obese.

Anaemia occurs when red blood cells are low in
number and size, resulting in a state of
haemoglobin concentration that limits the
blood’s abilit y to transport ox ygen around the
body. This can be due to eating a diet that is
low in micronutrient content (e.g. iron, folate,
ribof lavin, and vitamins A and B12), acute
and/or chronic infections (e.g. malaria,
tuberculosis and HI V ), other chronic diseases
and cancer, or inherited genetic disorders that
affect haemoglobin synthesis, red blood-cell
production or red blood-cell sur vival. Anaemia
is thus an indicator of both poor nutrition and
poor health. Children and women are
particularly v ulnerable to anaemia.

Obesit y has steadily increased in all regions
since 1975, and the pace has accelerated in the
past ten years. Global adult obesit y rates
increased by an average of one percentage point
ever y three years between 2004 and 2014.
Historically, the prevalence of adult obesit y has
been much lower in Africa and Asia, where only
moderate increases were obser ved in the 1980s
and 1990s. More recently, however, obesit y has
spread rapidly among larger parts of the
population in these regions as well. Hence,
while many low- and middle-income countries
still face high levels of undernutrition and
prevalence of infectious, communicable
diseases, they are now also experiencing an
increasing burden of people suffering from
overweight and obesit y and an associated rise
in certain non-communicable diseases such
as diabetes.

Sustainable Development Goal Target 2.2
explicitly calls for the nutritional needs of
adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating
women to be addressed, as anaemia in women
of reproductive age is a public health concern.
The condition not only has significant adverse
health consequences for women and their
offspring, it can also affect social and economic
development. 8 When anaemia occurs during
pregnancy, it causes fatig ue, lowered
productivit y, increased risk of maternal and
perinatal mortalit y, low birth weight, and
anaemia and poor growth and development in
young children. Anaemia is therefore closely
linked to other SDG targets – lowering its
prevalence will help to reduce maternal
mortalit y (Target 3.1) and improve levels of
economic productivit y (Target 8.2). Meanwhile,
achieving universal health coverage (Target 3.8)
and increasing access to sexual and reproductive
healthcare (Target 5.6) would also contribute to
reducing the prevalence of anaemia.

» The most recent estimates for 2016 indicate that

related deaths each year.11 Moreover, there is
increasing evidence that breastfeeding decreases
the risk of overweight and obesit y later in life.12

anaemia affects 33 percent of women of
reproductive age globally (about 613 million
women between 15 and 49 years of age).
In Africa and Asia, the prevalence is highest at
over 35 percent (Figure 8). It is lowest in
Northern America and Europe, and Oceania
(below 20 percent).

Globally, 43 percent of infants younger than six
months were exclusively breastfed in 2016, up
from 36 percent in 2005.13 The prevalence of
exclusive breastfeeding was highest in Southern
Asia (59 percent) and Eastern Africa (57 percent).
It is much lower in Latin America and the
Caribbean (33 percent), Eastern Asia (28 percent),
Western Africa (25 percent), and Western Asia
(21 percent). Too few countries provided data on
exclusive breastfeeding to report a regional
average for Europe, North America or Oceania.

The global average of the prevalence of anaemia
in women of reproductive age increased slightly
between 2005 and 2016, although the increase
was not statistically significant. It declined from
42 percent to 38 percent in Africa and from
25 percent to 22 percent in Latin America and the
Caribbean, although this was offset by slight
increases in all other regions. In 2012, the W H A
set the target of halving the prevalence of
anaemia in women of reproductive age by 2025.
Progress so far has clearly been off track.

Between 2005 and 2015, the practice of exclusive
breastfeeding increased by at least 10 percentage
points in 36 out of 82 countries for which
comparable data were available (Figure 9). In some
countries (e.g. Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya
and Turkmenistan), the prevalence increased by
more than 35 percentage points, providing
evidence that it is feasible to achieve significant
gains in exclusive breastfeeding in a short period
of time. Overall, half of all countries in Africa with
trend data exhibited an increase of 10 percentage
points or more, and a greater proportion of
countries in that region made increases in excess of
20 percentage points when compared to Europe
or Latin America and the Caribbean. However, in
many countries, more still needs to be done to
improve breastfeeding practices. n

Exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six
months of age
Improved rates of breastfeeding directly
contribute to ending hunger and child
malnutrition, 9 and increasing the rate of exclusive
breastfeeding by up to 50 percent in the first six
months of life is one of the global nutrition
targets endorsed by the W H A. Exclusive
breastfeeding is part of optimal breastfeeding
practices, which also include initiation within the
first hour of life and continued breastfeeding up
to two years old or beyond. Breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child sur vival and development as
it provides essential irreplaceable nutrition for a
child’s physical and cognitive growth.
Breastfeeding helps to reduce child mortalit y,
improve nutritional status, prevent common
childhood illnesses and non-communicable
diseases, and improve development and learning.
It is considered to be the preventive inter vention
with the single largest impact on child sur vival.10
Breastfeeding also benefits mothers as it
promotes uterine contraction, helps prevent
postpartum haemorrhage, decreases the
likelihood of developing iron-deficiency anaemia,
and reduces the risk of various t ypes of cancer.

nutrition, health and well-being. The success of
efforts to improve diets will depend on a better
understanding of the complex relationships
between food securit y and nutrition, the food
systems in which they are embedded and the
social, political and economic forces shaping
them. The preliminar y analyses in this section
are intended to promote more integrated and
critical thinking on these issues.

There is ample evidence that food insecurit y
and malnutrition in all its forms have multiple
and diverse negative effects on health and wellbeing.14 Adverse impacts on mental health and
cognitive and behavioural effects in children
are also well documented. The nutrition
indicators discussed in the previous section
refer to different moments in the human life
cycle, helping to shed light on the consequences
| 22 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

The multiple burden of malnutrition

of food insecurit y and malnutrition for health
and development before birth, into infancy and
on to adulthood.

No countr y is free from malnutrition, and most
countries experience multiple burdens of
malnutrition. Typically, data on child
undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, child
overweight and adult obesit y are presented
separately. This section aims to shed some light
on the overlaps, as they ref lect the numerous
issues that countries are facing.

The coexistence of food insecurit y and obesit y –
even in the same household – is often seen as
paradoxical, but there are many explanations for
this. As resources for food become scarce, people
often choose to eat lower-cost, less-healthy,
more energ y-dense foods, choices that can lead
to people becoming overweight and obese as
their means to access healthy food diminish.

Out of 119 countries with comparable data for at
least 3 of the 6 nutrition indicators, only 2 (Japan
and the Republic of Korea) experienced just one
single form of malnutrition.15 Rates of prevalence of
childhood stunting are positively correlated with
childhood wasting and anaemia among women
(Figures 10A–B). Similarly, countries with a high
prevalence of childhood overweight also tend to
have a high prevalence of adult obesity, while in
countries that still have high rates of child stunting,
adult obesity tends to be lower (Figures 10C–D)16 .

Periodic episodes of food insecurit y and
deprivation can also lead to eating disorders and
stress-related metabolic responses. This can in
turn increase the risk of obesit y and noncommunicable chronic diseases such as cancer,
diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Food
insecurit y and poor nutrition during pregnancy
and childhood are also associated with
metabolic adaptations that increase the risk of
obesit y and associated non-communicable
chronic diseases in adulthood. Readily available
and accessible highly processed foods that are
high in fat, sugar and salt, and shifts away from
traditional diets toward convenience foods,
further help explain the coexistence of multiple
forms of malnutrition within the same
communities and households.

Although this cross-countr y analysis indicates
that lower prevalence of childhood stunting tends
to be found in countries with a higher rate of
adult obesit y, many countries have high rates of
both. For example, of the 107 countries with data
on both stunting in under-five year olds and
adult obesit y, 35 have a prevalence of more than
10 percent in under-five stunting as well as more
than 10 percent in adult obesit y. In three
countries (Eg ypt, Iraq and Vanuatu), more than
20 percent of the under-five population is stunted
and more than 20 percent of adults are obese.

While food insecurit y at the household or
individual level increases the risk of developing
various forms of malnutrition, there are many
mediating factors. All of the nutritional
outcomes analysed here are affected in
important ways by other elements, such as
educational level, lifest yle, food environment
and habits, and access to clean water, basic
sanitation and qualit y health ser vices. In turn,
undernutrition negatively affects cognitive
development and child growth, leading to
reduced levels of productivit y and
economic development.

Therefore, tackling malnutrition in all its forms
requires a countr y-specific combination of
measures that leverage multiple sectors to
address the underlying determinants of
malnutrition, and target nutrition inter ventions
to prevent or treat the direct determinants of
malnutrition. Countries make progress when
initiatives from multiple levels and sectors
converge and reinforce each other.

As more and improved data become available in
the years ahead, it will be possible to enhance
knowledge of the links between the food
securit y and nutrition indicators analysed
below, the factors that mediate these links, and
the actions needed to simultaneously promote
both food securit y and better nutrition.

Food insecurity and the multiple burden of
malnutrition
Food insecurit y, or the inabilit y of households
and individuals to access food of adequate
quantit y and qualit y, is an important determinant

of malnutrition. However, exploring the causal
relationships between food insecurity and nutrition
outcomes requires detailed information at the
household – or even better, individual – level.17 As a
preliminary step, a simple cross-country analysis
was performed to explore the relationships between
PoU and nutritional indicators.

foods, and are also at higher risk of eating
disorders and stress-related metabolic
responses, all of which can lead to obesit y. n

The results show that countries with higher
levels of undernourishment also show higher
levels of stunting and wasting. In contrast,
higher levels of undernourishment are
associated with lower levels of child overweight
and adult obesit y.

STRENGTHENING
THE EVIDENCE BASE
TO MONITOR
FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION

The results in Table 3 suggest that adult obesit y is
more prevalent in countries with a low PoU.
Many Pacific Island countries and territories
are outliers, showing much higher adult obesit y
rates (in the range of 40 –50 percent) than those
of other countries with a similar prevalence of
undernourishment.

Bringing food security and nutrition under one
single goal in the 2030 Agenda has catalysed efforts
at coming to an integral understanding of these
fundamental ingredients of human well-being.
While ample data are already available, many more
are needed in order to come to a fuller
understanding. In particular, improved
coordination is needed at the national, regional and
global levels to produce data capable of shedding
more light on the links between food insecurity
and malnutrition and their determinants.

The negative association between food
insecurit y and obesit y is confirmed when using
cross-countr y data for the prevalence of severe
food insecurit y in the population as measured
with the FIES. However, the findings differ
when countries are grouped by income level.
This is consistent with the growing body of
literature showing that food insecurit y at the
household level is associated with obesit y.18
Among high- and upper-middle-income
countries, the adult obesit y rates are higher in
countries where the prevalence of severe
food insecurit y (measured by the FIES) is also
comparatively higher (Figure 11). Understanding
the reasons for this requires an analysis of the
association between food securit y and obesit y at
the household and individual level, as well as of
the multiple mediating factors. This is possible
when the FIES sur vey module is included in
national health and nutrition sur veys or in
household consumption and expenditure
sur veys. Existing evidence from higher-income
countries suggests that food-insecure people
rely on lower-cost, less-healthy, energ y-dense

The simple correlates presented in the previous
section suggest that when people face food
insecurit y, they are also likely to be at risk for
various forms of malnutrition. However,
nutritional outcomes are inf luenced by many
other factors as well, such as physical activit y,
lifest yle, food preferences, food environments,
women’s education, and access to clean water,
basic sanitation and qualit y health ser vices.
Incongruent timing in data collection is one of
the limitations of such countr y-level analysis of
food insecurit y and nutrition indicators. For

example, available data on child stunting and
wasting for many countries were collected in
years prior to the collection of FIES data. This
complicates analysis of the association between
food insecurit y and these two indicators. This
limitation may explain in part why the prevalence
of child stunting continues to show a decline
even as food insecurit y appears to be on the rise.
National sur veys that integrate the collection

evidence base. The hope is that including
food insecurit y and nutrition indicators in the
SDG monitoring framework will provide the
necessar y impetus for national governments,
international donors and development
partners to prioritize such data-collection
efforts to build a stronger evidence base. n

PROGRESS HAS SLOWED,
NEW CONCERNS HAVE
EMERGED

Malnutrition is not only the result of a lack of
access to sufficient, nutritious and safe food.
It also derives from a series of interlinked
factors related to inadequate access to
resources and ser vices, such as qualit y
healthcare, education, drinking-water,
sanitation and hygiene. Poor women often
face additional hurdles to access resources
and ser vices. Compelling evidence shows that
improving women’s education and status
within their households and communities has
a direct positive impact on food nutrition and
securit y, in particular child nutrition.

In summar y, the evidence presented in Part 1
reveals a global scenario of a possible recent
uptick in hunger. Child undernutrition has
continued to decline, but rates are still
unacceptably high in some regions. The
increasing prevalence of overweight among
children and the accelerated rise in obesit y
among adults are of major concern. Almost all
countries in the world are experiencing
multiple forms of malnutrition simultaneously,
and food insecurit y often coexists with obesit y.

Another increasingly important cause of food
insecurit y and malnutrition is conf lict.
People living in countries affected by conf lict
and violence are more likely to be food
insecure and malnourished, particularly in
those countries characterized by protracted
conf lict and fragile institutions.

Globally, cross-countr y analysis shows that
rates of adult obesit y are lower in countries
with higher rates of food insecurit y.
However, within the group of upper-middleand high-income countries, where more than
one-quarter of the adult population are obese,
the highest rates of obesit y are associated with
relatively higher rates of severe food insecurit y.
Childhood overweight is highest in Central
Asia and Northern Africa, suggesting future
problems with adult obesit y in these regions as
well. The regions most affected by nutritional
deficiencies are Africa and Asia, where more
than one in three women suffer from anaemia
and almost one-quarter of the population of
children under five are stunted.

Part 2 of this report takes a closer look at
the specific challenges facing these
countries, and the relationship between
hunger, conf lict and peace. It highlights the
need for conf lict-sensitive approaches to
improving food securit y and nutrition, based
on a deeper understanding of the dynamics
of conf lict in each context. More
fundamentally, it points to a need to find
lasting solutions to conf lict if the world is to
end hunger and achieve food securit y and
improved nutrition for all. n

The drivers behind these trends in food
insecurit y and malnutrition differ from
countr y to countr y and even within
countries. Food systems and diets are
changing. As large companies increasingly
dominate markets, highly processed foods
become more readily available, and
traditional foods and eating habits are
displaced. Weather-related events – in part

people today spend an average of more than
17 years in camps or with host communities. 21

Part 2 of this year’s The State of Food Security and
Nutrition in the World provides a review of the
evidence on how conflict affects food security and
nutrition, and how deteriorations in food security
conditions can exacerbate conflict, particularly
when combined with other factors. In addition, it
explores how conflict-sensitive approaches to food
security and nutrition can make a vital contribution
to sustaining peace and preventing conflict.

In 2016, more than 2 billion people were living in
countries affected by conflict, violence and fragility.
When the state, socio-economic systems and/or
local communities do not have the capacities to
prevent, cope with or manage situations of conflict,
the worst affected are generally the poorest and
most vulnerable sectors of society. The World Bank
and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) estimate that by 2030 high
population growth rates and weak economic
development could mean the poor will come to
represent half or more of the total population living
in fragile and conflict-affected situations. 22

WHY FOCUS ON THE
NEXUS BETWEEN
CONFLICT, FOOD
SECURITY AND
NUTRITION?

People living in countries affected by conflict are
more likely to be food insecure and
undernourished. The latest FAO estimates for
2016, as reported in Part 1, indicate that
815 million people in the world – or just over one
in nine – are undernourished. The majority of
these (489 million) live in countries struggling
with conflict, violence and fragility, where the
prevalence of undernourishment is higher than in
countries not affected by conflict. More strikingly,
while most countries have achieved significant
25-year gains in reducing hunger and
undernutrition, such progress has stagnated or
deteriorated in most countries experiencing
conflict. Conflict is a key factor explaining the
apparent reversal in the long-term declining trend
in global hunger, thereby posing a major challenge
to ending hunger and malnutrition. The number of
conflicts is increasing and the world is becoming
more violent, in increasingly intractable ways. 23
The 2016 Global Peace Index Report concluded
that the world is less peaceful now than it was in
2008, with year-on-year levels of peace having
declined in five out of the last eight years. 24

In 2016, more than 100 million people were
reported as facing crisis-level food insecurity, up
from 80 million the preceding year.19 In early 2017,
a famine was declared in South Sudan and alerts
were issued for high risk of famine-like conditions
in northeast Nigeria, in Somalia and in Yemen.
Conflict and civil war are common denominators
in all these cases, as they are in most other
countries facing food crises. Moreover, FAO
currently classifies 19 countries with a protracted
crisis (see Box 6). All 19 countries are also currently
affected by conflict and violence, which is typically
compounded by adverse climatic events, such as
prolonged droughts, that severely affect food
production and livelihoods.
Conflict and violence have led to the displacement
of millions of people, causing and protracting food
insecurity in host communities. For example, the
civil war in the Syrian Arab Republic has caused
more than 6 million people to flee their homes to
other locations within the country and another

EXTREME FRAGILITY: THE CASE OF PROTRACTED CRISES
two decades. In six contexts, conflict has been
ongoing for at least 18 of the last 20 years.
Most of these countries have witnessed multiple
types of conflict over time, with many experiencing
different forms simultaneously and/or overlapping but
in varying geographical locations. Almost all have
experienced periods of low-intensity conflict, often
combined with periods of higher-intensity violent conflict
(i.e. war or limited war). These conflicts cause higher
deaths rates, greater numbers of refugees / internally
displaced populations and more destruction of
infrastructure, housing, economy and culture.
However, conflict is not the only common
characteristic of protracted crisis situations. Most are also
characterized by very weak governance, breakdown of
local institutions, poor health of the affected populations,
and high prevalence of natural disasters.

FAO currently identifies 19 countries with a protracted
crisis situation. Of these, 14 have been in this category
since 2010, 11 of which are in Africa. Protracted
crises are contexts in which a significant proportion of
the population is acutely vulnerable to hunger, disease
and disruptions to livelihoods over prolonged periods.1
The 2010 and 2015 editions of The State of Food
Insecurity in the World identified countries with a
protracted crisis as deserving special attention, given
the extreme severity and persistence of food insecurity
and undernutrition they suffer.
Conflict and violence are key determinants of most
protracted crises. Almost all countries with a
protracted crisis have experienced some form of
violent conflict over prolonged periods (see Annex
Table A2.2, p. 105). These countries have suffered
from conflict for 10.5 years on average over the last

recognizes peace as a vital condition for
development, as well as a development outcome in
its own right. As conflicts can inhibit sustainable
development, food security and nutrition,
SDG 16 specifically aims to significantly reduce all
forms of violence, including by working with
countries and communities to find lasting
solutions to conflict and insecurity.

With the increasing concentration of hunger and
undernutrition in countries in fragile situations
and those affected by conf lict, it is imperative to
have a clearer understanding of the relationship
between hunger, conf lict and peace.
This understanding should then inform
conf lict-sensitive approaches 25 in designing
inter ventions and policies that address hunger
and undernutrition in such environments, while
providing incentives for sustaining peace.

The universality, breadth and indivisibility of the
SDGs have important implications for work on
food security and nutrition in conflict-affected
settings. SDGs 1 and 2 focus on the eradication of
extreme poverty and hunger, achieving food and
nutrition security, and making agriculture
sustainable. Achieving these goals is critical for
achieving SDG 16 and ensuring peaceful and
inclusive societies, leaving no one behind.
Correspondingly, achieving SDG 16 will be crucial
to meeting SDGs 1 and 2, as well as other SDGs.

between food securit y and nutrition, peace
and conf lict, and how reducing risks and
building resilience can contribute to
sustaining peace.

In April 2016, the United Nations General
Assembly and the United Nations Securit y
Council both adopted substantively identical
resolutions, concluding the 2015 review of the
UN Peacebuilding Architecture, which
covered peace operations, peacebuilding and
implementation of Resolution 1325. 26
Comprehensive and far-reaching, these
resolutions outline an ambitious new agenda
and approach that has sustaining peace as its

causes of conf lict. Across the UN, there is a
collective recommitment to promote peace
and prevent conf lict, building on and within

The changing landscape of conflicts:
implications for food security and nutrition
Although the frequency of wars had been
decreasing in recent decades to reach an
all-time low in 2005, there has recently been a
surge in the number of violent conf licts and
conf lict-related deaths. It is too early to
establish whether this represents a reversal of
the long period of peace that began with the
end of the Second World War, but there is a
consensus that several factors point to a
possible escalation of conf lict. 27
| 32 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

The number of conf licts and of displaced
populations caused by internal or intrastate
conf lict are two worr ying signs that current
trends are likely to continue over the coming
years. Violent conf licts have increased
dramatically since 2010 and are currently at
an all-time high (Figure 12). Of these, nonstate conf licts – between two organized
armed groups of which neither is the
government or a state – have increased by
125 percent since 2010, surpassing all other
t y pes of conf lict. State-based conf lict also
rose by over 60 percent in the same period. 28

Violence and conf lict are unevenly distributed
across continents, with most concentrated in
four regions: the Near East and North Africa,
northern sub-Saharan Africa, Central America,
and Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine.
However, violence and conf lict are spilling
across borders, and cross-border networks of
armed actors are enabling collaboration.
Many of the most protracted conf licts f low
across borders and are regional in nature,
including in the Horn of Africa, the Great
Lakes region of Africa, between Afghanistan,
India and Pakistan, and from Cameroon, Chad
and northern Nigeria across the Sahel.
Conf licts in Africa mapped over time and by
magnitude give a startling picture of their
cross-border and regional nature (Figure 13). 31

Civil wars or internal conf licts have now
surpassed the number of interstate or external
conf licts between states. In other words,
there has been a shift away from conf lict
between nations to conf licts within nations.
However, this trend is matched by a clear and
significant rise in the number of
internationalized internal conf licts. In 1991,
internationalized internal conf licts amounted
to just 3 percent of total conf licts, a number
that soared to 32.5 percent in 2014. 29 As
internal conf licts become more prominent,
external parties are increasingly likely to
become involved or to suffer the
consequences of violence; thus, local conf licts
evolve into regional or even
continental crises.

The nature and dynamics of conf licts and
violence are often changeable. Even in
seemingly calm post-conf lict contexts,
violence can resurge in a different form, in
another setting or with other actors involved.
Development outcomes, including food
securit y and nutrition, continue to deteriorate
in such contexts, particularly if the drivers
remain unaddressed, as this can prolong
conf licts and make them recurrent. 32
Experience shows that in some contexts the
perpetrators of violence can reappear in the
post-conf lict period to take economic and
political advantage of continued fragile and
v ulnerable environments. The Central
African Republic is an example of the
complexit y and intractabilit y of so-called
conf lict and violence traps and the impact
these have on food securit y and nutrition:
half of the population currently faces hunger,
which poses a threat not only to those
suffering but also to the stabilization process
in the entire countr y.

Coupled with large outflows of displaced
people, the entanglement of external
international actors in state conflicts shows
that even internal conflicts cannot be
quarantined, with their repercussions being felt
across borders and even continents. Similarly,
the implications of conflict-induced food
insecurity are no longer limited to specific
countries or regions – they are now global.
The number of refugees and internally
displaced persons (IDPs) has increased
significantly with the greater number of
conflicts, doubling from 2007 to 2016 to total
about 64 million people. There are now nine
countries with more than 10 percent of their
population classified as refugees or displaced
persons, with Somalia and South Sudan having
more than 20 percent of their population
displaced, and the Syrian Arab Republic more
than 60 percent displaced. 30

Many of today’s conf licts are localized, in that
they affect only certain areas or regions of a
countr y and thereby affect livelihoods on a
local scale. The ongoing low-intensit y
insurgency in the Casamance region in
Senegal, for example, is a highly localized
conf lict that affects only a ver y small portion
of the countr y and the intensit y of which
varies from year to year. 33

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

815 million chronically undernourished in 2016.

violence occur simultaneously in several
different locations, between different parties
and at var ying levels of intensit y. 34 In these
cases, the impact on food securit y and
nutrition can be significant and become
widespread, as witnessed in Afghanistan,
Burundi, the Central African Republic, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia,
South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and
Yemen. Where conf lict also persists over long
periods, livelihoods, food systems and
resilience become dangerously undermined,
creating a downward spiral that results in
extended and severe food and nutrition crises
(see Box 6).

This difference is even more pronounced for
child undernutrition. Almost 122 million, or
75 percent, of stunted children under age five
live in countries affected by conf lict, with the
difference in average prevalence between
conf lict and non-conf lict affected countries at
nine percentage points (Figure 15). 37 (The difference
is sixteen percentage points for the weighted
average.) However, conf lict is just one of the
inf luencing factors determining food securit y
and nutrition outcomes in these countries,
particularly where conf licts are localized.
Simple correlations between levels of food
insecurit y and conf lict do not explain the whole
picture, and a deeper analysis of the channels of
cause and effect is therefore called for.

More broadly, there is also a growing
recognition of the complex interaction
between conf lict and fragilit y. In the literature
on conf lict, weak institutional response
capacities tend to be captured under the term
fragilit y, a concept also sometimes used to
identif y countries affected by conf lict or at
high risk of falling into conf lict. Although
there are variations on the concept of fragilit y,
the term itself is important as it helps to
describe a countr y’s institutional strength
and, by extension, its potential resilience to
shocks and the violence that could otherwise
be triggered. 35 Fragilit y can provide an
indication not only of the future risk of
conf lict and violence, but also of the potential
prolongation of conf lict and the likelihood of
significant adverse impacts on livelihoods.
The analysis in this report applies the World
Bank’s definition of fragile situations
(see Annex 2).

As most conf licts today are internal and/or
localized, impacts on food securit y may not
necessarily spread to the entire population,
such that national averages of food securit y
and nutrition could underestimate the true
impact on the affected population. In addition,
the true impact of conf lict is mediated further
by other conditioning factors, such as the
response capacit y of governments and
institutions, as well as v ulnerabilit y to
natural hazards.
Figure 16 shows marked differences between the
prevalence of undernourishment among the
46 countries identified for the present analysis
as affected by conf lict during the period
1996 –2016. It clearly shows that conf lict
compounded by fragilit y and other stress
factors leading to protracted crises
substantially increases the likelihood of
undernourishment. The weighted average
prevalence of undernourishment in the
46 countries affected by conf lict is on average
between 1.4 and 4.4 percentage points higher
than for all other countries. Where
compounded by conditions of fragilit y, the
prevalence is between 11 and 18 percentage
points higher, 38 and for protracted crisis
situations the prevalence is about two anda
half times higher than for countries not
affected by conf lict.

Highest levels of food insecurity and
undernutrition are in countries in conflict
Simple correlations show higher levels of
chronic and acute food insecurit y and
undernutrition in countries affected by conf lict.
In 2016, the unweighted average of the
prevalence of undernourishment in countries
affected by conf lict was almost eight percentage
points higher than countries not affected by
conf lict (Figure 14). 36 (The difference is four
percentage points when weighting for
population size.) A salient finding is that the

with that made by other low- and middleincome countries over the same period. As a
whole, developing countries made significant

across regions and countries. 42

HOW DOES CONFLICT
AFFECT FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION?

severe levels of acute food insecurit y and in need
of urgent humanitarian assistance. 44
Problems of acute food insecurity and
malnutrition tend to be magnified where natural
hazards such as droughts and floods compound
the consequences of conflicts (see Table 4).
The concurrence of conflict and climate-related
natural disasters is likely to increase with climate
change, as climate change not only magnifies
problems of food insecurity and nutrition, but can
also contribute to a further downward spiral into
conflict, protracted crisis and continued fragility.

KEY MESSAGES:
è The adverse impacts of conflict on food security
and nutrition are unambiguous and well-documented.
è How conflict affects food security and nutrition is
highly dependent on context.

The degree to which conflict leads to acute and
chronic food insecurity is largely determined by how
it affects the lives and livelihoods of individuals,
households and communities at different times,
together with how it affects the immediate and
underlying determinants of individual and
household food security and nutrition.

è Conflict tends to create multiple compounding
impacts, direct and indirect, which flow through a
variety of channels.
è Conflict can cause deep economic recessions,
drive up inflation, disrupt employment and erode
finances for social protection and health care, to the
detriment of the availability and access of food in
markets and so damaging health and nutrition.

Conflict can also have devastating negative impacts
on food consumption and health (morbidity and
mortality patterns), including the four dimensions of
food insecurity (availability, access, utilization and
stability), individual caring practices, health services
and a healthy living environment. 45 Moreover, there
can be immediate effects and subsequent
implications for human life and nutrition.

è The impact on food systems can be severe if the
economy and people’s livelihoods rely significantly on
agriculture, as the effects can be felt across the foodvalue chain, including production, harvesting,
processing, transportation, financing and marketing.
è Conflict undermines resilience and often forces
individuals and households to engage in increasingly
destructive and irreversible coping strategies that
threaten their future livelihoods, food security and
nutrition.

How exactly conflict affects food security can be
difficult to ascertain, and impacts can occur
simultaneously and/or with a time lag such that
there are compounding effects on food
consumption, caring practices and health
environments. Conflict impacts can be direct (such
as, forced population movements, the destruction of
food stocks and productive assets and increased
health complications including death) and/or
indirect (for example, economic, social and
institutional changes). 46 Indirect impacts can also
include disruptions to food systems and markets,
leading to increased food prices or decreased
household purchasing power, or access to water and
fuel for cooking can be reduced, which negatively
affects food preparation, feeding practices and food
allocation within the household. Owing to this
complexity and the specific contexts, any analysis of
the impact of conflict on food security and nutrition
and associated health complications necessarily
relies on concrete case studies. 47

The previous section showed that countries
affected by conf lict have higher average rates of
undernourishment and undernutrition than those
not affected by conf lict. However, violent
conf licts can also lead to short-term impacts on
food securit y and nutrition, which can have
devastating lifelong effects on health, well-being,
productivit y, and physical and cognitive
development. 43
Conf lict is often a leading cause of famine and
food crises. The Global Food Crisis Report 2017
states that, in 2016 alone, the far-reaching effects
of violent conf lict and civil insecurit y left more
than 63 million people in 13 countries facing

The impact of conf lict on food securit y and
nutrition is highly context-specific and
dependent on the v ulnerabilit y of livelihoods as
well as on the nature of the conf lict. However,
there are some common traits across conf lict
situations in terms of how they affect
livelihoods and food securit y, a proper
understanding of which is essential for defining
adequate mitigation and prevention responses.

Rather than one single impact, conf lict tends to
create multiple, compounding and simultaneous
outcomes, the complexit y of which must be fully
understood and recognized when designing
programme and policy responses. For example,
conf lict can lead to economic and price impacts
that reduce household food access and may also
constrain people’s mobilit y, thereby limiting
household access to food, health ser vices and
safe water, and leading to an increased
incidence of disease and in some cases increased
mortalit y. Short-term, sector-specific
approaches that address only one problem are
therefore unlikely to be effective. Two case
studies presented in this section from South
Sudan (Box 7) and Yemen (Box 8) provide examples
of how conf lict leads to compounding impacts
on food securit y and nutrition. Mitigating these
impacts and strengthening resilience would
require more multisector programming, forming
part of holistic development approaches beyond
immediate humanitarian aid (see section
“The role of food securit y and nutrition in
sustaining peace”, p. 60).

Impacts on economic production, trade, and
public finances
Conf lict and civil insecurit y can wreak havoc on
economic production and growth, which is
detrimental to food securit y and nutrition not
only in that it challenges the availabilit y of and
access to food, but also because it presents
difficulties in terms of health and nutrition.
Conf licts can cause deep economic recessions,
drive up inf lation and erode fiscal finances,
affecting livelihoods and undermining response
capacities (for example by disrupting social
protection and health care).
| 40 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

A recent study across 20 countries shows that
armed conf lict reduces the level of GDP per
capita by 17.5 percent on average. 48 Impacts
var y widely, however: the GDP of the Syrian
Arab Republic fell by more than 50 percent
between 2010 and 2015, Libya’s by 24 percent
in 2014 after violence picked up, and in Yemen
there was a decline of an estimated
25 –35 percent in 2015 alone.

by repeated cycles of violence in the last three
decades are on average 20 percentage points
higher than in non-conflict countries. Every year
of violence can slow poverty reduction by almost
one percentage point. 51
Economic contractions tend to erode public
finances, which in turn may diminish, or in
extreme cases fully disrupt, social protection
mechanisms. They can also negatively affect
basic social ser vices that are critical to nutrition
outcomes, including the availabilit y of health
care and clean and safe water (for the case of
Yemen, see Box 8).

Conf lict duration and intensit y are important
determinants of economic impact. A recent
study that analysed annual data for
179 countries from 1970 to 2014 not only found
that conf lict significantly impacted economic
growth, but also that the impact increased with
the intensit y and duration of the conf lict. 49
In countries affected by high-intensit y
conf licts, GDP decreased by 8.4 percentage
points per year on average, while the decline
averaged 1.2 percentage points in countries
with less-intense conf licts. 50 Accounting for the
duration of conf lict, after three years, countries
suffered GDP losses of between four and nine
percentage points on average per year.
For countries in conf lict in the Near East and
North Africa region, the impact was greater, at
an estimated GDP loss of between six and
fifteen percentage points per year. The study
also found further spillover effects on
neighbouring economies.

Conf lict can also disrupt export channels and
drain foreign exchange resources, limiting
import capacit y and causing shortages of
commodit y supplies and inf lationar y pressure.
For net food-importing countries, import
disruptions can lead to reduced food availabilit y
in markets as well as reduced availabilit y or
affordabilit y of non-food items necessar y for
food preparation (such as cooking fuel).
Inf lation can also have significant negative
impacts on households’ abilit y to access food, as
price hikes hamper the abilit y of households to
purchase what they need.
Although it tends to halt social progress, conf lict
does not always lead to economic collapse. For
example, despite the upsurge in armed conf lict
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since
2012, the countr y’s economy grew by 7.1 percent
in 2012, 8.5 percent in 2013, 8.9 percent in 2014,
and 6.9 percent in 2015, driven mainly by a
thriving mining sector. 52 However, this rapid
growth has not led to improvements in social
indicators. 53 In 2013, 6.7 million people (almost
10 percent of the population) were facing severe
levels of acute food insecurit y (IPC
Phase 3 Crisis and IPC Phase 4 Emergency) and
were unable to access enough food to meet their
basic needs. In 2017, an estimated 5.9 million
people are still considered acutely food insecure,
and an estimated 3.9 million children are
suffering from acute malnutrition, of which
1.9 million are severely malnourished. 54 Poor
governance and insecurit y have kept public
expenditures and investments in economic
development, road construction, drinking-water
systems, and health care at low levels.
»

The analysis below shows that, in most
instances, economic impacts hit agricultural
sectors disproportionally hard, as many
conf licts are fought in rural areas and target
agricultural assets such as land and livestock.
In South Sudan, for example, livestock has been
a direct target of insurgency and
counterinsurgency warfare (see Box 7).
Conflict-induced economic contractions reduce
employment and income opportunities, which in
turn can increase poverty and reduce the ability
of households to meet their food and health-care
needs. Available evidence shows more
substantial reductions in poverty are made in
peaceful and stable countries than in those
affected by conflict. The former have managed
to reduce poverty at a steady pace, while the
latter have poverty rates that are stagnant or
even increase. Poverty rates in countries affected

PUBLIC HEALTH

producers, consumers and traders alike. The economic
impact of the current conflict on the livestock sector –
which constitutes 15 percent of GDP – has been
extensive, as livestock have been direct targets of
insurgency and counterinsurgency warfare. It is
estimated that the loss of GDP attributed to the
livestock sector is between US$1.4 billion and
US$2 billion (2014–16).2
Food access has been hampered by sharp
increases in prices, with inflation driven by
shortages, currency devaluation and high transport
costs owing to insecurity along major trading routes.
The year-on-year inflation rate peaked at 836 percent
in October 2016: the value of the South Sudanese
pound (SSP) depreciated from SSP16 to the US dollar
in August 2015 to SSP74 in November 2016. The
conflict in Juba in July 2016 restricted inflows of
imported food through the main southern supply
corridor from Uganda, reducing food supplies and
further driving up prices. In July 2016, cereal prices
were more than double those of June and almost ten
times higher than 2015 levels.3
A lack of financial and physical access to food
is limiting individual and household food
consumption, with real labour incomes and the
relative price of livestock falling dramatically.
Meanwhile, violence and insecurity have led to the
depletion and loss of assets such as livestock and
key household food sources such as standing crops
and grain stocks.
In the worst-affected areas, food is being used as
a weapon of war, with trade blockades and security
threats leaving people marooned in swamps with no
access to food or health care. Humanitarian access
to the worst-hit areas is limited, as warring factions
are intentionally blocking emergency food, hijacking
aid trucks and killing relief workers. A lack of
protection of civilians against violence has led to
1.9 million internally displaced persons and more
than 1.26 million refugees, who have lost their
livelihoods and are dependent on support for
their survival.3

South Sudan is an example of how conflict can affect
the lives and livelihoods of the population in multiple
ways, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe on an
enormous scale and with destructive longer-term
impacts on livelihoods, as well as on the agriculture
and food systems upon which these depend. In
December 2013, two and half years after South
Sudan gained its independence, large-scale violence
erupted in the Greater Upper Nile Region and by
2016 had spread to Greater Equatoria and Western
Bahr el Ghazal.
The ongoing conflict caused acute food insecurity
to increase dramatically, with famine declared in
parts of Greater Upper Unity State in February 2017
(see figure). More than 4.9 million people (over
42 percent of the population) are currently severely
food insecure (IPC Phases 3–5), a number that is
projected to increase to 5.5 million in 2017 if the
situation is left unaddressed.1
Widespread acute malnutrition is giving rise to a
major public health emergency: one in three children
is acutely malnourished in the southern part of Unity
State, and out of 23 counties, 14 have global acute
malnutrition (GAM) at or above the emergency
threshold of 15 percent. Rates of GAM of more than
30 percent were observed in Leer and Panyijiar and
of 27.3 percent in Mayendit. These high levels are
caused by reduced food access and by child, maternal
and public health factors. The situation is exacerbated
by a number of factors, including inadequate diets,
low quality and coverage of water and sanitation
facilities, as well as poor access to and levels of basic
health services.
Armed conflict and communal violence are
destroying rural livelihoods, decimating assets,
deepening poverty and increasing the vulnerability of
millions of people. Agricultural production and food
systems have been disrupted, livestock production has
declined significantly, and the spread of violence to
cereal surplus-producing areas in Equatoria is severely
affecting crop production. Violence is limiting market
access and disrupting trade flows, affecting livestock

» Conf licts among armed groups in the east of

land, livestock, crops, seed stocks or irrigation
infrastructure), the forced or corrupt seizure of
natural resources, and displacement from land,
livestock grazing areas, and fishing grounds.
Indirect impacts include macroeconomic shocks
(as highlighted in the previous subsection).

the countr y, intercommunal violence in other
areas, and instabilit y in neighbouring countries
have led to recurrent, large-scale movements of
refugees into the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, further complicating the food
securit y situation. 55

Not only is the duration of a conf lict important
for determining its impacts, there can also be
persistent lagged effects after the conf lict has
subsided and in post-conf lict situations.
For example, the agriculture sector in the
Central African Republic – including crop
production, livestock rearing and fishing – has
been severely affected by the long-running and
cyclical waves of violence and conf lict in the
countr y. 60 Despite a peace agreement in 2015
reached among various armed groups and a
decline in the conf lict level from the most
intense periods in 2013 and 2014, the
agriculture sector is struggling to recover.
Many areas are still insecure and armed groups
continue to block and control trade routes. In
2015, cereal production was 70 percent lower
than the pre-conf lict average (2008 –2012),
while significant declines have also been noted
in cotton and coffee production, the countr y’s
two most valuable cash crops. 61

Impacts on agriculture, food systems and
rural livelihoods
On average, 56 percent of the population in
countries affected by conf lict live in rural areas,
where livelihoods largely depend on
agriculture. For protracted crisis contexts, the
proportion of populations living in rural areas
is 62 percent on average, but can exceed
80 percent in cases such as Burundi, Ethiopia
and Niger. Most conf licts mainly affect rural
areas and their populations, heavily and
negatively affecting agriculture, 56 food systems
and livelihoods. In many countries affected by
conf lict, subsistence agriculture is still central
to food securit y for much of the population.
In 2014, agricultural activit y accounted for more
than 37 percent of GDP in countries
characterized by extremely fragile contexts,
compared with about 23 percent in fragile
contexts and 8 percent in the rest of the world. 57
In 2015, agriculture accounted for 23 percent of
the economy in countries affected by conf lict,
and an average of 35 percent of GDP for countries
with a protracted crisis. 58

Six years of civil war in the Syrian Arab Republic
have led to massive losses in the agriculture
sector, estimated at US$16 billion for the period
of 2011–16, including destroyed assets and
infrastructure. 62 Despite this, agriculture is still
an important sector in the Syrian Arab Republic,
as it accounts for an estimated 26 percent of GDP
and remains a source of livelihood for 6.7 million
Syrians, including the internally displaced who
remain in rural areas. Today, agriculture
production is at a record low in the countr y, with
about half the population unable to meet their
daily food needs.

Conf lict negatively affects almost ever y aspect of
agriculture and food systems, from production,
har vesting, processing and transport to input
supply, financing, and marketing. Although there
are no recent, comprehensive global estimates of
the impact of conf lict on agriculture and food
systems, 59 a number of food securit y and
nutrition assessments and analyses for countries
affected by conf lict demonstrate the significant
impacts of conf lict on agriculture production,
food systems and rural livelihoods at national
and subnational levels.

Another example is Iraq, where in 2016
production levels continued to fall as a large
part of the cereal production belt was directly
under the control of rebel forces, affecting
access to agriculture inputs, cereal har vest and
post-har vesting activities. 63 Before the conf lict,
the Ninewa and Salah al-Din Districts
produced almost 33 percent of the countr y’s
wheat and 38 percent of its barley.

These impacts can be direct and indirect, and felt
immediately as well as in the longer-term. Direct
impacts can be significant, particularly in regard
to the destruction of agricultural assets (such as

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

BOX 8

YEMEN – CONFLICT, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, AND THE DESTRUCTION
OF RURAL AND URBAN LIVELIHOODS

The most recent outbreak of conflict in Yemen
(beginning in March 2015) has had devastating effects
on livelihoods and nutrition. One of the main channels
of impact has been the conflict-induced, economy-wide
crisis that is affecting the entire population.
Yemen’s economic crisis is driving unprecedented
levels of food insecurity and undernutrition. Its GDP
dropped by 34.6 percent between 2014 and 2015,
the public budget deficit almost doubled between the
first half of 2015 and the first half of 2016, and the
currency exchange rate in the parallel market
repeatedly fluctuates and diverges from the official
rate (YER250 per US dollar), reaching a record high
of YER315 per US dollar in September 2016.1
In July 2016, the Central Bank of Yemen
suspended public budget expenditures and domestic
debt servicing. As a consequence, civil servants – who
make up 31 percent of the workforce in the country –
have experienced irregular salary payments or
complete salary cuts. The entire social protection
system has collapsed, with a suspension of safety nets2
to 1.5 million beneficiaries through the Social Welfare
Fund since the beginning of the crisis in 2015.
The conflict-driven public-sector crisis continues to
escalate, creating a host of uncertainties and
threatening a possible breakdown of the banking
system. The Government’s inability to pay salaries is
accelerating the economic collapse and tipping large
parts of the country into a destructive downward
spiral of extreme food insecurity and increasing
poverty. The liquidity crisis has directly affected more
than 7 million people who depend on government
salaries, thereby reducing not only their food
purchasing power, but also their access to basic
goods and services such as health care.
Yemen relies on imports for more than 90 percent
of its staple foods; restrictions coupled with fuel
shortages have reduced the availability of essential
commodities, causing prices to soar since the conflict
escalated in March 2015.

The annual inflation rate has increased to over
30 percent, pushing average consumer prices
70 percent above pre-crisis levels and heavily
reducing purchasing power for many. With both
urban and rural communities relying on markets on
a daily basis (70 percent of people in the case of
rural communities), increases in the cost of food,
cooking fuel, water and medicine all heavily
undermine food access and utilization. People have
reduced and lost income due to the poor
performance of the agriculture and fishery sectors,
job losses and suspensions of salaries. The
economic crisis has been further aggravated by
natural hazards, including plagues of locusts and
flooding caused by unusual high rains and tropical
cyclones in 2016.
The nutrition situation has been aggravated by
the dramatic breakdown of the health care system
and its infrastructure; an outbreak of cholera and
other epidemics3 that affected several governorates
in 2016 and that is continuing into 2017; depletion
of savings caused by loss of safety nets and
government salaries; distressed livelihood coping
strategies; and reduced ability to access food both
physically and economically.
As of March 2017, an estimated 17 million
people are experiencing severe food insecurity (IPC
Phases 3 and 4) and require urgent humanitarian
assistance. This represents 60 percent of the entire
population – a 20 percent increase from June 2016
and a 47 percent increase from June 2015.4 Chronic
child undernutrition (stunting) has been a serious
problem for a long time, but acute undernutrition
(wasting) has peaked in the last three years. Out of
22 governorates, four have levels of global acute
malnutrition (GAM) above the emergency threshold
of 15 percent, while seven record acute malnutrition
prevalence at “serious” (GAM between 10 percent
and 14.9 percent) and eight at “poor” levels (GAM
between 5 percent and 9.9 percent).

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

» An assessment in Februar y 2016 found that

or divert finances to conf lict-related
expenditures (such as militar y operations).

70 –80 percent of corn, wheat and barley
cultivations were damaged or destroyed in
Salah al-Din, while in Ninewa 32– 68 percent of
land normally used for wheat cultivation was
either compromised or destroyed, as was
43 –57 percent of the barley cultivation.

Domestic and foreign private investment in
agriculture and in regions with agricultural
potential also becomes discouraged, even after
conf lict and violence diminish. This is
especially the case where the root cause of the
conf lict is competition over natural resources,
including productive land or water resources.

When conf lict and civil insecurit y severely
disrupt and restrict trade and movements of
goods and ser vices, there can also be a negative
effect on the availabilit y of food and upward
pressure on prices of traded goods, which
negatively affects food access. Conf lict disrupts
the f low of food and other essential items
through markets, creates shortages, and
contributes to price hikes, thereby damaging
market functionalit y. People’s physical securit y
is also affected by conf lict – even those not
directly engaged as combatants or victims of
violence 64 – as it prevents consumers from going
to the market or traders from selling their wares.
Moreover, intentional blockades of trade routes
or the inaccessibilit y of besieged areas can result
in market collapse or reduced functionalit y.

Impact through displacement of people
Conf lict is also a main driver of population
displacement, and displaced populations are
among the most v ulnerable in the world,
experiencing high levels of food insecurit y
and undernutrition.
According to the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
there were an estimated 64 million displaced
people worldwide in 2016, of which 16 million
were refugees and 36.4 million IDPs. The
majorit y of the forcibly displaced are
concentrated in developing countries in
Africa, the Near East and South Asia. Over
half of the world’s refugees originate from
countries affected by conf lict. Displaced
persons from Afghanistan, Somalia and the
Syrian Arab Republic, are hosted mainly in
neighbouring countries, including,
respectively: Pakistan and Iran (Islamic
Republic of ); Ethiopia and Kenya; and Jordan,
Lebanon and Turkey. Most of the world’s IDPs
are concentrated in the Syrian Arab Republic,
Colombia, Iraq, the Sudan, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan.
Developing countries such as Ethiopia, Jordan,
Kenya and Lebanon are now hosting more
than 80 percent of all refugees in the world. 66

Conflict may also compromise food storage, as
facilities can become unsafe or at risk of
destruction or looting. However, new market
structures can also evolve. The absence of
functioning government institutions provides
fertile ground for informal markets to flourish, but
there is the risk of some groups gaining huge
benefits at the expense of others. For example,
certain groups can control all parts of the food
chain and charge inflated prices to different
sectors of the population, or there can be a fully
open black market through informal value chains.
South Sudan provides an illustrative example
of conf lict’s destructive impact on agriculture
and food systems and how this can combine
with other factors, including public health, to
undermine livelihoods and create a downward
spiral of increased food insecurit y and
malnutrition as conf lict intensifies (see Box 7).
Conf lict and the risk of conf lict impede public
and private investment in agricultural
production and marketing activities. 65 Faced
with conf lict-induced economic contractions
and public-finance stresses, governments often
reduce investment in agricultural development

The number of displaced people worldwide is at
an all-time high, as war and persecution continue
to rise. Currently, one in ever y 113 people is now
either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking
asylum. In the past five years, at least 15 conf licts
have erupted or re-ignited, 8 of which have been
in Africa (Burundi, the Central African Republic,
Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Libya, Mali, northeast Nigeria, and
South Sudan). 67

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

The Global Report on Food Crises 2017 indicates
that more than 15.3 million people were
displaced by six of the worst food crises
triggered by conf lict in 2016 (Figure 18).
In addition to direct conf lict-related
displacement, violent conf lict can lead to the
collapse of livelihoods, forcing populations to
move for sur vival. There is often also an
increased risk of disease, as people are forced to
live in unhealthy surroundings and overcrowded
shelters with potentially poor access to water

capacities determine how and the extent to which
individuals, households, communities and
institutions are able to cope with and adapt to
conf lict impacts.

Resilience is an important concept for coping
with conf lict and ensuring that shocks and
stressors do not have long-lasting consequences
for food securit y and nutrition. Resilience is
generally agreed to be a combination of three
capacities: adaptive (such as coping strategies,
risk management, and savings groups),
absorptive (use of assets, attitudes/motivation,
livelihood diversification, and human capital),
and transformative (governance mechanisms,

SYRIAN REFUGEES – STORIES OF LOST LIVELIHOODS AND
DESPERATION
markets were controlled by powerful groups,
leading to steadily increasing prices: in the
besieged city of Deir Ezzur, one participant said a
bag of sugar cost 100 000 Syrian pounds (over
US$450). People were forced to sell belongings
such as furniture and gold in order to buy food.
 Families were forced to cut out protein-rich and
dairy products from their diets, and most had to
reduce portion sizes, eating only one or two meals
a day. Some said they were living off starchy foods
such as bread, pasta, rice or potatoes, as meat,
butter, tomatoes, oil and sugar were all too
expensive.
 With the proliferation of armed groups and
religious sects, participants described increasing
mistrust among neighbours and friends. The armed
forces were abducting people at random and
forcibly conscripting young men. Women were
particularly concerned about the long-lasting
psychological effects of the conflict on their
children.
 Almost all the families interviewed in Jordan and
Turkey and some in Lebanon were internally
displaced multiple times before they crossed the
border. Overall, nearly eight in ten households
were internally displaced within the Syrian Arab
Republic at least once, and 65 percent twice or
more.
 The situation was particularly dire during the most
recent phase of internal displacement. Participants
described constant fear, life in collective shelters
with limited access to even basic services and
struggling to find food. In many cases, the
immediate trigger point to leave was injury or
death. Some participants did not leave because of
the immediate conflict, but rather were forced to
move due to lack of livelihood and food.

The devastating civil war in the Syrian Arab Republic
entered its seventh year in 2017. It is a complex,
internationalized conflict, with various armed groups
in control of much of the country. Formerly a vibrant
middle-income economy, 85 percent of the population
now live in poverty, of which 69 percent live in
extreme poverty, meaning they are unable to cover
their basic needs, including food.1 In 2016, an
estimated 6.7 million people were acutely food
insecure and in need of urgent humanitarian
assistance, while the prevalence of acute malnutrition
was at increased levels in most areas (7 percent
GAM). Anaemia affects about one-quarter of both
children under the age of five and adult women.2
Years of conflict have not only had a cumulative
destructive effect on the economy, infrastructure,
agricultural production, food systems and social
institutions, but also more generally on people’s ability
to cope. Since 2011, there has been a continuous
exodus of Syrians seeking to escape the conflict,
mostly into neighbouring countries. By 2016, an
estimated 4.8 million refugees had fled to Turkey
(58 percent), Lebanon (21 percent), Jordan
(14 percent), Iraq (5 percent), and Egypt (2 percent).
A recent WFP study of the Syrian refugee crisis
provides insights from the perspective of displaced
Syrian populations on the impact conflict has had on
their livelihoods and food security, documenting their
internal migration journeys and triggers for leaving
their homes. The following are some excerpts:
 For many of the refugees, the constant bombing
and the presence of armed forces in their villages
and towns were the main reason for leaving their
homes, many of which were being destroyed along
with their businesses.

livelihoods and markets were disrupted. Many food

and in the quality and availability of public
services. Labour supply has increased by up to
50 percent and the number of state-school students
has risen by 30–35 percent. There has also been a
surge in demand for public health-care services.
The crisis is having a disproportionate impact
on already vulnerable households, not only
because of increased competition for unskilled
labour and overloaded public services, but also
because half of the refugees live in the poorest onethird of districts. The World Bank estimates that the
poverty rate will have increased by 3.9 percent by
the end of 2014 because of the Syrian conflict.
Those who were already poor will become poorer
and adverse impacts on food security and nutrition
are to be expected.

The crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic has had an
immense impact on Lebanon, which has
experienced an economic slowdown and is having
to deal with the arrival of more than 1.5 million
refugees. The economic slowdown, manifested by a
sharp decrease in annual growth rates from almost
10 percent in the immediate pre-crisis years to
1–2 percent in 2011–14, is a result of increased
insecurity, disrupted trade routes, and declining
confidence among investors and consumers. Exports
and foreign direct investments fell by 25 percent
between 2013 and 2014, and tourism has dropped
by 60 percent since the start of the crisis.
Public debt reached 141 percent of GDP in
mid-2014. The influx of refugees has been

» and irreversible options. People t ypically first

respond with a mix of ex ante risk management
and ex post risk-coping strategies. 73 Common
strategies include: diversification of land
holdings and crop cultivation, storage of grain
from one year to the next, resorting to sales of
assets such as cattle and land that could have
been accumulated as a precaution against the
occurrence of a shock, borrowing from village
lenders or other money loaners, and receiving
gifts and transfers from informal mutual
support networks (such as family, friends,
neighbours and funeral societies).

engage in reversible coping strategies with
short-term effects, such as making modest
dietar y adjustments and skipping meals.
However, as coping options are exhausted or
disappear and food insecurit y worsens,
households are more likely to employ more
extreme and damaging strategies that are less
reversible and therefore represent a more severe
form of coping, such as distress selling of
livestock or productive assets such as farm tools.
Severe and/or persistent conf lict can ultimately
lead to the collapse of coping mechanisms,
prompting migration, destitution and, in
extreme cases, death and star vation. Coping
mechanisms and loss of livelihoods can in turn
undermine local and national economies.

Although there is evidence that in some
contexts households appear to learn to live amid
conf lict, this is often at a lower income level. 74
For example, where non-state armed factions
remained in Colombia, farming households
shifted to activities with short-term yields and
lower profitabilit y. However, as violence
intensified, farmers focused more on subsistence
activities to provide basic food securit y.

However, there are many examples of
individuals and households living in conf lict
areas and sur viving the impacts of violence. 72
Households in risky environments generally
| 49 |

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

The reasons may be related to issues over access
to productive land, to a switching away from
income-generating activities that are more
sensitive to conf lict, or to an attempt to avoid
accumulating assets that may become liabilities
or targets. 75 Other coping strategies may also
include fighting, looting, supporting armed
groups and participating in illegal activities in
order to sur vive the loss of livelihoods.

Available evidence further shows that conf lict
leads to increased female labour participation.
This can be due either to the death or
disappearance of male workers or to the loss of
income-generating assets that male household
members relied on before the conf lict, such as
land or livestock that may have since been stolen
or destroyed. 79 Children’s roles in the household
and communit y can also be severely affected, as
many are at risk of being pulled into child labour
in its worst forms during times of conf lict. 80

Gender dimensions in food security and nutrition
in conflicts
Gender is important in assessing how conf lict
affects food securit y and nutrition, as men and
women often have different roles and
responsibilities in securing adequate food and
nutrition at the household level. Conf licts tend
to alter gender roles and social norms. Men and
boys are more likely to be engaged in the
fighting and are at greater risk of being forcibly
recruited into militar y groups and socialized into
adopting violent concepts of masculinit y. 76
Together with the normalization of violence,
especially in prolonged conf lict settings, this not
only exposes them to a greater risk to loss of life,
or life-long disabilities, but can hinder efforts to
sustain peace.

Shifting gender roles can also have beneficial
effects on household welfare. Where women gain
more control of resources, household food
consumption tends to increase and child nutrition
improve. Their economic empowerment may
further give them greater voice in household and
communit y decision-making. For example, the
experience in Somalia shows that – during the
conf lict – women’s contribution to household
income generation increased along with their
inf luence on decision-making. 81 Similarly,
comparative case studies in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Colombia, Nepal, Tajikistan and
Timor-Leste found that armed conf lict led to an
increase in female labour participation, albeit
mainly in low-paid unskilled work and often
exposing women to unsafe and insecure labour
conditions. 82 Also when self-employed as
farmers, women often see income opportunities
limited where they do not have rights to own or
inherit land and to access input or credit markets.
In these circumstances, and where conf lict affects
economic conditions more in general, it is
unlikely that increased female labour market
participation will improve household welfare and
food securit y. 83

The engagement of men in conf lict puts greater
responsibilit y in the hands of women in
sustaining the livelihood of the household,
including for the access to food, nutrition and
health care of household members. Conf lict
situations often are characterized by increased
sexual violence, mostly targeted at women. Such
violence and trauma not only cause direct harm
to women, but also tend to affect their abilit y to
support their families.

Conflict impacts on traditional social networks

Rural women often have less access to resources
and income, which makes them more v ulnerable
and hence more likely to resort to riskier coping
strategies. These strategies may affect their
health, which in turn is detrimental to the food
securit y of the entire household as food
production and the abilit y to prepare food
decreases with illness. 77 In crisis situations and
among refugees, one in ever y five women of
childbearing age is likely to be pregnant.
Conf licts put these women and their babies at
increased risk if health-care systems falter and
their food securit y situation deteriorates. 78

Conf licts can undermine the effectiveness of
traditional institutions with social networks,
both within and across neighbouring
communities. In many contexts, it is these
support mechanisms that provide important
safet y nets and coping mechanisms to protect
populations against shocks, and their collapse
can be a critical causal pathway towards
increased food insecurit y.
For example, in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda,
pastoral communities have traditionally

PASTORALISM IN EAST AFRICA – BREAKDOWN OF TRADITIONAL
SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION
The congested settlements are causing loss of soil
cover due to erosion. Communities also suffer from
scarcity and overuse of water because of the larger
numbers of people and livestock. Overcultivation and
excessive pressure on soils have resulted in loss of soil
fertility, deforestation, and depletion of biomass.
This environmental degradation is exacerbated by
cutting down trees and grass for construction,
fuelwood, charcoal burning for domestic use and sale
for income generation.
In Ethiopia, on-and-off violent conflicts between
the Borana, Garre, Guji and Konso have become
commonplace. Although occurring at local levels,
these conflicts have involved complex legal, political
and economic dynamics that extend to national and
even regional dimensions, encompassing the
communities and their allies elsewhere in Ethiopia
and across the border in Kenya. Loss of access to
grazing land and water sources puts the pastoral
system under pressure and gradually reduces its selfsufficiency. This means that the land-use system is no
longer able to respond to ecological and climatic
variability, resulting in degradation that is evident in
the level of bush encroachment. This in turn changes
the structure and composition of the herbaceous
vegetation, with undesired thorny and woody
species encroaching on grazing areas. The result is
an imbalance in the grass–bush ratio and a
decrease in biodiversity and carrying capacity,
which causes severe economic and ecological losses
to pastoral communities.

Long-lasting and recurrent conflicts have altered the
grazing patterns of affected pastoralists in Ethiopia,
Kenya and Uganda, reducing both their resilience and
their coping strategies.
Mobility is limited with increased insecurity, as it
forces the community to concentrate livestock on
reduced territory. The sustainable use of pastoral
rangelands depends in large measure on mobility,
which allows for rotational use of wet- and dry-season
grazing areas. Loss of access to land and water
sources puts the pastoral system under pressure and
gradually reduces its self-sufficiency. This means that
the existing land-use system is no longer able to
respond to ecological and climatic variability, resulting
in ecological degradation.
FAO has documented the impact of conflict on the
breakdown of traditional systems and how this has
affected environmental degradation, undermining the
long-term viability of pastoral livelihoods.
In Kenya, key informants in Kula Mawe (Borana)
indicated that even in times of peace livestock
grazing is restricted to a radius of 15 kilometres for
fear of raids orchestrated by either the Somali or
Samburu. Concentrating livestock in limited areas
results in overgrazing and general degradation of the
environment.
In Uganda, pastoralists have been forced to settle
in concentrated areas, leading to overgrazing and
ecological degradation, which is undermining their
livelihoods and the community’s ability to cope with
droughts and other climate-related disasters.

facilitated negotiated access to strategic natural
resources, especially in times of ecological stress.
This is done primarily by restricting mobilit y,
which in turn is critical for sustainable rangeland
and livestock management. However, conf lict is

leading to a breakdown of these traditional
systems of social exchange and mediation,

and degrading the rangelands upon which their
livelihoods depend (see Box 11). 84 n

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

CAN FOOD INSECURITY
AND UNDERNUTRITION
TRIGGER CONFLICT?

Drivers and conditioning factors determining
changes in food insecurity that trigger
conflicts
Measuring the impact of variations in food
securit y on the likelihood of violent conf lict is
complex, owing to data limitations and the
specific nature of conf lict contexts. However,
some studies have suggested that food
insecurit y, when coupled with other factors,
increases the likelihood of conf lict. For
example, a recent study by W FP that assessed a
25-year time span suggests that
undernourishment is one of the more
important determinants of the incidences of
armed conf lict, and that when coupled with
povert y, food insecurit y increases the
likelihood and intensit y of armed conf lict. 86

KEY MESSAGES:
è Food insecurity itself can become a trigger for
violence and instability, particularly in contexts
marked by pervasive inequalities and fragile
institutions.
è Sudden spikes in food prices tend to exacerbate
the risk of political unrest and conflict, as witnessed in
2007–08 when food riots broke out in more than
40 countries.
è Climate-related events, especially droughts, tend to
jeopardize food security in terms of availability and
access, which has been found to increase the risk of
conflict. This is particularly the case where deep
divisions exist between population groups or where
coping mechanisms are lacking.

Another study that analysed socio-economic
conditions prior to the outbreak of conf lict
found that in countries with low socioeconomic indicators – such as higher rates of
child mortalit y, povert y, food insecurit y and
undernutrition – there is a higher risk of
conf lict (Figure 19). 87 In contrast, the same study
found that levels of per capita income, GDP
growth, and having access to a safe water
source would not increase the likelihood of
conf lict. While this comparison across
countries does not imply causalit y, it does
indicate that the probabilit y of armed conf lict
onset appears to be higher in countries with
low socio-economic status. When combined
with income povert y, nutritional status and
poor health were found to be more strongly
associated with conf lict outbreaks than were
per capita GDP, annual GDP growth, or the
ratio of primar y commodit y exports over GDP. 88
Moreover, according to this evidence,
post-conf lict countries with high levels of food
insecurit y are 40 percent more likely to relapse
into conf lict within a ten-year time span than
those with low levels.

è Competition for natural resources can be
detrimental to the food security of vulnerable rural
households, potentially culminating in conflict.
While it is well established that conf lict causes
food insecurit y and undernutrition, the
reverse causal link is much less clear.
Food insecurit y and undernutrition as such
have not been found to be the sole causes of
conf lict, but they may compound other
grievances or political, social or economic
factors that trigger conf lict. A vicious circle
can emerge when conf lict leads to a worsening
of the food securit y and nutrition situation,
which in turn enhances the risk of deepening
and prolonging the conf lict. 85
This section looks at the available evidence and
case studies that help identif y the contributing
factors to food insecurit y and undernutrition
that can trigger, fuel or sustain conf lict,
especially rising food prices, extreme weather
events, and competition over land or resources.
The effects, however, are always played out in
combination with other conf lict-promoting
factors that are highly context-specific.

Cross-countr y comparisons using nation-wide
averages for measures of both conf lict and food
insecurit y tend to overlook subnational
inequalities and the more localized nature of
many of today’s conf licts (see section “Why

securit y and nutrition?”, p. 30). However, more
detailed case study-based analyses confirm
that povert y, hunger and food insecurit y,
together with a highly unequal distribution of
income, land and other material goods, can
create feelings of anger, hopelessness,
unfairness and a lack of social justice among
sectors of the population.

Food insecurit y, or the threat thereof, is a
distressing condition that can activate grievances
and cause frustration and anger, leading
individuals to engage in antisocial behaviour. 91
People can resort to violence when their human
securit y, including food securit y, is threatened,
especially when there is a lack of formal and
informal institutions that are able and willing to
mediate such risks. These grievances can be
compounded by mistrust in the government,
often originating from a feeling of a lack of state
support when facing food insecurit y. 92

Such grievances can then be exploited by
individuals and groups with a desire to foment
violence. 89 As noted above (see section "Why
focus on the nexus between conf lict, food
securit y and nutrition?", p. 30), conf lict
significantly affects food securit y and nutrition,
especially when protracted and compounded by
weak institutional response capacities (fragilit y).
Fragile institutions and poor governance help
explain why similar external shocks can produce
violence in one countr y but not in another.
Studies have shown that, during the 2007– 08
food price crises, the likelihood of the outbreak
of protests was much higher in developing
countries categorized as in fragile situations. 90

At the individual level, studies have shown that
people might choose to participate in and support
armed groups in the hope of gaining financially,
particularly if they have lost trust in state support
mechanisms. 93 In Mozambique, Peru and Sierra
Leone, for example, rebel fighters were
remunerated via looting of civilian propert y.
Other evidence suggests deprivation, such as the
inabilit y to meet their basic nutritional
requirements, is among the reasons for joining
rebel groups. In the north of Mali where povert y
| 53 |

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

is high, one study found that a per vasive sense of
marginalization and a lack of livelihood
opportunities for young men have fed into the
region’s recurrent conf licts. 94

Historical evidence confirms that sudden spikes
in food prices exacerbate the risk of political
unrest and conf lict,104 as witnessed for example
in Eg y pt (1977), Morocco (1981), Tunisia (1984),
and Jordan (1996). In October 1988, youth riots
and demonstrations are said to have indirectly
contributed to the fall of Algeria’s one-part y
system and the introduction of democratic
reforms, which culminated in the countr y’s civil
war of 1991. Rising food prices, high youth
unemployment, and fiscal austerit y measures
were identified as key factors triggering the
protests and social unrest.

However, caution is needed when drawing
conclusions about any one driver that might
motivate behaviour and conf lict. 95 In most cases,
multiple factors are at play, with three of the
most commonly studied discussed below: sharp
and increased food prices, extreme climate
impacts, and competition over natural resources.

Sharp increases in food prices

More recently, the global food price crises of
2007– 08 and 2011 triggered riots in more than
40 countries, where the cost of imported basic
goods increased, thereby eroding real incomes
(see Figure 20).105

In 2013, 767 million people in the world lived
in extreme povert y. 96 As most poor people
spend more than 50 percent of their income on
food, even a slight increase in prices can
severely affect their well-being. There is a
growing body of empirical evidence that points
to food price hikes as an important
contributing trigger of social unrest such as
protests, riots, violence and war. 97 Most
evidence stems from studies of such conditions
in Africa, 98 including those that identified
international food price shocks as one of the
factors that may have contributed to the
so-called Arab Spring uprisings of 2010 –11
(Box 12). 99 More recent studies suggest the
association may apply more widely.100 Little is
known about the extent to which food prices
alone drive violent conf lict, especially as
historical events show sharp and increased
food prices interplay with other economic and
political adversities in violent conf lict contexts.

Other examples of severe political consequences
of food riots include the resignation of Haiti’s
Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis in 2008
and the coup against President Marc
Ravalomanana of Madagascar in 2009.106
In Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of ), political
tensions have escalated with increasing
shortages of food and other essential items, as
the economy has plummeted with declining oil
prices and oil revenues, and foreign-exchange
shortages have limited imports of food and
basic goods.107
Food riots often erupt first in urban areas, where
households depend primarily on markets for
accessing food and are extremely vulnerable to
price changes. However, price shocks may not
necessarily result in a marked increase in food
insecurity before triggering a conflict. It is rather
the perceived risk of a deteriorating food
security situation that can increase affected
groups’ willingness to fight to protect their
livelihoods,108 and hence changes in food
security – rather than levels of food insecurity –
are probably the most influential factors.109
Incentives to join or support conflicts and
rebellions stem from a number of causes, of
which the protection of food security is just one.
Food insecurity may also help to sustain
conflict. If post-conflict recovery proves difficult
and food insecurity remains high, this can
strengthen incentives for reigniting conflict.110

The dominant explanation for the food-price–
conf lict link is consumer grievances: higher
prices create or increase economic constraints
and/or sentiments of (perceived) relative
deprivation, which activates grievances that in
turn lead to conf lict. A second explanation
emphasizes the breakdown of authorit y and
legitimacy when the state fails to provide food
securit y, leading people to act out grievances
against the state.101 A number of recent
analyses have found that the cohesiveness of
political institutions in low-income countries
deteriorates significantly when international
food prices increase,102 while rising food prices
and riots in Africa have also been associated
with greater levels of political repression.103

Climate change and extreme weather events

In most cases, droughts do not immediately
increase the risk that specific population
groups will challenge state power through
militar y means. However, in agriculturedependent communities in low-income
contexts, droughts have been found to increase
the likelihood of violence and prolongation of
conf lict at the local level, which may eventually
pose a threat to societal stabilit y and peace.
Severe drought is among the factors that may
have contributed to food insecurit y and civil
war in the Syrian Arab Republic (Box 13), and the
high sensitivit y of Ethiopia’s economy to
rainfall variations has long been identified as a
major challenge for development. Studies of
both Ethiopia and Somalia show that lower

Climate-related events can increase food
insecurit y, in terms of both availabilit y and
access, through a number of channels. Drought is
a special case as it diminishes livestock and
agricultural productivit y, thus expanding the
pool of potential combatants and giving rise to
more broadly held grievances.111 A severe drought
tends to threaten local food securit y and
aggravate humanitarian conditions generally
speaking, which in turn can trigger large-scale
human displacement and create a breeding
ground for igniting or prolonging conf licts.112
A recent study found that as drought intensifies
and is prolonged, the likelihood of conf lict
increases significantly.113

THE ARAB SPRING AND SHARP INCREASES IN FOOD PRICES

of a social system whereby governments had
offered subsidized food, housing, utilities and
fuel, often along with employment in a large
public sector – all of which they could
no longer afford.
However, this interpretation of the sequence of
events has been contested and may not apply in all
cases. In the case of Tunisia, FAO’s GIEWS – its
on-the-ground early warning system – reported
relatively stable domestic food prices despite high
international prices during the winter months of
2010 to 2011. Hence, based on this evidence, it
seems unlikely that food price spikes triggered the
beginnings of the Arab Spring in Tunisia.2

Several studies have identified high food prices as a
possible contributing factor that added to grievances
that triggered the protests of late 2010 and early
2011, first in Tunisia and then in other Near East and
North African countries.1 All of the Arab Spring
countries are net importers of food, which meant their
inhabitants were highly vulnerable to the global food
price spikes of 2008 and 2011. Combined with high
levels of unemployment, this resulted in a steady
increase in the cost of living and an erosion of living
standards, which has been perceived as exacerbating
food insecurity in the region.
Sharp rises in domestic food prices from
2007 onwards also contributed to an unravelling

discriminated and marginalized groups – lack
coping mechanisms to avoid the harmful
effects of events such as drought on their food
securit y and livelihoods. Central factors that
restrict coping capacit y in such contexts
include a low level of socio-economic
development, histor y of conf lict, and limited
access to economic and social capital that
could facilitate alternative livelihoods.
Climate-induced crop failure or loss of pasture
can mean a dramatic drop in income, and
limited material and human capital can
aggravate the situation by narrowing the
range of outside options. However, this
process alone does not explain how violent
conf lict might erupt or be sustained. Ethnicit y
is the predominant common divide around
which social identit y and political preferences
are formed and play out. Most modern civil
conf licts are fought along ethnic lines, and
ethnic conf licts have increased markedly since
the end of the Cold War.115

precipitation levels are associated with a higher
probabilit y of conf lict onset.114
A study in Asia and Africa from 1989 to 2014
shows that the risk of conf lict increases for
each additional year of growing-season drought
and is even more pronounced for
low-development countries (Figure 21). For the
average politically excluded group, going from
zero to five consecutive years of drought during
the local growing season increases the
estimated likelihood of conf lict incidence from
12 percent to 15 percent, other things being
equal. With climate change, the risk of extreme
weather-related events increases as does the
variabilit y in rainfall. If left unaddressed,
climate change should therefore be expected to
have an increasing impact on the risk of
conf lict outbreaks.

SEVERE DROUGHT CONTRIBUTED TO A WORSENING OF THE CONFLICT
IN THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
20 percent of the population in these urban areas, the
refugee and newly migrated communities lived in
substandard housing, faced rampant unemployment
and received little if any governmental support, driving
rebellion within some of these same communities.
While half the population once worked in
agriculture, livestock herds today have been reduced by
50 percent and wheat production is down by
40 percent.3 However, the description of food insecurity
as leading to conflict through migration is not the whole
story, and there were other, more important political
factors at play. Nonetheless, hunger can often be a
critical element, and rebel groups can offer an
alternative livelihood to protect household food security
through incentives and promises of improved conditions.

The current civil war in the Syrian Arab Republic and
the rise of rebel groups provides a stark example of
the potential impacts of food insecurity, although
some question this link.1 A severe drought across the
Syrian Arab Republic in 2006–07 led to the collapse
of the country’s agricultural system, with most
small- and medium-scale farmers and herders having
lost most, if not all, production and livestock herds in
2008. As safety nets were not provided for these
farmers, the only recourse for most became migration
to urban areas.
As a result, an estimated 1.5 million Syrians joined
the swelling Iraqi refugee population in the Syrian
Arab Republic’s largest cities, including Damascus,
Aleppo, Homs and Latakia.2 Comprising as much as

livelihoods. Some sources estimate that over
the past 60 years, 40 percent of civil wars have
been associated with natural resources. Since
2000, some 48 percent of civil conf licts have
taken place in Africa, in contexts where access
to rural land is essential to the livelihoods of
many and where land issues have played a
significant role in 27 out of 30 conf licts.116 In
other contexts it was not so much competition
for land but the dispossession of farmers from
their land by armed groups: in Colombia for
example, farmers have suffered systematic
strategies of eviction that have led to
significant displacements of people (Box 14).

The link between natural resources –
particularly high-value ones such as oil and
minerals – and conf lict is well documented.
This is especially true of cases in which poor
governance leads to resources only benefiting
a handful of corrupt politicians or certain
ethnic or political groups, rather than the
population at large. Such a situation impedes
the development of the countr y, curtails
investment in common ser vices such as health

marginalization of v ulnerable households

In the Greater Horn of Africa, competition over
water and pasture is a constant cause for
localized conf lict between pastoralists and
farmers in the region. Water, forests, land and
minerals are declining owing to degradation,
overuse and climate change threats,
particularly the increase in temperatures.
Conf licts among communities in many parts
occur as communities compete for increasingly
scarce resources, while desertification in the
region has resulted in less availabilit y of land

Consequently, competition has become fierce,

In Mali, arid and semi-arid conditions and

contributed to further entrenching the
grievances of pastoralists. A conf lict that

would be even higher if the territories of ethnic
communities were included. Dispossession revolved
mostly around smallholdings and farms, which
particularly affected the poorest and most vulnerable
rural families. It became critical for Colombia to
make up for the material losses experienced by
displaced and rural populations as a result of
conflict, including by instigating land and housing
restitution and improving access to working capital
and capital goods.
Colombia is the only country in the world that
has implemented a land restitution policy amid
conflict. Valuable lessons can be drawn from this,
in particular regarding how to ensure the safe and
sustainable return of land, beyond just securing the
victims’ land titles. Colombia possesses a solid
legal framework to support the populations
displaced as a result of conflict, helping to sustain
peace by restoring not only land to people, but
also their dignity. The land restitution and territorial
rights policy for ethnic peoples and communities is
not isolated from the country’s other current or
planned social and political processes related to
rural areas. The implementation of the peace
agreement with Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia – People’s Army (FARC) – which includes
an integrated rural reform programme – represents
a unique opportunity to achieve long-lasting peace
and address the important social challenges faced
by rural populations.

Colombia witnessed a five-decade-long conflict that
left up to six million people internally displaced –
equivalent to 14 percent of the total population.
This was the result of systematic strategies of
eviction and dispossession by armed groups in
their quest to seize rural territories, control valuable
natural resources and land, and appropriate the
rents associated with these resources. Strategies of
forced displacement have also been associated
with the economy of drug trafficking, the growth of
which requires control over routes and land to
cultivate illegal crops. The scale and magnitude of
forced displacement is not only the main effect of
armed conflict, but also the main source of food
insecurity. The impact has been most keenly felt by
the poorest and most vulnerable populations,
including ethnic communities.
The economic and social repercussions of
Colombia’s conflict were both short- and long-term
in impact. Rebel strategies of eviction and
dispossession led first to the displacement of farmers
and rural households, while concentrating land
ownership in fewer hands and inducing lasting
changes in land-use and agricultural production
(from staple food crops to crops for industrial use,
including palm oil and coca leaves). This affected
poverty and inequality as well as food production
and access. For the period from 1980 to 2010, it is
estimated that 6.6 million hectares of land were
abandoned as a result of displacement. This figure

processes that enable food securit y and

processes? Are there specific pathways that
can contribute to sustaining peace?

Harvesting peace by improving food security
and nutrition

KEY MESSAGES:

Building resilience by promoting sustainable
peace is critical to improving food securit y
and nutrition outcomes in areas with
recurrent crises.120 However, knowledge is
more limited in regard to the role that food
securit y and nutrition can play in preventing
or mitigating conf licts and in potentially
contributing to sustaining peace. Studies on
how conf lict affects food securit y and
nutrition, and the channels through which
chronic povert y, deprivation and
dispossession could trigger or perpetuate
conf lict, suggest there could be potential
inter ventions that might support peace
processes and help prevent conf licts
from emerging.

è Conflict-sensitive and timely interventions
aimed at improving food security and nutrition
can contribute to sustaining peace.
è Building and strengthening resilience to
conflict requires helping countries and households
prevent, anticipate, prepare for, cope with, and
recover from conflicts.
è A sustainable impact on peace is more likely
when food security and nutrition initiatives are
implemented as part of a broader set of
multisectoral, humanitarian, developmental and
peace-related interventions.
è Much official development assistance (ODA)
to countries affected by conflict is provided in
the form of humanitarian assistance, focused on
short-term responses, and leaving insufficient
support for investments in longer-term resilience
building and preparedness.

First, inter ventions to improve food securit y
could help weaken some of the causes of
conf lict, including motives that may lead
individuals to support or join armed groups or
engage in illegal activities. Second, greater
food price stabilit y and the recover y of local
agricultural and food markets could help
v ulnerable individuals and households
mitigate the impacts of conf lict, including by
supporting people affected by conf lict in
regaining access to markets.

The earlier section “How does conf lict affect
food securit y and nutrition?” (see p. 39) showed
that conf lict strongly affects food insecurit y and
undernutrition. While the evidence is more
limited regarding the opposite causal
relationship, the section “Can food insecurit y
and undernutrition trigger conf lict?” (see p. 52)
indicated food insecurit y may also trigger and
perpetuate conf lict under certain circumstances.
This section examines how investments in food
securit y and nutrition, including building and
strengthening more-resilient livelihoods and
risk-informed programmes, may help to prevent
and mitigate conf licts and potentially contribute
to sustaining peace. The same measures will
also ser ve to mitigate the impacts of conf lict on
food securit y and nutrition.

More work is needed to better understand
these pathways. Nonetheless, as agriculture is
the dominant form of livelihood for the
majorit y of households in countries affected by
conf lict (see section “How does conf lict affect
food securit y and nutrition?”, p. 39), efforts to
revive the sector, foster economic growth,
increase food securit y and improve the
nutritional status of the population may also
have positive effects on sustaining peace. It is
important to rapidly re-engage smallholder
farmers – men and women – in productive
activities in the aftermath of shocks,
particularly in fragile settings. Policies that
strengthen local participation in decision-

dialog ues and policy discussions. It
encompasses activities aimed at preventing
the outbreak, escalation, continuation and
recurrence of conf lict, including by addressing
root causes and moving towards recover y,
reconstruction and development. While
economic revitalization and resilient and
sustainable livelihoods should be key elements
of a coordinated and coherent approach to
sustaining peace, they need to be combined
with establishing political processes,
improving safet y and securit y, re-establishing
the rule of law and respect for human rights,
restoring social ser vices and supporting core
government functions.128 Opportunities thus
exist for inter ventions in support of food
securit y, nutrition and agricultural livelihoods
to contribute to conf lict prevention and
sustaining peace, in order to address not only
the symptoms but also the root causes
of conf lict.

making processes on agriculture and food
securit y are vital.121 Social protection,
including in-kind and cash assistance, can
offer valuable peace dividends and contribute
to restoring trust in government and
rebuilding social capital.122
Findings from a review of case studies indicate
that social protection has the potential to
directly address some of the underlying causes
of conf lict in affected communities.123 Social
protection through cash-for-work (CF W)
programmes can help create productive
infrastructure and improve the technical
capacit y of governments and other local
counterparts, which when combined create an
enabling environment for nutrition and
health. There are substantial challenges to
ensuring effective assistance in conf lict and
post-conf lict settings, on which UN agencies
including FAO and W FP are working to
identif y how UN-wide efforts could help to
reinforce peace.124

Pathways to building resilience to conflict and
sustaining peace

In 2006, the UN Secretar y-General’s progress
report on the prevention of armed conf lict
stated that, “… tackling food insecurit y and
related problems of agricultural
underproduction and resource scarcit y can do
much to stabilize a fragile situation. A hungr y
person is an angr y person”.125 This perspective
was more recently reinforced in the April 2016
Securit y Council and General Assembly
resolutions on peacebuilding, where the
concept of sustaining peace was introduced
as a unif ying framework to address the root
causes of conf lict.126

There are a number of food securit y and
nutrition-related inter ventions and measures
that can be put in place to prevent and mitigate
the risk of conf licts recurring. Preventive
inter ventions that can break the link between
food insecurit y and conf lict include shielding
consumers and producers from food price
shocks, for example, through price stabilization
measures and social protection inter ventions.
A different approach, rooted in social
anthropolog y, is to drive recover y through
agriculture, thereby bringing new life to
shattered homes and communities, and
motivating people to come together after a
conf lict has destroyed social networks.129

Recognizing that policies and actions should
contribute to resolving and preventing the
underlying challenges, in 2015 the Committee
on World Food Securit y endorsed a Framework
for Action for Food Securit y and Nutrition in
Protracted Crises. The framework included a
specific principle for addressing food
insecurit y and undernutrition in a conf lictsensitive manner and for contributing to peace
objectives through food securit y and
nutrition-related inter ventions.127

Post-conf lict situations are t ypically fragile,
with 40 percent reverting to conf lict within ten
years.130 The international communit y should
pay special attention to post-conf lict situations
when seeking to sustain peace. However, there
is increasing recognition that sustaining peace
is no longer just a post-conf lict activit y, but
should be a priorit y during all stages of the
conf lict cycle – before, during and after.
Conf licts are rarely if ever linear and sequential
processes, but rather escalate and de-escalate in

management, land and water access and use,
low income and high unemployment.
Inter ventions can include support for
livelihoods, repair of infrastructure damaged
by conf lict or cash transfers and food
assistance to help households avoid resorting
to violence. It is equally vital to invest in
strengthening existing systems and capacities
to reduce the need for long-term emergency
assistance. A recent review by the UN
Peacebuilding Support Office recognizes the
potential of improved basic ser vice deliver y to
help sustain peace, including through
education, food securit y, health, and water
and sanitation.132

intensit y and are often cyclical in nature, with
periods and geographic pockets of relative peace
and stabilit y.
Acknowledging these complexities, a range of
pathways can be identified through which
support to livelihoods, food securit y and
nutrition can also help build resilience against
conf lict and contribute to sustaining peace:
  livelihood support that addresses the root causes of

conf licts and conf lict stressors, and that
promotes re-engagement in productive
economic activities, including cash transfers
and social protection;
  facilitated community-based approaches that help build
relationships and social cohesion, improving
aspirations, confidence and trust;

Livelihood-based peace dividends
The W FP Livelihood Asset Recover y
Programme in Liberia (2009–2012), supported
by FAO, enabled rural communities to build
and restore irrigation systems, roads and
agroprocessing facilities. This raised farm
productivit y and food availabilit y, improving
household income and access to food and
thereby addressing some of the root causes of
conf lict. In the short term, the project
provided work for unemployed rural youth,
helping to defuse an impending cause of
conf lict during a critical period of postconf lict recover y;133 with about 90 percent of
sur veyed participants saying they believed
these short-term jobs helped to promote peace
and reconciliation.134

  interventions that contribute to building the capacity of

institutions and local actors, improving
governance to deliver equitable ser vices.
Some of these pathways interact and overlap,
and in most instances combinations will
probably need to be considered (see Box 15).
Moreover, these inter ventions will need to fit
local conditions as well the context and nature
of the conf lict.
As conf lict t ypically coincides with other shocks,
it is also essential to enhance resilience to
these.131 For example, efforts to strengthen
resilience to droughts may include the
introduction of drought-resistant crops, water
har vesting, livelihood diversification and
increased access to risk-based insurance.
Resilience to economic shocks can be enhanced
through social protection and livelihood
inter ventions to increase purchasing power.
Efforts to improve resilience to multiple food
securit y shocks must also include national-level
inter ventions, to enhance government capacit y in
critical areas such as food securit y, emergency
preparedness and response and deliver y of basic
ser vices such as health, nutrition, education,
water and sanitation.

In another context, in response to the 2011
famine in Somalia, FAO significantly scaled
up its support to existing CF W inter ventions
in the central and southern regions. Since
then, the Organization has continued to
support thousands of families through a range
of activities designed to improve the resilience
of v ulnerable communities, rather than merely
offering short-term support for food securit y.
In the absence of a functioning government,
FAO provided basic ser vices (such as livestock
vaccinations) along with an ambitious
programme to build and rehabilitate rural
infrastructure (such as water catchments,
irrigation canals) through CF W schemes.
These rural assets were chosen for their
potential to increase the resilience of farmers
and pastoralists to shocks.135

BUILDING RESILIENCE TO CONFLICT
continued access to food during a conflict. Cashfor-work and food-for-assets programmes can also
provide temporary work opportunities while at the
same time creating or rehabilitating critical
productive infrastructure, such as roads or
irrigation systems. Farmers displaced by conflict
can be trained in new livelihood skills, with which
they can earn an income in camp settings.
Communities affected by violent cattle raiding can
be trained in switching partially or entirely to
livelihoods that are less exposed to conflict risks.
In pastoralist regions, watering points can be built
in safe areas to avoid the risk of leading livestock
into conflict zones.
 Recovering after conflict: Post-conflict situations
offer a critical window of opportunity to support
governments and communities in restoring food
security and nutrition to build back better.
Participation in decision-making is particularly
important for vulnerable groups that have been
systematically excluded and marginalized. Support
can be provided to internally displaced people,
refugees and ex-combatants for returning home
and resuming productive agricultural activities, for
example, by providing seeds, tools, livestock, or
skills training. Such interventions can be an
important element of national peace and recovery
plans or disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration programmes. Land tenure issues and
access to natural resources may also need to be
addressed. Support could also be provided in
restoring conflict-damaged infrastructure, including
roads and irrigation canals that are vital for food
production and marketing. Opportunities may also
arise to use food security and nutrition
interventions as a platform for sustaining peace
and mitigating relapses into conflict, for example,
by bringing communities together to rebuild
productive assets. Communities can be empowered
when provided with knowledge and skills to
improve their members’ health and nutritional
situation. Progress towards peace is often fragile
and easily reversible, and the impacts of conflict
on food security may persist well beyond the end
of active fighting. It will often be necessary to
sustain investments in many of the measures
outlined under “preventing”, “anticipating”,
“preparing” and “coping” above.

“Resilience to conflict” can be understood as assisting
countries and households to prevent, anticipate, prepare
for, cope with, and recover from conflicts in order to
“bounce forwards”.1 Below are some examples of
practical measures that can address each of the five
elements of resilience. Interventions should aim to
support communities in their own strategies and be
complemented by broader efforts to improve livelihoods.
 Preventing conflict: This will typically require
undertaking a range of efforts to address both root
and proximate causes of conflict, such as economic
exclusion, extractive or predatory institutions,
inequitable social services, access to and use of
natural resources, food insecurity, and climatic
disasters.
 Anticipating and preparing for conflict: Preliminary
efforts are under way to develop conflict earlywarning systems.2 These systems are intended to
help governments and humanitarian organizations
to plan and mobilize resources for timely
responses, such as humanitarian assistance or
shock-responsive social protection. At community
level, helping households to anticipate conflict may
also facilitate their own planning and preparation,
for example, through savings, livelihood
adjustments, or managed migration options. In
addition, in contexts where there is a high risk of
conflict, governments can be supported in
preparing relief responses or designing shockresponsive social protection mechanisms, as well
as in contingency planning to maintain delivery of
services and social protection during a conflict.
Again, communities can be supported, for
example, by facilitating saving cash or food or
developing skills in alternative livelihoods that are
likely to be less sensitive to conflict.
 Coping with conflict: Conflicts often reduce
household access to food, for example, owing to
displacement, disruption of livelihoods and
markets, food price inflation, or loss of household
wage earners. It is critical to support vulnerable
households in order to prevent them resorting to
negative coping strategies that further undermine
food security and nutrition or being incentivized to
participate in violence. Doing so requires timely,
well-targeted humanitarian action and shockresponsive, scaled-up social protection to enable

management. For example, FAO’s provision of
communit y-based animal health ser vices and
livestock vaccinations to the Dinka Ngok and
Misseriya communities in the contested Abyei
area of South Sudan and Sudan, working with
local government bodies, UN peacekeepers and
other UN entities,140 has been an effective entr y
point for re-establishing intercommunit y
dialog ue, leading to a local-level peace
agreement.141 Different groups often blame one
another as the source of animal disease
outbreaks, which can reignite violence.
Enhancing mutual trust and basic stabilit y is
therefore essential for sustainable recover y and
development programming, as recognized in
the Securit y Risk Management Process for the
Abyei area.142 Interaction between groups to
address mutual problems is often a good
starting point for building trust and
establishing cooperation, thereby facilitating
further collaboration between conf licting
parties on more sensitive topics.

The W FP programme Food Assistance for
Conf lict-Affected Populations in Nepal
(2007–2010) supported inter ventions that helped
to restore damaged productive agricultural
infrastructure, as well as training farmers in
agricultural skills. FAO contributed to this
programme, which was launched at the end of the
civil war in 2006. The inter ventions raised the
incomes of affected rural households and reduced
income inequalit y, thereby addressing what were
considered root causes of support for
the conf lict.136
The Western Sudan Resources Management
Programme ( WSRMP), financed by IFAD,
promotes the development of a natural-resources
governance system in the states of North, West
and South Kordofan. In western Sudan, conf lict
between different ethnic and livelihood groups
over scarce natural resources continues to erupt,
claiming dozens of lives ever y year. The
programme is developing a governance structure
for natural resources that is efficient, equitable
and environmentally sustainable, thereby
reducing disputes over natural resources between
nomadic and settled communities and farmers in
five target areas in the countr y. A range of
activities have been implemented to improve
livelihoods and promote peaceful coexistence
between different groups living along livestock
migration routes, including the creation of
conf lict resolution centres, with 92 percent of
reported cases resolved in 2015. This is coupled
with major investments in land demarcation
(more than 4 000 km of stock routes), restoration
of grazing routes and rangeland, water
har vesting, communit y adaptation plans, savings
groups, and support for small businesses to
promote diversification.137

Social protection
When properly designed, social protection
systems can contribute to overcoming the
frequent divide in responses between
emergency humanitarian assistance and
development support.143 Access to predictable,
sizeable and reg ular cash transfers can protect
poor households from the impacts of shocks in
the short term, thereby minimizing negative
coping practices that have lasting
consequences. Over time, by helping v ulnerable
households manage risks better, social
protection can induce investments in
livelihoods that enhance people’s resilience to
future threats and crises.144 In several
countries, school meal programmes have
contributed to sustaining peace, especially in
the post-conf lict phase. Social protection can
help create a sense of structure and normalit y,
as well as enhance equit y and cohesion among
conf lict-affected populations.145

The UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) has supported
inter ventions in multiple contexts to address
conf lict drivers, rehabilitate agriculture and
restore productive assets,138 while the Safe Access
to Fuel and Energ y programme has helped reduce
tensions arising from competition over natural
resources, by building more resilient livelihoods
and connecting displaced and host
communities.139

Non-formal and communit y-based support
structures are often the first resort in times of
conf lict, but are also weakened by such crises.
Impact evaluations in sub-Saharan countries
show that national cash transfer programmes
can strengthen communit y-based reciprocit y
structures. Cash transfers enable beneficiaries

appropriate. Herders may also need financial
and technical support to render their animals
more drought-resistant and marketable, and
thereby be better prepared for more frequent
and intense droughts in the future.

to join or re-enter the circles of their extended
families and communities, decreasing the
social distance between poor and wealthier
households and local institutions.146
A recent study in the Philippines offers
experimental evidence of conditional cash
transfers 147 leading to a substantial decrease
in conf lict-related incidents in treatment
villages relative to control villages. The
Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino programme was
also found to have reduced insurgent
inf luence in the villages involved, although it
cannot be excluded that this could also have
been the result of insurgents shifting their
focus of activit y to controlling villages.

FAO, UNICEF and W FP have identified three
interlinked groups of strategies that promote
resilience in the Horn of Africa:
(i) strengthening productive sectors;
(ii) improving basic social ser vices; and
(iii) establishing productive safet y nets.149
Evidence from the Sudan shows that providing
ser vices such as health, education and
physical securit y in remote areas characterized
by chronic v ulnerabilit y to food insecurit y,
and to inter-ethnic and cross-border violence,
can contribute to sustaining peace and
longer-term resilience.

The deliver y and design of social protection
needs to be carefully considered and tailored
to the specific context, incorporating welldesigned information campaigns, awareness
raising, grievance mechanisms and
transparency of targeting, as well as building
on any existing social protection structures.

Gender-sensitive approaches and the role of
women in securing peace and food security
As analysed in the section “How does conf lict
affect food securit y and nutrition?” (see p. 39),
violent conf licts affect men and women
differently. The different impacts in terms of
shifted roles and responsibilities should be
recognized when designing policies for
economic recover y and peaceable transition of
countries affected by conf lict.

Reducing price volatility and strengthening risk
management capacities
Measures to stem agricultural and food price
instabilit y can help build resilience against
human and climatic shocks to livelihoods,
while mitigating the risk of food price spikes
becoming a trigger of conf lict.

Inter ventions that include specific measures
for gender equalit y programming not only
strengthen women’s empowerment but are
also more effective in food and nutrition
securit y outcomes. As well as helping them
and their communities to complete har vests,
targeting women as beneficiaries of food
assistance and social protection can
contribute significantly to improving
household resilience and sustaining peace, as
their roles are often under valued and their
needs marginalized.

At the macro level, this might involve stricter
rules on food commodit y speculation and the
institutionalization of grain reser ves to
stabilize prices in times of crisis. It also
includes investment in creating price
information systems, as well as expanding
credit and insurance markets.148
Given the link between climatic shocks, crop
and livestock price collapse and conf lict
outbreaks, adopting agricultural practices and
livelihood strategies for climate change
adaptation should be promoted as an integral
part of conf lict prevention – with pastoralist
and semi-pastoralist livelihoods deser ving
special attention. Introducing and expanding
credit and insurance markets may help herders
to better cope with droughts by avoiding loss
of their herds, and more importantly by

Promoting women’s economic empowerment

that constrain their access to resources,

conf lict-resolution networks and female-run
production cooperatives.153

For example, Burundi continues to experience
cycles of violence and political crisis that
contribute to food insecurit y and disrupt
agriculture. This is taking place in a context
where 75 percent of the population are
food-insecure and 90 percent rely on
subsistence farming as a livelihood source.
IFAD’s countr y programme promotes
nutrition-sensitive agriculture activities as a
means to break out of the cycle, including
nutritional education for mothers, vegetable
production, livestock development, and
creation of savings and loan schemes among
communit y self-help groups. The programme
targets households severely disrupted by
conf lict, also promoting literacy for women
and providing access to legal advice on how to
increase their economic engagement.150

Community-based approaches to build trust and
social cohesion
Traditional post-conf lict policies and actions
are generally focused on reconstruction
efforts, which are important for increasing
agricultural production in short periods.
However, recent analysis suggests that
policies should also aim to create favourable
conditions for reducing uncertaint y (see the
section “How does conf lict affect food
securit y and nutrition?”, p. 39).
Re-establishing the rule of law and reducing
insecurit y are essential for improving
confidence and trust in communities and
between households. Paired with increased
access to formal credit and social protection,
reducing uncertaint y may also help
households to avoid selling productive assets
or taking suboptimal planting decisions, and
instead invest more in improving incomes
and food securit y.

The landmark United Nations Securit y Council
Resolution 1325 151 addresses not only the
inordinate impact of conf lict on women, but
also the pivotal role they should, and do, play
in conf lict management, resolution and
sustainable peace. A study of the impacts of
implementation of this resolution found
significant progress in supporting women’s
participation in electoral processes, the securit y
sector, and gender mainstreaming in policies.
However, only modest impacts were found in
other areas including protection for women
against conf lict-related sexual violence and for
women ser ving in peacekeeping forces.152

Reinforcing positive aspirations, improving
well-being
Confidence, hope and dignit y are all factors
that shape people’s aspirations about their
future lives and relations with others –
including perceptions and attitudes towards
social cooperation and cohesion, both of
which are arg uably key to sustaining peace.154
Recent research building on behavioural
economics has shown that aspirations are
crucial in shaping economic development and
social interactions.155 Some of these findings
have informed social and individual skills
training programmes aimed at young people
who were involved in violent conf licts, helping
them to reset and improve their aspirations.

It is often assumed that women are first and
foremost victims of war. However, this is a
limited perspective as women also undertake
daily activities that contribute to peace. A
recent study found that women’s contributions
to peace were most notable when they worked
together to bridge differences in religion,
ethnicit y, class and between urban and rural
divides. Working across divides has allowed
more-robust organizations and networks to
emerge, as well as preparing the ground for
peace within the larger population. In
Burundi, after the peace agreement was
signed in 2000, women’s organizations were
supported in developing radio programmes to
share concerns and information. They also
received training on conf lict resolution which
facilitated the creation of mutual-aid and

As many ex-combatants are young men and

as it is for a more positive outlook. The

medical care and personal items, as well as

where tensions exist between displaced

training and agricultural tools and supplies.
An evaluation showed the programme led to
the increased engagement of youth in
agriculture and reduced involvement in illicit
mining. Participants were also much less
likely to have joined local armed groups
involved in an outbreak of violence in
Côte d’Ivoire.156

The FAO-supported Dimitra Clubs improve
rural people’s livelihoods and gender equalit y
in communities in Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mali, Niger
and Senegal. Empowering rural women and
men – both adults and young people – the
clubs provide spaces for communit y-level
dialog ue and action to address common
challenges. Qualitative assessments ref lect
changes in behaviour, practices and
perceptions of men and women in rural
communities, including: improved access to
information and knowledge, new agricultural
practices, improved self-confidence and
leadership of women, communit y mobilization
and improved social cohesion. The discussions
and achievements of the clubs are broadcast
on communit y radio to inspire others. After
years of civil war and continuing insecurit y in
the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, the clubs have created new
dynamics through information-sharing on
food securit y, agricultural practices, HI V/
AIDS, and domestic violence. The clubs have
given a voice to women, helping to bring
communities together to invest in improving
their livelihoods.159

Jobs can compensate for the loss of identit y,
status and income associated with the
dissolution of armed forces and militias, as
well as counteracting stress factors that could
reignite conf lict. Central to the PBF–FAO –ILO
Jobs for Peace programme implemented in the
insurgency-affected areas of Nepal in the
period 2009–2012 was the creation of rural
youth employment. It played an important role
in enhancing social cohesion during the postconf lict process of reintegration and sustaining
peace, providing remunerative alternatives and
discouraging re-engagement in violence.
Similarly, an FAO-supported agricultural
livelihoods programme in the North Caucasus
stimulated economic recover y, contributed to
social regeneration and enhanced individuals’
sense of well-being.157
Cash transfer programmes can also improve
mental health and reduce stress and anxiet y
among beneficiar y populations, as seen in
refugee groups in Jordan. In this case, the
reg ular transfer, receipt and consequent abilit y
to pay for critical expenditures increased their
sense of self-esteem, with one-third of
respondents reporting lower levels of stress
and anxiet y.158

An ongoing PBF-funded programme in
Kyrg yzstan to improve cross-border
cooperation brings ethnic Kyrg yz and Tajik
groups together to restore irrigation canals
through W FP’s Food Assistance for Assets
programme. The canals benefit both ethnic
groups, while the process of jointly managing
and physically working together on the
project provides space for interaction,
dialog ue, cooperation and building trust,
particularly through reg ular intercommunit y
meetings.160 Other agencies including FAO,
UNDP, UNICEF, and UN Women are involved
in activities within this programme, all
promoting intercommunit y dialog ue
and engagement.

Joint community planning and dialogue,
supporting social cohesion
Food securit y and nutrition inter ventions can
be rendered more effective by facilitating
dialog ue between groups from different sides of
a conf lict and engaging them in the planning
and implementation of programmes. Training
and awareness raising for sustaining peace can
be equally critical for successful inter ventions.
For example, in many conf lict-affected
contexts, W FP conducts seasonal livelihood
programming consultations involving
representatives of civil societ y organizations,

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

Effectiveness and legitimacy of institutions

Strengthening regional and national institutions
is critical for the effective design and
implementation of food securit y and nutrition
information systems and disaster risk prevention
and reduction mechanisms. Within the
framework of the Global Alliance for Resilience
Initiative and the United Nations Integrated
Strateg y for the Sahel, FAO, W FP and other
partners support the Cadre Harmonisé, an
information and early warning system for food
securit y and nutrition in the Sahel. Established
in 2008 – 09 by the Permanent Interstate
Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, the
Cadre Harmonisé is now present in 17 countries
in the region and yields reg ular food securit y
situation reports with timely warnings for
decision-makers. As a result, governments and
humanitarian actors in the region have access to
reliable data to take informed decisions as to
how to prevent, mitigate, anticipate and respond
to recurrent food crises. For example, the Cadre
Harmonisé provides reg ular updates on the food
securit y crisis that resulted from the Boko
Haram-related violence in northeast Nigeria.

Poor governance is often a factor in conflict,
undermining the state–society compact and
creating or exacerbating the perception of
discrimination as well as actual inequalities.
The impact of conflict on food insecurity and
undernutrition is also stronger when compounded
by weak capacity of government and nongovernmental institutions to respond to crises
and mitigate the risks of affected and vulnerable
populations (see the sections “Why focus on the
nexus between conflict, food security and
nutrition?”, p. 30, and “How does conflict affect
food security and nutrition?”, p. 39).
Food security and nutrition interventions that
strengthen institutions
Food securit y inter ventions that build the
capacit y of institutions to deliver equitable access
to ser vices may help to restore confidence in state
effectiveness and legitimacy, while increasing
incentives for the population to maintain peace
and stabilit y. This could be equally true for
building the capacit y of non-state-level
institutions (such as farmer cooperatives, water
user associations, women’s groups, and
communit y grain banking groups) to provide
better ser vices for local communities. Many see
functioning and effective institutions as essential
for building resilience to conf lict.161

Recently, FAO has supported Côte d’Ivoire in
the development and adoption of a policy for
land tenure securit y in rural areas. The policy is
considered essential in the countr y’s postconf lict context, where tensions over land tenure
continue to pose risks to social stabilit y and
could spark conf licts between communities.
Developed through a participator y and inclusive
approach that involved communities, traditional
and administrative authorities, nongovernmental organizations, development
partners and the Government, an autonomous
agency was created to implement the policy, and
a communications strateg y on rural land tenure
securit y was rolled out. Collective land
ownership certificates have been agreed,
encouraging agro-enterprises to return to
business, as disputes over land are no longer a
major issue.164

Poor basic ser vice deliver y can undermine state
legitimacy and perpetuate conf lict. However,
contrar y to conventional wisdom, improved
ser vice deliver y does not necessarily enhance
state legitimacy.162 Research by the Secure
Livelihoods Research Consortium in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nepal,
Pakistan and Uganda found that poor experiences
of ser vice qualit y indeed led to less-favourable
perceptions of the state. At the same time, it
concluded that enhanced ser vice deliver y only
improved such perceptions if accompanied by
improvements in other forms of societal trust,
including through communit y participation in
voicing grievances. This more nuanced
relationship between ser vice deliver y and state
legitimacy was also identified elsewhere, such as
in the provision of water ser vices in Iraq.163
At the same time, improved ser vice deliver y
should not exacerbate inequalities in fragile
situations, as this could risk re-igniting conf lict.

appeals or humanitarian action plans had been
adopted for more than the traditional one-year
duration. Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Somalia and the Sudan now all engage
in multiyear planning, in some cases for a
second three-year cycle. The Syrian Regional
Refugee and Resilience Response Plan also
includes appeals for 2017 and 2018.

development assistance (ODA) and national
efforts. Yet, ODA support for efforts to prevent
conf lict and sustain peace remains limited.
Much of the ODA f lowing to countries in
conf lict or with a protracted crisis takes the
form of humanitarian assistance. Seven
protracted crisis contexts received on average
more than 30 percent of ODA in the form of
humanitarian assistance in the period 2012–
14, while four received more than 45 percent
of ODA in that form, rising to 79 percent in
the case of the Syrian Arab Republic; these
shares are almost 20 percent higher when
protracted crises are filtered for conf lict.
Compared with countries not affected by
conf lict, humanitarian assistance to countries
affected by conf lict is three and a half times
higher as a proportion of total ODA.165

While the arg ument about whether to plan over
multiyear cycles appears to be prevailing, the
issue at stake is to do so more effectively.
Concerns remain as to how much ODA-funded
support is indeed now subject to actual
multiyear programming and financing. For
example, in 2015, the United Nations Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCH A) estimated that only 9 percent of the
527 projects under the Sahel 2014–2016
Humanitarian Response Plan could legitimately
be considered part of a multiyear cycle.167 Yet
other evidence is more encouraging: in 2014,
multiyear contributions to W FP increased to
over US$600 million, representing almost
11 percent of total contributions received. This
is a three-fold increase since 2010 –11, building
on an expanding base of multiyear agreements
with donors.168

About 80 percent of humanitarian appeals are
related to conf lict situations, most of which
are now protracted in nature. There have been
calls in recent years for longer-term and more
predictable funding in protracted crises in
order to enable a sustained response to
chronic or recurrent needs and help boost the
resilience of crisis-affected communities.166
However, the data cited above indicate that
integrating humanitarian and development
assistance in the context of long-term policy
and planning frameworks may not have
changed substantially in the past decade –
despite continued increases in overall levels of
humanitarian assistance. In fact, the highestever amount of international humanitarian
assistance recorded was in 2015: estimated at
US$28 billion, this was the third consecutive
annual increase in overall spending. In the
past decade, the total volume of humanitarian
assistance has increased steadily, particularly
in protracted crisis contexts (almost
60 percent) and in countries affected by
conf lict (almost 50 percent).

ODA support for agriculture in conflict and
protracted crisis contexts
Agriculture is the mainstay of livelihoods of
most people living in situations of fragilit y,
protracted crisis, and/or conf lict (see the
section “Why focus on the nexus between
conf lict, food securit y and nutrition?”, p. 30).
This highlights the importance of increasing
the priorit y of and support for agricultural
development in these contexts in terms of
contributing to recover y, building resilient
livelihoods and improving food securit y and
nutrition as a cornerstone for peaceful and
inclusive societies.

Towards multiyear planning and financing

It is not feasible to analyse existing ODA data
to assess in detail the amount of international
support for specific inter ventions towards
resilience building in conf lict-affected contexts.
Painting with a broader brush, in contexts of
protracted crisis, the sectors of direct
importance to food securit y and nutrition

Better integration of humanitarian and
development support to conf lict contexts
requires longer-term donor commitments. Such
a shift towards multiyear planning is already a
realit y in a number of protracted crisis and
conf lict contexts. By 2015, some 15 consolidated
| 69 |

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

Implications for ODA contributions to sustaining
peace

received relatively small shares of total
developmental ODA between 2012 and 2015:
5.8 percent for agriculture; 3.8 percent for
water, sanitation, and hygiene, 7.4 percent for
basic health, and 2.1 percent for education.
Notably, the share for agricultural development
in conf lict-affected and protracted crisis
contexts was on average well below that for
other least-developed countries, which stood at
8.1 percent.169

Despite recent initiatives and positive moves
toward multiyear planning and financing in
humanitarian appeals, this limited analysis
of development and humanitarian aid f lows
suggests there is still a need to better
“layer” different financing tools and
resources. Individual protracted crisis and
conf lict-affected contexts need to receive
enough of the right mix of support to
respond to the challenges of ensuring food
securit y and nutrition, strengthening
resilience and sustaining peace. This should
be ref lected across the humanitarian,
development and peace pillars and could
include risk finance, peace operations,
multilateral, bilateral, the private sector,
technical cooperation, loans, and domestic
tax revenue, among others.

On the humanitarian side, despite huge
increases in levels of funding, there remains a
large gap in terms of increasing funding
requirements. Analysis of the OCH A Financial
Tracking System shows that the percentage of
support versus requirements under the
Consolidated Appeals Process for the
agriculture sector in 2016 was 27 percent, a
dramatic decline from 2011 when support was at
58 percent of requirements. Funding levels for
countries with a protracted crisis did marginally
better at 31 percent (Figure 22). A similar trend
can be seen in the food sector,170 where funding
declined from 77 percent of requirements in
2011 to 51 percent in 2016, with the same level
both globally and just in protracted crisis
contexts. A fall in the percentage of
requirements met was also seen in the health
sector between 2011 and 2016. Other key sectors
such as water and sanitation and education
globally received less than 50 percent of
assessed needs.171 Given the myriad factors
underlying conf licts and the multiple
inter ventions required to sustain peace, all
sectors require adequate funding, including
support to governance and peacekeeping.

Donors do not seem to give the highest priority
to addressing the root causes of conflict. That is
to say, an examination of sector allocations of
ODA shows that countries with conf lict and
protracted crisis situations receive less ODA for
agricultural sector development than do other
developing countries with comparable shares of
agriculture to GDP. The international
community has a responsibility to help address
the root causes of conf lict, which may also
relate in part to disputes over agricultural and
other natural resources, as well as deteriorating
food insecurit y and malnutrition. Measures
aimed at strengthening resilience and
sustaining peace can also support a sustainable
shift from providing humanitarian assistance
to those in need, to reducing those needs and
the related humanitarian costs.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that UN
peacekeeping expenditures help to reduce the
risk of renewed conf lict after it has ended.
While recognizing that economic recover y is
the best way to achieve stable peace, doubling
peacekeeping expenditure can reduce the risk
of conf lict recurrence from 40 to 31 percent.172

This will also mean working together more
effectively across the humanitarian–
development–peace nexus in pursuit of
collective outcomes. Recently termed the “New
Way of Working”,173 this collective method is
being adopted as a priorit y across the UN
system, within (and between) both the InterAgency Standing Committee and the United
Nations Development Group. Representing a
huge challenge both in terms of operations and
policy, this will be a gradual process, but one
that is essential to achieving improved food

An analysis of post-conf lict northern Uganda
(see Box 16) illustrates how a combination of
peace processes and investments in peace and
recover y led to significant gains in food
securit y and nutrition within a relatively
short period.

Improving contributions to sustaining peace
As reinforced by the 2030 Agenda, the New
Way of Working and the Peace Promise 174
among others, there is a global consensus that
to achieve SDG 2 (and other SDGs), all
pillars – humanitarian, development and
peace – must work together to prevent conf lict
and sustain peace. Peace and stabilit y can be
both the enabler for and outcome of
development. Among the most effective
policies and strategies to restore peace and
stabilit y are those that simultaneously reduce
development stresses and mitigate risks of
conf lict, gradually building a virtuous cycle

Food securit y and nutrition-related
inter ventions are generally only likely to have
a sustainable impact on peace when
implemented as part of a broader set of
mutually reinforcing efforts across multiple
sectors by multiple actors, ideally nationally
owned. These might include formal political
peace processes, building and supporting
institutions, justice and securit y, economic
growth and employment, and the provision of

and peaking at 1.9 million in 2007 (see figure).1
Following the retreat of LRA forces from northern
Uganda in 2006–07, the IDP camps were closed and
people returned to their places of origin over the
following years. Significant investments were made
both in sustaining peace and in promoting recovery
under the framework of the government-led Peace,
Recovery and Development Plan for Northern Uganda.
For example, combined contributions of US$51.5 million

(2011–12) and the Multi-Country Demobilization and

The post-conflict recovery of northern Uganda is a
positive example of how sustained investments in peace

in food security and nutrition in a former conflict zone.
Two decades of conflict between government forces
and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern
Uganda led to mass displacements coupled with a
surge in poverty and food insecurity and malnutrition,
particularly in the formerly agricultural Acholi region.
Forced to live in camps, the Acholi population – who
had previously been largely food secure – became
almost entirely reliant on international food assistance.

phases of the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund
(NUSAF I and II).3
The Government of Uganda identified agriculture as
a priority for post-conflict recovery. Multiple
organizations supported IDPs and ex-combatants in
repairing their livelihoods through the provisioning of
inputs, such as seeds and tools, as well as livestock
restocking, cash- and food-for-work programmes, all
complemented by national-level efforts to enhance food
security and nutrition governance. An estimated
32 percent of funding for NUSAF I went to agriculture.4
Food security and nutrition in northern Uganda
have improved substantially since the end of the
conflict: no further food assistance has been required
by the Acholi population since the end of 2011, and
WFP phased it out in that region in 2010.5 In Uganda

as a whole, the prevalence of wasting in children
declined by almost one-third, from a high of
6.3 percent in 2006 to 4.3 percent in 2012.6
Meanwhile, the percentage of the country’s population
living below the national poverty line declined from
31.1 percent in 2005 to 19.5 percent in 2012.7
The case of northern Uganda demonstrates how
timely and substantial post-conflict investments in
peace and recovery, with a strong emphasis on
agriculture, can contribute to significantly improving
food security and nutrition. Despite the emergence of
relative peace, recent advice suggests that continued
support is still required to address underlying conflict
stressors in northern Uganda, such as grievances
over land and ethnic divisions, to avoid a relapse
into conflict.8

OVERALL
RECOMMENDATIONS

To effectively address conf lict-related causes of
food insecurit y and undernutrition as well as
reduce the risks of conf lict, it is necessar y to
invest in multisectoral causal analyses and
inter ventions that address both chronic and acute
food insecurit y and undernutrition. Policy and
programme coherence is needed in addressing
these impacts, along the following lines:

Conflict can have significant negative and
destructive impacts on the immediate and
underlying determinants of individual and
household food security and nutrition including
nutrition-related morbidity and mortality. When
considering appropriate responses, it is critical to
understand the complex, direct and indirect
channels and the multiple compounding impacts.
This in turn requires an understanding not only of
the nature of the conflict, but also of context-specific
factors and the vulnerability of people’s livelihoods.

economic crises that wreak havoc on

securit y and nutrition. Social policies are
also needed to address the challenges to
| 73 |

PART 2 CONFLICT, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: THE IMPERATIVE OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE

To inform coherent policy responses as described
above, it will be essential to improve the
evidence base on cause and effect in the nexus
between conflict, food insecurity, and sustaining
peace (see Box 17). Moreover, the shifting nature
and complexity of conflict has significant
implications for efforts and interventions aimed
at reducing hunger and undernutrition. Working
in conflict-affected contexts cannot be “business
as usual”, but requires a conflict-sensitive
approach if the challenges of hunger and
undernutrition are to be addressed.

health and nutrition that result from reduced
access to and availabilit y of food.
  Policies and investments are needed for
agriculture and food systems in particular.
Deep economic crises can unfold where the
root cause of the conf lict is competition over
natural resources, including productive land or
water resources. Policies should address these
root causes and aim to mitigate – and if
possible prevent – their impact on food
systems, food securit y and the economy at
large. As agriculture is the mainstay of
people’s livelihoods in many countries affected
by conf lict, inter ventions should prioritize
investment in improving the resilience of the
sector.
  Effective support to populations displaced by
conf lict needs to be an integral part of the
policy agenda, considering that more than half
of the world’s refugees originate in countries
affected by conf lict and IDPs are concentrated
in these same areas. Adequate livelihood and
social support needs to be provided to both the
displaced and the host populations, as they too
experience added stress on their resources, and
to address enhanced risk of disease due to poor
access to water, sanitation and health ser vices.
  There is a need for polices and scaled-up
programmes aimed at building and
strengthening resilience to shocks and
stressors in order to prevent long-lasting
consequences on food securit y and nutrition.
Strengthening social policies and protection
systems will be critical, as households’ own
coping capacities tend to be considerably
reduced in situations of violent conf lict. Unless
these programmes are in place, individuals and
households may engage in increasingly
destructive and irreversible coping strategies
that threaten future livelihoods, food securit y
and nutrition.
  Food securit y and nutrition policies and
programmes must take into consideration the
specific needs and priorities of men, women,
boys and girls, and target inter ventions in a
gender-responsive way that leaves no one
behind. This will require inter ventions being
developed based on a sound gender analysis
and that existing v ulnerabilities and capacities
be fully recognized, providing both men and
women with the opportunit y to be engaged in
the whole process.

As shocks to food securit y and nutrition may
also be a trigger or compounding factor of
conf licts, building more-resilient rural
livelihoods and measures to improve food
securit y and nutrition will likely be instrumental
to both mitigating the impacts of conf lict and
reducing the likelihood of conf lict occurring.
Regardless of the triggers, there are three
principles to consider when identif ying possible
responses to conf lict. In all situations, responses
should be supportive of wider peace processes
and contribute to sustaining peace, demanding
conf lict-sensitive approaches and ensuring that
the role of women is sufficiently recognized:
  In situations of ongoing conflict, it is essential that

assistance be provided in ways that do not
exacerbate tensions, that avoid causing harm
and that adhere to humanitarian principles,
while ensuring that efforts aim to build
resilience as well as address immediate needs.
  In areas of greater stability, the focus should be on
supporting local reconciliation and normalit y,
for example, by supporting livelihoods,
securing assets and re-establishing
infrastructure and providing basic ser vices
(i.e. health, nutrition and social) in ways that
help bring communities together, build social
cohesion, and offer a platform for peacerelated lessons learned.
  In areas with peace accords in place, support must be
geared at local and national peace and
development plans in a coherent and
integrated manner.
No blueprints can be provided on the best course
of action to take in any given conf lict-affected
situation, but some general recommendations on
better ways of working are as follows:

THE NEED FOR MORE AND BETTER RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS

Substantially improving the evidence base to better
inform the design, targeting and implementation of
interventions will require the following efforts:
 Strengthen collaboration with research
institutions and academia in measuring
outcomes related to peace in order to explore
pathways such as building resilience to conflict,
improving social cohesion, the role of
institutions, or reducing the opportunity costs for
violence and conflict.
 Conduct further research around the role of
individual aspirations and perceptions and how
people make choices and decisions in conflict
and protracted crisis contexts. This could include
using perceptions to measure household
resilience1 or exploring how to enhance
individuals’ positive aspirations and perceptions
through food security and nutrition interventions.

 Better align databases and conceptual frameworks
that measure food security and conflict, enabling
the improvement of local contexts where conflict
and food insecurity interact.2
 Most existing conflict early warning systems fall
short in terms of transparency, public availability
and replicability, which greatly hampers their
usefulness. Uppsala University 3 is working on a
political Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS)
to assess the risk that conflicts will erupt, continue,
or spread to new locations, involve new actors, or
start targeting civilians and whether fragile peace
will hold. Such systems could provide forecasts on
the timing and location of different forms of
political conflict, bringing together the underlying
structural risks of violence (including food security
drivers), and could be usefully integrated into food
security, nutrition, and early warning systems. 4

The interaction of food securit y and nutrition
inter ventions with complex processes of social
change both shape and are shaped by
individual and household behaviours, social
norms, institutions, the operation of markets,
and collective action.
  Closer partnerships between humanitarian,
development and peace actors and
international financial institutions will be
important to support conf lict and protracted
crisis-affected communities in addressing
root causes, building resilience and finding
durable solutions.

nutrition and sustainable peace will
require a change in mind-set to a more
deliberate, preventive approach, and from
short-term and output-based inter ventions
to longer-term sustainable and collective
outcomes linked to a strategic focus on
resilience building.
  In conf lict-affected and protracted crisis
contexts, a boost in development action to
help people become self-reliant as quickly as
possible and build resilience to future shocks
(including conf lict) is vital. This will require
more risk tolerance, earlier engagement, more
f lexible financing and context-adaptable,
conf lict-sensitive programming. n

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 Target 2.1: “By 2030, end hunger and
ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable
situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.”
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 2 Target 2.2: “By 2030, end all forms of
malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on
stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, and address the nutritional
needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons.”
2
Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent of population is
covered. To reduce the margin of error in projections, estimates are presented
as three-year averages.
3
People living in households where at least one adult has been found to be
food-insecure, as a percentage of the total population. To reduce the impact of
year-to-year sampling variability, estimates are presented as three-year averages.
Country-level estimates should be interpreted as preliminary estimates and are
presented only for those countries for which estimates are based on official national
data (Brazil, Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Canada, Guatemala, Mexico, Seychelles and
the United States of America) or for which approval to publish FAO estimates based
on Gallup® World Poll data was provided by national statistical authorities. Global,
regional and subregional aggregates reflect data collected in almost 150 countries.
4
Anaemia data for 2016 for countries in the WHO European region are undergoing
validation and thus are subject to change. The WHO European region includes:
Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro,

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2017

METHODOLOGICAL
NOTES

in the population. DEC can be estimated from
data on food consumption obtained through
sur veys that are representative of the population.
DEC can also be estimated from accounts of the
total supply and utilization of all food
commodities in a given countr y, where the
contribution of each commodit y to the
availabilit y of food for human consumption is
expressed through its dietar y energ y content and
the total divided by the size of the population.
The major source of data on national food
balances are the Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
maintained by FAO for most countries in the world
(see www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/).

UNDERNOURISHMENT
Definition: Undernourishment is defined as the
condition in which an individual’s habitual food
consumption is insufficient to provide the
amount of dietar y energ y required to maintain a
normal, active, healthy life.
How it is reported: The indicator is reported as the
prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), which is
an estimate of the proportion of the population
that has been in a condition of undernourishment
over the reference period (usually one year).

The coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (Skew). The
most common sources of data to estimate C V and
Skew are multipurpose household sur veys, such
as Living Standard Measurement Sur veys or
Household Incomes and Expenditure Sur veys
(Household Budget Sur veys), which also collect
information on food consumption.

Methodology: To compute an estimate of the
prevalence of undernourishment in a population,
a probabilit y distribution of habitual daily dietar y
energ y intake levels (expressed in kcal) for an
average individual is modelled through a
parametric probabilit y densit y function (pdf ),
f(x). Once the pdf has been characterized, the
indicator is obtained as the cumulative
probabilit y that daily habitual dietar y energ y
intakes (x) are below minimum dietar y energ y
requirements (MDER) (i.e. below the lowest
acceptable range in the distribution of energ y
requirements) for a representative average
individual, as in the formula below:

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). Human
energ y requirements are computed by
multiplying normative requirements for basic
metabolic rate (BMR, expressed per kilogram of
body mass) by the ideal weight of a healthy
person of given height, and then multiplied by a
coefficient of physical activit y level. Ranges of
normal energ y requirements are thus computed
for each sex and age group of the population.
The MDER for a given population group,
including for the national population, is
obtained as the weighted average of the
minimums of the energ y requirement ranges for
each sex and age, using the population size in
each group as weights.

PoU = ∫x< MDER f(x|DEC; CV; Skew)dx
where DEC (mean dietary energ y consumption),
CV (coefficient of variation, which reflects the
spread of the distribution, or inequality in
access to food) and Skew (skewness, which
determines the asymmetry in the distribution)
characterize the distribution of habitual dietary
energ y consumption levels in the population
(see www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf for a
detailed description).

PoU projections for 2016: The PoU estimates for 2016
were obtained by projecting each of the model’s
parameters and applying the formula above to the
projected parameters. While each countr y’s PoU
value for 2016 was projected separately, only the
aggregate subregional, regional and global values
are reported in order to limit the impact of
possible projection bias.

Data source: Different data sources can be used to
estimate the different parameters of the model.

Dietary energy consumption (DEC). The mean of the

Projection of the DEC. The latest available data from
national food balance sheets for most countries
refer to a year between 2013 and 2015. To

individual in a population corresponds to the
average daily per capita food consumption level

likely exceed 5 percent in most cases. For this
reason, FAO does not consider national level PoU
estimates lower than 2.5 percent as sufficiently
reliable to be reported.

the per capita availabilit y of major commodities –
cereals, meats, oilseeds, and sugar, available from
the Trade and Market Division (EST) of FAO,1 is
used to estimate the likely rates of change in total
food availabilit y from 2013, 2014 or 2015
(depending on the countr y) to 2016. Such rates of
change are then applied to the latest available
DEC values to project them up to 2016.

Challenges and limitations: While the state of being
undernourished applies to individuals, due to
conceptual and data-related considerations,
the indicator can only refer to a population or
group of individuals. The prevalence of
undernourishment is thus an estimate of the
percentage of individuals in a group that are
in that condition; it is not based on
identification of which individuals in the
population are undernourished.

FOOD INSECURITY AS MEASURED BY THE
FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE SCALE
(FIES)
Definition: Food insecurit y as measured by this
indicator refers to limited access to food, at the level
of individuals or households, due to lack of
money or other resources. The severit y of food
insecurit y is measured using the Food Insecurit y
Experience Scale (FIES), a global measurement
standard established by FAO.

Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference
and the margins of uncertaint y associated with
estimates of each of the parameters in the model,
the precision of the PoU estimates is generally
low. While it is not possible to calculate margins
of error around PoU estimates, these would

How it is reported: In this report, FAO provides two
different estimates of severe food insecurity (FI sev):

The EST division has developed and maintained a commodity balance database
(XCBS) that provides with elementary information for analysis of the food situation of
a country or a group of countries. The XCBS provides balance sheet structured data for
the major commodities in the following groups: cereals, dairy, meat, oil-bearing crops,

sugar, tropical beverages, bananas and citrus. The data from the XCBS is used in a
number of FAO publications and associated databases such as the Global Information
and Early Warning System (GIEWS), food outlook and crop prospects and food
situation. XCBS provides with up to date information on agriculture markets.

 the prevalence (%) of individuals in the population
living in households where at least one adult
was found to be severely food insecure
 the estimated number of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be severely food insecure

As only adults are sampled in the GWP, the
prevalence estimates directly produced from this
data refer to the population 15 years and older. In
order to arrive at the prevalence and number of
individuals (of all ages) in the population, an
estimate is required of the number of people
living in households where at least one adult is
food insecure. This involves a multistep
procedure detailed in Annex II of the Voices of
the Hungr y Technical Report (see link below).

Data source: Since 2014, the 8-question FIES survey
module has been applied in nationally representative
samples of the adult population (defined as aged
15 or older) in more than 140 countries included in
the Gallup® World Poll (GWP), covering 90 percent
of the world population. In most countries, samples
include about 1 000 individuals, with larger samples
of 3 000 individuals in India and 5 000 in
mainland China.

Regional and global aggregates of FI sev are computed as:
FI r =

∑ c Nc

where r indicates the region and FI c is the value
of FI estimated for countr y c in the region and
N c is the corresponding population size.
Missing values for individual countries are
imputed to be equal to the population-weighted
average of the estimated values of the countries
in the same region.

For Canada, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Guatemala,
Mexico, Seychelles and the United States of America,
national government survey data were used to
calculate the prevalence estimates of food insecurity
by applying FAO’s statistical methods to adjust
national results to the same global reference standard.

Methodology: The data were validated and used to

Universal thresholds are defined on the FIES
global standard scale (a set of item parameter
values based on results from all countries covered
by the GWP in 2014–16) and converted into
corresponding values on local scales. The process
of calibrating each countr y’s scale against the
FIES global standard can be referred to as
equating, and permits the production of
internationally comparable measures of food
insecurit y severit y for individual respondents, as
well as comparable national prevalence rates.

construct a scale of food-insecurit y severit y using
the Rasch model, which postulates that the
probabilit y of obser ving an affirmative answer by
respondent i to question j is a logistic function of
the distance, on an underlying scale of severit y,
between the position of the respondent, a i , and
that of the item, b j .

By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it
is possible to estimate the probabilit y of being
severely food insecure (p sev ) for each respondent,
with 0 ≤ p sev ≤ 1.

prevalence estimates are based on FIES data
collected in the GWP, with national sample
sizes of about 1 000 in most countries,
confidence inter vals rarely exceed 20 percent
of the measured prevalence (that is,
prevalence rates of about 50 percent have
margins of error of plus or minus 5 percent).
Confidence inter vals are likely to be much
smaller, however, when national prevalence
rates are estimated using larger samples and
for estimates referring to subregional and
regional aggregates of countries. To reduce the
impact of year-to-year sampling variabilit y,
countr y-level estimates are presented as
three-year averages.

The prevalence of food insecurity at severe levels (FI sev) in
the population is computed as the weighted sum
of the probabilit y of being severely food insecure
for all respondents (i) in a sample:
FI sev = ∑p i,sev w i
where w i are post-stratification weights that
indicate the proportion of individuals or
households in the national population
represented by each element in the sample.

Methodology: Nationally representative household
sur veys (MICS, DHS national nutrition sur veys,
etc.) and nutrition sur veillance systems are the
preferred primar y data sources for child
nutrition indicators. For entr y in the database,
they must be nationally representative,
population-based sur veys with a sample size of
at least 400 children and present results based
on W HO standards, or provide access to the raw
data, enabling re-analysis.

STUNTING, WASTING AND OVERWEIGHT
IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE
Definition of stunting: Height (cm) for age (months)
< –2 SD of the WHO Child Growth Standards
median. Stunting is the result of long-term nutritional
deprivation and may affect mental development,
school performance and intellectual capacity.
The percentage of children with low height for age
reflects the cumulative effects of undernutrition
and infections since and even before birth.

A weighted analysis was carried out to account
for the different countr y populations and ensure
that the inf luence in the regional trend analysis
of countries’ sur vey estimates was proportional
to their population. The population weights
were derived from the UN Population Prospects,
revision 2015. For each data point, the
respective under-five population estimate for
the specific sur vey year was obtained. If a
sur vey was performed over an extended period,
for example, November 2013 to April 2014, the
year in which most of the fieldwork was
completed (in this case 2014) was used as the
year from which to choose the respective
population estimate. Weights of countries with
single data points were derived by dividing the
under-five population at the time of the sur vey
by the sum of the countries’ mean population in
the whole region. For countries with multiple
data points, the weights were calculated by
dividing the mean of the countr y’s
under-five population (over the obser ved years)
by the sum of the countries’ mean population in
the whole region.

How stunting is reported: The national prevalence of
stunting is the percentage of children aged
0 –59 months who are below –2 standard
deviation (SD) from the median height for age of
the W HO Child Growth Standards.
Definition of wasting: Weight (kg) for height (cm) < –2
SD of the W HO Child Growth Standards median.
Low weight for height is an indicator of acute
weight loss and ref lects nutritional imbalance,
usually as a consequence of insufficient food
intake and/or infectious diseases.

How wasting is reported: Wasting is the percentage of
children aged 0 –59 months who are below –2 SD
from the median weight-for-height of the W HO
Child Growth Standards.
Definition of childhood overweight: Weight (kg) for height
(cm) > +2 SD of the WHO Child Growth Standards
median. Overweight is an indicator of excessive
weight for height and generally reflects an imbalance
between food intake and energy expenditure.

A linear mixed-effect model was applied for
each region or income group, using the logistic
transformation of prevalence. The final models
were then used to project the trend of
malnutrition in children from 2000 to 2016.
Using the resulting prevalence estimates (after
back-transformation), the total numbers
affected were calculated by multiplying the
prevalence and lower and upper limits of the CI

How childhood overweight is reported: Child overweight is
the percentage of children aged 0 –59 months who
are over +2 SD from the median weight for height
of the W HO Child Growth Standards.

EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING

Challenges and limitations: The recommended
periodicit y of reporting on stunting, overweight
and wasting is ever y three to five years; however,
for some countries data are available less
frequently. While ever y effort has been made to
maximize the comparabilit y of statistics across
countries and over time, countr y data may differ
in terms of data collection methods, population
coverage and estimation methods used. Sur vey
estimates come with levels of uncertaint y due to
both sampling errors and non-sampling errors
(technical measurement errors, recording errors,
etc.). Neither of the two sources of error has been
fully taken into account for deriving estimates at
countr y or regional and global levels.

Definition: Exclusive breastfeeding children
< 6 months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child survival and is the best feeding
for newborns, as breast milk shapes the baby’s
microbiome, strengthens the immune system, and
reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases.
Breastfeeding also benefits mothers by preventing
postpartum haemorrhage and promoting uterine
involution, decreasing the risk of iron-deficiency
anaemia, reducing the risk of various types of
cancer and providing psychological benefits.

How it is reported: Percentage of infants aged
0–5 months who are fed exclusively on breast milk
with no additional food or drink, not even water.

For the prevalence of wasting, as sur veys are
generally carried out during a specific period of
the year, the estimates can be affected by
seasonalit y. Seasonal factors related to wasting
include food availabilit y (e.g. pre-har vest
periods) and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea,
malaria, etc.), while natural disasters and
conf licts can also show real shifts in trends that
would need to be treated differently than a
seasonal variation. Hence, countr y-year estimates
for wasting may not necessarily be comparable
over time. Consequently, only the most recent
estimates are provided.

4. WHO. 2008. Indicators for assessing infant and young
child feeding practices, Part 1: Definitions. Geneva,
Switzerland. (available at www.unicef.org/
nutrition/files/IYCF_updated_indicators_2008_
part_1_definitions.pdf).

population, unless otherwise noted. For 2005
data, where countr y data were unavailable, data
from 2002 to 2008 were used, choosing the
closest year to 2005. For 2016, where countr y
data were unavailable, available data were used
from the most recent year between 2010 and
2015. Exceptionally, the same estimate for China
2008 was used for both the 2005 and 2015
regional averages.

ADULT OBESITY
Definition: BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2 . The body–mass
index (BMI) is the ratio of weight to height
commonly used to classif y the nutritional
status of adults. It is calculated as the body
weight in kilograms divided by the square of
the body height in metres (kg/m 2). Obesit y
includes individuals with a BMI equal to or
higher than 30 kg/m 2 .

Challenges and limitations: While a high proportion
of countries collect data for exclusive
breastfeeding, data are lacking in high-income
countries in particular. The recommended
periodicit y of reporting on exclusive
breastfeeding is ever y three to five years.
However, for some countries, data are reported
less frequently, meaning changes in feeding
patterns are often not detected for several
years after the change occurs.

How it is reported: Percentage of the population over
18 years of age with BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2
standardized by age and weighted by sex.
Data source: W HO/NCD-RisC and W HO Global
Health Obser vator y Data Repositor y.
Available at: http://apps.who.int/gho/data/
node.main.A900A?lang=en.
(1 698 population-based studies with more
than 19.2 million participants aged 18 years or
older, measured in 186 countries).

Regional and global averages may be
affected depending on which countries had
data available for the periods considered in
this report.
Using the previous day’s feeding as a basis
may cause the proportion of exclusively
breastfed infants to be overestimated, as some
given other liquids irreg ularly may not have
received these the day before the sur vey.

Methodology: A Bayesian hierarchical model was
applied to selected population-based studies
that had measured height and weight in adults
aged 18 years and older, to estimate trends
from 1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the
prevalence of BMI categories (underweight,
overweight and obesit y). The model
incorporated non-linear time trends and age
patterns; national versus subnational and
communit y representativeness; and whether
data covered both rural and urban areas versus
only one of them. The model also included
covariates that help predict BMI, including
national income, proportion of the population
living in urban areas, mean number of years of
education, and summar y measures of
availabilit y of different food t y pes for
human consumption.

Challenges and limitations: Despite a high proportion
of countries having nationally representative
sur vey data available for anaemia, there is still
a lack of reporting on this indicator, especially
in high-income countries. As a result, estimates
may not capture the full variation across
countries and regions, tending to shrink
towards global means when data are sparse.

ANAEMIA IN WOMEN OF
REPRODUCTIVE AGE
Definition: [Haemoglobin] < 110 g/litre for pregnant
women; [Haemoglobin] < 120 g/litre for
non-pregnant women. Anaemia is defined as a
haemoglobin concentration below a specified
cut-off point, which can change according to the
age, sex, physiological status, smoking habits and
altitude at which the population being
assessed lives.

DEFINITIONS AND LISTS
OF COUNTRY GROUPS

In 2017, there are 19 countries that meet the
above criteria of protracted crisis (see Table A2.1,
column A, below). Although not part of the
definition or criteria for selection, out of the
19 countries with a protracted crisis, all have
experienced some form of conf lict of varied t y pe,
duration and intensit y between 1996 and 2015
(see Table A2.2 below). However, there are
13 countries that have experienced conf lict
resulting in a high level of battle deaths and that
therefore meet both the criteria of protracted
crisis and countries affected by conf lict (see
definition and criteria in B below), these are
referred to as countries with a protracted crisis
affected by conf lict (see Table A2.2, column C,
below).

A. Countries with a protracted crisis
SOFI 2010 defines protracted crisis situations as
“characterized by recurrent natural disasters and/
or conf lict, longevit y of food crises, breakdown of
livelihoods and insufficient institutional capacit y
to react to the crises.” There are three criteria
used to define a countr y with a protracted crisis:
(i) longevit y of the crisis; (ii) humanitarian aid
f low to the countr y; and (iii) the countr y’s
economic and food securit y status.
Specifically, the list of countries identified in
situations of protracted crisis includes those that
meet the following three criteria:

B. Countries affected by conflict

1. The countr y is among the Low-Income FoodDeficit Countries (LIFDC), as defined by FAO
in 2015.
2. The countr y has faced a shock – either natural
or human-induced – for four consecutive years
between 2013 and 2016, or for eight out of ten
years between 2007 and 2016, and is reported
in the list of countries requiring external
assistance for food (source: FAO Global
Information and Early Warning System
(GIEWS).
3. The countr y received more than ten percent of
total ODA in the form of humanitarian
assistance between 2006 and 2014 (source:
Development Initiatives: http://devinit.org).

Defined as low- and middle-income countries
and territories affected by conf lict for at least one
sub-period of five consecutive years and having
suffered 500 or more battle deaths during that
sub-period. The timeframe spans from 1996 to
2015, with four periods of five years: 1996 –2000;
2001–2005; 2006 –2010; 2011–2015. Table A2.3 below
presents the number of sub-periods where these
criteria are met, by countr y. The Uppsala Conf lict
Data Program (UCDP) dataset is used to establish
battle deaths and countr y lists (see http://ucdp.
uu.se/). There are 45 low- and middle-income
countries and one territor y (total 46) that meet
these criteria. For a complete list, see Table A2.1,
column B, below.

C. Countries in fragile situations

countries (for which the CPIA scores are not
publicly disclosed) unless there is the presence of
a peacekeeping or political/peacebuilding
mission, in which case the countr y will be
included on the harmonized list with the
exclusion of its CPIA score. In 2017, the
Harmonized List of Fragile Situations registers
34 countries and 1 territor y. For a list of these
countries see http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/
en/154851467143896227/F Y17HLFSFinal-6272016.pdf. The 20 countries that are on
both the Harmonized List of Fragile Situations
and that meet the conf lict-affected criteria as
defined in B above are referred to as countries in
fragile situations affected by conf lict. For a list of
these countries, see Table A2.1, column D, above.

This report uses the World Bank Group’s 2017
Harmonized List of Fragile Situations, unless
specified that another definition of the state of
fragilit y is being used. The World Bank
methodolog y on “Fragile situations” includes
countries or territories that meet three criteria:
(i) a harmonized CPIA – i.e. Countr y Policy and
Institutional Assessment – rating of 3.2 or less;
and/or (ii) the presence of a UN and/or regional
peacekeeping or political/peacebuilding mission
during the last three years; and (iii) the list
includes only IDA eligible countries and
non-member or inactive territories/countries
without CPIA data. The list excludes IBRD

GLOSSARY

occurring along distribution chains from
farmgate (or port of import) up to retail level.

Anthropometry. Use of human body measurements to
obtain information about nutritional status.

Food insecurity. A situation that exists when people lack
secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and
nutritious food for normal growth and
development and an active and healthy life. It
may be caused by unavailabilit y of food,
insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate
distribution or inadequate use of food at the
household level. Food insecurit y, poor conditions
of health and sanitation and inappropriate care
and feeding practices are the major causes of
poor nutritional status. Food insecurit y may be
chronic, seasonal or transitor y.

Body mass index (BMI). The ratio of weight for height,
measured as the weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in metres.

Conflict. Conf lict as used in this report is defined as
struggles between interdependent groups that
have either actual or perceived incompatibilities
with respect to needs, values, goals, resources or
intentions. This definition includes (but is
broader than) armed conf lict – that is organized
collective violent confrontations between at least
two groups, either state or non-state actors. This
report focuses on conf licts that threaten or entail
violence or destruction, including where fragilit y
raises the risk of damaging conf licts and where
protracted crises persist.

Food security. A situation that exists when all people,
at all times, have physical, social and economic
access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that
meets their dietar y needs and food preferences
for an active and healthy life. Based on this
definition, four food securit y dimensions can be
identified: food availabilit y, economic and
physical access to food, food utilization and
stabilit y over time.

Conflict sensitivity. Conflict sensitivity means to study
the profile, causes, actors and dynamics of conflict
and the interaction between these and the proposed
intervention. In the context of sustaining peace, this
means maximizing positive impacts toward peace
while minimizing negative impacts, including
potentially creating so-called future hazards.

Fragility. Fragilit y is defined as the combination of
exposure to risk and insufficient coping
capacities of the state, system and/or
communities to manage, absorb or mitigate
those risks. The new OECD fragilit y framework
is built on five dimensions of fragilit y –
economic, environmental, political, societal, and
securit y – and measures each through the
accumulation and combination of risks and
capacit y. See OECD. 2016. States of Fragility
2016: Understanding Violence. Paris. Available at
w w w.oecd.org/dac/states-of-fragilit y-20169789264267213-en.htm

Dietary energy intake. The energ y content of food
consumed.

Dietary energy supply (DES). Food available for human
consumption, expressed in kilocalories per
person per day (kcal/person/day). At countr y
level, it is calculated as the food remaining for
human use after deduction of all non-food
utilizations (i.e. food = production + imports +
stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use −
animal feed – seed – wastage − additions to
stock). Wastage includes loss of usable products

Hunger. In this report, the term hunger is
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.
| 107 |

ANNEX 3

Kilocalorie (kcal). A unit of measurement of energ y.
One kilocalorie equals 1 000 calories. In the
International System of Units (SI), the universal
unit of energ y is the joule ( J). One kilocalorie =
4.184 kilojoules (kJ).

In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of more
than 25 but less than 30, and obesit y as a BMI of
30 or more. In children under five years of age,
overweight is defined weight-for-height greater
than 2 standard deviations above the W HO Child
Growth Standards median, and obesit y as
weight-for-height greater than 3 standard
deviations above the W HO Child Growth
Standards median.

Macronutrients. Here refers to the proteins,
carbohydrates and fats available to be used for
energ y; measured in grams.
Malnutrition. An abnormal physiological condition

Stunting. Low height for age, ref lecting a past
episode or episodes of sustained undernutrition.
In children under five years of age, stunting is
defined height-for-age less than –2 standard
deviations below the W HO Child Growth
Standards median.

caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive
consumption of macronutrients and/or
micronutrients. Malnutrition includes
undernutrition and overnutrition as well as
micronutrient deficiencies.

Micronutrients. Vitamins, minerals and other
substances that are required by the body in small
amounts; measured in milligrams or micrograms.

Undernourishment. A state, lasting for at least one
year, of inabilit y to acquire enough food, defined
as a level of food intake insufficient to meet
dietar y energ y requirements. For the purposes of
this report, hunger was defined as being
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.

Nutrition security. A situation that exists when secure
access to an appropriately nutritious diet is
coupled with a sanitar y environment, adequate
health ser vices and care, in order to ensure a
healthy and active life for all household members.
Nutrition securit y differs from food securit y in
that it also considers the aspects of adequate
caring practices, health and hygiene in addition
to dietar y adequacy.

Undernutrition. The outcome of poor nutritional
intake in terms of quantity and/or quality and/or
poor absorption and/or poor biological use of
nutrients consumed as a result of repeated disease.
It includes being underweight for one’s age, too
short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for
one’s height (wasted) and deficient in vitamins
and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition).

Nutrition-sensitive intervention. Inter ventions designed
to address the underlying determinants of
nutrition (which include household food security,
care for mothers and children and primary healthcare services and sanitation) but not necessarily
having nutrition as the predominant goal.

Underweight. In adults, underweight is defined as a
BMI of less than 18.5, ref lecting a current
condition resulting from inadequate food intake,
past episodes of undernutrition or poor health
conditions. In children under five years of age,
underweight is defined as weight-for-age less
than –2 standard deviations below the W HO
Child Growth Standards median, and is thus a
manifestation of low height for age and/or low
weight for height.

Nutritional status. The physiological state of an
individual that results from the relationship
between nutrient intake and requirements and
from the body’s abilit y to digest, absorb and use
these nutrients.
Overnutrition. A result of excessive food intake
relative to dietar y nutrient requirements.

Wasting. Low weight for height, generally the result
of weight loss associated with a recent period of
inadequate caloric intake and/or disease. In
children under five years of age, wasting is
defined as weight-for-height less than –2
standard deviations below the W HO Child
Growth Standards median.

Overweight and obesity. Body weight that is above
normal for height as a result of an excessive
accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation
of expending fewer calories than are consumed.

times during the year, food insecurity as detected by the FIES
questions. This is consistent with the definition according to which
food security exists when “all people at all times have […] access
to food […]” and includes cases where food insecurity might have
been of a transitory nature. See Glossary, p. 107.

NOTES

17 While there is a large body of academic literature exploring
the food security–nutrition nexus, most of the analyses are based
on ad hoc, small-sample surveys. There is a need for more
large-scale population surveys that integrate household- or
individual-level food security and nutrition indicators.

22 The World Bank Group estimates that, by 2030, the share of
the poor in the global population living in fragile and conflictaffected situations will be 46 percent, while OECD’s estimate is
60 percent. Estimates are different because both sources use different
definitions of fragility and violence. For the World Bank estimates see,

19 See Food Security Information Network (FSIN). 2017. Global
Report on Food Crises 2017 (available at www.fao.
org/3/a-br323e.pdf). The reported food insecurity crisis-level
population estimates are derived from a selection of countries
and/or population groups that faced a high severity and
magnitude of acute food insecurity in the period from January to
December 2016. The key information source is the Integrated
Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)/Cadre Harmonisé (CH),
which considers: countries with any segment of the population in
IPC/CH Phase 4 Emergency or Phase 5 Catastrophe; countries
with at least 1 million people in IPC/CH Phase 3 Crisis; and
countries for which an Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
Humanitarian System-Wide Emergency Response was declared.
These numbers represent emergency-level food insecurity that
requires immediate humanitarian action. They differ from the
prevalence of undernourishment estimates presented in previous
sections, which are more globally comprehensive and measure
chronic food deprivation.

25 Conflict sensitivity refers to engagements based on
understanding of the contexts in which it works (including the
systematic study of the profile, causes, actors and dynamics of
conflict) and the interaction between its interventions and each
context. In the context of sustaining peace, it refers to maximizing
positive impacts towards peace while minimizing negative
impacts (in line with best practice and minimum standards),
including the potential for creating “future hazards”. Conflict
sensitivity involves both gaining a sound understanding of the
two-way interaction between activities and context, and acting
on this analysis. A conflict-sensitive approach is necessary in all
contexts (even in situations where underlying tensions have not
resulted in violence).

The Uppsala Conflict Data Program definitions of the three types of
conflict are: state-based conflict is the use of armed force by the
government of a state, where a state is either an internationally
recognized sovereign government controlling a specified territory, or
an internationally unrecognized government controlling a specified
territory whose sovereignty is not disputed by another internationally
recognized sovereign government previously controlling the same
territory; non-state conflict occurs where there is use of armed force
between two organized armed groups, neither of which is the
government of a state, which results in at least 25 battle-related deaths
in a year; one-sided violence is characterized by the use of armed
force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group
against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year.

to unweighted estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment

47 There is no existing study that convincingly disentangles or
quantifies such impacts of conflict, in part owing to the complexity
and limitations of data that would be required. This would require
detailed household-level data on crop production and assets, as
these are affected by conflict (including the timing and extent of
theft); information about the extent and duration of displacement
(including changes in food security, nutrition and exposure to
disease or time spent in resettlement camps); detailed conflict
event data at the household and village level to measure war
exposure; and individual food consumption data and child
anthropometrics at multiple points in time to capture changes in
short- and long-term indicators. The lack of data in conflictaffected situations is a major challenge.

59 Agriculture losses for all developing countries due to
conflict between 1970 and 1997 averaged US$4.3 billion
annually, far exceeding the value of development assistance
to those countries.

METHODOLOGY
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017 has
been prepared by the FAO Agriculture Development Economics
Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the
Economic and Social Development Department, and a team of
technical experts from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO.
Production of the report was guided by a senior advisory
team, consisting of designated senior managers of the five
UN publishing partners. Led by FAO, this team decided
on the outline of the report and defined its thematic focus.
It further gave oversight to the technical writing team comprised
of experts from each of the five co-publishing agencies.
The technical writing team involved external experts in
preparing background papers to complement the research and
data analysis undertaken by the members of the writing team.
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs,
including an annotated outline, first draft and final draft of
the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by
the senior advisory team at each step in the preparation
process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review
by senior management and technical experts from different
divisions and departments within each of the five UN agencies,
both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the
report then underwent executive review and clearance by the
heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

NOTES FOR ANNEX 1

THE STATE OF
FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
IN
THE
WORLD
BUILDING RESILIENCE FOR PEACE
AND FOOD SECURITY

The international community is committed to ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition worldwide
by 2030. While much progress has been made, conflict and human-induced and natural disasters
are causing setbacks. This year’s The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World warns that
the long-term declining trend in undernourishment seems to have come to a halt and may have
reversed, largely on account of the above-mentioned factors. Meanwhile, though progress continues
to be made in reducing child malnutrition, rising overweight and obesity are a concern in most parts
of the world.
These and other findings are detailed in the 2017 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition
in the World (formerly, The State of Food Insecurity in the World). For the first time, this year’s report
is published by an expanded partnership, with UNICEF and WHO now joining FAO, IFAD and WFP.
The report also marks a new era in the monitoring of food security and nutrition in the context of the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition. To assess
progress made towards the goal of ending hunger, the report uses both the traditional measure of
the prevalence of undernourishment and a new indicator, the prevalence of severe food insecurity,
based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale. The report further looks at various forms of
malnutrition, including trends and situations for child stunting, wasting and overweight and for adult
obesity, breastfeeding and anaemia in women. The thematic part of the report sheds light on how
the increasing incidence of conflict in the world is affecting food security and nutrition. It also
explores how, by improving food security and nutrition and by making rural livelihoods more
resilient, it is possible to help prevent conflicts and sustain peace.
