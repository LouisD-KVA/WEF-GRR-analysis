Foreword
The annual “WMO Statement on the Status
of the Global Climate” series has continued
to gain in popularity since its initiation in 1993
by the World Meteorological Organization,
through its Commission for Climatology, and
in cooperation with its 189 Members. The
series stands today as an internationally recognized authoritative source of information for
the scientific community, the media and the
public at large. The present WMO Statement
on the Status of the Global Climate in 2011 is
the latest addition to this successful series.
Although global mean surface temperatures
in 2011 did not reach the record-setting levels
of 2010, they were nevertheless the highest
observed in a La Niña year. A number of climate
extremes, in particular precipitation extremes,
were recorded around the world. Many of the
extremes associated with one of the strongest La Niña events of the past 60 years had
major impacts worldwide. Significant flooding was recorded in many places, the most
severe in South-East Asia, which caused about
1 000 deaths, while a major drought in East
Africa led to a humanitarian disaster. Arctic
sea ice continued its declining trend with an
extent falling to near-record-low levels. Despite
below-average global tropical cyclone activity, the United States of America experienced
one of its most destructive tornado seasons
on record.

The year 2011 will be remembered as the year
in which the Sixteenth World Meteorological
Congress focused on the launching of the
implementation of the Global Framework for
Climate Services. This initiative opens a new
era in helping nations to access improved
climate data and services, particularly the
most climate-vulnerable countries.
I wish to express the appreciation of WMO to
all the Centres and the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services of its 189 Members
that collaborated with WMO and contributed
to this key publication. As with the previous
editions, I would like to underscore the
importance of your feedback. WMO looks
forward to your comments on the WMO
Statement on the Status of the Global Climate
in 2011 and to your welcome suggestions for
its further improvement.

Temperatures averaged over the globe in 2011
were not as warm as the record-setting values
seen in 2010 but were nevertheless well above
the long-term average. Globally averaged
temperatures in 2011 were estimated to be
0.40°C ± 0.09°C above the 1961–1990 annual
average of 14°C. This makes 2011 nominally
the eleventh warmest year on record in records
dating back to 1880. The 2011 nominal value of
+0.40°C1 is also the warmest ever to occur in
The analysis is based on three independent datasets, maintained by the Hadley Centre
of the Meteorological Office, UK, and the Climatic
Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (HadCRU) in the United Kingdom, the National Climatic
Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCDC–NOAA) in the United
States, and the Goddard Institute of Space Studies
(GISS) operated by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in the United States.
The NCDC and GISS datasets (and hence the combined dataset) extend back to 1880 and the HadCRU
dataset extends back to 1850.

The 2002–2011 ten-year average of 0.46°C
above the 1961–1990 mean matched 2001–2010
as the world’s warmest ten-year period on
record. This was 0.21°C warmer than the warmest ten-year period of the twentieth century,
1991–2000. In turn, 1991–2000 was clearly
warmer than previous decades, consistent
with a long-term warming trend.

Major large-scale influences on the global
climate in 2011
The year began with a strong La Niña event
established in the Pacific. This event, which
began in the second half of 2010, was near peak
intensity at the start of the year with sea surface temperatures widely 1.5°C to 2°C below
average in the central and eastern equatorial
Pacific (the Niño 3.4 index was −1.64°C in
January). The 2010–2011 La Niña event ranked
as one of the strongest of the past 60 years.
While the sea surface temperature anomalies
at the event’s peak (monthly Niño 3.4 index
of −1.68°C in October) were slightly weaker
than those at the peak of the 2007–2008 event
(−1.89°C), atmospheric indicators of the event
were at record or near-record levels. Positive
anomalies in early 2011 of outgoing long-wave
radiation, which is an indicator of cloudiness,
near 180° longitude and of trade winds in the
east-central Pacific were both at the highest levels since consistent records of those
indicators began in the 1970s. The six-month
Southern Oscillation Index of +22 for the period
November 2010–April 2011 was the highest
such value since 1917.

The year 2011 was a year of climate extremes
around the world. Precipitation extremes,
many of them associated with one of the
strongest La Niña events of the past 60 years,
had major impacts on the world. Significant
flooding occurred in many places throughout
the world, while major droughts affected parts
of East Africa and North America. Global
mean temperatures in 2011 did not reach the
record-setting levels of 2010, but were still the
highest observed in a La Niña year, and Arctic
sea-ice extent fell to near-record-low levels.
Global tropical cyclone activity was below
average, but the United States had one of its
most destructive tornado seasons on record.

The La Niña event weakened during the early
months of 2011, with sea surface temperatures returning to the neutral range by May. It
redeveloped during the northern hemisphere
autumn, although with much less strength than
the previous year, with Niño 3.4 near −1°C in
November and December. The atmospheric
response, however, was again strong, with the
monthly Southern Oscillation Index reaching
+23 in December and a mean of +14 for the
September–December period.

mid-spring. They were also strongly positive towards the end of the year, especially
in December. The December value of the
North Atlantic Oscillation (+2.25) was the
highest on record for December, while the
Arctic Oscillation ranked second behind
December 2006 – both in marked contrast
to the near-record negative values observed
in December 2010. The Antarctic Oscillation,
also known as the Southern Annular Mode,
also behaved somewhat differently to 2010,
with strongly negative values in the July–
September period, although by the end of the
year it was strongly positive. The Indian Ocean
Dipole index, after being strongly negative in
the second half of 2010, was weakly positive
for most of 2011, with slightly above-average
temperatures in both the west and east of the
equatorial Indian Ocean.

Regional temperatures in 2011
Temperatures were above the 1961–1990 average in the vast majority of the world’s land
areas in 2011. While none of the 23 subregions
analysed had their warmest year on record in
2011, compared with the six that did so in 2010,
22 experienced above-normal2 temperatures,
the only exception being northern Australia.

As was the case in 2010, the largest departures
of temperatures from normal were in the
high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
In this brochure, “normal” refers to the
WMO standard climatological normal for the period
1961–1990. Where a different averaging period is
used or the averaging period is unclear, the term
“average” is used.

Mean annual temperatures were as much as
5°C above normal in parts of the Arctic coast
of the Russian Federation and were 3°C or
more above normal over substantial areas in
the north of both the Russian Federation and
Canada, although most of northern Canada
had been even warmer in 2010. Temperatures
were at least 1°C above normal over most land
areas north of 55°N in both North America
and Eurasia, as well as over large parts of
central-western and south-western Europe, the
southern United States and northern Mexico,
the Sahara Desert and Arabian Peninsula,
parts of southern Asia, and the south-western
corner of Australia.
Only limited land areas experienced belownormal temperatures in 2011. These included
most of the northern half of Australia, parts
of eastern China and the Indochina Peninsula,
Kazakhstan and adjacent border regions of
the Russian Federation, the Caucasus region,
and the far west of the United States. Ocean
temperatures were below normal over large
parts of the central and eastern Pacific as a
result of the year’s La Niña events, but were
well above normal in many subtropical oceans,
especially the Indian Ocean, as well as at
higher latitudes of the North Atlantic and
North-West Pacific. Sea surface temperatures
off the west coast of Western Australia were
at record levels.
Europe and northern and central Asia
In Europe and northern Asia, 2011 was a generally warm year. It was the fourth-warmest year
on record for the northern European region and
ninth-warmest for the Mediterranean region.
Despite a relatively mild summer with near-average temperatures, France, Spain, Switzerland,
Brussels and Luxembourg all reported their
warmest years on record, while the United
Kingdom had its second-warmest year on
record despite its coolest summer since 1993.
In parts of Ireland it was the coolest summer
since 1962. Norway also had its equal- warmest year on record. The year had a warm start
and finish. Following generally above-average
temperatures in January and February, except
in north-eastern Europe where the snow depth
at St Petersburg, Russian Federation, reached a
record level in early February, spring was especially warm in western and northern Europe,
with numerous countries setting seasonal and
monthly records. September, November and
6

December were also warmer than average,
with an especially mild finish to the year in the
Nordic countries and north-eastern Europe.
The Russian Federation had its third-warmest
year on record, with Siberia experiencing its
warmest year, while the +5°C annual anomalies
reported on the Arctic coast east of Novaya
Zemlya were the largest ever recorded in the
country. While summer conditions in western
areas were not as extreme as in 2010, heat was
more consistent across the country, leading to
the second-hottest summer on record for the
Russian Federation as a whole. The only region
to experience below-normal temperatures
was an area in the south-central part of the
country, and adjacent areas of Kazakhstan.
Elsewhere in Asia, temperatures were closer
to normal. The Eastern and Central Asia subregions both had their coolest year since 1996,
although both still had above-normal regional
temperatures. In parts of Eastern Asia, January
was particularly cold – the coldest in Japan,
China and the Republic of Korea since 1986,
1977 and 1981, respectively.
South Asia and the Pacific
There were significant areas of below-normal
temperatures in eastern China, especially
the south-east, and the Indochina Peninsula.
Temperatures were above normal, although
mostly cooler than those of 2010, over southern
Asia as far east as the Indian subcontinent.
Australia had its coolest year since 2000, with
temperatures generally below normal in the
north and above normal in the south. It was
the coolest year on record in some parts
of interior northern Australia where mean
annual temperatures were up to 1.5°C below
normal, whereas the south-west corner was
especially warm with many locations having
their warmest year on record. New Zealand
temperatures were slightly above normal.
The Americas
North America was generally warmer than
normal in 2011. Temperatures in Canada fell
short of their record-breaking levels of 2010,
but were still well above normal, ranking ninth
warmest on record (1.4°C above normal). All
seasons were warmer than normal except
spring, with autumn (2.2°C above normal) ranking as the third-warmest and summer (1.2°C
above normal) fourth-warmest on record. All

parts of the country were warmer than normal
in 2011 except for the south-west – Alberta,
Saskatchewan and southern British Columbia
– where temperatures were close to normal.
In the continental United States temperatures
were generally above normal in the eastern
two thirds of the country and near normal in
the western third; locally, they were below
normal in the north-west. For the country as
a whole, 2011 ranked as the twenty-second
warmest year on record, 0.6°C above the
average for the twentieth century. It was the
warmest year on record for Delaware and
ranked in the top ten for all other north-eastern
states, while Texas had its second-hottest
year on record. Summer was especially hot,
ranking as the second hottest on record after
1936 (1.3°C above average), with records set in
Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico.
Spring was particularly cool in the northwestern states, as well as in adjacent parts of
western Canada. Annual mean temperatures
in Alaska were close to average.
It was a very warm year in the region comprising Central America, Mexico and southern
Texas. The northern half of Mexico was
severely affected by drought. For this region
as a whole, it was the third-warmest year on
record (1.01°C above normal), only missing a
record because of a relatively cool November
and December.
South American temperatures were slightly
above normal, with annual anomalies of
+0.27°C in the south and +0.29°C in the north.
In Argentina it was the eleventh warmest year
on record (0.34°C above normal), with a cold
winter but temperatures well above normal
from September onwards. Northern South
America had above-average temperatures
through most of the year, although in eastern
Brazil temperatures were near average in the
September–November period.
Africa and the Arabian Peninsula region
It was another very warm year for most parts
of Africa, although less so than in 2010, which
was clearly the continent’s hottest year on
record. Only southern Africa missed out to
some extent, largely as a result of the wet
2010–2011 rainy season in the region; it was
the region’s coolest year since 2000, although
still 0.55°C above normal.

The Saharan/Arabian Peninsula region had its
third-warmest year on record (1.27°C above
normal), the three warmest years being the
last three. North-western Africa was especially
warm throughout 2011, particularly in the early
months of the year; north-eastern Africa had a
warm second half of the year but near-average
temperatures in winter and spring. It was also a
warm year in West Africa (0.75°C above normal,
fifth-warmest) and East Africa (1.17°C above
normal, sixth-warmest); in the case of East
Africa the ten warmest individual years have
been the last ten, clearly making 2002–2011 the
region’s warmest ten years on record.

Major heatwaves and extreme high
temperatures
There were no heatwaves in 2011 on the
scale of that which occurred in the Russian
Federation and eastern Europe in 2010, but
significant heat still occurred in many areas.
In the United States, Oklahoma’s summer
(June–August) mean temperature of 30.5°C,
which was 4.0°C above the long-term average, was the highest ever recorded for any
American state, with Texas also breaking
the previous record. The heat was marked
by its consistency rather than its extreme
intensity; relatively few all-time record highs
were broken, but many records were set for
the greatest number of days of 37.8°C (100°F)
or above. Dallas had 40 consecutive days
of 37.8°C or above in July and August, narrowly missing the record of 42 days set in
1980. At times the extreme heat spread to the
eastern United States, with Newark (42.2°C)
and Washington–Dulles Airport (40.6°C) both
setting all-time records on 22 July.
Extreme heat affected the Caucasus region
and parts of the Middle East in late July. A
national record of 43.7°C was set at Meghri,
Armenia, on 31 July, while several station
records were set in Azerbaijan. There were
numerous temperatures above 50°C in the
Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and Kuwait in
late July and early August, including 53.3°C
at Mitribah, Kuwait, on 3 August and 52.6°C at
Omidieh, Islamic Republic of Iran, on 27 July.
While most of western and central Europe
had a relatively cool summer, abnormal heat
7

occurred in both the spring and autumn.
Numerous sites in the region set records in
April for the earliest dates on which temperatures over 25°C or 30°C had occurred, while a
late-season heatwave saw national records set
for October in the United Kingdom, Denmark
and Slovakia. Two notable temperatures in
Spain were 37.4°C at Murcia on 9 April and
36.5°C at Jerez de la Frontera on 12 October,
respectively the highest temperatures ever
recorded in mainland Spain so early and so
late in the year.
Two notable southern hemisphere observations occurred in February. Timaru reached
41.3°C on 6 February, the highest temperature
in New Zealand since 1973, and Puerto Deseado
(47.73°S) recorded 40.1°C on 11 February, the
furthest south that a temperature of 40°C has
ever occurred in Argentina. Shortly afterwards,
Mumbai, India, had its hottest day on record
with 41.6°C on 16 March. At the end of the year,
the South Pole had its highest temperature
on record, reaching −12.3°C on 25 December.

Snow and extreme cold
There were three exceptional snow events in
the southern hemisphere during the winter.
In mid-August, New Zealand had its most
significant low-level snowfalls since 1976.
Snow was lying to sea level over large parts
of the South Island. Snow also covered many
suburbs of Wellington, although not in the city
centre itself, while flurries were observed in
Auckland. Auckland Airport and Rotorua both
had their coldest day on record on 15 August,
with a daily maximum temperature of 8.1°C and
5.7°C, respectively. The event was prolonged
over several days and caused major disruptions to transport and deliveries. Unusually
heavy snowfalls also occurred in eastern South
Africa on 25–26 July, and in elevated parts
of the Atacama region in Chile in early July.
Abnormally cold weather affected the southern United States and northern Mexico on a
number of occasions early in the year. The
most significant events were in early February.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, recorded a temperature of −18°C on 4 February, the coldest in
the city since at least 1950, and Nowata set
a state record for Oklahoma with −35°C on
10 February. Many parts of the northern United
8

States received above-average seasonal snowfall in the 2010/2011 winter, but the year’s most
notable snow was on 29–30 October when
an exceptional early-season event produced
between 30 and 80 cm of snow in many parts
of the north-east from West Virginia to New
England. New York City received a total of
7 cm on 29 October, the city’s heaviest daily
October snowfall on record. The heavy wet
snow, at a time of year when trees were still in
full leaf, caused extensive vegetation damage
and major power outages across the region;
22 deaths also were attributed to the storm.
The early weeks of the year were cold in East
Asia and there were significant snowfalls in
some locations. Some of the heaviest falls
occurred in the east of the Republic of Korea,
where Samcheok received 100 cm between 11
and 14 February. Snow also badly disrupted
transport in January in parts of southern China.

Precipitation
Main features
According to the United States National
Climatic Data Center, globally averaged land
surface precipitation was the second-highest
on record in 2011, 46 mm above the 1961–1990
average, ranking only behind 2010 (52 mm
above normal), but with marked contrasts
between wet and dry regions. Major areas
that experienced substantially above-normal
rainfall included most of Australia, large
parts of South-East Asia and the islands of
the westernmost parts of the Pacific (Japan,
the Philippines and Indonesia), southern
Africa, substantial areas of Brazil, Colombia
and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
Pakistan and western India, the north-central
and north-eastern United States, and the
north-western fringe of Europe. Most of these
regions experienced significant flooding at
some point during the year (see section on
flooding below). Major areas of below-normal
rainfall included the southern United States,
especially Texas, and northern Mexico, large
parts of Europe away from the far northwest, and much of southern China. Despite
the extreme drought there for most of the
year (see section on major droughts below),
heavy rains late in the year resulted in East
Africa having annual totals for 2011 that were
mostly close to average.

Europe and the United States
Both Europe and the United States had marked
geographical contrasts in precipitation. In the
United States, it was much wetter than average
over most north-central and north-eastern
parts of the country, and 2011 was the wettest year on record for seven states and for
numerous major cities, including Cincinnati,
Detroit, Philadelphia and Newark. By contrast,
it was very dry over most of the south. The
dry conditions were at their most extreme in
Texas, which had its second driest year on

record behind 1917, with statewide rainfall
46 per cent below average. Northern Mexico
was also very dry, with the states of Durango
and Aguascalientes experiencing their driest
years of the post-1941 period and several
other states ranking in the driest three years.

national records were set in France and the
Netherlands. After wetter conditions during
the summer, especially in the north, it became
very dry again during autumn. November
was exceptionally dry across central Europe;
many stations had no precipitation for the
month, and Germany, Austria, Slovakia and
Hungary all had their driest calendar month
on record, as did the Prague Observatory
(with more than 200 years of data). The dry
conditions broke down in December with
widespread above-average precipitation
in western and central Europe. The most
extreme dry anomalies for the year were
centred in two regions. It was the driest year
on record in parts of western France and
the English Midlands, and the driest year
since 1921 in many other parts of western
Europe. Records were also set in a large part
of central and south-eastern Europe, including
Slovakia, where Malé Kosihy with 262 mm
had the driest year ever at a Slovakian station,
Hungary, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia.
Some stations in Croatia and Montenegro
received less than half their average annual
precipitation. The contrast with 2010 was
striking in the latter region, where Hungary
followed its wettest year on record in 2010
10

In contrast to most of the continent, it was a
very wet year on the north-western fringe of
Europe. The contrast was especially striking
in the United Kingdom, where Scotland had
its wettest year on record, only a few hundred
kilometres from where record low annual rainfalls were being set in central England. It was
also the wettest year on record for Norway,
Tórshavn (Faroes), and for parts of northern
and southern Sweden. During summer the
wet conditions extended southwards; the
Netherlands had its wettest summer on record,
Denmark its second-wettest, and record summer rainfalls also occurred at numerous places
in the northern half of Germany. There were
also localized but extremely heavy rains in late
October and November at various locations
around the Mediterranean (see section on
flooding below).
South Asia and the Pacific
It was a very wet year over much of SouthEast Asia, contributing to disastrous flooding
in several countries in the region, especially
Thailand and Cambodia (see section on flooding below). Thailand had its wettest year
on record with nationally averaged rainfall
24 per cent above normal. Most of Australia
was also very wet, with especially heavy
rains in the first three months of the year
associated with the strong La Niña event.
It was the country’s second wettest year on
record (52 per cent above normal) and the
wettest year on record for the state of Western
Australia, while 2010–2011 was Australia’s
wettest two-year period on record. Further
west, the picture for rainfall in South Asia
was mixed, with monsoon rainfall well above
average in Pakistan and western India, but
well below average in north-east India and
Bangladesh. Monsoon season rainfall was
the fifth-highest on record (72 per cent above
average) for Pakistan but near average (1 per
cent below average) for India.
Conditions were drier than average in 2011 over
large parts of southern China. Severe drought

late 2010 continued into the early months of
2011. It was especially dry in the lower Yangtze
basin, where the January–May rainfall was
202 mm, 53 per cent below normal and well
below the previous record of 320 mm. From
June onwards the dry conditions in this region
were replaced by above-average rainfall, with
some flooding in places, but further south in
China rainfall during the summer monsoon
season was well below average. Hong Kong,
China had its driest year since 1963 with an
annual total of 1 477 mm, 38 per cent below
average.
South America and Africa
Rainfall was well above normal for the second
successive year in the north-west of South
America, with parts of Colombia receiving
more than double their normal annual rainfall, and much of the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela also much wetter than average.
Many parts of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon
basin, were also wetter than average, although
not exceptionally so. Further south, it was a
dry second half of the year in the northern half
of Argentina with August–December rainfall
widely 20 to 40 per cent below average, but
no significant records were broken.

The 2010/2011 rainy season was wetter than
average over many parts of southern Africa,
especially the western half. Rainfall from
January to March was two to four times the
average over many parts of a region encompassing Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia,
Angola and northern South Africa, and flooding occurred on several occasions. Rainfall for
the 12 months from July 2010 to June 2011
was more than double the average over northwestern parts of South Africa. In the Sahel,
totals during the rainy season were generally
near or slightly below average, while in East
Africa, extremely dry conditions that prevailed
in places up until September (see section
on major droughts below) were replaced by
very wet conditions in the last three months
of the year.

Major droughts
A humanitarian disaster in East Africa
Severe drought developed in parts of East
Africa in late 2010 and continued through
most of 2011. The most severely affected
area encompassed the semi-arid regions
of eastern and northern Kenya, western

Somalia and some southern border areas
of Ethiopia.
In this region, rainfall was well below average for two successive rainy seasons, the
“short rains” of October–December 2010
and the “long rains” of March–May 2011. In
eastern and northern Kenya, 2010–2011 was
rated alongside 1983–1984 and 1999–2000
as the three most significant droughts of the
last 60 years; it was also the driest 12-month
period on record at some locations within
the region. The 2004–2005 drought also had
a large impact over the wider region but was
less intense in Kenya. Rainfall for the 12 months
from October 2010 to September 2011 was
50­– 80 per cent below average over most of
the area. The humanitarian impacts of the
drought were severe, especially in Somalia
and Kenya, with significant famine and largescale displacement of the population. The
United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 13 million
people required humanitarian aid.
There was a dramatic change to the pattern in
early October, with heavy rains beginning in
the second week of the month and continuing
into December. Many parts of north-eastern
and coastal Kenya had already received well
in excess of their average rainfall for the full
October–December season by early November.

In the north-east, Wajir received only 73 mm
of rain in the 12 months from October 2010 to
September 2011, 76 per cent below the longterm average of 310 mm, its driest 12-month
period in the post-1950 period. However, it
then received 508 mm for the three months
October–December, 64 per cent above its
annual average and its third-wettest October–
December period on record. Although the rains
late in the year provided relief in the worstaffected areas, the resultant flooding caused
some crop damage and other disruption.

Drought and fires elsewhere in the world
Outside of East Africa, the most significant
drought of the year was in the south-central
United States and adjacent areas of northern
Mexico. As noted earlier, numerous annual
low rainfall records were set on both sides
of the border. The most intense phase of
the drought extended from October 2010 to
October 2011, before generally above-average
rains in November and December brought
some relief. There were substantial losses
to agriculture, and water shortages, in both
countries. The dry conditions also contributed
to many significant fires. The worst of these
occurred in September near Austin, Texas,
burning 13 000 hectares and destroying more
than 1 600 homes. No deaths were reported.

Dry conditions affected large parts of Europe
during the year, especially in the spring and
autumn, once again with losses to agriculture
in the worst-affected areas. Shipping on the
Danube River was also disrupted due to low
river levels in late autumn. The dry spring
conditions produced elevated fire risk over
many parts of western Europe, and there
were several large fires in late April and
early May, especially in Ireland and southern
England. The dry conditions also contributed
to a duststorm near Rostock, Germany, on
8 April, during which eight deaths occurred
in a road accident.
One of the most destructive forest fires in
Canadian history burned large parts of the
town of Slave Lake, Alberta, in May. About
40 per cent of the buildings in the town were
destroyed in the fire. This event was the second-largest insurance loss for any natural
disaster in Canadian history, with total claims
of about US$ 700 million.
The heavy rains that affected large parts of
Australia in late 2010 and early 2011 caused
abnormal vegetation growth in many arid
regions of the central and western parts of the
country, which then went on to fuel extensive
fires during the second half of 2011. The very
wet summer resulted in a very quiet summer
fire season in eastern Australia, but in the
west, a fire in early February on the southeastern fringe of Perth resulted in the loss of
72 houses, the worst property damage from
a fire in Western Australia since 1961. There
were further destructive fires in the region
in November.

Destructive flooding in many parts of the world
A major feature of 2011 was destructive flooding in many parts of the world, both long-lived
flooding arising from major seasonal climate
anomalies, and short-term or flash floods
resulting from extreme events on timescales
of days or hours.
Brazil
In terms of loss of life, one of the most
extreme single events occurred in Brazil on
11–12 January. A flash flood caused by rainfalls that exceeded 200 mm in a few hours in
mountainous terrain about 60 km north of Rio

de Janeiro caused at least 900 deaths, many
of them as the result of a landslide. This was
one of the worst natural disasters in Brazil’s
history. Another event of comparable severity, tropical cyclone Washi in the Philippines
in December, is described in the section on
tropical cyclone activity below.
South-East Asia
The most significant event of the year, in terms
of overall impact, was the flooding in SouthEast Asia. This resulted from consistently
above-average rainfall through mid-year in the
region centred on northern Thailand, where
May–October rainfall was 35 per cent above
average, and the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, rather than any individual extreme
event. Major flooding developed in the Mekong
and Chao Phraya basins in late September,
causing long-lived inundation downstream
over a period of weeks. Cambodia and parts of
Viet Nam were badly affected by the Mekong
River flooding, while in Thailand, large areas
of Bangkok and the surrounding region were
flooded from October to early December,
causing major losses from property damage
and disruption of industry. About 1 000 deaths
across the three countries were attributed to
the flooding, and the World Bank estimated
total economic losses in Thailand at approximately US$ 45 billion, about 70 per cent of
which was in the manufacturing sector.

Australia
There was widespread flooding in eastern
Australia, especially from late December to
early February. The worst-affected areas were
south-east Queensland and northern Victoria,
which had its wettest summer on record. The
city of Brisbane had its worst floods since 1974
with many riverside properties inundated.
Total losses arising from the flooding were
estimated at US$ 1.3 billion in Victoria and
several billion dollars in Queensland.
Pakistan
Pakistan was badly affected by monsoonal
flooding for the second consecutive year,
although the worst impacts were confined to
a smaller area than had been the case in 2010,
when extreme rainfall in northern Pakistan
caused flooding throughout the Indus catchment as it moved downstream. In 2011 the
extreme rainfall was concentrated in the southern province of Sindh, where July–September
rainfall was 248 per cent above average. The
station of Mithi received 1 348 mm for the
three-month period, almost all of it in a few
weeks, which was nearly five times its average
for the period.
United States and Canada
Flooding was a regular feature during 2011
in the northern United States and adjacent
areas of Canada, as well as areas downstream
of the region. Spring and early summer
were extremely wet in many central areas,
particularly the Ohio Valley and the upper
Midwest of the United States and the Prairie
provinces of Canada, which experienced
some of their worst flooding on record.
There was also substantial spring flooding
in the north-eastern United States and the
Canadian province of Quebec. The heavy
spring rains, combined with the melting of
a heavy winter snowpack in northern areas,
caused major downstream flooding during
May and June. Parts of the Mississippi River
experienced their worst floods since 1933,
and there was also major flooding in the
Missouri River and several Canadian rivers.
The Canadian Prairie floods were especially
long-lived, with inundation lasting for more
than four months in places. Later in the year,
two tropical cyclones, Irene in August and
Lee in September, brought extreme rainfall
and record flooding to parts of the northeastern United States.
14

Mediterranean and Europe
A number of relatively localized storms caused
severe flash floods in the western and central
Mediterranean in late October and November.
The most extreme events were in Liguria
in north-western Italy: Borghetto di Vara
received 472 mm in 6 hours on 25 October and
Vicomorasso, near Genoa, received 400 mm
in 12 hours on 4 November. South-eastern
France also saw extreme rainfall, with one
station receiving more than 900 mm in the
nine days from 1 to 9 November. A total of
19 deaths were reported from the two events
in Italy, and there was also loss of life in Spain,
Tunisia and Algeria, as well as elsewhere in
Italy in separate events in Rome and in the
Calabria/Messina region.
Flash flooding also occurred in parts of northern and central Europe during the summer.
One of the most significant events occurred
in Copenhagen on 2 July, when 135 mm of
rain fell in 24 hours.
Central America
Central America experienced major flooding
in October, exacerbated by heavy rains from
a tropical depression. In Huizúcar, El Salvador,
1 513 mm of rain fell in the ten-day period from
10 to 20 October. The worst flooding occurred in
El Salvador, but Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras
and Costa Rica were also affected. At least
105 deaths were attributed to these events.
Eastern Asia
In Eastern Asia, tropical cyclones caused flooding in several parts of the region, particularly
in Japan in September as a result of Talas and
Roke. Talas was responsible for a 72-hour
rainfall of 1 652.5 mm at Kamikitayama in
Nara Prefecture, a national record. The Korean
peninsula had more consistent rainfall through
the summer. It was the wettest summer on
record for the Republic of Korea, with a national
average of 1 048 mm (44 per cent above the
1973–2011 average). Seoul had 1 131 mm in
July alone (187 per cent above the 1908–2011
average), its second-wettest month on record,
and 1 702 mm for the summer (91 per cent
above the 1908–2011 average); there was
substantial flooding in the city in late July.
East Africa
Drought conditions broke down in late 2011
in the East Africa region. Rainfall was well

above average in many areas from October
to December with flooding resulting in some
areas. The most damaging flooding occurred
in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania,
where 260 mm of rain fell in three days from
21 to 23 December. More than 40 deaths were
attributed to this flooding.

Summary of global tropical cyclone activity
in 2011
Global tropical cyclone activity was again
below average in 2011 after the exceptionally
low activity in 2010. There were 74 tropical
cyclones in 2011, including two subtropical
systems. This was well below the 1981–2010
mean of 85, although it was higher than the
67 cyclones observed in 2010, which set the
record for the lowest number of cyclones since
the start of the modern satellite era.
The number of more intense systems was
also below average; 38 systems reached hurricane intensity in 2011 and 22 reached major
hurricane (Saffir–Simpson category 3 and
above) 3 intensity, compared with 1981–2010
means of 47 and 23, respectively. No cyclones
reached Saffir–Simpson category 5 intensity,
with the year’s most intense systems – Dora
in the North-East Pacific, Ophelia in the North
Atlantic, Nanmadol, Songda and Muifa in the
North-West Pacific, and Yasi in the Australian
region – all peaking at category 4.
For the second year in succession, an active
North Atlantic stood in contrast with low global
activity, with a total of 19 cyclones (compared
with an average of 12), equalling 2010 as the
third-most active season on record. However,
many of these cyclones were relatively weak
and the number of more intense systems
(7 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes) was close
to normal. By contrast, the North-East Pacific
had a below-average number of cyclones (11,
compared with an average of 17), but 10 of the
11 cyclones in that region reached hurricane
The lower boundary of category 3 is
defined as maximum sustained 1-minute winds of
50 m s –1 or above, 59 m s -1 or above for category 4,
and 70 m s –1 or above for category 5. These equate
to maximum sustained 10-minute winds (the WMO
standard) of approximately 44, 52 and 62 m s –1,
respectively.

intensity. The increased North Atlantic and
decreased North-East Pacific activity are both
characteristic of La Niña years.
Total activity was close to average in the
Australian region (12 cyclones, average 11)
and the South-West Pacific (7 cyclones, 3 of
which also affected the Australian region.
compared with an average of 5). The Australian
region typically experiences increased activity during La Niña years and the absence of
such an increase in 2011 contributed to the
low global total.
Activity was well below average in the SouthWest Indian (5 cyclones, average 15) and
North Indian (2 cyclones, average 5) basins.
The 2010–2011 seasonal total for the SouthWest Indian basin (4 cyclones, including one
subtropical system) was the second-lowest
since records began. The North-West Pacific
(21 cyclones, average 26) was also less active
than usual, although more active than it had
been in 2010.
The year’s most intense landfall was that of
Yasi in early February. It was a category 4
system when it made landfall at Mission Beach,
between Townsville and Cairns, making it the
most intense system at landfall on the east
coast of Australia since at least 1918. Only
one death was attributed to Yasi, but property
damage exceeded US$ 1 billion. However,
by far the worst cyclone of the year in terms
of humanitarian impact was Washi, which
was only of tropical storm intensity (maximum sustained winds 26 m s –1) but caused
extreme flooding in northern Mindanao in the
Philippines from 16 to 18 December, resulting
in over 1 000 deaths and the displacement of
almost 300 000 people. Another cyclone to
cause significant loss of life was Thane, which
caused about 50 deaths on the south-east
coast of India on 30 December. A further damaging landfall event was category 1 cyclone
Irene, which struck the north-eastern United
States in late August and caused in excess of
US$ 7 billion in damage, mostly from flooding.

of Joachim were felt in central Europe, while
Dagmar, which also caused damaging storm
surges, mostly affected the Nordic countries
and the Kaliningrad and St Petersburg regions
of the Russian Federation. Both storms brought
wind gusts in excess of 150 km/h, with a gust
of 233 km/h observed during the passage of
Dagmar at the high mountain site of Juvasshøe
in Norway.
In the United States, 2011 was one of the most
active tornado seasons on record, with numerous major outbreaks, particularly in April and
May, and about double the long-term average
number of tornadoes. The deadliest single
tornado in the United States since 1947 caused
157 deaths in Joplin, Missouri, in May. The year
ranks with 2004 and 2008 as being the three
most active tornado seasons on record4 and,
with 553 deaths, equals the second-greatest
number of deaths on record. This included
six tornadoes confirmed as category 5 on the
Enhanced Fujita scale, resulting in the second
highest number of category 5 tornadoes,
behind the seven recorded in 1974.
At the time of writing, the total number of
tornadoes ranks third behind 2004 and 2008, but a
number of possible tornadoes late in the year are
still under investigation and may be added to the
2011 total if confirmed.

Arctic sea-ice extent was again well below
average in 2011. After tracking at record or
near-record low levels for the time of year
through the first half of 2011, the seasonal
minimum extent, reached on 9 September,
was 4.33 million km2, 35 per cent below the
1979–2000 average, according to the United
States National Snow and Ice Data Center.5 This
was the second-lowest seasonal minimum on
record, 0.16 million km2 above the record low
set in 2007. Unlike the 2007 season, both the
North-West and North-East Passages were
ice-free for periods during the 2011 summer.
Sea-ice volume was even further below average and was estimated at a new record low of
4 200 km3, surpassing the record of 4 580 km3
set in 2010.
Antarctic sea-ice extent anomalies fluctuated
during 2011, but averaged over the year as a
whole sea-ice extent was close to average.
Sea-ice extent was well below average in the
early months of the year, largely as a result of
the absence of the usual summer ice coverage
in the eastern part of the Ross Sea, and briefly
reached record low levels for the time of year
in February but returned to near average by
May. After remaining at near-normal levels
until November, sea-ice extent then became
well above average in December, due to the
slow break-up of ice in the sector between
20°W and 20°E.
Elsewhere, as a result of the cold winter in
north-eastern Europe, winter Baltic Sea ice
coverage reached 300 000 km2 on 25 February,
the largest area since 1987.

Polar ozone depletion in 2011
The peak Antarctic ozone hole in 2011, while
larger and more intense than the long-term
average, was of typical size for the last decade.
Ozone depletion was assisted by generally
below-average stratospheric temperatures
in the Antarctic region in winter and spring.
Other groups using slightly different
satellite resolutions and algorithms, such as
the University of Bremen in Germany, determined
the 2011 minimum to be slightly lower than that
of 2007.

The daily maximum ozone hole for 2011
was 24.4 million km2 on 8 October.6 This is
5.8 million km2 more than the 1979–2000 average but about 6 million km2 less than the record
of almost 30 million km2 set in 2000. Averaged
over the full period of peak ozone hole extent
(7 September–13 October), the ozone hole in
2011 covered an area of 22.5 million km2, close
to the post-1990 average.
The minimum daily average ozone during 2011
was reached on 8 October with 99 Dobson
Units (DU). This is below the 1979–2000 average of 125.4 DU and was the lowest value
since 2006. The record low was observed in
1994 with 73 DU.
A figure of 26 million km2 was reported
by other instruments; the difference arises from
different assumptions made in satellite processing algorithms with respect to areas that are still in
darkness in the early part of the season.

The most significant Arctic ozone depletion
yet observed occurred in 2011, as a result
of unusually prolonged low temperatures
in the lower stratosphere over the region in
the 2010/2011 winter. Total ozone depletion
in the 18–20 km layer was about twice the
previous highest observed, in 1996 and
2005, and total ozone column loss was in
the vicinity of 40 per cent. About 45 per cent
of the Arctic vortex had total column ozone
below 275 DU at the hole’s peak, with the
lowest values in late March around 220–230
DU, representing comparable ozone loss7
to that observed in the Antarctic vortex
during 2010, which was a relatively weak
Antarctic ozone depletion year.
Background ozone levels in the Arctic
during spring are about 100 DU higher than those in
the Antarctic, so a measurement of 220–230 DU in
the Arctic represents a similar ozone loss to one of
120–130 DU in the Antarctic.

Major large-scale drivers of seasonal and
interannual variability of the world’s climate
There are several large-scale modes of variability in the world’s climate that influence
conditions over large parts of the world on
seasonal to interannual timescales.

El Niño–Southern Oscillation
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is
probably the best-known of the major global
modes of interannual climate variability.
Under normal conditions, sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean are several degrees cooler than
those in the west, associated with the effects
of cold ocean currents off the west coast of
South America. In a warm phase (El Niño),
those central and eastern equatorial Pacific
Ocean temperatures warm to above-normal
levels – by up to 3°C to 4°C in the most extreme
events, although 1°C to 2°C is more typical
of a standard El Niño event. This results in
a reduction of the west-to-east temperature
gradient in the equatorial Pacific, and hence
a reduction in the air pressure gradient and
reduced intensity of the easterly trade winds
through the tropical Pacific. In a cold phase
(La Niña), the reverse happens, with the
equatorial Pacific cold tongue stronger than
normal, and enhanced trade winds through
the tropics. Both El Niño and La Niña events
typically form around mid-year and persist
for 9 to 12 months until the early months of
the following year.
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation influences
climate in many ways over large parts of
the world, including some far away from the
Pacific. El Niño is associated with a high risk
of drier-than-normal conditions in areas such
as eastern Australia, the Indonesian region,
India, southern Africa, the Caribbean and
north-east Brazil. Conversely, El Niño years
tend to be wetter than normal on the west
coast of South America, northern Argentina
and Uruguay, equatorial East Africa, the islands
of the central tropical Pacific, and the southern
United States. El Niño also influences temperature and tropical cyclone occurrence, with
a marked tendency for global temperatures
to be atypically warm during El Niño years.
In general the effects of La Niña are the reverse
of those of El Niño, for example, an increased
18

risk of heavy rain and flooding in Australia, the
Indian subcontinent and southern Africa, and
an increased risk of drought in the southern
United States. La Niña years are typically
relatively cool on the global scale (see Figure 1
on page 2).

Indian Ocean Dipole
The equatorial Indian Ocean is also subject
to fluctuations in sea surface temperatures,
although on a less regular basis than the Pacific.
The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) describes a
mode of variability that affects the western and
eastern parts of the ocean. When IOD is in its
positive mode, ocean waters are warmer than
average in the western equatorial Indian Ocean
(off the east coast of Africa) and cooler than
average in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean,
particularly to the south of the Indonesian
islands of Java and Sumatra. The reverse is
true when IOD is in its negative mode.
Positive IOD events are more likely to occur
in El Niño years and negative IOD events in
La Niña years, but there is not a one-to-one
relationship. Positive IOD events have an
association with below-average rainfall in
large parts of Australia and western Indonesia,
and above-average rainfall in East Africa;
conversely, negative IOD years tend to be wet
in Australia and dry in East Africa.

Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation
The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) are two closely related
modes of variability in the atmospheric circulation at middle and higher latitudes of the
northern hemisphere. In the positive mode,
the subtropical high-pressure ridge is stronger
than normal, as are areas of low pressure at
higher latitudes, such as the “Icelandic” and
“Aleutian” lows, resulting in enhanced westerly circulation through the mid-latitudes. In
the negative mode, the reverse is true, with a
weakened subtropical ridge, weakened higherlatitude low-pressure areas and anomalous
easterly flow through the mid-latitudes. As
the name implies, NAO describes this mode
of variability over the North Atlantic sector
only; AO describes the mode over the full
northern hemisphere.

The principal effects of AO and NAO on climate occur in the colder months. When these
oscillations are in their positive mode, there
tend to be more and stronger storms over the
North Atlantic. This typically results in warmer
and wetter winters over northern and central
Europe and the eastern United States, drier
winters over the Mediterranean and cold,
dry conditions over northern Canada and
Greenland. These relationships are reversed
in negative mode; in particular, negative
modes of NAO are strongly associated with
below-average winter temperatures in northern and central Europe. The effects of positive
and negative phases of AO and NAO are
illustrated by maps of monthly temperature anomalies for December 2010 (negative
phase) and December 2011 (positive) (see
figure opposite).

The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), also
known as the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO),
is the southern hemisphere analogue of
the Arctic Oscillation, and indices describing it are constructed in a similar way. As
for the Arctic Oscillation, positive modes
of SAM are indicative of a stronger subtropical ridge and a stronger Antarctic
circumpolar trough, and enhanced westerly
flow between them (because of the lack
of land areas at high southern latitudes,
the Antarctic circumpolar trough is more
continuous and consistent than its northern
hemisphere counterpart).
The enhanced westerly flow in a positive
phase of SAM only has a limited effect on
land areas, because the only land areas in the
latitude range in which flow occurs are southern South America, the Antarctic Peninsula

Of more significance to climate on land is the
strengthening of the subtropical high-pressure
belt in a positive SAM phase, which is typically associated with below-average rainfall in
southern Australia (especially the south-west)
and southern New Zealand.
