Foreword
In 1873 the First International Meteorological
Congress assembled in Vienna to establish
the International Meteorological Organization
(IMO), which by 1929 had launched its
Commission for Climatology. During August
1947, the ten IMO technical commissions and its
six regional commissions held their respective
sessions simultaneously in Toronto, Canada.
These meetings immediately preceded the
Washington (Eighth) Conference of Directors
of Meteorological Services, which in October
1947 unanimously approved the Convention of
a new organization: the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). Following the necessary ratifications, WMO took over the IMO
responsibilities on 23 March 1950 and, one
year later, WMO became a specialized agency
of the United Nations system.
Fifty years after the founding of the IMO
Commission for Climatology, in 1979 WMO
organized the First World Climate Conference, in
collaboration with the International Council for
Science, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
and the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations. This historic conference led to the establishment of the WMO
World Climate Programme and, in 1980, to the
World Climate Research Programme, which
WMO first co-sponsored with the International
Council for Science and subsequently also
with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission. Furthermore, the conference
paved the way for the 1988 establishment of the
WMO/UNEP co-sponsored Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, which received the
prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its
efforts “to build up and disseminate greater
knowledge about man-made climate change,
and to lay the foundations for the measures
that are needed to counteract such change”.
The Second World Climate Conference, which
WMO organized with partners in 1990, provided decisive momentum to the international
efforts that resulted in the development of
the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change and the Global Climate
Observing System. In the wake of these historic
events, WMO began to issue in 1993 its annual

report “WMO Statement on the Status of the
Global Climate”, which by now has become
a well-established source of authoritative
information, eagerly sought after every year
by the scientific community and the media.
The WMO Statement on the Status of the
Global Climate in 2008 is the latest in this
successful series.
The year 2008 was notable, in particular,
as it signalled positive global temperature
anomalies, which positioned it among the
ten warmest on record since the beginning
of modern measurements in 1850. Several
extreme weather and climate events were
recorded in various parts of the world in 2008,
of which perhaps the most dramatic was
tropical cyclone Nargis, which made landfall
in Myanmar in May, causing catastrophic
destruction and more than 70 000 fatalities.
Other parts of the world suffered severe flooding, extreme heatwaves and droughts in 2008,
while Arctic sea ice was once more observed to
decline markedly, reaching during September
its second-lowest historic extent.
I would like to highlight that 2008 was the
second year of the International Polar Year
2007–2008, a WMO co-sponsored scientific
venture that has already made decisive contributions to our scientific understanding of
climate in the polar regions.
I wish to express the appreciation of WMO to
all the Centres and the National Meteorological
and Hydrological Services of WMO Members
that collaborated with WMO and contributed
to the present publication. As with previous editions, I would like to underscore the
importance of receiving your feedback. WMO
looks forward to your comments on the WMO
Statement on the Status of the Global Climate
in 2008 and to your welcome suggestions for
its further improvement.

made by leading climate centres. The Met
Office Hadley Centre analyses showed that
the global combined sea surface and land
surface air temperature for 2008 was 0.31°C
(0.56°F) above the 1961–1990 annual average
of 14.0°C (57.2°F), ranking 2008 as the tenth
warmest year on record. According to the
National Climatic Data Center of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
global mean surface temperature anomaly was
0.49ºC (0.88ºF) above the twentieth century
average (1901–2000), which ranks 2008 as the
eighth warmest year on record.

2000

Based on the joint Met Office Hadley Centre
and Climate Research Unit, University of
East Anglia analyses, in 2008 the northern
and southern hemispheres, with a mean
temperature anomaly of +0.51ºC (+0.92ºF)
and + 0.11ºC (+ 0.20ºF), ranked ninth and
seventeenth, respectively.

The year 2008 ranked as one of the warmest

The global average temperature in 2008 was
slightly lower than for the previous years
of the twenty-first century, owing in part to
the moderate-to-strong La Niña that developed in the latter half of 2007. The global
mean temperature anomaly in January 2008
(+0.05ºC/+0.09ºF) was the lowest recorded
since February 1994 (–0.09ºC /–0.16ºF).

All temperature values have uncertainties, which arise mainly from gaps in data
coverage. The size of the uncertainties is such
that, for example, although 2008 is nominally
the tenth warmest year on record, it could lie
anywhere between the seventh and fourteenth
warmest years.
Since the beginning of the twentieth century,
the global average surface temperature has
risen by 0.74°C, although this increase has not
been continuous. The linear warming trend
over the past 50 years (0.13°C per decade) is
nearly twice that for the past 100 years.
Note: Following established practice, WMO global temperature analyses are based on two different datasets. One is
the combined dataset maintained by the Met Office Hadley
Centre, UK, and the Climatic Research Unit, University of
East Anglia, UK. The other is maintained by the United
States Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. Both centres use improved
temperature analyses, but different methodologies. These
differing methodologies may result in small differences in
global ranking.

Regional temperature anomalies
In 2008 most parts of the world experienced
yet again a year of above-average temperatures. The northern hemisphere, particularly
Europe, Asia and the North Atlantic, had the
largest anomalies (the anomalies reached

between +1ºC and +3ºC); conversely, part of
the United States and Canada experienced
slightly cooler than average temperatures. In
the southern hemisphere, over the ocean and
south of 45° latitude, the temperatures were
mostly below average.
Europe and Asia
A large geographical area, including northwestern Siberia and part of the Scandinavian
region, recorded a remarkably mild winter.
January and February were very mild in
most of Europe. Monthly mean temperature
anomalies for these months exceeded
+7°C in some places in Scandinavia. In
most parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden,
winter 2007/2008 was the warmest recorded
since the beginning of measurements. The
previous mildest winter in Finland was the
1924/1925 winter, more than 80 years ago.
Large parts of Western Europe, including
the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, had
an exceptionally sunny February with some
areas recording over double their monthly
average sunshine duration. The United
Kingdom experienced its sunniest winter
since 1929.
The boreal winter was remarkably cold for a
large part of Asia, extending eastward from

Canada. November was also particularly
mild over Canada and the western part of the
United States.
South America
Between January and April, above-normal
temperatures predominated over southern
South America; conversely, below-normal
temperatures were recorded in the central
and north-western part of the region. During
the same period, southern Argentina and
Chile were affected by persistent atmospheric
blocking situations that brought very hot
weather to the area. February was particularly warm throughout this region. Many
locations recorded the warmest February in
50 years, with daily maximum temperatures reaching between 35°C and 40°C, well
above the average, which ranges between
20°C and 28°C.
May was colder than average especially
because of an early Antarctic air mass outbreak that affected southern South America,
particularly central and northern Argentina,
where the minimum temperature dropped
below –6°C in some locations, breaking annual
absolute minimum temperature records.
Conversely, mean July temperatures were
more than +3°C above average in large parts
of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, south-east
Bolivia and southern Brazil, making it the
warmest July in the past 50 years for many
locations. November also broke historical

Australia
In Australia, the year started with the hottest
January since 1950. An exceptionally prolonged heatwave affected much of southern
Australia in March. For example, Adelaide had
its longest running heatwave on record, with
15 consecutive days of maximum temperatures
above 35°C, well in excess of the previous
record of 8 consecutive days. Despite this, the
rest of the austral autumn was characterized, in
much of the country, by above-average daytime
and below-average overnight temperatures.
In Queensland, the first ever sub-zero March
minimum (–0.2°C) was recorded at Stanthorpe,
while Kalumburu (Western Australia) and
Kowanyama (Queensland) had 60 or more
consecutive below-normal nights, extending
from early April to early June. September and
October were very warm months ranking,
with the two-month combined period, second
behind 1988.

Global precipitation
In 2008, global precipitation over land
was slightly above the 1961–1990 average.
Precipitation throughout the year was variable
in many areas. Less than average conditions
were observed across the western and
south-central contiguous United States; southwestern Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands;

Argentina, as shown in Figure 7 for the northeast region, shows the severity and duration
of this drought. This drought caused some
damage to agriculture, livestock and water

Extreme storms and flooding
In January, 1.3 million square kilometres (km2)
in 15 provinces in southern China were covered by snow. Persistent low temperature and
icing affected the daily lives of millions of
people who suffered not only from damage to agriculture, but also from disruptions
in transpor t, energy supply and power
transmission.
In Canada, several all-time snowfall records
were set during winter, reaching more than
550 centimetres (cm) in many locations,
including Quebec City. In Toronto, it was the
third snowiest winter on record for the past
70 years. At the end of January, Prince Edward
Island was struck by one of the worst ice
storms in decades.
In the United States, heavy April rainfall,
combined with previously saturated ground
and snowmelt, resulted in widespread major

flooding that affected Missouri and southern
Indiana. During June, 78 stations reported
their wettest day of any June and 15 of
these stations set a new all-time record for
the wettest 24-hour period for any month.
Also, 2008 was one of the top 10 years for
tornado-related fatalities (123) since reliable
records began in 1953. According to statistics,
2 192 tornadoes were recorded during the
year, well above the 10-year average of 1 270.
In Germany, between May and September,
a large number of strong thunderstorms
with heavy rain, tornadoes and hailstorms
were observed, causing some casualties and
significant damage.
Sub-Saharan Africa, including West and
East Africa, was affected by heavy rains,
which caused the worst-ever recorded
flooding in Zimbabwe and affected more than
300 000 people in West Africa during the
monsoon season.
In northern Africa, heavy and extended
rainfall during the September–November
period affected Algeria and Morocco, causing important infrastructure damage and
several casualties. Extreme rainfall intensities

in less than six hours were recorded in the
northern provinces of Morocco. Within the
same climate anomaly context and period,
intense rainfall was also recorded in southwestern Europe. In Valencia, Spain, a total
rainfall of 390 mm was recorded in 24 hours,
of which 144 mm was recorded in less than
1 hour. In France, heavy and intense rains
affected several locations from 31 October to
2 November. In those three days, total rainfall
reached 500 mm in some locations, which
caused severe flooding and flash floods,
particularly in the central and east-central
parts of the country.
Several major rain events affected eastern
Australia in January and February, causing
significant flooding, particularly in Queensland.
In November, widespread heavy rains occurred
across most of the continent, ending an
extremely dry period in central Australia.
Associated severe thunderstorms caused
damage from winds, hail and flash floods in
many places.
In southern Asia, including India, Pakistan and
Viet Nam, heavy monsoon rains and torrential
downpours produced flash floods, killing more
than 2 600 people, and displacing 10 million
people in India.
In western Colombia, continuous abovenormal rainfall resulted in severe flooding
and landslides that affected at least half a
million people and caused extensive damage
during the second half of the year.
In Southern Brazil, intense rainfall affected
Santa Catarina state from 21 to 24 November,
causing severe flooding and deadly mudslides,
which affected 1.5 million people and resulted
in more than 80 casualties. During this period,
more than 500 mm of rainfall was recorded,
including more than 200 mm of rainfall in
24 hours (breaking historical records for
24-hour rainfall), for example, at Blumenau,
Balneário Camboriú, São Francisco do Sul,
Itapoá and Biguaçú.

Tropical cyclones
The most deadly tropical cyclone recorded
in 2008 was Nargis, which developed in the
North Indian Ocean and hit Myanmar in early

May, killing more than 70 000 people and
destroying thousands of homes. Nargis was
the most devastating cyclone to hit Asia
since 1991 and resulted in the worst natural
disaster on record for Myanmar.
A total of 16 named tropical storms formed
in the Atlantic, including 8 hurricanes, 5 of
which were major Category 3 or higher,
compared with the long-term average of
11 tropical storms, 6 hurricanes, 2 which were
Category 3 or higher. The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was devastating, with many
casualties and widespread destruction in the
Caribbean, Central America and the United
States. For the first time on record, six consecutive tropical cyclones (Dolly, Edouard,
Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) made landfall
on the United States, and a record of three
major hurricanes (Gustav, Ike and Paloma)
hit Cuba. Hanna, Ike and Gustav were the
deadliest hurricanes of the season, causing
several hundred casualties in the Caribbean,
including 500 deaths in Haiti.
In the East Pacific, 17 named tropical storms
were recorded, of which 7 evolved into hurricanes and 2 into major hurricanes, compared
with averages of 16, 9 and 4, respectively.
In the western North Pacific, 22 named tropical storms were recorded; of these, 11 were
classified as typhoons compared with the
long-term averages of 27 and 14, respectively.
The Philippines, Cambodia, the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Thailand, Viet Nam and
south-eastern China were severely affected
by these events. For the first time since 2001,
no named tropical cyclones made landfall in
Japan during the year.
In the broader Australian region, tropical
cyclone numbers during the 2007/2008 season were close to normal, with a total of
10 systems. However, it was a quiet season
for landfalls and intense systems.

Weakening of La Niña
The first quarter of 2008 was characterized
by a La Niña event of moderate to strong
intensity, which began in the second half of
2007 and prevailed through May 2008. The

(more than 29 million km2), but larger than in
2007 (25 million km2). The variation in the size
of the ozone hole from one year to another
can be explained, to a large extent, by the
meteorological conditions in the stratosphere,
as ozone depletion becomes more severe if the
stratosphere is cold. Temperature conditions
in the 2008 Antarctic stratospheric vortex were
colder than in 2007 but warmer than in 2006.
Over the next few years, the variation in the
severity of ozone hole will be governed by
inter-annual changes in meteorology rather
than changes in ozone depleting substances,
whose decline is quite slow.

Arctic sea ice down to second-lowest extent
Arctic sea-ice extent during the 2008 melt
season dropped to its second-lowest level
since satellite measurements began in 1979,
reaching the lowest point in its annual cycle
of melt and growth on 14 September 2008.

Average sea-ice extent over the month
of September, a standard measure in the
scientific study of Arctic sea ice, was
4.67 million km2. The record monthly low, set
in 2007, was 4.3 million km2. As the ice was
thinner in 2008, its overall volume was less
than that in any other year. A remarkable occurrence in 2008 was the dramatic disappearance
of nearly one quarter of the massive ancient
ice shelves on Ellesmere Island. The season
strongly reinforces the 30-year downward
trend in Arctic sea-ice extent.
For the first time in recorded history, the
navigable deep-water routes of the fabled
Northwest Passage over the top of North
America, and the Northeast Passage over
the top of the Russian Federation, were
simultaneously free of ice. The year 2008
marked the third consecutive summer that
ships could easily navigate the Northwest
Passage without hitting or being blocked by
sea ice.

Benefits for climate monitoring and assessment
of data rescue activities
by Phil Jones, Climatic Research Unit, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, UK
In most regions of the world there are longer
instrumental records than apparent in a cursory search of the website or archives of a
National Meteorological and Hydrological
Service (NMHS). In most cases this results
from the NMHS not yet having digitized all the
meteorological data in its archives. In many
cases the records pre-date the founding of
the Service, whereas in others they pre-date
the founding of the country. It is important
that these early records, which were often
taken with meticulous care by early scientists and medical doctors, be digitized and
made available for climatological use. These
early records are generally to be found in
national or learned society archives, sometimes located in the archives of an earlier
colonial power. Present-day scientists owe
their forebears much gratitude for taking these
early measurements with meticulous care
and diligence. Given this effort, it would be a
shame if they were left to collect more dust in
an archive.
Extending climatic series brings a number of
scientific benefits, both to the NMHS and to
the climatological research community in the
country and in the region. The primary benefit

is that the longer records enable trends and
other analyses to be more extensive, placing
recent records and extremes in the longer
context. Longer climatic series also provide
instrumental data for more extensive calibration of natural and documentary proxies, both
of which have the potential for extending the
climatic history further back in time. Longer
observational data provide better coverage
(in both space and time) for extended reanalysis projects, planned to begin from the
late nineteenth century. Lastly, longer records
are useful for assessing impacts of climate
change over more extensive time frames
than just the recent past. The following two
examples discuss the above for northern
and western Europe. They illustrate what has
been achieved through more extensive digital
instrumental data.

Longer records for the assessment
of proxy evidence
Longer climatic reconstructions require information from natural (for example, trees and
ice cores) and documentary (written archives)
proxy material. These proxy records must use
instrumental records to calibrate the proxy

In Europe, however, it is generally possible to
assess the quality of possible reconstructions,
especially the longer decadal-timescale details,
for almost 200 years. The figure shows examples of such calibration exercises using a long
instrumental record developed for northern
Fennoscandia. Both proxy series show good
replication of instrumental temperatures at
the inter-annual and decadal timescales.

Paris and London. At both sites, near-continuous
daily pressure records have been taken since
the late seventeenth century. For Paris, a
complete record has been developed back to
1677, missing only most of the years in the
1720s and 1730s. For London, the record is
complete from 1692, missing only the years
between 1717 and 1722. Despite these short
gaps, a very useful approximation to the winter
NAO has been developed back to 1692.

Extensions of the North Atlantic Oscillation

References

The longest record of the winter North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), back to 1820, has been
derived by Jones and others (1997) based on
pressure data from Gibraltar and Reykjavik.
As the NAO is essentially a measure of the
westerly wind strength over western Europe,
two long well-located pressure records would
provide a good surrogate for the more distant
locations in Iceland and southern Iberia or the
Azores. The two locations with the greatest
