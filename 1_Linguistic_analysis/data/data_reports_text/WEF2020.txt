Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have evolved with new issues emerging on the 10-year horizon. For example, cyberattacks, income disparity and unemployment entered the set of global risks in 2012.
Some global risks have been reclassified: water crises and income disparity were recategorized as societal risks in the 2015 and 2014 Global Risks Reports, respectively.

Preface
The 15th edition of the World Economic
Forum’s Global Risks Report comes as
long-mounting, interconnected risks are
being felt. The global economy is faced
with a “synchronized slowdown”, the past
five years have been the warmest on
record, and cyberattacks are expected to
increase this year—all while citizens protest
the political and economic conditions in
their countries and voice concerns about
systems that exacerbate inequality. Indeed,
the growing palpability of shared economic,
environmental and societal risks signals that
the horizon has shortened for preventing—
or even mitigating—some of the direst
consequences of global risks. It is sobering
that in the face of this development, when
the challenges before us demand immediate
collective action, fractures within the global
community appear to only be widening.
Global commerce has historically been a pillar
and engine of growth—and a key tool for
lifting economies out of downturns—but as
we warn, significant restrictions were placed
on global trade last year. This comes as G20
4

Preface

economies hold record high levels of debt
and exhibit relatively low levels of growth.
Ammunition to fight a potential recession
is lacking, and there is a possibility of an
extended low-growth period, akin to the
1970s, if lack of coordinated action continues.
In addition, a potential decoupling of the
world’s largest economies, the United States
and China, is cause for further concern. The
question for stakeholders—one that cannot
be answered in the affirmative—is whether
in the face of a prolonged global slowdown
we are positioned in a way that will foster
resiliency and prosperity.
On the environment, we note with grave
concern the consequences of continued
environmental degradation, including
the record pace of species decline.
Respondents to our Global Risks Perception
Survey are also sounding the alarm, ranking
climate change and related environmental
issues as the top five risks in terms of
likelihood—the first time in the survey’s
history that one category has occupied all
five of the top spots. But despite the need to

be more ambitious when it comes to climate
action, the UN has warned that countries
have veered off course when it comes to
meeting their commitments under the Paris
Agreement on climate change.
And on global health and technology, we
caution that international systems have
not kept up to date with the challenges of
these domains. The global community is
ill-positioned to address vulnerabilities that
have come alongside the advancements
of the 20th century, whether they be the
widening application of artificial intelligence
or the widespread use of antibiotics.
Today’s risk landscape is being shaped
in significant measure by an unsettled
geopolitical environment—one in which
new centres of power and influence are
forming—as old alliance structures and
global institutions are being tested. While
these changes can create openings for new
partnership structures, in the immediate
term, they are putting stress on systems of
coordination and challenging norms around
shared responsibility. Unless stakeholders
adapt multilateral mechanisms for this
turbulent period, the risks that were once
on the horizon will continue to arrive.
The good news is that the window for action is
still open, if not for much longer. And, despite
global divisions, we continue to see members
of the business community signal their
commitment to looking beyond their balance
sheets and towards the urgent priorities ahead.

The Global Risks Initiative
It is fitting that this year’s report, which
makes clear the need for a multistakeholder
approach to mitigating risk, coincides
with the Forum’s 50th anniversary. As the
international organization for public-private
cooperation, the Forum brings together
leaders from the business, government and
non-profit communities for action-oriented
deliberations and uses the conclusions of
this report to inform its multistakeholder
initiatives throughout the year.
Indeed, the Global Risks Report is itself the
result of a multistakeholder process. I am
grateful for the long-standing relationship
with our strategic partners, Marsh &

McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group,
who offered invaluable input to produce
this publication. I am also grateful to our
academic partners: the National University
of Singapore, the Oxford Martin School of
the University of Oxford, and the Wharton
Risk Management and Decision Processes
Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
Over the course of developing the report,
the Forum benefited from a committed
Advisory Board, who shaped the direction
of early drafts and provided beneficial
comments and insight throughout the
writing process. The Forum also hosted a
range of representatives from the public and
private sectors in September and October
for discussions in Geneva, New York and
Washington, DC, insights from which can
be found in these pages.
The foundation of the report is our
annual Global Risks Perception Survey,
completed by approximately 800 members
of the Forum’s diverse communities. I am
particularly proud that for the first time we
are also featuring the results from more
than 200 members of our Global Shapers
Community—a generation of emerging
global social entrepreneurs and leaders.
This younger generation is increasingly
using its digital savviness—and its feet—to
spotlight issues, particularly relating to
climate change, that it sees as existential
risks not only to its generation but to the
wider global community.
The Global Risks Report is part of an
expanded Global Risks Initiative launched
by the Forum this past year that includes
sustained analysis at the global, regional
and industry levels. It is this qualitative and
quantitative study of global risks, conducted
in partnership with members of the business,
academic and public-sector communities,
that we hope will help bring stakeholders
together in developing sustainable,
integrated solutions to the world’s most
pressing challenges.

Executive Summary
The world cannot wait for the fog of
geopolitical and geo-economic uncertainty
to lift. Opting to ride out the current period
in the hope that the global system will
“snap back” runs the risk of missing crucial
windows to address pressing challenges.
On key issues such as the economy, the
environment, technology and public health,
stakeholders must find ways to act quickly
and with purpose within an unsettled global
landscape. This is the context in which the
World Economic Forum publishes the 15th
edition of the Global Risks Report.

An unsettled world

increasing the risk of economic stagnation.
Low trade barriers, fiscal prudence and
strong global investment—once seen as
fundamentals for economic growth—are
fraying as leaders advance nationalist
policies. The margins for monetary and
fiscal stimuli are also narrower than
before the 2008–2009 financial crisis,
creating uncertainty about how well
countercyclical policies will work. A
challenging economic climate may
persist this year: according to the Global
Risks Perception Survey, members of the
multistakeholder community see “economic
confrontations” and “domestic political
polarization” as the top risks in 2020.

Powerful economic, demographic and
technological forces are shaping a new
balance of power. The result is an unsettled
geopolitical landscape—one in which
states are increasingly viewing opportunities
and challenges through unilateral lenses.
What were once givens regarding alliance
structures and multilateral systems no
longer hold as states question the value
of long-standing frameworks, adopt
more nationalist postures in pursuit
of individual agendas and weigh the
potential geopolitical consequences of
economic decoupling.

Amid this darkening economic outlook,
citizens’ discontent has hardened with
systems that have failed to promote
advancement. Disapproval of how
governments are addressing profound
economic and social issues has sparked
protests throughout the world, potentially
weakening the ability of governments to
take decisive action should a downturn
occur. Without economic and social
stability, countries could lack the financial
resources, fiscal margin, political capital
or social support needed to confront key
global risks.

Beyond the risk of conflict, if stakeholders
concentrate on immediate geostrategic
advantage and fail to reimagine or adapt
mechanisms for coordination during this
unsettled period, opportunities for action
on key priorities may slip away.

Risks to economic stability
and social cohesion
Recent editions of the Global Risks Report
warned of downward pressure on the
global economy from macroeconomic
fragilities and financial inequality. These
pressures continued to intensify in 2019,

Executive Summary

Climate threats and
accelerated biodiversity loss
Climate change is striking harder and
more rapidly than many expected. The
last five years are on track to be the
warmest on record, natural disasters are
becoming more intense and more frequent,
and last year witnessed unprecedented
extreme weather throughout the world.
Alarmingly, global temperatures are on
track to increase by at least 3°C towards
the end of the century—twice what climate
experts have warned is the limit to avoid
the most severe economic, social and

environmental consequences. The nearterm impacts of climate change add up to
a planetary emergency that will include loss
of life, social and geopolitical tensions and
negative economic impacts.
For the first time in the history of the Global
Risks Perception Survey, environmental
concerns dominate the top long-term
risks by likelihood among members of the
World Economic Forum’s multistakeholder
community; three of the top five risks by
impact are also environmental (see Figure I,
The Evolving Risks Landscape 2007–2020).
“Failure of climate change mitigation and
adaption” is the number one risk by impact
and number two by likelihood over the next
10 years, according to our survey. Members
of the Global Shapers Community—the
Forum’s younger constituents—show
even more concern, ranking environmental
issues as the top risks in both the short
and long terms.

technology governance framework and
cyber insecurity all pose significant risk.
Geopolitical and geo-economic uncertainty—
including the possibility of fragmented
cyberspace—also threaten to prevent the
full potential of next generation technologies
from being realized. Respondents to our
survey rated “information infrastructure
breakdown” as the sixth most impactful risk
in the years until 2030.

Health systems under
new pressures

Consequences of
digital fragmentation

Health systems around the world are at
risk of becoming unfit for purpose. New
vulnerabilities resulting from changing
societal, environmental, demographic and
technological patterns threaten to undo the
dramatic gains in wellness and prosperity
that health systems have supported over the
last century. Non-communicable diseases—
such as cardiovascular diseases and mental
illness—have replaced infectious diseases as
the leading cause of death, while increases
in longevity and the economic and societal
costs of managing chronic diseases have
put healthcare systems in many countries
under stress. Progress against pandemics is
also being undermined by vaccine hesitancy
and drug resistance, making it increasingly
difficult to land the final blow against some
of humanity’s biggest killers. As existing
health risks resurge and new ones emerge,
humanity’s past successes in overcoming
health challenges are no guarantee of
future results.

More than 50% of the world’s population is
now online, approximately one million people
go online for their first time each day, and
two-thirds of the global population own a
mobile device. While digital technology is
bringing tremendous economic and
societal benefits to much of the global
population, issues such as unequal
access to the internet, the lack of a global

There is still scope for stakeholders to
address these risks, but the window
of opportunity is closing. Coordinated,
multistakeholder action is needed quickly
to mitigate against the worst outcomes
and build resiliency across communities
and businesses.

The Forum’s multistakeholder network
rate “biodiversity loss” as the second most
impactful and third most likely risk for the
next decade. The current rate of extinction
is tens to hundreds of times higher than the
average over the past 10 million years—and
it is accelerating. Biodiversity loss has critical
implications for humanity, from the collapse
of food and health systems to the disruption
of entire supply chains.

Powerful economic, demographic and
technological forces are shaping a new
balance of power. The result is an
unsettled geopolitical landscape—one
in which states are increasingly viewing
opportunities and challenges through a
unilateral lens. What were once givens
regarding alliance structures and multilateral
systems no longer hold as states question
the value of longstanding frameworks,
adopt more nationalist postures in pursuit
of individual agendas and weigh the
potential geopolitical consequences of
economic decoupling.
Beyond the risk of conflict, if stakeholders
concentrate on immediate geostrategic
advantage and fail to reimagine or adapt
mechanisms for coordination during this
unsettled period, opportunities for action on
key priorities will slip away.

Turbulence: The new normal
For much of the post–Cold War period, all
but a few societies shared the aspiration
of stable development in the context of
formally agreed (if not universally observed)
rules governed by multilateral institutions.
Geopolitical challenges—from border
conflicts to terrorist attacks—were often
10

Global Risks 2020

addressed through cooperative institutions
and in ways that sought to minimize
interruptions to cooperation for global
economic progress. And some have argued
that greater economic interconnectedness
and interdependence in the last 20 years—
fostered by multilateral institutions—has
acted as a check on great power conflict.1
But new dynamics—in certain cases,
underlying forces that are the result of
progress over the last three decades—are
causing states to re-evaluate their approach
to geopolitics. Today’s emerging economies
are expected to comprise six of the world’s
seven largest economies by 2050.2 Rising
powers are already investing more in
projecting influence around the world.3 And
digital technologies are redefining what it
means to exert global power.4 As these trends
are unfolding, a shift in mindset is also taking
place among some stakeholders—from
multilateral to unilateral and from cooperative
to competitive. The resulting geopolitical

The challenge to these institutions is rooted
in concern within some societies about
globalized systems and mechanisms
of cooperation—what the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) dubs a “trust
recession”.5 According to the 2019 Edelman
Trust Barometer, just one in five people
believe “the system” is working for them.6

Global Risks 2020

While there was progress late last year
towards a “Phase One” US-China trade
deal,9 tensions between the two have
harmed the economies of both countries
and the global economic outlook as
well: the tensions could cost US$700
billion in lost output in 202010—almost
the amount of GDP lost by the entire
European Union due to the financial
crisis (US$757 billion between 2008 and
2009).11 The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)
warns, “Escalating trade conflicts are
taking an increasing toll on confidence and
investment, adding to policy uncertainty,
aggravating risks in financial markets
and endangering already weak growth
prospects worldwide.”12 Respondents to
the Global Risks Perception Survey do
not expect overall economic tensions
to cease—over 78% of them see
“economic confrontations” increasing
in 2020 (see Figure 1.1).

The environmental frontier
In late 2019, UN Secretary-General António
Guterres warned that a “point of no-return”
on climate change is “in sight and hurtling
toward us”.13 Respondents to the Forum’s
Global Risks Perception Survey also are
sounding the alarm. For the first time in
the history of the survey, climate-related
issues dominated all of the top-five longterm risks by likelihood among members
of the Forum’s multistakeholder community
(see Figure 1.2). And members of the
Global Shapers Community—the Forum’s
younger constituents—show even more
concern, ranking environmental issues as
the top risks in both the short and long
terms (see Figure III, The Global Shapers
Risk Landscape).
Yet, although immediate multilateral and
multistakeholder coordination is needed to
address global warming (see Chapter 3,
A Decade Left, and Chapter 4, Save the
Axolotl), global fracture—most recently
exhibited at the 2019 UN Climate Change
Conference COP25 in Madrid—and a
growth in nationalist policies risk preventing
meaningful action.14

dramatic effects of climate change—the

degradation, but by exploiting the region for
geostrategic advantage. The Arctic Council,
which for more than 20 years has served
as an important multilateral mechanism
for collaboration among the eight Arctic
States, is under stress. A new cold war is
developing as countries—including China,
Norway, Russia and the United States—
compete for fish, gas and other natural
resources; for the use of new shipping lanes;
and to establish a strategic footprint in the
region.15 Russia and China have prioritized
developing the Northern Sea Route, with
the latter dubbing its initiative the “Polar Silk
Road”.16 The U.S. Department of Defense
released its Arctic strategy in July; that
document did not mention climate change

but did present a strategy in which the
“end-state for the Arctic is a secure and
stable region in which U.S. national security
interests are safeguarded.”17

The digital frontier
Both sets of respondents to the Global Risks
Perception Survey—the multistakeholder
community and the Global Shapers—identify
cyber-related issues, such as cyberattacks
and data fraud or theft, within the list of top
10 long-term risks (see Figure 1.2). Indeed,
while the growth of digitalization offers
opportunities that can best be captured
through coordinated approaches among
stakeholders, it also creates areas in need
of coordinated solutions.
The Global Risks Report 2020

13

One such area is artificial intelligence (AI).
According to the UN’s International
Telecommunication Union, it will take
“massive interdisciplinary collaboration”
to unlock AI’s potential.18 But because
AI can also bring significant risk,
multilateral cooperation is needed to
address challenges such as security,
verification, “deepfake” videos, mass
surveillance and advanced weaponry.

confrontations” to

Despite the need for a common set of
global protocols, AI has become a new
frontier for competitive geopolitics. In
2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin
said, “Whoever becomes the leader in
this sphere will become the ruler of the
world.”19 China has strongly encouraged
companies to invest in AI, making it a
national security priority;20 AI is a pillar
of its current five-year plan (2016–2020)
for science and technology development
and its “made in China 2025” industrial
plan.21 In the United States, the Defense
Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence
Center recently requested that its budget
be tripled to US$268 million,22 citing the
rapid development of AI capabilities by
China and Russia as a reason for urgency.
There is some progress. Already,
stakeholders are coming together to
design shared protocols for AI. The World
Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth
Industrial Revolution has worked with the
government of the United Kingdom to
formulate guidelines for more ethical and
efficient procurement of AI. These guidelines
will be piloted in countries across Europe,
the Middle East and Latin America. And, in
May 2019, the OECD’s 36 member states
adopted Principles on AI—the first common
set of principles that governments have
adopted—to promote AI “that is innovative
and trustworthy and that respects human
rights and democratic values.”23 However,
14

challenges remain. Eleonore Pauwels of
the United Nations University Centre for
Policy Research warns that “the resurgence
of nationalist agendas across the world
may point to a dwindling capacity of the
multilateral system to play a meaningful role
in the global governance of AI.”24

A coming decoupling?
Geopolitical turbulence related to trade
tensions and technological rivalries is part
of a larger risk for the global community—
the risk of the United States and China
decoupling. Together, these two countries
account for over 40% of global GDP,25 and
they are the world’s leading innovators.26
They are also the world’s top two emitters
of greenhouse gases.27 Expanding the
global economy, addressing climate
change and realizing the full benefits of
technology, therefore, depend on their
ability to coordinate as part of a common
global system that is capable of including
other stakeholders.

and security have functioned over the
past three decades. Countries would
need to decide which economic system
to be part of—something many have
already said they do not want to do—
and businesses would have to develop
separate protocols.32
The decline of economic integration would
also remove what many see as a check
against outright conflict.

A need for adaptive
geopolitics

However, the trend today is not one in which
these two countries are just competing
across common domains but one in which
each is looking to design its own systems—
its own supply chains, 5G networks and
global investment institutions. Already
investment flows between the two have
dropped,28 each has moved to restrict
technology from the other,29 and some
analysts predict China will look to reduce
its dependence on the US dollar by holding
more foreign currencies.30
Even if the current trade tensions cool,
we risk heading towards an era in which
the two countries disentangle their
economies and create barriers between
one another. While leaders in Beijing and
Washington have expressed disapproval
of an economic decoupling, the policy
measures being put in place are paving a
road towards that destination.31
A return to a kind of cold war or iron curtain
economic landscape would fundamentally
change the way in which global business

As the outlines of the next geopolitical era
start to emerge, there is still uncertainty
about where the distribution of power
will settle and from where influence will
emanate, but a snap back to the old order
appears unlikely. If stakeholders attempt to
bide their time, waiting for the old system
to return, they will be ill-prepared for what
lies ahead and may miss the point at
which key challenges—economic, societal,
technological or environmental—can be
addressed. Instead, longstanding institutions
must adapt to the present and be upgraded
or reimagined for the future.
There are signs of adaptation in the
creation of new institutions designed
to function in this turbulent geopolitical
climate. One example is the Franco-German
“Alliance for Multilateralism”, a group of
nations working to boost international
cooperation in areas such as disarmament,
digitalization and climate change.33 Another
is the African Continental Free Trade
Agreement, which will bring together the
55 member states of the African Union to
form the largest free trade area since the
formation of the WTO.34 Narrower, issuespecific, ad-hoc “coalitions of the willing”
are proliferating—including Asian regional
trade and investment instruments, the
“Quad” (consultation among Australia,
India, Japan and the United States), and
the Global Coalition against Daesh. While
aiming to address collective priorities,
however, such adaptive approaches run
the risk of being less effective because
they lack the legitimacy of broad-based
multilateral institutions. Still, they point to
the need for continued coordination and
partnership during an unsettled time.

Fundamentals
Risks to Economic Stability and

REUTERS/STRINGER

REUTERS/STRINGER

Recent editions of the Global Risks Report
have warned of downward pressure on the
global economy from macroeconomic
fragilities and financial inequality. These
pressures continued to intensify in 2019,
increasing the risk of economic stagnation.
Low trade barriers, fiscal prudence and
strong global investment—once seen as
fundamentals for economic growth—are being

challenged as leaders advance nationalist
policies and citizens’ discontent hardens with
systems that have failed to promote economic
advancement for all. A challenging economic
climate may persist: according to the Global
Risks Perception Survey, members of the
multistakeholder community see “economic
confrontations” and “domestic political
polarization” as the top risks in 2020.
19

The global economy is at risk of stagnation.
Rising trade barriers, lower investment and
high debt are straining economies around
the world. The margins for monetary and
fiscal stimuli are narrower than before
the 2008–2009 financial crisis, creating
uncertainty about how well countercyclical
policies will work. This uncertainty is
exacerbated by a tense geo-economic
and geopolitical landscape (see Chapter
1, Global Risks 2020), as well as by
domestic challenges. Profound citizen
discontent—born of disapproval of the way
governments are addressing economic and
social challenges—has sparked protests
throughout the world, potentially weakening
the ability of governments to take decisive
action should a downturn occur.

Economic risk factors are
compounding with
widespread domestic
discontent towards
economic systems
Macroeconomic risk factors
During the last decade, moderate but
stable growth has given way to what the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called a
“synchronized slowdown”—weakened growth
among the world’s economies.1 We cautioned
in last year’s Global Risks Report that a gradual
deceleration was underway, and the evidence
suggests that, since then, the slowdown of the
world economy has further materialized. By the
third quarter of 2019, six of the world’s largest
seven economies (Japan is the exception),
which together represent more than half of
global production, had decelerated. The outlook
is also precarious for other G20 economies.
Except for Indonesia and South Korea, these
economies are growing at a rate below 2%—
with Argentina and Mexico contracting in the
third quarter of 2019.2 These trends likely explain
why our multistakeholder community rated
“recession in a major economy” as the ninth
risk most likely to increase in 2020 (see Figure
1.1 in Chapter 1, Global Risks 2020).
20

The Fraying Fundamentals

Going forward, rising trade tensions, lower
investment, weak confidence and high debt
risk a prolonged slowdown of the world
economy. At the time of writing this report,
the IMF had lowered its last five estimates
of world output for 2019 and expected a
growth rate of 3.0%—a sharp decline from
3.6% in 2018 and the slowest since the 1.7%
contraction in 2009.3 For 2020, the IMF had
also downgraded its forecast from 3.7% to
3.4% (see Figure 2.1).

Trade tensions
“Economic confrontations between major
powers” is the most concerning risk for
2020, according to members of the Forum’s
multistakeholder community; this is the
same risk our multistakeholder network
rated as the top risk last year. It is clear why
short-term economic risks ranked high in
the Global Risks Perception Survey: global
trade, which for decades has been an
engine for growth, is slowing down. World
Trade Organization (WTO) data for the first
three quarters of 2019 shows that total
world merchandise trade decreased 2.9%
from the previous year (see Figure 2.2)—it
decreased in the world’s top ten traders.4
Reduced trade volumes are largely the
result of what the WTO has called
“historically high levels of trade restrictions”.5
The potential result, according to the IMF,
could be global growth slowing by 0.8
percentage points in 2020, should the
United States and China uphold existing
tariffs or implement new ones.6 While
progress was made in late 2019 between
the United States and China towards a
trade agreement, the effects of having
turned trade from an instrument of
cooperation to a weapon of rivalry
may persist.

Lower investment
Investment is indispensable for boosting
productivity. Globally, investment has been
affected by low expected returns, uncertainty
about economic policy in major economies,
and ongoing and emerging geopolitical
tensions (see Chapter 1, Global Risks 2020).
In our survey, “protectionism regarding trade
and investment” and “populist and nativist
agendas”—two major obstacles to the free
flow of foreign direct investment (FDI)—were
rated as the fifth and sixth risks most likely to
increase through 2020.

Like global growth, FDI remains lower than
it was before the 2008–2009 crisis. It has
decreased for the last three years. In 2018,
net FDI inflows were down 38% compared
to 2017, and less than half of the level they
were in 2015.7 The sharpest decline has
been in the euro area (see Figure 2.3), where
less appealing yields, lower production and
uncertainty surrounding Brexit have led net
FDI inflows to the region to fall to a record
low since the euro was adopted in 1999.8

Weak confidence
Business confidence, a precursor to
investment, has also deteriorated during 2019.
The Business confidence index—constructed
by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) using
production data and business sentiment to
anticipate future performance—signals that
the state of the global economy is expected
to worsen in the short term. At the time of
writing this report, the index had declined for

no-change threshold for the first time since
2016 and reaching a 10-year low in October
of last year (see Figure 2.4).9

High debt
Private and public debt has been accumulating
since the crisis. According to the IMF, the
global ratio of debt-to-GDP increased by
11 percentage points between 2009 and
2017. Across G20 economies, public debt is
expected to reach 90% of GDP in 2019—the
highest level on record—and to grow even
more, to 95% in 2024 (see Figure 2.5).10

As economic warning signs begin to

previously used to brake economic slides
may no longer be available. Financial

are creating uncertainty as to whether
conventional monetary and fiscal policy

The Fraying Fundamentals

Private debt has built up on the basis of
lower interest rates—particularly in China and
the United States, where more than 40% of
total private debt is located.11 In the second
quarter of 2019, non-financial corporate
debt reached 156% of GDP in China.12 In the
United States, non-financial corporate debt
reached 47% of GDP in the third quarter—
the highest level ever recorded—according
to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data.13
The IMF has listed “rising corporate debt
burdens” as a key vulnerability in the global
financial system.14

As the IMF has signalled, interest rate cuts
have helped boost growth, but they have also
fostered higher debt and riskier rent-seeking,
which affect financial market stability.15 In
2019, monetary policies worldwide saw
profound reversals, with most central banks
persistently cutting interest rates to very—
sometimes historically—low levels.16 In the
United States, after nine consecutive hikes
between 2015 and 2018, the Federal Reserve
lowered its target interest rate from 2.50%
in December 2018 to 1.75% currently.17 The
European Central Bank (ECB) cut its deposit

REUTERS/PRASHANT WAYDANDE

rate to a historic low of -0.50% in September
2019.18 The Bank of Japan’s deposit rate
has remained at -0.10% since February
2016.19 Such low rates raise concerns about
the soundness of banking systems. The
ECB has warned that decreasing profits are
challenging Europe’s banking sector;20 in the
second quarter of 2019, European banks
yielded an average return-to-equity of 7.0%,21
compared to 12.1% in the United States.22
The role and reach of monetary policies are
also challenged by wider factors such as
technological change, climate change and
rising inequality. Christine Lagarde, President
of the ECB, for example, announced a
“strategic review” of the ECB’s mandate to
preserve price stability to “address the major
changes that have taken place over the
course of the last 16 years”—when the last
such review was conducted.23

Fiscal constraints
The margin for fiscal stimulus in most of the
world’s main economies has narrowed, as
higher spending has reduced budget coffers.
Public debt in 15 of the 20 largest economies

has increased every year since the 2008–
2009 crisis.24 Researchers from the ECB
analysed four decades worth of data from
17 European countries and concluded that
fiscal stimuli may not be effective when
public debt is high.25
At the same time, tax rates have increased
across G20 economies—their average
maximum income tax rate has risen by
more than two percentage points since
2009, to 37.7%.26 Lowering tax rates could
be a potential stimulus measure, but strong
political and social pressure may arise as
these monies are often used for public
services that attempt to combat inequality.
Higher debt and economic stagnation help to
explain why “fiscal crises” are the top-rated
risk for businesses globally over the next
10 years—according to our Executive
Opinion Survey.27 In the current global
context, weak public finances have two
implications: they jeopardize whatever
remaining margin governments have to
address a recession, and they could
aggravate already hard-felt social tensions
The Global Risks Report 2020

23

(see 2019 Regional Risks for Doing
Business report).28 The world learned
from the European sovereign debt crisis
that drastic fiscal corrections and public
austerity measures can shrink the welfare
state with political and social consequences
that many governments would be neither
willing nor able to incur. However, if the
combination of a prolonged economic
slowdown and a public finance crisis
pressures governments into spending to
address citizens’ immediate needs, they will
be left with little margin for investment to
confront the slowdown.

Vulnerable societies
Compounding the economic risk factors that
are manifesting is a widespread domestic
discontent with current economic systems,
perceived to be rigged and unfair.

Recent social upheaval
Concern about inequality underlies recent
social unrest on almost every continent,
although it may be sparked by different
tipping points—such as corruption,
constitutional breaches, or the rise in prices
for basic goods and services. Although
global inequality has declined over the past
three decades, domestic income inequality
has risen in many countries—particularly
in advanced economies—and reached
historical highs in some.29 The OECD reports
that “income inequality in OECD countries is
at its highest level for the past half century.”30
Many of those protesting have long been
excluded from their country’s wealth and
share frustration that the elite have captured
gains at the expense of others.
In Chile, for example, a 3% increase
in metro fares triggered violent
demonstrations, forcing the government

The Fraying Fundamentals

Economic growth, political will and social
stability are fundamental for a model of
“stakeholder capitalism”
to change its policy. Chile is one of the
fastest growing and most stable Latin
American economies, and it is becoming
less unequal: its Gini coefficient—the most
widely used measure of income inequality—
fell from 0.57 in 1990 to 0.47 in 2017.
Nonetheless, it still has the second highest
Gini coefficient among OECD members,
well above the OECD average of 0.32.31
In Hong Kong, the recent months-long
demonstrations on political issues have
also been aggravated by inequality: at 0.54,
Hong Kong’s Gini coefficient is at its highest
level in 45 years, significantly above those
of China (0.39) or the United States (0.42).
As Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng have
argued, “a powerful, but oft-ignored factor
underlying the frustrations of Hong Kong’s
people is inequality.”32
In Lebanon, where the Gini coefficient is
0.51, nation-wide protests were triggered
by the government’s decision to impose
a tax on the popular communication app
WhatsApp. In Iraq, protests began in
October—mostly led by people from the
disenfranchised working class and middleincome groups—over issues of corruption,
unemployment and demands for access to
basic public services.

Economic and political consequences
Inequality hinders growth and damages
macroeconomic fundamentals, as the IMF
has pointed out: it slows down economic
activities and casts doubt on a country’s
stability.33 This damages investor confidence
and undermines political capital—both
fundamental conditions for prosperity,
especially in times of economic volatility.
In France, for example, the persistence of
the “gilets jaunes” movement had caused
businesses more than US$11.4 billion in
losses by December 2019 and complicated
the government’s plans for economic revival.
At the time of writing this report, growth in
France was expected to slow from 1.7% in
2018 to 1.3% in 2020.34 The protests in Chile
cost businesses over US$1.4 billion and

forced the government to cancel the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and
COP25 summits scheduled to take place in
Santiago.35 Hong Kong’s economy contracted
by 3.2% in the third quarter of 2019, with the
Government Economist stating that “local
social incidents dealt [it] a very severe blow”.36
The profound political consequences of
inequality can also undermine economic
growth by making a country harder to
govern—in ways ranging from legislative
impasses to complete government
paralysis. This risk is accentuated by the
decentralized and spontaneous nature
of recent demonstrations: with pop-up
protests, it is difficult for governments to
negotiate with demonstrators and develop
concrete measures to meet their demands.
During 2019, distinctive issues exacerbated
by inequality forced the reshuffling of the
entire presidential cabinet in Chile and the
resignation of the heads of state in Bolivia,
Iraq and Lebanon.
According to our expert community,
“domestic political polarization” is the second
risk most likely to increase in 2020—up from
ninth in 2019. Our global business community
also ranked “failure of national governance”
as the sixth most concerning risk for doing
business over the next 10 years.

Stakeholder capitalism
The World Economic Forum has argued
since 1970 for the need to consider social
well-being alongside economic gains.
Unless the global economic system is
reformed to be more socially conscious,
the twin risks of prolonged slowdown and
stronger defiance towards the current
economic model will continue to exacerbate
each other. Economic growth, political will
and social stability will be fundamental to
ensure a prompt and smooth transition to
a more cohesive and sustainable model of
“stakeholder capitalism”.37

A
Decade
Left
Confronting Runaway
Climate Threat
REUTERS/LUCAS JACKSON

Geopolitical and economic strains
discussed in previous chapters could
compromise efforts across many realms,
including and especially one in which we
simply cannot afford failure: climate change.
Indeed, “failure of climate-change mitigation
and adaption” is this year’s number one
long-term risk by impact and number

two by likelihood, according to survey
respondents. This chapter takes stock
of the planetary risks of a warming climate
and assesses the capacities of government,
business and societies to face the urgent
and existential challenge of both mitigating
and adapting to climate change in the
coming decade.
29

Governments, markets and, in an increasing
number of societies, voters are awakening
to the urgent realities of climate change—it
is striking harder and more rapidly than
many expected.1 The last five years are on
track to be the warmest on record.2 Climaterelated natural disasters such as hurricanes,
droughts and wildfires are becoming more
intense and more frequent, reportedly now
averaging a disaster a week.3 Polar ice is
melting more quickly than anticipated,4 with
drastic implications for sea levels and coastal
populations.5 Severe weather is worsening:
the last year witnessed unprecedented
wildfires and devasting storms across the
globe,6 sea ice loss in the Arctic and recordbreaking heatwaves in Europe.
Global temperatures today are slightly over
1°C above pre-industrial levels. On the current
trajectory set out in countries’ nationally
determined contributions (NDCs), which
remain largely unchanged in the wake of
the most recent UNFCCC Conference of
Parties in Madrid in December (COP 25),
that figure will rise to at least 3°C by the end
of the century.7 Because each additional
degree of warming will be proportionally
more destructive, the damage will accelerate
and be exponential. To avoid the most
severe economic, social and environmental
consequences, climate experts warn that the

temperature rise must be limited to 1.5°C.8
This equates to a remaining carbon budget of
less than 10 more years of emissions at their
current level.9

Climate realities
The near-term consequences of climate
change add up to a “planetary emergency”.10
Implications are catastrophic, wide-ranging
and intersecting. Worse still, the complexity
of the climate system means that some
impacts are still unknown. Established
risks include:

Loss of life
More and more species are becoming
extinct (see Chapter 4, Save the Axolotl).
Humans, too, will experience loss of life—
but potentially unequally. Women and
children are 14 times more likely than men
to die during natural disasters, which are
likely to intensify or become more frequent
because of climate change.11 The elderly
and infirm are also at higher risk.12 Climate
change will also lead to increased health
spillovers, burdening already stretched health
systems, particularly for the poorest and
most vulnerable, including in many low- and
middle-income countries,13 as explored in
Chapter 6, False Positive.

A Decade Left

Stress on ecosystems
Oceans are getting warmer, stormier
and more acidic, impacting the health of
sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral
reefs. As glaciers and ice sheets melt,
low-lying geographies will flood;14 indeed,
by 2050, three times more people will be
impacted than previously thought.15 This
risk was explored in detail in the 2019
Global Risks Report chapter Fight or
Flight, which examined the intersection of
rapid urbanization and rising sea levels.
Additionally, a scenario in which ice-cap
melt creates disruption to the Gulf Stream
could cause further ecosystem disorder,
as well as major change in the pattern of
severe weather perils. Another significant
unknown risk relates to the potential thawing
of permafrost—frozen soil around the poles
that stores nearly twice as much carbon as
the atmosphere currently holds.16 If the soil
thaws, this carbon could be released with
unprecedented consequences.

Food and water crises
Crop yields will likely drop in many
regions, undermining the ability to double
food production by 2050 to meet rising
demand. Because agriculture, livestock and
deforestation produce nearly a quarter of
global emissions, more efficient use of land
is critical; it’s also one of the best potential
carbon sequestration options.17 Water
scarcity will increase as well—it already
affects a quarter of the world’s population.18

Increased migration
From 2008 to 2016, over 20 million people
a year have been forced from their homes
by extreme weather such as floods, storms,
wildfires and hotter temperatures.19 Tropical
Cyclone Idai, for example, displaced nearly
150,000 people in March 2019.20 Rising sea
levels will increasingly create refugees as people
flee low-lying areas. Indeed, defence and
intelligence agencies are now regularly warning
that climate change could trigger conflicts
severe enough to uproot entire populations.

Exacerbation of geopolitical tensions
Countries will face more potential points
of contention as climate change reshapes
the security of and access to historic
common property resources, such as
fishing waters.21 Melting sea ice could
enable new shipping routes through the
Arctic, as well as opportunities for natural

resource extraction,22 all of which could
cause tension between countries already
at odds over unresolved maritime and land
boundaries (see Chapter 1, Global Risks
2020).23 According to the UN, water was
a major factor in conflict in 45 countries
in 2017; disputes between upstream and
downstream areas will likely intensify.24
And as transition to a more decentralized,
renewable energy economy changes
geopolitical equations and creates new
vulnerabilities for certain states and regions,
states’ relative position in the international
system will shift as well.25

damage from natural disasters in 2018

Economic impacts
Worldwide economic stress and damage
from natural disasters in 2018 totalled
US$165 billion, and 50% of that total was
uninsured.26 A report by federal agencies
suggests that, in the United States alone,
climate-related economic damage could
reach 10% of gross domestic product (GDP)
by the end of the century.27 Over 200 of the
world’s largest firms estimated that climate
change would cost them a combined total
of nearly US$1 trillion in the case of nonaction. At the same time, there is broad
recognition among these same firms that
there are significant economic opportunities,
provided the right strategies are put in
place.28 Countries will also experience losses
unequally, with the highest economic costs
being felt by large economies, while risk of
exposure, death and non-economic costs is
higher in smaller, poorer economies.29

Capital market risks
Central banks increasingly see climate
change as a systemic risk to the global
capital market and recognize that

role in developing low-carbon alternatives for iron,
steel, glass and cement.

Mining and metals. The solar industry will
increase demand for aluminium. Copper,
lithium and cobalt demand will increase
multiple times by 2040.

Across many sectors, technological change is
already transformative and, in moving towards
lower carbon technologies, risks could include
stranding assets, reducing investment returns
and reducing market capitalization.

Mobility. The shift from fossil
fuels to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, fully
electric and hydrogen fuel cells is
already well underway.
Energy. The shift from oil
to gas, electrification,
renewables, nuclear and
hydrogen will require novel
storing technologies and
reforms in the production
of hydrogen.

Economic

Transition to a low-carbon economy
raises profound issues around the
future job market, health and safety,
and the broader fate of
communities. For both investors
and workers, transitioning quickly,
effectively and equitably will be this
generation’s challenge.

A dramatic shift in the price of carbon—broadly seen as necessary to tackle climate
change—implemented in a short time frame without taking into account wider economic and
equity issues could be viewed as a politically unpalatable transition risk for many decision-makers.
This is particularly the case given economic vulnerabilities already in place such as high debt,
negative interest rates, rising income inequalities and elevated geopolitical risks. International
initiatives such as the Carbon Pricing Leaders Coalition and national bi-partisan coalitions like the
Climate Leadership Council in the United States are working on practical solutions—such as
reallocating dividends from carbon pricing and adjusting border taxes—to these challenges. More
comprehensive transition policy packages, which recognize these economic transition risks, such
as the European Green New Deal, are also being explored.

non-action is not an option.30 More common
extreme weather events could make
insurance unaffordable or simply unavailable
for individuals and businesses:31 globally,
the “catastrophe protection gap”—what
should be insured but is not—reached
US$280 billion in 2018.32 The transition
to a low-carbon economy also creates
potential challenges that will need to be
managed. For example, action to reduce
emissions could turn approximately 30% of
32

current oil reserves, 50% of gas reserves
and 80% of coal reserves into stranded
assets for extractive companies and their
investors (see Box 3.1).33 Pension funds may
face catastrophic shortfalls as industries
consolidate and transition.34 Climate risk
may also cause disruption to the mortgage
market, particularly in vulnerable regions
such as Florida where 30-year mortgages
could default en masse if homes become
uninsurable over time.35

Trade, labour and supply
chain disruption
Climate change will affect trade by distorting
prices and disrupting supply chains.36 For
example, with the Artic sea ice melting at
a record pace, a northern route through
once-impassable waters has “emerged as
a potential global shipping artery.”37 Shifts
in seasonable temperature and rainfall will
place particular stress on economies reliant
on agricultural output,38 creating new winners
and losers in the trade sphere.39 The labour
force will experience impacts as well, and
not only in the structural transition to a lowcarbon economy: for example, heat stress
resulting from global warming is projected to
cause productivity losses equal to 80 million
full-time jobs in 2030.40

At a crossroads
For the future of climate change mitigation,
2020 is a critical year: it presents the
first opportunity for nations to revise
their national plans to tackle climate
change as set out under the 2015 Paris
Climate Agreement, and to close the gap
between what they have pledged and
what is needed. An increasing number of
governments are announcing long-term
net-zero emissions goals and showing
more interest in tackling outstanding
challenges in developing potential lowcarbon solutions. These include creating
a low-carbon hydrogen supply chain at
scale; reducing emissions through carbon
capture, use and storage; managing the
intermittency of renewables with grid-scale
storage solutions; electrifying domestic
and commercial heating; better recycling
of electric car batteries; and mapping out
the future availability of the raw materials
needed to support the transition.
Nonetheless, achieving significant change
in the near term will depend on greater
commitment from major emitters. Failure to
seize 2020’s opportunity to mitigate climate
change will have three main consequences.
First, transition risks will increase (Box 3.1).
Further delay in reducing emissions will make
it harder to achieve carbon budget goals:
companies and markets will ultimately be
forced to adjust more rapidly, which could
lead to higher costs, greater economic

disruptions, or draconian interventions
from panicked policy-makers that imperil
macroeconomic and financial instability.
Communities will also suffer if jobs are lost
without well-thought-through and equitable
transition plans in place.
Over 40 central banks and supervisors are
already examining how climate risks can be
integrated into their economic and financial
activities.41 The Bank of England has warned
that corporations in incumbent “dirty”
industries can expect to go bankrupt if they
fail to understand the risk of their business
models becoming obsolete as investment
flees to net-zero-emission alternatives.42
The Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
announced recommendations in 2017
that have driven boardroom discussions
regarding financial exposures and transition
strategies.43 Now supported by almost 900
companies, assessing financial risk of climate
change is becoming more mainstreamed.44
Governments are also moving towards
mandatory disclosure of climate risks by
listed companies.45 The investor community
is also responding to climate risk, with a
recent notable development being the launch
of the UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owners
Alliance at the 2019 United Nations Climate
Action Summit.46

Climate change is striking
harder and more rapidly than
many expected
Second, the risk of unilateral geoengineering
gambles will become more likely. Failure
to implement effective regional or global
climate policies increases the risk that
countries may decide unilaterally to
implement geoengineering projects such
as ocean fertilization or stratospheric aerosol
injection. This would risk further disruption
to ecosystems: one recent study, for
example, found that stratospheric sulphate
aerosols could harm agricultural production,
cancelling out benefits from the reduction
in warming.47
The Global Risks Report 2020

33

And lastly, and perhaps most vital, is the
risk that the specific multilateral process
mandated to address climate change loses
momentum and action on climate stalls.
For example, the recent failure at COP25
to develop a rule book for a new global
carbon market means there is not yet a
credible system that would allow countries
to pay each other for projects that reduce
emissions. The risk here is not simply that
we lose an unaffordable five years, but
that the perception of failure drains more
political support from the multilateral process
and undermines the prospects for future
progress. However, encouraging steps
are already being taken by various new
geometries of governments, companies,
investors, sub-national entities and civil
society working together on key areas of
climate action, such as the energy and
industry transition, the mobilization of finance
and agriculture, and nature-based solutions.
These multistakeholder efforts to advance
climate action, as highlighted at the 2019 UN
Climate Action Summit, are becoming an
increasingly important component of
the international response. They are also

helpful mechanisms to bolster political
confidence that climate change can be
successfully tackled.

Can societies deliver?
Climate and corresponding economic risks
threaten a 2008-style systemic collapse,48
unless net human-caused carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions fall by 50% by 2030
relative to 2010, and to net zero by 2050.
Reaching these targets will require serious,
interconnected economic and societal
transitions at macro and micro levels
that depend on technological innovation
and commitment from governments and
businesses. So far, however, commitments are
inadequate given the urgency of the challenge
and current trends are not encouraging.
Most critically, demand for energy is
continuing to increase and much of this
demand is still being met by fossil fuels.
Global energy demand rose by 2.3% in
2018, the fastest pace in a decade.49 China,
the United States and India account for
nearly 70% of the rise. Energy demand is
expected to grow even further—by over
25% by 2040—driven by population growth,
increasing incomes and urbanization: in
developing economies, 1.7 billion people are
expected to move to urban areas in the next
two decades.50
There is a clear tension between calls to green
society and the drive, particularly in emerging
markets, to boost economic growth through
investment in carbon-heavy projects such
as roads, dams, energy resources, mines
and ports. For example, coal power plants
built in Asia in the last decade accounted for
nearly one-third of the total increase in CO2
emissions in 2018.51 Global annual subsidies
for fossil fuels are approximately double those
for renewable power.52
Beyond power generation, shifts in patterns
of land use and how we manage our global
food systems are also needed to reduce
carbon emissions: agriculture, deforestation
and wetlands development contribute 23%
of all human-caused greenhouse gases.53
Many current food and land use investment
portfolios are often not consistent with
delivering even a warming scenario.54
Transitioning our carbon-based global

A Decade Left

agriculture system to practices such as
regenerative farming would require radical
shifts in subsidies and investment. Similarly,
about 10% of global emissions comes
from the very high heat levels required to
produce commodities—such as cement,
steel and petrochemicals—and, although
low-carbon alternatives do exist, they are
currently costly.55 New public-private initiatives
such as the Mission Possible Platform,
launched at the UN Climate Action Summit in
September 2019, are designed to help heavy
industry sectors achieve net-zero emissions
by mid-century through collaboration with
governments, international organizations
and investors.
Although there are financing roadmaps for
green energy, there are serious financing
gaps for overall plans to mitigate and adapt
to climate change. The UN estimates
that, to meet 2030 goals for adaptation,
developing countries will need US$140 to
US$300 billion annually—much higher than
currently available adaptation financing.56
Moreover, investments in climate-related
activities largely stay within wealthy nations’
borders.57 Only 49 developing countries
have quantifiable climate-financing targets,
and few of them look further than 2020,
rendering them largely irrelevant to climate
risks beyond this horizon.58
Aside from a number of vanguard firstmover champions, most companies, too,
appear ill-equipped to address climate risk.
Many do not yet quantify physical climate
risks in their direct operations and supply
chains, and those that do are likely to be
underestimating them significantly.59 In the
World Economic Forum’s survey of business
leaders, none of the top 10 risks globally are
environmental, suggesting a critical blind
spot.60 On the other hand, those business
leaders who are more exposed to climate
change discussions among their peers
become more aware of climate risks and
thus become more likely to act. For example,
industry partners of the World Economic
Forum ranked environmental risks higher
than business leaders surveyed more
broadly.61 This awareness and concern for
environmental risks is also likely influenced
by other business organizations that focus
on helping their members tackle climate
and other related issues, demonstrating
the importance of these networks and

organizations.62 Overall, lack of consistent
awareness-raising among business leaders
may create first-mover advantages for some,
but it also potentially demonstrates the
much more concerning overarching risk: that
many businesses may not be planning for
the physical and financial risks that climate
change may have on their activities and
across their value chains.

Consequently, businesses may also struggle
to anticipate future shifts in government
policy and customer preferences in time
to align their strategy—for example, the
rapid rise in consumer demand for nonplastic packaging took companies by
surprise. Increasing pressure to respond is
generating transition risk at the individual
company level as each company needs to
reassess assets, reconcile trade-offs and
develop new capabilities to move towards
a more sustainable model. At the same
time, there is growing acknowledgement
among some critical financial-sector players
that environmental risks could threaten the
broader economic outlook, which could be a
sign of more positive shifts moving forward.63

A green social contract
Concern about climate change is increasing,64
particularly among young people, and
this could alter the paths societies take in
confronting the challenge. Political winds are
shifting: in 2019 climate change underpinned
the Greens’ surge in the European
Parliament elections;65 it also emerged as
a key policy issue in the US Democratic
presidential primaries and in elections in
Australia, Canada and Switzerland.66 Most
recently, the European Commission, led by
President Ursula von der Leyen, announced
a broad set of plans—the “European Green
Deal”—that is intended to re-evaluate the
European economy in light of environmental
risks.67 Climate activism also increased in
2019. The non-violent civil disobedience
The Global Risks Report 2020

35

Alongside the risks, the next decade
brings tremendous opportunity
movement Extinction Rebellion became
more mainstream, with groups forming in
72 countries.68 More remarkably, millions
of schoolchildren participated in organized
“climate strikes”.69
In the long term, the mobilization of
youth could lead to a new green social
contract reordering political and business
life, as today’s striking children gradually
become tomorrow’s voters, workers,
investors and consumers. Politicians will
seek to attract them through policies such
as the Green New Deal legislation that
has been proposed in the United States.
As today’s youth demand jobs that are
compatible with their concern about climate
change, workforce climate activism may
become more common,70 and companies
without strong environmental credentials
could struggle for talent.71 Lastly, as
consumers, the new generation of climate

In the short term, however, many current
voters may be unwilling to support transition
policies: in an age of economic anxiety and
uncertainty, there is also concern about the
implications for cost of living, jobs and the
competitiveness of high-carbon sectors. This
concern may pitch voters against climate
action or make their support for climate
policies ambiguous. For example, polling
before Canada’s election found that many
voters who identified climate change as a
key concern were nevertheless reluctant to
bear any cost to tackle it.73 And Australia’s
“climate change election”—which took place
before the recent wildfires—resulted in an
unexpected victory for a coalition opposed to
aggressive action.74
New political and social dynamics (or
events such as dramatic natural disasters
that can be climate-related) may be making
available the policy space to embark on
the radical trajectory needed to mitigate
drastic warming. But building broadbased support for climate policies that
can meet the Paris Agreement’s goals
will require convincing voters that a just
transition is possible. Policies that provide
for social protection programmes and
job training could help to limit disruption
and exacerbation of socio-economic
inequalities in the transition to a lowcarbon economy.

crusaders will make more sustainable
lifestyle choices, such as eating plant-based
diets or flying less, and demand more lowcarbon goods.72

A Decade Left

2010

2015

The next 10 years will shape the outlook
for climate risk for the rest of the century.
To avoid the worst consequences, global
emissions need to peak almost immediately
and decline precipitously—by 7.6% each
year between 2020 and 2030.75 This
implies an additional US$460 billion a year
of clean energy investment over the next

decade.76 Far-reaching policies will be
needed to transform industrial
processes, transport, agriculture and
land-use, alongside changes in consumer
behaviours to scale the necessary
critical solutions.77
As policies shift and societies transition,
options must be assessed holistically
because disorderly transition could
potentially exacerbate impacts with shortsighted responses. For example, materials
needed for low-carbon technologies such
as nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese
could be mined from the seabed—but the
impacts of deep-sea mining on ecosystems
and ocean health could offset its benefits.78
Likewise, the deployment of bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage could require
up to 700 mega hectares (an area twice
the size of India) for bioenergy crops by the
end of the century 79—and at a time when
the global population may have reached
nearly 11 billion people. Converting such
large swaths of land to monocultures has
clear consequences for food production
and nature. Geopolitical relationships will
shift as trade in fossil fuels becomes less
economically important.
Alongside the risks, the next decade brings
tremendous opportunity; technological
breakthroughs are happening all the time.
For example, most recently, a start-up
announced it had developed a way to
harness artificial intelligence and mirrors
reflecting the sun to create the extreme
heat required for industrial processes—a
potential game-changer for the source of
around 10% of global emissions each year.80
Clean energy is increasing (see Figure 3.1)
while also getting cheaper and creating
jobs. The cost per unit of electricity from
onshore wind and photovoltaic solar power
plants has dropped by about 70% and 90%
respectively over the last decade.81 In most
countries, it is now cheaper to install new
wind or solar power stations than new coal
power plants.82 The International Renewable
Energy Agency estimates that shifting to
renewables could grow the world economy
by 1% a year until 2050, a cumulative gain
of over US$52 trillion (see Figure 3.1).83
Other industries, such as agriculture
through regenerative growing practices, and
food production through meat alternatives,
carry still-untapped potential.

New political and social dynamics may now
also be creating the policy space available to
embark on the radical trajectory needed to
mitigate drastic warming. At the same time,
adaptation needs to be given urgent priority,
not only to prepare for the possibility of very
dangerous levels of climate change in the
future, but also to eliminate the resilience
deficit we face today. A series of important
initiatives—such as the report from the
Global Commission for Adaptation, the
Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment,
and the Just Rural Transition—were launched
in 2019 at the UN Climate Action Summit
as a package of measures on resilience.84
These initiatives aim to ensure infrastructure
investment, spark innovation on adaptation
and set out a principles for a just transition,
among other goals.
The 2020s—the decade of delivery for the
Sustainable Development Goals—needs to
also be the resilience decade for climate.
Concerted action is required not only to
reduce emissions, but also to develop
credible adaptation strategies, including
climate-proofing infrastructure, closing the
insurance protection gap and scaling up
public and private adaptation finance. This
will require governments and businesses
to identify and prioritize risks and develop
metrics and strategies to manage them.85

Dangers of Accelerated Biodiversity Loss
REUTERS/BRUNO KELLY

Human-driven nature and biodiversity loss
is threatening life on our planet. The previous
chapter assessed where the world stands
in 2020 in the face of existential climate risk.
This chapter considers the other side of the
same coin: how destabilizing tipping points in

nature could exacerbate the social
and economic consequences of climate
risk. At the same time, understanding
nature’s benefits could help societies
leverage opportunities to stem the
planetary emergency.

The axolotl, arguably one of the world’s most recognizable salamanders, has a unique ability to regenerate severed
limbs, which unlocks medicinal and scientific opportunities for everything from tissue repair to development and
cancer. After centuries of inbreeding, captive populations are at risk and scientists could lose the opportunity to
learn vital information about the animal’s biology that could have significant benefits for human health.1

On the loss of species
All species, including humans, depend for
their survival on the delicate balance of life
in nature.2 Yet biodiversity—the diversity
within species, between species, and within
ecosystems—is declining faster than it has
at any other time in human history.3 The
current rate of extinction is tens to hundreds
of times higher than the average over the
past 10 million years—and it is accelerating.4
Although the world’s 7.6 billion people
represent just 0.01% of all living creatures,
humanity has already caused the loss of
83% of all wild mammals and half of plants.5
If low estimates of the number of species
are accurate—around 2 million—between
200 and 2,000 extinctions are occurring
every year. At the upper end of the estimate,
between 10,000 and 100,000 species are
going extinct each year.6 How we grow

food, produce energy, dispose of waste and
consume resources is destroying nature’s
delicate balance of clean air, water and life
that all species—including humans—depend
on for survival.7
Human activity endangers biodiversity in at
least five main ways.8 First, agricultural and
industrial expansion has led to the loss of
over 85% of wetlands, altered 75% of land
surface, and impacted 66% of ocean area.
A second powerful threat is in the
exploitation of plants and animals through
harvesting, logging, hunting and fishing.
Third, pollution: habitats are being destroyed
by untreated waste; by pollutants from
industrial, mining and agricultural activities;
and by oil spills and toxic dumping. Marine
plastic pollution alone has increased
tenfold since 1980. A fourth critical driver
of biodiversity loss is the introduction of

Biodiversity is declining faster than it has
at any other time in human history
non-indigenous species that edge out
native ones; this has increased by 40%
globally over the same period. Fifth, climate
change exacerbates nature loss, which in
turn reduces nature’s resilience to climate
change—a vicious circle.9
Less directly, losses of biodiversity are
driven by population growth, trade,
consumption patterns and urbanization.10
By 2030, cities are expected to cover three
times as much land as they did in 2000, with
many of the expansions occurring in key
biodiversity hotspots.11 Inadequate export
controls have facilitated the spread of invasive
species, pests and diseases, which aggravate
a quarter of plant extinctions and a third of
animal ones.12 Demand for food will more
than double by 2050; meeting this demand
will require an additional billion hectares
of land—an area the size of Canada13—or
increasing yields on existing land through the
use of fertilizers and pesticides, which also
contribute to biodiversity loss.

Implications for humanity
The dramatic loss of biodiversity brings
serious risks for societies, economies
and the health of the planet. Sir Robert
Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services (IPBES),14 observes:
“Biodiversity and nature’s contributions to
people sound, to many people, academic
and far removed from our daily lives.
. . . Nothing could be further from the
truth—they are the bedrock of our food,
clean water and energy.”15 Humans rely
on biodiversity in fundamental ways,
from pollinating crops to curing diseases.
Biodiversity loss has also come to threaten
the foundations of our economy: one
attempt to put a monetary value on goods
and services provided by ecosystems
estimates the worth of biodiversity at US$33
trillion per year—close to the GDP of the
United States and China combined.16 Risks
arising from biodiversity loss include:

Food insecurity
Biodiversity underpins the world’s food
system.17 It creates and maintains healthy
soils, pollinates plants, purifies water and
protects against extreme weather events,
among other vital services.18 The ongoing
loss of diversity in indigenous domesticated
plants and animals is undermining the
resilience of agricultural systems against
pests, pathogens and climate change.19
Declining diversity of fish species is
correlated with lower catches and
higher incidence of stock
collapse.20 A new report
from the United Nations’
Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) identifies
another risk: increased
carbon-dioxide levels
are lowering the
nutritional value of
food staples such as
rice and wheat.21

Health risks
Well-functioning ecosystems support
human health by providing clean air and
water and a source of medicines.22 An
estimated 50,000–70,000 plant species
are harvested for traditional or modern
medicine,23 and around 50% of modern
drugs were developed from natural
products. Researchers are increasingly
“reverting to nature” to look for new
therapeutic options, efforts that are
threatened by biodiversity loss.24 Species
currently endangered by biodiversity loss
include the South American cinchona tree,
the source of the malaria drug quinine.25
In many cases, natural molecules for
medical treatments are so complex that
scientists are not yet able to chemically
synthesize them, so they must harvest and
store plants and seeds.26 Some threatened
organisms are critical for medical research:
the Mexican axolotl (described above), for
example, has unique characteristics that
enable instructive comparisons with the
human genome.27

crisis: these microscopic plants that drift
at the sea surface absorb carbon dioxide
on a scale comparable to the world’s
forests,29 and they are threatened by
warming oceans.30

Business risk
The destruction of nature will inevitably
impact bottom lines—for example,
through reduced fish stocks disrupting
commodity supply chains, economic
losses from disasters such as flooding,
and the loss of potential new sources
of medicine. Extractives, construction,
energy, fashion and textiles are among
the sectors especially vulnerable to
ecological destruction.31 All businesses
should account for ecological risks to their
operations and reputations, yet few do: a
recent study of Fortune 500 companies
found that nearly half mentioned biodiversity
in their sustainability reports, but only five
set specific, measurable and timebound
targets.32 Nature-related risks are
undervalued in business decision-making.

Exacerbation of climate change
Terrestrial and marine biodiversity together
support the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions and the conservation of carbon
sinks, sequestering 5.6 gigatonnes of
carbon per year—the equivalent of 60% of
global human-driven emissions. The health
of ecosystems that sequester carbon can
depend on individual species: for example,
endangered forest elephants are vital to
the health of Central Africa’s rainforests.
Collapse of this ecosystem could release
3 billion tons of carbon, the equivalent
of France’s emissions for 27 years.28
Phytoplankton provide another example
of how depletion of species and ecosystems
could exponentially worsen the climate

Indigenous community livelihood
and culture risks
Indigenous communities often rely on their
diverse local ecosystems for food and other
resources: for example, 60% of the world’s
indigenous population uses largely plantbased traditional medicines.33 And the rest of
humanity relies on indigenous communities
to be stewards of ecosystems, protecting
and preserving environmental resources.
Indigenous peoples comprise less than 5%
of the world’s population but protect 80% of
its biodiversity.34
Beyond these known risks are unknowable
losses—the risk of losing species we have
not yet discovered that could have been
domesticated for crops or given rise to new
medicinal breakthroughs. For example,
the ocean represents a “virtually untapped
resource for discovery of novel chemicals
with pharmaceutical potential,”35 and recent
bacterial samples from coastal sediments
grown under saline conditions have
yielded new antibiotic, antitumor and antiinflammatory compounds.36 Another recently
discovered ocean organism, a rare genus
of marine bacteria called Serinicoccus, was
shown to selectively destroy melanoma
cancer cells.37 With continued loss of
biodiversity, we may never know what we
have missed out on.

Imagine if ...
Many and varied ecosystems are in decline
or at risk of destruction from human activity.
While their complexity makes it very hard
to predict which losses would be most
consequential, it is clear the stakes are high.
Here we consider three potential ecosystem
collapses or extinctions that could have
profound impacts for humanity and the Earth.

Insect decline
A world without insects, according to one
entomologist, would be a “flowerless world
with silent forests, a world of dung and old
leaves and rotting carcasses accumulating
in cities and roadsides.”38 One recent study
estimates that insects have declined by
40% in recent decades (see Figure 4.1),
and a third are endangered.39 It identifies
deforestation, urbanization, pollution and
the widespread use of pesticides in
commercial agriculture as the principal

causes. Insects are the main food source
for many species higher in the food chain,
such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.
As the author of the study points out, “[if] this
food source is taken away, all these animals
starve to death.” 40
Insects are also the world’s top pollinators:
75% of the 115 top food crops rely on
animal pollination, including nutrient-rich
foods like fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds,
as well as cash crops such as coffee and
cocoa.41 Dwindling insect populations will
force farmers to seek alternative means of
pollination,42 or shift to staple crops that
do not rely on pollinators. However, these
crops—such as rice, corn, wheat, soybeans
and potatoes—are often energy-dense,
nutrient-poor and already over-consumed
globally, contributing to an epidemic of
obesity and diet-related disease.43 Increasing
their prevalence in the food supply at the
expense of fruits, nuts, vegetables and seeds
could exacerbate this global health crisis (see
Chapter 6, False Positive).
Approximately 1 million insect species have
been documented, but “untold millions await
discovery.”44 As with the broader community
of species discussed above, it is impossible
to know what humanity could lose from the
extinction of insect species that are not yet
known to science.

Coral reef collapse
Coral reefs are home to some of the planet’s
most biodiverse ecosystems. They are
critical to ocean health: although they make
up less than 1% of the ocean floor, 25% of
fish species rely on reefs for at least part
of their life cycle.45 Ocean reefs contribute
to the livelihoods of at least 500 million
people worldwide, mostly in less-developed
economies.46 Coral reefs generate US$36
billion per year for the global tourism industry,
with the Great Barrier Reef in Australia
accounting for more than 15% of that total
(US$5.7 billion).47 They provide vital protection
from coastal flooding and storm surges: one
recent study found that losing just the top
layer of coral could result in US$4 billion more
in flood damages per year.48
50

Save the Axolotl

Coral reefs are threatened partly by
overfishing, industrial activity and pollution,
but even more by the planet’s rapid warming.
When the water surrounding them becomes
too warm, corals expel the algae living within
the tissue of the reef, turning the corals
white—also known as “coral bleaching”.
If corals are bleached for prolonged periods,
they will die. A recent study found that
severe marine heatwaves can lead not just
to bleaching, but also to the immediate
death of reefs.49 If global temperatures
stabilize at an increased 1.5°C, coral reefs
could decline by 70% to 90%; with higher
rises, they would disappear.50
The disappearance of coral reefs could
have dire consequences for life on land

as well as in the ocean. Up to 80% of the
oxygen humans breathe comes from the
ocean.51 Without reefs, coastal communities
would be more vulnerable to storms,
and migration away from low-lying
population centres and islands could
increase. As the oceans “become largely
lifeless or at least extremely transformed”,52
the fishing and tourism industries could be
wiped out. In some regions, collapsing fish
stocks could increase security risks, such
as piracy and terrorism.53

Disappearance of the Amazon
Around 12 million hectares of tropical forest
worldwide were lost in 2018, equivalent to
30 football fields per minute.54 The Amazon
alone has lost approximately 17% of its
size over the last 50 years, and rates of
deforestation have been rising since 2012.55
The Amazon now absorbs around a third
less carbon than it did a decade ago,56 and
a recent study found that increasing dryness
in the atmosphere is leaving ecosystems
even more vulnerable to fire and drought.57
The rapid disappearance of more of the
rainforest could exacerbate the effects of
climate change: if 20% to 25% of the forest is
lost, scientists warn that the Amazon could
pass a tipping point where a vicious cycle
of drought, fire and canopy loss takes hold
that cannot be stopped. This tipping point
could be reached within decades.58 The
destruction of the forests of Borneo offer an
ominous precedent: mass deforestation and
fires there have led to the loss of over 50% of
lowland tropical rainforest.59
Because the Amazon is the world’s most
diverse ecosystem and home to about 10%
of terrestrial species,60 its destruction means
potentially undiscovered cures for disease
would be lost forever. More intense fires
and flooding in the region, as well as more
unpredictable rainfall patterns and droughts,
could also ensue. This would undermine
food production, increase water scarcity
and reduce hydropower generation, with
economic costs exceeding US$3 trillion.61
Global agricultural markets might suffer
as well,62 since Brazil is one of the world’s
largest agricultural exporters of products
including soybeans, maize and meat. A
significant decline in Brazil’s agricultural
output could increase volatility of food
prices, which history shows can trigger
instability and contribute to long-term

deteriorations in security. Indigenous
communities who rely on the rainforest
would struggle and possibly disappear. The
tourism industry, critical for South American
economies, could be badly affected.

No silver bullet
The UN declared 2010 to be the International
Year of Biodiversity. Notwithstanding the
appearance of biodiversity as a top risk by
both likelihood and impact on the GRPS (see
Figure II, The Global Risks Landscape 2020),
10 years later, general confusion persists
about what precisely biodiversity is, why
it relates to human prosperity and how to
confront its loss. Achievement of the Aichi
Biodiversity Targets for 2020 has lagged.63
Since the targets were set in 2011, global
production of metals, minerals, fossil fuels
and biomass has increased by more than
20%, while an area larger than Mexico has
been deforested.

breathe comes

Solutions to stemming biodiversity loss
will be as complex as the problem itself.
No longer can nature be protected by either
“sparing” (preserving areas of land where
species can thrive away from production)
or “sharing” (integrating processes where
nature and food production coexist).64 Both
approaches are required and both will
involve trade-offs: how should biodiversity
be weighed against social and economic
imperatives such as food production and
economic development? For example,
organic agriculture avoids the use of
harmful chemicals but might require more
land for comparable yields.65 Similarly, the
production of biofuels and bioenergy with
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a
potential game-changer for negative carbon
emissions.66 However, BECCS
also uses large swaths of agricultural
land, with implications for future socioeconomic developments, food security
and biodiversity management.
The Global Risks Report 2020

51

Bio-economic transitions would create
feedback loops that must also be
considered. For example, developing
climate-resistant crop varieties could
help farming systems adapt to a warming
planet—but deepening our reliance on a
handful of staple crops grown in largescale, intensive monoculture farming
systems could ultimately undermine the
resilience of the food system by reducing
genetic diversity and increasing vulnerability
to pests and disease.67 On a smaller scale,
urban tree-planting might actually result in
a net loss of street-tree carbon storage over
time because of the “unique demographics
of urban ecosystems”.68

70

Inequities in development trajectories that
characterize the climate debate are also
inherent in any coordinated response to
biodiversity loss. Certain
countries, for example,
may incur a stiffer penalty
for the protection of the
planet by virtue of their
geography and natural
resources. However,
conservation efforts do
not necessarily require
trade-offs in development
priorities or human rights.69
In fact, efforts to address
declining biodiversity ought
to be inextricably linked
to other social agendas,
such as poverty alleviation,
healthcare, disaster relief and protection
of human rights.70 It is vital to expand
discussion around biodiversity loss to include
researchers from non-empirical disciplines
as well as farmers, indigenous communities,
businesses and other stakeholders.

%

agricultural land
use accounted

sector

The new nature economy
While trade-offs may be unavoidable, there
are also potential “win-wins”. Consider diets.
The livestock sector accounts for 70% of
agricultural land use;71 it is also responsible
for about 14% of global greenhouse gas
emissions.72 Reducing meat consumption
would be good for nature and the climate. In
a growing number of countries it would be
good for people as well, as overconsumption
of meat could be leading to worse health
outcomes.73 Another win-win example is the
52

Save the Axolotl

circular economy, in which waste is designed
out and materials are kept in use for as long
as possible: besides helping to decouple
resource demand from economic growth,
this can contribute to lower emissions and
less habitat loss.
There is also a business rationale for
preserving or restoring natural ecosystems.74
On average, the costs of restoration are
outweighed tenfold by its benefits to
communities.75 Restoring coastal mangroves,
for example, can protect land from storm
surges and coastal erosion, develop fisheries
and support ecotourism. Investing in the
restoration of wetlands, mangroves and
coral reefs could reduce insurance costs
for businesses in coastal areas vulnerable
to flooding. Likewise, financing ecological
forestry practices could reduce insurance
costs for businesses, such as power and
water utilities, that are exposed to wildfire
risks.76 According to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), restoring 46% of the world’s
degraded forests could provide up to US$30
in benefits for every dollar spent, boosting
local employment and increasing community
awareness of biodiversity’s importance.77
A critical challenge for the biodiversity
agenda will be finding investment models
that mobilize private finance to capture a
share of this opportunity. New approaches
are emerging, such as resilience-financing
structures through which businesses can
invest in the restoration of ecosystems in
return for a reduction in insurance premiums
or risk-financing costs. Better data to track
the effectiveness of investments will be
critical. However, given the sums involved—
one estimate puts the current cost of
protecting biodiversity at US$100 billion per
year78—public funding will also be needed.
Habitat protection and restoration are highly
beneficial public goods for which government
investment is more than justified. The People’s
Bank of China, for instance, now offers capital
relief for banks that make green loans.79
The International Union for Conservation of
Nature is developing a species conservation
metric that will help companies, banks and
governments to quantify their contribution.80
A renewed interest in nature-based solutions
can help combat climate change as well as
mitigate the exacerbating effects of nature
loss on the climate.

Beyond policy interventions, stemming the
impacts of biodiversity loss may require
a fundamental shift in thinking about the
economic value of nature. Gross domestic
product (GDP), the primary performance
indicator for economies, fails to account for
“natural capital”—the stock of a country’s
ecosystems, natural resources and human
capital.81 Businesses, governments and
individuals would be better served by
another metric—or series of metrics—that
more accurately describes an economy’s
overall health, thus incorporating the costs
of ecosystem degradation. The Gaborone
Declaration for Sustainability in Africa, for
example, is encouraging member countries
to use metrics such as “ecosystem valuation”
and “natural capital accounting” in measuring
economic activity and decision-making.82
The most effective solutions may imply
significant disruption or shifts to existing
business models. For example, the fashion
industry could reduce its impacts on
biodiversity by shifting towards transforming
old clothes into new ones and creating
garments that are durable rather than
disposable—an opportunity worth US$560
billion.83 Extractive industries’ negative
impacts on biodiversity could be mitigated
if mining companies were to move to a
resource services model,84 in which the
companies retain ownership of metals over
their lifecycle and keep them in use for as
long as possible.

Later in 2020, governments will gather in
Kunming, China, to revisit global targets
on protecting ecosystems and halting
species loss. This is a critical moment: as
climate change exacerbates ecosystem
collapse, we could be causing irreversible
ecosystem damage with serious economic
and social consequences.85 Some of
the most serious impacts will not occur
gradually, but rather suddenly and violently,
as critical thresholds are breached.
Messaging around biodiversity loss and
its impacts is key to underscoring the
meaning and impact of biodiversity loss
for societies. Consumers also have a role
to play in demanding sustainable policymaking and products.
The rapid degradation of our life support
system means a lot more is needed. As
we find ourselves at the doorstep of the
“sixth mass extinction”, both businesses
and regulators have a huge role to play
in shifting paradigms about who pays for
the externalities created by business-asusual. The World Economic Forum will
be publishing the New Nature Economy
Report—to be released in three parts during
2020—setting out risks, key transformation
pathways and financing for a naturepositive economy. We have the science and
evidence required to pivot in this direction,
but there is an acute need for champions
who can shift systems and prioritize
investment for safeguarding nature.

Consequences of Digital Fragmentation
REUTERS/TOMAS BRAVO

Heightened geopolitical tensions discussed
in previous chapters also risk negatively
influencing the huge economic potential of the
next generation of technologies. The current
lack of global technology governance and the
presence of cybersecurity blind spots increase

the risk of a fragmented cyberspace and
competing technology regulations. This chapter
contemplates how a fragmented cyberspace
and differing technological standards
could hinder economic growth, exacerbate
geopolitical rivalries and further divide societies.
61

The 4IR: The new economy
More than 50% of the world’s population
is now online;1 roughly one million more
people join the internet each day.2
Two-thirds of humanity own a mobile
device.3 Fourth Industrial Revolution
(4IR) technologies are already bringing
tremendous economic and societal benefits
to much of the global population.
The next wave of 4IR technologies will
dramatically reshape economies and
societies. Precision medicine, autonomous
vehicles and drones are all fast-growing
markets (see Figure 5.1), while artificial
intelligence (AI) alone is expected to boost
global growth by 14% by 2030.4
Smart technologies have enormous potential
to improve both human life and the health
of the planet. For example, satellite-based
applications can aid rural farmers to irrigate
their crops efficiently.5 Prostheses can be
3D printed.6 Autonomous vehicles can
be employed by the elderly to support
better mobility.7 The Internet of Things (IoT)
can even help to lower CO2 emissions by
optimizing energy consumption and reducing
traffic congestion.8
However, many unintended consequences
have also surfaced. Cyberattacks have
become a common hazard for individuals

and businesses: our surveys rank them
as the seventh most likely and eighth
most impactful risk, and the second most
concerning risk for doing business globally
over the next 10 years (see Figure II, The
Global Risks Landscape). Fifth generation
(5G) networks, quantum computing and
AI are creating not only opportunities but
also new threats of their own. The lack
of a global governance framework for
technology risks fragmenting cyberspace,
which could deter economic growth,
aggravate geopolitical rivalries and widen
divisions within societies.

The dangers of digital
innovation
Cyberattacks. The digital nature of 4IR
technologies makes them intrinsically
vulnerable to cyberattacks that can take
a multitude of forms—from data theft
and ransomware to the overtaking of
systems with potentially large-scale harmful
consequences. Operational technologies
are at increased risk because cyberattacks
could cause more traditional, kinetic impacts
as technology is being extended into the
physical world, creating a cyber-physical
system. However, using “security-by-design”
principles to integrate cybersecurity features
into new products is still secondary to getting
products quickly out into the market.

Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure—
rated the fifth top risk in 2020 by our
expert network—have become the new
normal across sectors such as energy,9
healthcare,10 and transportation.11 Such
attacks have even affected entire cities.12
Public and private sectors alike are at
risk of being held hostage. Organized
cybercrime entities are joining forces,13
and their likelihood of detection and
prosecution is estimated to be as low as
0.05% in the United States.14 Cybercrimeas-a-service is also a growing business
model, as the increasing sophistication
of tools on the Darknet makes malicious
services more affordable and easily
accessible for anyone.
The IoT is also amplifying the potential
cyberattack surface. It is estimated
that there are already over 21 billion IoT
devices worldwide,15 and their number will
double by 2025.16 Attacks on IoT devices
increased by more than 300% in the first
half of 2019,17 while in September 2019,
IoTs were used to take down Wikipedia
through classic distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attacks,18 and the risk of
IoT devices being used as intermediaries is
expected to increase.19 In 2021, according
to Cybersecurity Ventures, cybercrime
damages might reach US$6 trillion20— what
would be equivalent to the GDP of the
world’s third largest economy.21
Vulnerable data. 4IR technologies
run on data, making privacy a major
challenge. IoT devices collect and share
data that are potentially highly sensitive
for individuals, companies and states,
from personal identification and medical
records to national security information.
The data brokering market—aggregating,
disaggregating, copying, searching and
selling data for commercial purposes—is
worth an estimated US$200 billion a year.22
Data theft can enable the manipulation of
individual and collective behaviour, leading
to physical and psychological harm.
Artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been
dubbed both “the most impactful invention”
and our “biggest existential threat”.23
Indeed, we may not even be able to
comprehend AI’s full potential—or its full
risk. Some risks—such as manipulation
through fake news and “deepfakes”—are

well known.24 Others are yet to be fully
uncovered, including in such areas as braincomputer interfaces and hyper-automation
(combining robotics and AI). 25
Fifth generation (5G). 4IR technologies rely
on high-speed digital infrastructure—on 5G
networks and, further down the road, 6G.26
While 5G technology can be built in part on
existing 4G infrastructure, significant shortfalls
in capacity are expected as early as 2020
in some countries.27 Current projections
show the risk of a US$1 trillion global gap in
telecommunication infrastructure investments
through 2040.28 In developed countries,
the challenge is not only to build modern
infrastructure but also to overcome reliance
on legacy systems, on which the public and
private sectors currently spend up to 80% of
their technology budgets. Here, introducing
new, safe and reliable systems into existing
capabilities is key; some entities have already
begun to do this.29

One million
additional people joining the
internet daily
Quantum computing. Quantum computing
could dramatically reduce the time needed
to solve the mathematical problems on
which encryption techniques currently rely—
from months to minutes and seconds.30 It
risks rendering useless most of our existing
data security and critical infrastructure
systems, including military networks, email
and power grids.31
Cloud computing. While many technical
advancements of 4IR are essentially
digitally based, cloud computing has
the potential to enhance trans-sectoral
development, expand technological access
to remote areas and further link AI to
other 4IR technologies. At the same time,
with increasingly more data hosted in the
cloud, companies are amassing personal
information like never before, which could
ultimately create potential new data privacy
and security risks.32
The Global Risks Report 2020

The proliferation of standards makes it
more difficult to converge on a single one
The importance of global tech
and cyber governance
Attempts to address the security challenges
of 4IR technologies are maturing, but
they are often still fragmented and limited
in scope and participants. Numerous
initiatives bring together businesses and
governments to build trust, promote security
in cyberspace, assess the impact of
cyberattacks and assist victims.33 Multilateral
efforts, such as the Council of Europe’s
Budapest Convention, also aim to define
responsible behaviour in cyberspace and
harmonize the patchwork of existing laws and
regulations.34 Collaborative incident response
and information-sharing efforts attempt to
centralize cybersecurity capabilities to reduce
the impact of cyberattacks.35
International efforts to develop AI standards
are also ongoing (for example, in the field
of AI and ethics alone, there are over 80
frameworks),36 yet the large increase in
such initiatives serves to fragment the
response to the threat, often imposing
burdensome and sometimes conflicting
obligations on organizations operating
across national boundaries. The proliferation
of standards also makes it more difficult
for countries and companies to converge
on a single one as more AI-enabled systems
are adopted.
Even more critical, international and
national policies are not keeping up with
technological advances. The need is
urgent for a more comprehensive, inclusive
and agile global governance architecture
to address the dynamic and intertwined
security issues raised by the 4IR. The “age
of digital interdependence” will benefit
all societies only if the wide-ranging
geopolitical, economic and societal risks
it could bring are managed in a coordinated
and inclusive way.37 The current disruption
of the multilateral system (see Chapter
1, Global Risks 2020) renders the
development of such a framework
more challenging.
64

Wild Wide Web

Geopolitical risks
Digital innovation is both influencing and
being influenced by geopolitical tension,
which amplifies the possibility for risk and
minimizes the chances for cooperation. At
the same time, the private sector exercises
significant power to impact outcomes in this
realm. Indeed, global tech companies have
leveraged open digital borders to integrate
global supply chains and connect people
worldwide—but these companies are also
challenging some core competencies of
nation states, such as standard-setting
and monetary policies. Technological
predominance and future national
competitiveness go hand in hand.
The lack of a global tech governance
framework increases business influence on
standard-setting, the foreign participation
in national critical infrastructure, foreign
acquisition of domestic technology, the
offshoring of data, and technology transfer
as a price to access foreign markets,38
influencing societal risks as well (see below).
Additional risks for states include:
Parallel cyberspace. Connectivity
depends on internationally established
protocols. Historically, multilateral
stakeholders have tended to favour a fairly
open and loosely regulated cyberspace.
However, current international developments
point to an increased risk of divergence in
protocols—old and new—that could lead
to fragmentation of cyberspace and future
technologies.39 Additionally, if countries
continue to seek “cyber-sovereignty”—
national or regional versions of the
internet40—global interconnectivity
could be further disrupted.
First-mover advantage. Patents in 4IR
technologies are being filed at an increasing
rate.41 Governments as well as businesses
want to be at the forefront of cutting-edge
technologies because they stand to benefit
from being the first to make breakthroughs.
First-mover advantage can shift geopolitical
balance by influencing standards, systems
and production chains.

REUTERS/FRANCOIS LENOIR

A new digital arms race. Digital
dependency is changing the nature of
international and national security, raising
three urgent issues: how to protect critical
infrastructure, uphold societal values and
prevent the escalation of state-on-state
conflicts. Digital technologies increasingly
feature in asymmetric warfare, enabling
attacks by smaller countries and non-state
actors on larger states. Viruses developed
as cyberweapons have been re-purposed
by adversaries after being released into
cyberspace. Cyberspace has become an
extension of the military domain, triggering
new technological arms races.42
In 2019, several countries agreed to pursue
the establishment of guiding principles
for the use of lethal autonomous weapons
systems.43 However, key military powers
are resisting international legal regulation
in this area, increasing the risk of serious
future mishaps.
Interruption of international
interconnectivity. Increased intelligencesharing between government cybersecurity
agencies and infrastructure operators has
strengthened the appreciation of challenges
related to cyberattacks and improved

preparedness efforts. It has also raised the
question of whether the participants in critical
information infrastructure are trustworthy.
The fragmentation of cyberspace will
render those efforts moot and create
possibly insurmountable technological
incompatibilities for law enforcement to
cooperate across varying systems.

Economic risks
It is no surprise that technology hardware
supply chains have driven recent research
and development (R&D) and trade debates
between major global economies.44
Many countries are heavily scrutinizing
investment in—or acquisition of—technology
companies by foreign investors. Countries
are increasingly looking at foreign
investment in universities to assess risks of
intellectual property—in the form of research
and its potential commercial applications—
vanishing abroad. Technology transfers in
exchange for market access have become
a contested part of trade negotiations.
These issues highlight the trade-offs
countries are making between near-term
economic gain at a time of slow growth
and longer-term security in an increasingly
challenging geopolitical context. Europe’s
The Global Risks Report 2020

65

desire for its own cloud—in part to retain
valuable data now being extracted by foreign
players—risks it falling behind in this global
race. Other economic risks include:

80

Fragmentation costs. In today’s
hyperconnected global economy, it is
estimated that a total shutdown of the internet
would result in a daily GDP loss of 1.9% in
a high-connectivity country and 0.4% in a
low-connectivity country.45 Fragmentation of
cyberspace and technologies could aggravate
these economic consequences by having
negative effects on businesses’ use of cloud
services,46 increased transactional costs of
doing business across parallel jurisdictions
and lower productivity by requiring different
production lines for different markets.
These economic consequences undermine
businesses’ ability to realize the
potential of 4IR technologies.
Loss of sustainability. As the
world is on the brink of climate
collapse (see Chapter 3, A Decade
Left), the necessary duplication
of efforts for overcoming such
technical fragmentation would
not only be economically
counterproductive, but also
environmentally inefficient. This
inefficiency is further amplified
by countries’ pursuit of isolated
national technology regulations.
Adaptation to different products
for different markets would
inevitably increase the negative
environmental footprint of any industry. At
the same time, today’s ecological footprint
of mass data generated for and by AI—
for example, the energy required to run
servers—is already considerable.47

Monetary and fiscal risks. The lack of
coordinated efforts by nations on how to
capture wealth created by open trade and
through digital means is a major challenge,
creating disparities with local companies
and between countries. Moreover, new
digital currencies operating outside a clear
regulatory framework could undermine
sovereign currencies and international
cooperation against money laundering.
Collapse in confidence in digital currencies
could also threaten financial stability.48 At the
same time, innovation in this space could
provide social benefit but this requires, as
66

Wild Wide Web

then-IMF Chair Christine Lagarde warned,
“being alert to risks in terms of financial
stability, privacy or criminal activities, and
ensuring appropriate regulation is in place to
steer technology toward the public good.”49

Societal risks
The differential speed of 4IR developments
around the world risks widening divides
between nations. Highly digitized economies
have the capacities and capital to invest in
future technologies, leaving behind others—
especially in Africa, ASEAN and Latin
America—that currently trail in areas such
as patents, IoT development and market
capitalization.50 Societal risks include:
Digital divide and wealth gaps. A widening
digital divide between countries risks a
vicious cycle, as increasing wealth gaps and
a brain drain make it harder for those left
behind to catch up, and easier for regions
to miss critical investment opportunities that
would allow access to new 4IR technology
markets. Hence, countries could lose out
on the compounding effect of investments
and subsequently lack the R&D capabilities
needed to thrive, contributing to yet further
brain drain. Within countries, wealth gaps
could also increase: automation is forecasted
to hit low-skilled workers and women the
hardest.51 Societal divides could also widen
between rural and urban areas in developing
economies,52 and between smart and nonsmart cities in developed countries.53 The
wide-scale affordability of new technologies
will be one important factor for minimizing
the digital divide.54
A human dystopia. Given the growing
societal awareness of problems such as
biased algorithms and cyberbullying,55 there
are many calls for deeper engagement on
questions of ethics in the development and
use of 4IR technologies.56 Due diligence must
be applied to avoid negative consequences
for under-represented communities. The lack
of a global technological framework could
lead to a dystopia involving, for example,
cyberbullying without consequences,
workplace surveillance and the erosion of
employee privacy.57
While the open cyberspace has allowed
the democratization of certain processes
and increased access to information and
data, growing opportunities for promoting

falsehoods (accidentally and deliberately) have
resulted in a gradual erosion of trust in media,
social networks and even governments.
Data are increasingly being collected on
citizens by government and business alike,
and these data are then monetized and used
to refine the development and deployment
of new technologies back towards these
citizens, as consumers. Amassing of data by
a handful of small entities leads to a further
entrenchment of gaps between advanced
and emerging economies.

Global governance challenges
for businesses
Businesses, just as economies, rely on
concerted global technology governance.
Fragmentation and incompatibility between
global cybersecurity and technology
frameworks risk weakening businesses’
capabilities to adapt to the emerging
challenges discussed in this chapter in a
timely way, as raising transactional costs
increases the financial burden on businesses.
More and more firms operate in complex,
global and digital service ecosystems that
not only expose them to their own cyber
and technological weaknesses, but also
to those of other participants—including
customers, suppliers and managed
system providers. At the same time,

businesses are facing the challenge of
implementing existing cybersecurity and
4IR standards (where they exist), while
ensuring compliance with fragmented
regulations on accountability, transparency,
bias and privacy for developing—or simply
applying—4IR technologies. Because
government and corporate leaders equally
share the responsibility for promoting global
cybersecurity and digital trust, cooperation
between the public and private sectors
is more vital than ever in areas such as
information-sharing, collaboration with
law enforcement agencies, and skill and
capacity development.
The new digital geopolitical race (see
Chapter 1, Global Risks 2020) also risks
affecting businesses’ development of 4IR
technologies and their market readiness
to harness the benefits of the 4IR
transformation. An open and interconnected
cyberspace, along with global technological
compatibility, are essential for businesses
to be able to counter the dislocating
impacts of social media, the economic
impacts of global technology giants and
potential security issues resulting from
the digital technology race between the
world’s leading economies. By advocating
for fair and concerted global actions on
any 4IR-related governance frameworks,
businesses can mitigate risks, ensure trust
towards consumers and governments, and
increasingly benefit from the 4IR.

Health Systems under New Pressures
REUTERS/BENOIT TESSIER

The institutions and approaches that have until
now enabled health progress across the world
are straining under gathering pressures and
seem outmatched against new risks.
Health systems around the world are at risk of
becoming unfit for purpose. Changing societal,
environmental, demographic and technological
patterns are straining their capacity. Vaccine
hesitancy and drug resistance are undermining
progress against pandemics, making it
increasingly difficult to land the final blow

against some of humanity’s biggest killers.
Meanwhile, new vulnerabilities threaten to undo
the dramatic gains in wellness and prosperity
that health systems have supported over the
last century. Non-communicable diseases
(NCDs)—such as cardiovascular diseases
or mental illness—have replaced infectious
diseases as the leading cause of death.
As existing health risks resurge and new
ones emerge, humanity’s past successes
in overcoming health challenges are no
guarantee of future results.
73

The slowing of
health progress
Global investments in health in recent
decades have yielded substantial gains to
both longevity and quality of life. Over the
long history of our species, the average
life expectancy at birth for people in most
societies ranged from 20 to 50 years. Since
1950, this has improved significantly—to
72 years globally,1 of which 63 years on
average are lived in good health, free of
disease or disability (see Figure 6.1).2
Many factors have contributed to this
success: scientific breakthroughs; better
hygiene, sanitation and nutrition; health
policies and investments made possible
by prosperity; international cooperation;
and individual choices. Vaccines illustrate
this point: after germ theory took hold in
the late 19th century, scientists developed
vaccines for many deadly infectious
diseases including smallpox, measles,
polio, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and
tuberculosis. Smallpox—once among the
deadliest diseases—was the first to be
eradicated by national programmes and
international cooperation in surveillance and
containment, reinforced by people’s trust
in health systems and their willingness to
be vaccinated. Coordinated immunization
programmes continue to prevent millions of
deaths annually.3

False Positive

However, strained health systems are leading
to worrying trends. Gains in lifespan and
healthspan (the number of years spent in
good health) seem to be slowing in both
developed and developing countries.4 For
example, recent data published by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
shows that US life expectancy declined in
2017 for the third year in a row, the longest
sustained drop for a century—since the
combined effects of World War I and a global
influenza pandemic.5 In Singapore, although
life expectancy has increased since 1990,
people are spending more of their lives in
sickness.6 Disparities in health outcomes
persist within and across countries. A
baby born in Hong Kong SAR can expect
to live for 85 years, versus just 52 years in
the Central African Republic (Figure 6.1).7
Meanwhile, rich-poor health gaps are
growing in countries including the United
Kingdom and the United States.8

Pressures on health systems
Gathering pressures are straining health
systems on many fronts. In this section, we
discuss long-standing challenges as well as
the next generation of health pressures that
health systems are now confronting.

Familiar foes
There is no guarantee that health systems
will continue to improve health, and clear
signs of strain are apparent. Despite historic,
hard-won success against diseases such
as smallpox, some of humanity’s most
formidable global health threats still linger—
and other threats, thought to have been
quashed, are resurgent.
Persisting pandemics. Thirty years ago,
polio was endemic in 125 countries,
causing 350,000 clinical cases per year.
After an extraordinary international effort
and US$20 billion in investment, today
there are 99.9% fewer cases and polio
remains endemic in only Afghanistan,
Pakistan and possibly Nigeria—where
geopolitical challenges have complicated
eradication.9 Polio could potentially be
eradicated in the next four years—but the
estimated cost to make that happen would
be another US$4.2 billion.10 The last mile is
proving the hardest, for reasons including
persistent political instability and community

REUTERS/EMMANUEL FOUDROT

resistance—which often stems in part
from a perception that investments in polio
eradication come at the expense of other
health priorities.11 Letting up is not an option
because the short- and long-term benefits
of eradicating this enduring scourge would
be massive.
Similar stories can be told about HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria. After years of
remarkable progress as a result of sustained
political commitment and funding via
the Global Fund, ambitions to end these
epidemics by 2030 are being undermined
by factors such as diseases’ increasing
resistance to drugs.12
Vaccine hesitancy. The World Health
Organization (WHO) considers reluctance or
refusal to vaccinate to be among the top 10
threats to global health.13 Growing vaccine
hesitancy has led to outbreaks of measles
worldwide, including in developed countries
where it had largely been eliminated.14
New York City spent US$6 million in 2019
responding to a completely preventable
measles outbreak.15 Making fewer headlines
than the massive Ebola outbreak in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, that country

33 years
widest gap in life expectancy
between countries
also recently saw the world’s largest
measles outbreak, affecting over 200,000
people in less than a year.16 The resurgence
of measles is a symptom of complacency
and recklessness.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As
measles and other infectious diseases
strain health systems by siphoning off
limited resources and attention, overuse of
antibiotics poses a direct threat to health
and healthcare. AMR makes antibiotics
less effective at treating illnesses. Surgeries
that have become routine, infections we
now think of as easily treatable, and some
common illnesses could again become lifethreatening.17 The WHO estimates that AMR
could result in 10 million deaths by 2050.18

Global health security risks.
Considerable progress has been made
since the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in
2014–2016, but health systems worldwide
are still under-prepared for significant
outbreaks of other emerging infectious
diseases, such as SARS, Zika and MERS.
A recent first-of-its-kind comprehensive
assessment of health security and
related capabilities across 195 countries
found fundamental weaknesses around
the world: no country is fully prepared
to handle an epidemic or pandemic.19
Meanwhile, our collective vulnerability
to the societal and economic impacts of
infectious disease crises appears to
be increasing.20

False Positive

Serious as these risks are, it can be argued
that health systems nonetheless have a
blueprint to mitigate them, and success
requires only adequate attention. The same
cannot be said for new health risks.

Emerging Risks
Longevity, lifestyle and climate changes
are transforming disease burdens. Health
systems need new infrastructure, resources
and skills, but in many parts of the world
they are failing to adapt—even as healthcare
spending soars to unsustainable levels.
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
As populations grow, age and urbanize,
NCDs and mental disorders have replaced
infectious diseases as the leading threats to
health and health systems worldwide. Once
considered diseases of the rich world—
linked to low-quality diets, little exercise and
the use of tobacco and alcohol—chronic
and degenerative conditions are now a
global epidemic (see Figure 6.2). They
account for 41 million deaths each year, of
which 85% are in low- and middle-income
countries, where people might grow old
and ill before they become rich.21 By 2030,
the WHO expects this figure to increase by
11 million, reaching 52 million in total, and
deaths from infectious diseases to decline by
7 million.22 Depression and anxiety disorders
are on the rise—they increased by 54%
and 42% respectively from 1990 to 2013,
according to WHO data.23 Currently 700
million people worldwide are estimated to
have a mental disorder.24
While infectious diseases and pandemics
pose an acute threat to human life, NCDs
have a gradually crippling effect on the
well-being of individuals and societies.
Besides causing enormous physical and
psychological suffering, the four leading
NCDs—heart disease, cancer, diabetes
and respiratory diseases, along with mental
illness—could have cost the global economy
an estimated US$47 trillion (in treatment and
lost productivity) over the 2010s and 2020s.25
Dementia is expected to cost a further
US$2 trillion by 2030,26 as each year brings
10 million new cases.27 NCDs and mental
disorders are difficult to prevent and treat as
they stem from varied and complex causes,
develop slowly, and often co-exist with other
chronic conditions. Effective interventions
need to target both individuals and

Dementia affects 10 million more
people each year
populations, overcoming entrenched habits
and commercial interests. Even in richer
countries, the medical and social care costs
of NCDs could bankrupt health systems.
NCDs could also disrupt societal cohesion:
growing health inequalities could widen
economic inequalities, earlier onset among
younger people could stifle the economic
growth necessary to fund care for older
people, and ageing electorates could prioritize
spending on pensions and healthcare over
other issues such as education, infrastructure
and climate resilience.
Climate change health effects. The
WHO deems climate change to be “the
greatest threat to global health in the 21st
century”.28 Human-induced climate change
is already impacting the health of millions
and challenging health systems globally.29 It
affects the quality of the air we breathe and
both the quality and quantity of the water
we drink and the food we eat. Air pollution is
already costing the world more than US$5
trillion from decreased productivity every
year.30 Extreme weather conditions are
putting populations around the world at risk
of food and water insecurity. Today’s children
face a future of increasingly serious climaterelated hazards: less nutritious crops, air
pollution exacerbated by burning fossil
fuels, rising average temperatures and other
weather-related disruptions to livelihoods.31
Climate change also exacerbates the
incidence of infectious diseases. Warming
temperatures are expanding mosquitofriendly habitats beyond the tropics,
spreading diseases such as malaria, dengue,
yellow fever, West Nile virus and Zika into
new regions. In 2015, the El Niño effect
allowed Zika to spread from Brazil to the
rest of South America.32 In 2012, the United
States logged a record 5,500 cases of West
Nile virus and an increase of 70% in dengue
fever.33 By 2080, extreme global warming
could expose a billion people to mosquitoborne diseases in previously unaffected
regions such as Europe and East Africa.34

Demand–capacity mismatch. As more
people live for longer with increasing health
and social care needs, and as new drugs
and technologies are developed, surging
demand and expectations are stretching
current approaches to financing care. Health
expenditure growth is outpacing inflation in most
countries.35 It has reached an unsustainable
18% of GDP in the United States,36 resulting
in an increasing transfer of financial risk from
insurance companies to individuals through
rising premiums, co-pays and deductibles;
and in bipartisan anger over drug prices,
hospital bills and out-of-pocket spending.
Most health systems continue to focus on
reactive care in hospitals—detecting and
treating disease—and give too little attention
to NCD prevention and control. They have
yet to adapt their infrastructure to combine
online, remote and retail care settings to
improve information, screening, treatment
and support for patients and carers.
Health systems—and governments more
broadly—will also need better health policies,
regulations and promotion strategies to
reduce environmental and lifestyle risk
factors of NCDs.
The Global Risks Report 2020

Workforce limitations. Most health systems
are training and retaining too few doctors,
nurses and other health workers. For
example, the UK National Health Service
has an estimated 94,000 unfilled vacancies
in hospital and community services37—
almost 8% of its total workforce—and
risks an exodus due to burnout and low
morale.38 Disparities persist across countries,
regions, care levels and areas of medicine.
Nearly half of the world’s population lives in
countries with over 100,000 people for every
psychiatrist.39 Even in the United States,
with 10.8 psychiatrists per 100,000 people,
almost half of those currently practising are
expected to retire soon.40 The brain drain
of health workers places further strain on
poorer and rural parts of the world.

New breakthroughs, new risks
Transformative technologies, medicines
and insurance that could vastly improve the
reach and quality of healthcare are on the
horizon—but they also bring new risks and
trade-offs for health systems and societies.

US$

2 million

cost per patient of recent cell
and gene therapies
Disruptive technologies. Over the
centuries health systems have embraced
many innovations, sometimes without
waiting for them to be proven safe and
effective. Healthcare providers and payers
are already using today’s emerging
technologies—machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI), sensors, digital therapies,
telemedicine and so on—to support both
clinical and operational decisions: to triage
symptoms,41 interpret diagnostic tests,42
create personalized treatment plans43
and predict re-admissions at a hospital or
epidemics in a population. Combined with
human capacity, these technologies could
78

ultimately make it possible for everyone—
even in currently fragile, over-burdened
health systems—to access high-quality,
consistent, affordable, timely and
convenient care.
But new technologies also raise risks,
including risks of compromising patient
safety and privacy, as well as introducing
bias. Errors by individual health workers
affect only their patients, whereas the
consequences of AI errors could unfold
at a whole new scale. Since training data
sets in health often skew white and male,44
AI could fail to spot symptoms or devise
effective treatment plans for everyone else.
These outcomes will be tough to predict or
avoid because AI’s black-box nature makes
it difficult to understand how it reaches
conclusions—making it hard to spot bias.
Health data are especially vulnerable to
cyberattacks,45 with risks of individuals being
identified even from anonymized data (see
Chapter 5, Wild Wide Web).
Pharmaceutical revolution. Highly complex,
specialized new drugs promise radically better
treatment for devastating diseases—but they
come at exorbitant prices. For example, three
recently launched cell and gene therapies
cost up to US$2 million per patient. Over
the next few years, between 15 and 30 new

could lead to rewards and incentives for
people to live healthier lifestyles, but if
unchecked by regulation, it could also
potentially put insurance beyond the reach of
people judged to be higher risk for genetic,
environmental or behavioural reasons.

million-dollar drugs are expected to enter
the market, mostly for cancer.46 New pricing
models—such as multi-year payments
contingent on patient outcomes—are starting
to emerge to address the high costs and risks
of these treatments.
But health systems are finding it difficult to
adapt amid questions over who should pay,
how high a price can be justified, and what
can be given up to afford new therapies. As
people’s expectations rise, unequal access
to better therapies could deepen health
inequalities within and across countries,
eroding trust in health systems and societal
cohesion. In the longer run, if (or when)
gene-editing technologies become available
to enhance physical, cognitive or behavioural
capabilities, these could result in a society of
genetically enhanced haves and the merely
natural have-nots.
Risk pools of one. Health insurance looks
set to be transformed by big data and
analytics. As with in-car devices used by car
insurers to reward responsible drivers with
lower premiums, health insurers can (with the
consent of customers and the appropriate
levels of data security), capture, store and
analyse personal health and behavioural data
from wearable—and eventually implantable—
devices. Personalized risk assessment

In some jurisdictions, steps have already
been taken to mitigate this risk in response
to the concerns of people who have taken
predictive genetic tests for certain diseases.
In 2018, the UK Government, together with
the Association of British Insurers (ABI),
consolidated existing agreements on the use
of genetic information and created the Code
on Genetic Testing and Insurance. Given
the rapid advances taking place in genetic
research, this Code will be reviewed every
three years to consider the technical, ethical
and societal implications of insurability.
Among other principles, the Code commits
insurance companies to treat applicants for
insurance fairly and not require or pressure
any applicant to undertake a predictive or
diagnostic genetic test.47

Ubiquitous risks of a weak
health system
Good health is the foundation for societal
well-being and a dynamic and prosperous
economy.48 Health systems form part of
countries’ critical infrastructure: they are
vital to security, resilience and growth.
At the population level, health underpins
productivity. Well-functioning health systems
enable countries to respond to, and recover
from, natural and human-made disruptions.
Weak systems let pathogens and diseases
spread because they fail to address fake
news about healthcare and preventive
care, psychological responses of fear and
despair, and lack of compliance with health
professionals’ requests.49
Like climate change, health risks pose an
expensive and expanding transnational
challenge. Around the world, health systems
need to take a critical look at the fitness of their
current approaches and institutions if we are to
maintain the progress of the last century and
tackle emerging threats. When health systems
fail to mitigate vulnerabilities and adapt to
changing contexts, they increase the likelihood
of economic crises, political instability, social
ruptures and state-on-state conflict.

Appendix B:
Global Risks Perception Survey
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the World Economic Forum’s source of original risks data,
harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s extensive network of business, government, civil society and thought
leaders. The survey was conducted from 5 September to 22 October 2019 among the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities (including the Global Shapers Community), the professional networks of its
Advisory Board, and members of the Institute of Risk Management. The results of the GRPS are used to create
the Global Risks Landscape and Interconnections Map presented at the beginning of the report, and to offer
insights used throughout.
Both the GRPS and the Global Risks Report adopt the following definition of global risk:
Global risk: A “global risk” is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant negative
impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years.

Methodology
The world in 2020
In the first section of the GRPS, respondents were
asked to assess whether the risks associated with 40
current issues would increase or decrease in 2020
compared to 2019 (see Table B.1 below for full results).
Respondents were also given the option to name any
other issue(s), not included in the 40 risks listed that
they expect to be a source of increased risk in 2020.
We use these open responses to assess the need to
update our list of risks from year to year.
The possible answers to survey questions ranged from
“significantly decrease” to “significantly increase” on
a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing “significantly

88

Appendices

decrease” and 5 representing “significantly increase”.
To reduce framing bias, the values between this range
were not assigned specific wording. For each risk, the
share for each answer was obtained by dividing the
number of respondents who selected that answer by
the total number of answers.
Respondents were asked to base their answers to
each of these 40 risks on a global level. They were
asked the following question: “On a global level, do
you think that in 2020 the risks presented by the
following issues will increase or decrease compared
to 2019?”

The global risks landscape
For each of the 30 global risks listed in Appendix A,
respondents were asked to assess: (1) the likelihood
of each global risk occurring over the course of the
next 10 years, and (2) the severity of its impact at a
global level if it were to occur, both on a scale from
1 to 5 as follows:
–

Likelihood: a value of 1 for “very unlikely” and 5 for
“very likely”

–

Impact: a value of 1 for “minimal” impact and 5 for
“catastrophic” impact

To reduce timing bias, respondents were reminded
to assess the 30 risks over a 10-year period, as
opposed to a time horizon of one year for the previous
40 risks. Again, to reduce framing bias, the values
within the 1–5 scale were not assigned specific
wording. Respondents could leave the question
completely blank. Partial responses for any risk—those
assessing only the likelihood of occurrence or only the
negative impact—were not included in the results.

Formally, for any given risk i, its likelihood and impact—
denoted respectively likelihood
Ni i and impacti—are:

likelihoodi

likelihoodi,n
Ni N

impacti =

impacti =

where Ni is the number ofn=1
respondents for risk i,
and likelihoodi,n and impacti,n are, respectively, the
likelihood and impact assigned by respondent n to
risk i. The likelihood is measured on a scale of 1–5
and the impact on a scale of 1–5. Ni is the number of
respondents for risk i who assessed both the likelihood
and impact of that specific risk.

A simple average for both likelihood and impact for
each of the 30 global risks was calculated on this
basis. The results are illustrated in the Global Risks
Landscape 2020 (Figure II).

Global risks interconnections
Part 3 of the GRPS assesses interconnections
between pairs of global risks.
For the interconnections between pairs of risks, survey
respondents were asked the following question:
“Global risks are not isolated, and it is important to
assess their interconnections. In your view, which are
the most strongly connected global risks? Please
select three to six pairs of global risks, from the 30

90

Appendices

global risks below (one risk can be connected to
any one of the other 29 global risks).” The results are
illustrated in the Global Risks Interconnections Map
2020 (Figure IV). A tally was made of the number of
times each pair was cited.
In the Global Risks Landscape and the Interconnections
Map, the size of each risk is scaled according to the
weight of that node in the system.

Completion thresholds
We received 1,047 total responses to the GRPS to
which we applied an overall standard deviation check, as
well as specific completion thresholds for each section
of the survey:
–

–

–

Overall: nine responses yielded a standard
deviation of zero in the increase/decrease scores
for Part 1 of the survey, as well as the likelihood
and impact scores for Part 2. These responses
were not included in the survey results.

Part 2 “Assessment of Global Risks”:
The answers from the 718 respondents who
assessed the impact and likelihood of at least
one risk were used to compute the results (leaving
the question entirely blank was not considered a
valid answer).

–

Part 3 “Global Risk Interconnections”: The
answers from the 628 respondents who selected
at least one valid pair of risks were used to
compute the results.

Part 1 “The World in 2020”: The answers from
the 777 respondents who assessed at least four
of the risks listed in this question were used to
compute the results.

Figure B.1 presents some key descriptive statistics and
information about the profiles of the respondents.
