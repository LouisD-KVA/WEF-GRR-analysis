80th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 28 June 2010

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 80th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2010.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 1,859.8 million, compared
with SDR 446.1 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the
financial year 2009/10 may be found on pages 144–7 of this Report under “Net
profit and its distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 374.1 million
in payment of a normal dividend of SDR 285 per share costing SDR 155.6 million
and a supplementary dividend of SDR 400 per share costing SDR 218.5 million.
These dividends would be payable in any constituent currency of the SDR, or
in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 148.6 million be transferred to
the general reserve fund, SDR 12.0 million be transferred to the special dividend
reserve fund and the remainder – amounting to SDR 1,325.1 million – to the
free reserve fund.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2009/10 will be payable to shareholders on 8 July 2010.

Overview of the economic chapters

Chapter I

Chapter II

The financial crisis has left policymakers with a daunting legacy, especially in
industrial countries. In setting policies, they must adopt a medium- to longterm perspective while they cope with the still fragile and uneven recovery.
Households have only just begun to reduce their indebtedness and therefore
continue to curb spending. Extraordinary support measures helped to contain
contagion across markets, preventing the worst. But some measures have
delayed the needed adjustments in the real economy and financial sector,
where the reduction of leverage and balance sheet repair are far from
complete. All this continues to weigh on confidence. The combination of
remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system and the side effects of ongoing
intensive care threaten to send the patient into relapse and to undermine
reform efforts.
Macroeconomic support has its limits. Recent market reactions demonstrate
that the limits to fiscal stimulus have been reached in a number of countries.
Immediate, front-loaded fiscal consolidation is required in several industrial
countries. Such policies need to be accompanied by structural reforms to
facilitate growth and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. In monetary policy,
despite the fragility of the macroeconomy and low core inflation in the major
advanced economies, it is important to bear in mind that keeping interest
rates near zero for too long, with abundant liquidity, leads to distortions and
creates risks for financial and monetary stability.
Fundamental reform of the financial system must be completed to put it
on more stable foundations that would support high sustainable growth for
the future. Above all, reform should produce more effective regulatory and
supervisory policies as part of an integrated policy framework. A new global
framework for financial stability should bring together contributions from
regulatory, supervisory and macroeconomic policies. Supported by strong
governance arrangements and international cooperation, such a framework
would promote the combined goals of financial and macroeconomic stability.
While some emerging market economies are in danger of overheating,
GDP in most advanced economies is still well below pre-crisis levels despite
strong monetary and fiscal stimulus. The rapid increase of government debt
raises urgent questions about the sustainability of public finances.
Banks have increased their capital buffers, and profits have been boosted
by a number of temporary factors. But banks still remain vulnerable to further
loan losses. As recent disruptions in funding markets have shown, banks can
face significant refinancing pressures when sentiment turns adverse. Although
banks in the crisis countries have made some progress in repairing their
balance sheets, this process is far from complete. Efforts to restructure and
strengthen the financial system should continue.

Central banks cut policy rates sharply during the crisis in order to stabilise
the financial system and the real economy. Those essential cuts, reinforced by
unconventional policy measures to address financial market malfunctioning,
helped to forestall an economic meltdown. But there are limits to how long
monetary policy can remain expansionary. Low interest rates can distort
investment decisions. The financial stability risks that could arise from a
prolonged period of extremely low policy rates also need to be very carefully
weighed. An extended period of such low policy rates can encourage
borrowers to shorten the duration of their debts, facilitate the increased
leverage of risky positions and delay necessary balance sheet adjustments.
While policymakers can and should address such risks with other tools, they
may still need to tighten monetary policy sooner than consideration of
macroeconomic prospects alone might suggest.
Emerging market economies (EMEs) are recovering strongly and inflation
pressures there are rising. Given low policy rates in the major financial centres,
many EMEs are concerned that their stronger growth prospects could attract
destabilising capital inflows, leading to currency appreciation. Some continue
to keep policy rates low and resist exchange rate appreciation by conducting
large-scale intervention in foreign exchange markets. Such policies tend to be
associated with a sizeable expansion in bank balance sheets, rapid credit
growth and asset price overshooting. The risks of domestic overheating thus
increase. To promote more balanced domestic and global growth, some EMEs
could rely more on exchange rate flexibility and on monetary policy tightening.
In addition, prudential tools have an important role to play in enhancing the
resilience of the financial system to domestic and external financial shocks. In
contrast, while capital controls may have a limited and temporary role, they
are unlikely to be effective over the medium term.
The level of public debt in many industrial countries is on an unsustainable
path. Current budget deficits, partly cyclical but also swollen by policy
responses to the crisis, are large in relation to GDP. And expenditures related
to ageing populations are set to increase considerably over the next few
decades. Recent events in Greece and other southern European countries
have shown how quickly investors’ doubts about the sustainability of public
finances in one country can spill over to others. In addition, high levels of
public debt may lower long-term economic growth and ultimately endanger
monetary stability.
These risks underscore the urgent need for credible measures to reduce
current fiscal deficits in several industrial countries. Tackling the long-term
fiscal imbalances requires structural reforms aimed at boosting the growth of
potential output and containing the future increase in age-related expenditures.
Such measures may have adverse effects on output growth in the short term,
but the alternative of having to cope with a sudden loss in market confidence
would be much worse. A programme of fiscal consolidation – cutting deficits
by several percentage points of GDP over a number of years – would offer
significant benefits of low and stable long-term interest rates, a less fragile
financial system and, ultimately, better prospects for investment and long-term
growth.

The crisis revealed that some business models of financial firms were
seriously flawed. For a long time, financial firms earned comparatively low
returns on assets but used high leverage to meet targets for returns on equity.
They also took full advantage of cheap short-term funding. This strategy made
their profits more volatile, especially during periods of market stress. Since the
crisis, investors have become more discriminating in their treatment of financial
firms, rewarding those with more prudent and resilient models. The priority of
policymakers now is to incorporate in the regulatory framework the stronger
standards being imposed by the marketplace. Higher-quality capital, lower
leverage and more stable funding should buttress the sector’s future resilience.
This need not undermine medium-term profitability, particularly if restructuring
continues and excess capacity is progressively eliminated. In addition, more
sound business models should restrain funding costs, thus contributing to
strong, stable and sustainable performance in the sector.
The stability of the financial system is undermined by distorted incentives
and procyclical feedback effects. Macroprudential policy, which broadens the
perspective of traditional prudential policy, can readily strengthen the resilience
of the financial system to procyclicality by adapting conventional prudential
tools. Countercyclical capital buffers, for example, can be built up when credit
growth rises above trend during a boom, and released during the downturn.
Other measures such as ceilings on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for mortgage
lending can act as automatic stabilisers because they will bind more during a
boom when banks typically seek to expand property loans by accepting high
LTV ratios. Such approaches could help to restrain credit and asset price
excesses and thus mitigate the build-up of systemic financial vulnerabilities.
Addressing procyclicality is closely linked to traditional macroeconomic
stabilisation policy. A more resilient financial system complements
countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy, helping address threats to financial
stability in the downturn. That said, monetary policy does need to lean more
against the build-up of systemic financial vulnerabilities during the boom.
That can be done by lengthening the policy horizon, thereby promoting
long-term price stability more effectively.

I. Beyond the rescue: exiting intensive care and
finishing the reforms

Three years after the onset of the crisis, expectations for recovery and reform
are high but patience is wearing thin. Policymakers face a daunting legacy: the
side effects of the ongoing financial and macroeconomic support measures,
combined with the unresolved vulnerabilities of the financial sector, threaten to
short-circuit the recovery; and the full suite of reforms necessary to improve
the resilience of the financial system has yet to be completed.
When the transatlantic financial crisis began nearly three years ago,
policymakers responded with emergency room treatment and strong medicine:
large doses of direct support to the financial system, low interest rates, vastly
expanded central bank balance sheets and massive fiscal stimulus. But such
powerful measures have strong side effects, and their dangers are beginning
to become apparent.
Here are the worst problems arising now from the continued use of
the extraordinary programmes: Direct support is delaying vital post-crisis
adjustment and runs the risk of creating zombie financial and non-financial
firms. Low interest rates at the centre of the global economy are discouraging
needed reductions in leverage, thereby adding to the distortions in the
financial system and creating problems elsewhere. The sustained bloat in their
balance sheets means that central banks still dominate some segments of
financial markets, thereby distorting the pricing of some important bonds and
loans, discouraging necessary market-making by private individuals and
institutions, and increasing moral hazard by making it clear that there is a
buyer of last resort for some instruments. And the fiscal stimulus is spawning
high and growing government debt that, in a number of countries, is now
clearly on an unsustainable path.
The time has come to ask when and how these powerful measures can be
phased out. We cannot ignore the fact that the cumulating side effects
themselves pose a danger that, at the very least, implies exiting sooner than
may be comfortable for many. That said, exit from a number of these measures
is hindered by the state of the financial sector and the macroeconomic outlook,
which are fragile in many parts of the industrial world and make policy
tightening risky.
On the reform front, work is proceeding apace. Detailed and wideranging proposals are taking aim at the multifarious causes of the crisis and
at the effects of threats that could yet develop. Such reforms will make the
next crisis less likely and, when it does come, less severe. But as we argued a
year ago, success requires that everyone contribute.1 Regulators need to

reform their approach to the safety of the financial system’s three essential
elements: instruments, markets and institutions. They must establish a
macroprudential framework to promote the stability of the financial system as
a whole, over and above the soundness of each of its components. Fiscal
authorities must work to maintain long-term sustainability, ensuring that their
policies absorb rather than amplify shocks by building reserves in good times
that will be available for response in the bad times. And central banks must
confront booms in asset prices and credit as being the threat to stable prices
and growth that they are. The programme for reform on all these fronts –
regulatory, fiscal and monetary – must be put in place and seen through to
completion.
The first part of this introductory chapter briefly outlines the extraordinary
policy measures undertaken during the crisis and discusses the risks arising
from the now prolonged administering of that medicine, which primarily
addressed symptoms. In the subsequent parts, we examine the underlying
causes of the crisis, survey the work that is under way to reform the financial
system and consider what still needs to be done.

In the emergency room: initial responses to the crisis
As the crisis intensified with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, authorities
implemented an escalating series of emergency measures aimed at shoring
up their financial systems and the real economy. These were essentially
emergency room treatments, which meant that consideration of any side
effects would have to wait.
Depending on the structure of their economies and financial systems,
policymakers chose varying measures, including: guarantees of bank assets
and liabilities aimed at averting potential bank runs; direct lending from
fiscal authorities and central banks, as well as from international financial
institutions, to allow rollover and prevent default; capital injections to ward off
insolvency; nationalisations to allow failed institutions to continue to serve
their customers; removal of low-quality loans from private sector balance
sheets and support of prices of assets for which liquid markets had
disappeared, and thereby ballooning of central bank balance sheets; and
supervisors’ public certification of the capital adequacy of large banks. A
comprehensive list of the actions taken would include dozens of specific
programmes in virtually every advanced economy and many emerging
market economies as well.2
Unprecedented macroeconomic policies accompanied the large array of
direct actions to support the financial system. The extremely accommodative
monetary and fiscal policies put in place were a reaction to the consequences
of the crisis. In the United States, Europe and Japan, public deficits are now
in excess of 5% of GDP and policy rates are near zero. And as the conventional
monetary easing ran its course, central banks in a number of core countries

Annual Report.

BIS 80th Annual Report

shifted their focus from prices to quantities. Over the past two years, the total
quantity of assets owned by those central banks about doubled and remains
at or near that bloated level.

Intensive care: the problem of dangerous side effects
The emergency policies were essential at the time and have been largely
successful in meeting their short-term objectives. Many of them are still in
effect today, however – three years after the onset of the crisis. To put it
bluntly, the combination of remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system
and the side effects of such a long period of intensive care threaten to send
the patient into relapse.
The crisis has left the global macroeconomic situation far worse than it
was three years ago. In Europe and the United States, unemployment is high
and demand prospects are poor. Support programmes for markets and
institutions have created a dependency from which the financial system may
have a hard time withdrawing without a continuation of very easy monetary
policy. And some banks and banking systems remain highly leveraged and
still appear to be on life support.
The Greek sovereign debt crisis shows just how fragile the financial
system still is. In mid-May, the escalating difficulties surrounding Greece’s
creditworthiness resulted in funding problems for a number of banks,
especially in Europe, reminiscent of those following the collapse of Lehman.
These funding difficulties reflected not only the new problem of sovereign
debt but also the lingering doubts about the quality of commercial bank
balance sheets. In reaction to these difficulties, the ECB moved into new
territory and announced it would buy sovereign bonds. And as with the earlier
crisis, central banks opened emergency swap lines to address some of the
funding problems.
Leverage remains high in the non-financial sectors of many countries
at the centre of the crisis. As discussed in Chapter II, households in these
economies have started to reduce their leverage. But including the large
increases by the public sector, debt levels of the non-financial sector have
risen substantially since 2007; they are expected to be higher by 20–40% of
GDP by the end of 2010 in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and
the United States. Not only does the continued high leverage imply fragility of
private and public sector balance sheets, which will take years to resolve, but it
also severely limits the scope for fiscal policy intervention if another bailout –
public or private – is needed.
Indeed, the events coming out of Greece highlight the possibility that
highly indebted governments may not be able to act as buyer of last resort to
save banks in a crisis. That is, in late 2008 and early 2009, governments
provided the backstop when banks began to fail. But if the debt of the
government itself becomes unmarketable, any future bailout of the banking
system would have to rely on external help.
The Greek sovereign debt crisis may have delayed any monetary
tightening, but the longer that policy rates in the major advanced economies

BIS 80th Annual Report

remain low, the larger will be the distortions they create, both domestically and
internationally. As discussed in Chapter III, a prolonged period of exceptionally
low real interest rates alters investment decisions, postpones the recognition
of losses, increases risk-taking in the ensuing search for yield, and encourages
high levels of borrowing. Our recent experience with exactly those
consequences a mere five years ago should make us extremely wary this
time around. True, the current environment is very different from what it was
in the first half of the past decade, but the 2007–09 crisis suggests that the
financial binges promoted by such low policy rates – booms in asset prices
and credit, the underpricing of risk and the like – ultimately have devastating
effects.
For those economies that are growing strongly and require higher policy
rates, the low interest rates at the centre of the global financial system are
unhelpful, to say the least – the interest differentials induce capital movements.
As discussed in Chapters III and IV, those flows put pressure on exchange
rates, encourage credit booms and asset price bubbles, and destabilise the
economy when interest rate differentials normalise and cause the flows to
reverse.
Vast fiscal outlays to support aggregate demand in the wake of the
2007–09 crisis – combined with past promises on health care, pension and
social security payments – have sent public debt in many industrial countries
rocketing on an unsustainable trajectory. As discussed in Chapter V, ageing
populations are beginning to place large burdens on the public finances of
most advanced economies. Events during the first half of this year show that
it may already be too late for some countries to protect or quickly restore their
standing in the debt markets on their own. But in any case, sizeable fiscal
consolidation is needed urgently in a number of industrial countries and
generally in two forms: cuts to rein in current deficits, and convincing action
to ensure that deficits will not surge in the future.
Fiscal consolidation is even more pressing for those countries that
entered the crisis with high debts that were a result both of fiscal profligacy
and of low potential growth arising from a lack of international competitiveness.
Adjustment to the former is straightforward even if painful to implement.
But for countries in a currency union with their major trading partners,
devaluation is not an option, so improvements in competitiveness can come
only through higher productivity or lower nominal wages. As the long history
of sovereign debt crises has shown, when investors lose their confidence in a
country’s ability to service its debt and become unwilling to hold it, rescue
packages, bailouts and even debt restructuring for the sovereign remain the
only options.

Diagnosis: identifying the causes of the crisis
The adage of every good doctor must be: treat the symptoms of the disease,
but never forget its causes. And what is true for medical illness is also true
for a financial and economic crisis: policymakers must address its symptoms
and at the same time press ahead with reforms aimed at its causes so as

10

BIS 80th Annual Report

to reduce systemic financial risk as soon as possible. Therefore, to better
evaluate how far along we are with these reforms, we first briefly summarise
the causes of the crisis. The causes are all surely interrelated, but for ease of
exposition we divide them into two broad categories: microeconomic and
macroeconomic.3

Microeconomic causes
The microeconomic causes fall into three areas: flawed incentives; failures
of risk measurement and management; and weaknesses in regulation and
supervision. Jointly, these shortcomings allowed the entire financial industry
to book profits too early, too easily and without proper risk adjustment.
The crisis revealed distorted incentives for consumers and investors,
financial sector employees, and rating agencies alike. Consumers and
investors failed to watch out for themselves, borrowing heavily and investing in
overly complex and opaque products. Managers of financial firms, encouraged
by compensation schemes keyed to short-term returns and business volumes,
increased leverage and accumulated huge amounts of risk. Rating agencies,
overwhelmed by the avalanche of complex structured products yet unable to
resist the profits from taking on the business, failed to correctly evaluate the
probability that borrowers would repay.
Measuring, pricing and managing risk all require modern statistical tools,
which are based largely on historical experience. Even for data series with a
long history, the belief that the world evolves slowly but permanently meant
downweighting the importance of the more distant past and its upheavals. So,
the long but more recent period of relative stability created the perception that
risk had permanently fallen. The result was a willingness to buy and sell risk
very cheaply. But as we have learned at great social cost, those ubiquitous
statistical methods are especially bad at assessing large-scale, infrequent
events. They perform worst when we need them most.
Inadequate governance of risk management created additional
problems.4 Risk managers have the very unpopular job of telling traders to
stop making money. A lack of support from top management sidelined the
risk managers.
Finally, the regulatory system was too indulgent and, for some activities,
too easily evaded altogether. Overreliance by regulators and supervisors
on market discipline (including the discipline supposedly imposed by credit
rating agencies) led to what can only be characterised as an extremely light
touch in some countries at the core of the global financial system. And when
even that light touch proved too much to bear, financial institutions found it
easy to shift selected activities outside the regulatory perimeter. As a result,
by fighting the wrong battles or not fighting at all, weak regulators and
supervisors allowed the build-up of enormous risk.

Macroeconomic causes
The macroeconomic causes fall into two broad categories: problems
associated with the build-up of imbalances in international claims, and
difficulties created by the long period of low real interest rates.
Persistent and large current account surpluses and deficits generated net
capital flows from capital-poor emerging market countries to capital-rich
industrial economies for most of the decade preceding the crisis. The varying
opinions on the origin of these flows and the resulting build-up of cross-country
claims – excessive domestic demand in some major advanced economies; a
savings glut; a dearth of investment opportunities; demand for international,
low-risk assets for portfolio diversification; or the building-up of war chests by
emerging market economies – are secondary. The point, rather, is that the
symbiotic relationship between export-led growth in one set of countries and
leverage-led growth in another generated the large gross flows and huge
stocks of claims by residents of the exporting countries on the residents of the
importing countries. Those flows and claims contributed to the mispricing of
assets and to the global spread of the crisis.
The second set of macroeconomic causes stemmed from the protracted
period of low real policy rates and low real long-term interest rates that began
in 2001. Those low rates had a number of important effects. Among them was
the boom in credit to households in many advanced economies, which fuelled
some clearly unsustainable run-ups in housing prices. Another was the search
for yield, which drove institutional investors to take on significant additional
risk even when it would achieve only modestly higher returns.

Addressing the causes of the crisis
If the financial system is to have a more stable foundation, the causes of the
global financial crisis must guide the design of reforms we put in place. So, to
write effective prescriptions, it is crucial that we draw the correct conclusions
from the causes. One might deduce from the crisis that certain activities, like
securitisation or over-the-counter trading, and certain financial instruments,
like collateralised debt obligations or credit default swaps, should be banned
in order to prevent another meltdown. But even if we could do it, fighting the
last war would not win the next one. Instead, we must take a flexible and
forward-looking approach that addresses the externalities that allowed the
specific activities to inflict systemic damage. Rather than attempt the
impossible task of eliminating crises, we must seek to reduce both their
likelihood and their severity.
As discussed in last year’s Annual Report, building a more resilient financial
system requires us to address the risks arising from two types of externalities
in that system: one is joint failures stemming from common exposures
(institutions are all exposed to the same risk) and interlinkages (institutions
are inextricably tied together), and the other is procyclicality.5 The next two

Prescription: reducing the risks of common exposures and
interlinkages
New and better rules for reducing systemic risk arising from common
exposures and interlinkages operate on two fronts: reducing the risk that an
individual institution will fail and reducing the chance of a system-wide
breakdown.

Reducing the chance of an individual failure
The probability that a financial institution will fail can be reduced with a variety
of tools that: (i) affect the size, composition and riskiness of the balance sheet;
(ii) improve the governance of the institution and the incentives of its
executives; and (iii) enhance market discipline. In combination and properly
implemented, these should reduce risk-taking, increase the ability of
institutions to absorb losses and make failure less likely.
With the first set of goals in mind, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (BCBS) has recommended four types of balance sheet measures,
all of which should lead banks to hold capital and liquidity that better reflect
their risk exposures.6
The first BCBS balance sheet proposal improves the quantity and quality
of capital at banks so that they can better withstand unexpected declines in
the value of their assets.
The second guards against illiquidity by limiting both the extent of maturity
transformation at banks (borrowing short to lend long) and their reliance on
wholesale funding. It is worth emphasising the obvious: the more maturity
transformation a bank undertakes, the less liquid it is. And as the most recent
crisis showed, liquidity is at least as important as capital during times of stress,
especially for banks funding themselves in international markets or operating
across a variety of jurisdictions.
The third proposal improves risk coverage with respect to counterparty
credit exposures arising from derivatives, repurchase agreements, securities
lending and complex securitisation activities.
The fourth complements complex, risk-weighted capital requirements
with a supplementary backstop – a limit on the leverage ratio. Because
leverage amplifies losses as well as profits, it increases the risk of failure in
bad times.7
6
In December 2009, the BCBS published two major papers outlining proposals to strengthen capital and
liquidity regulation. These included a set of measures to raise the quality, consistency and transparency of
the capital base (Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and International framework for liquidity
risk measurement, standards and monitoring, Consultative Documents, 17 December 2009). Similarly, the
IASB has proposed a more forward-looking provisioning approach (International Accounting Standards
Board, Financial instruments: amortised cost and impairment, Exposure draft 2009/12, November 2009).
7
Our discussion focuses on banks, but efforts to reduce the probability of failure involve other types
of financial institutions as well. One example is the global framework devised by international insurance
supervisors, Solvency II, which has already been applied in the European Union.

14

BIS 80th Annual Report

Some jurisdictions – including Switzerland and, more recently, Ireland –
have begun to impose more stringent capital requirements and leverage
ratios on their banks.8 Authorities in the United Kingdom and the United
States have essentially done the same thing through their stress-testing
procedures. In a trend that reinforces those efforts, the anticipation of such
requirements in combination with investor demands has already led many
institutions to make significant adjustments to their capital base.
The second set of tools aimed at reducing the risk of failure for individual
institutions address governance and managerial incentives. National
supervisors in many countries have increased their monitoring to ensure better
risk management at financial institutions. Numerous measures create special
bank resolution regimes (including living wills). A hoped-for side effect of the
measures is that management will be more aware of the risks inside their own
firms.9 Related efforts, which attempt to better align compensation structures
with prudent risk-taking, will reduce the perverse incentives that drive
managers to increase short-term profits without regard to the long-term risks
imposed on the firm and the system.10
In addition, the BCBS is preparing frameworks to improve supervisory
standards, valuation methods, liquidity arrangements and stress testing.
Improved adherence to international supervisory and regulatory standards is
most certainly a first step. In January 2010, the FSB published a framework on
this topic that is currently being implemented. It contains three main elements:
leading by example; FSB peer reviews; and promoting global adherence to
international financial standards.
The third set of tools seek to increase transparency to enhance market
discipline. For example, the enhancements to the Basel II regulatory
framework published by the BCBS in July 2009 address weaknesses in the
disclosure of securitisation exposures at banks.11 Other measures include
those sought by the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board
to increase the international harmonisation of accounting standards;
implementation of regulation proposed by the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to address the need for stronger standards

8
In November 2008, Switzerland’s banking regulator introduced cyclical capital buffers and liquidity ratios
for the two largest Swiss banks. The capital requirements, to be implemented by 2013, are 50 –100%
above those set in Pillar 1 of the Basel II standard. In March 2010, Ireland’s financial regulator announced
that, by the end of 2010, banks in Ireland will be required to hold capital amounting to 8% of core Tier 1
capital, and capital of the highest quality – equity – must account for 7 percentage points of that amount.
Further amounts, specific to each institution, are to be added in the calculation of future loan losses.
9
Special resolution regimes for large financial firms have been proposed or introduced in several
jurisdictions, including Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Cross-border
resolution plans are also being considered, as discussed below.
10 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has presented guidelines for the reform of the regulatory and
supervisory framework that address these concerns. See FSB principles for sound compensation practices
– implementation standards, September 2009 (based on an April 2009 report issued by the predecessor
organisation, the Financial Stability Forum). The FSB reviewed progress in the implementation of those
standards in Thematic review of compensation, March 2010.

and oversight for credit rating agencies; and improvements of disclosures
more generally.

Reducing the chance of system-wide failure
We want to eliminate unnecessary instabilities in the structure of individual
institutions in the ways just described, but we still want a system in which
individual institutions can fail.12 What we do not want is a system in which
many fail at once, whether because they have a common exposure to a risk or
because a single institution is so large or interconnected that its failure brings
on a system-wide failure, creating a cascade of insolvencies.
The problem of common exposures is relatively straightforward. It means
that a financial landscape dotted with a large number of small yet identical
institutions will be just as prone to collapse as a system with a small number
of financial behemoths. To guard against either type of weakness, all that
regulators and supervisors have to do in principle is ensure that intermediaries
are not all equally subject to the same stresses.
The bigger challenge is preventing a single financial institution from
creating a cascade of failures. Doing that involves three tasks: (i) reducing the
systemic importance of financial institutions; (ii) minimising spillovers from an
institution’s failure by ensuring that the costs of failure will be borne by the
institution’s unsecured liability holders; and (iii) bringing all systemically
relevant financial institutions and activities within the regulatory perimeter and
keeping them there. In all three of these areas, we see progress both through
the regulation and the supervision of individual institutions – in many cases
representing welcome steps towards adopting a macroprudential approach –
and through the reform of market structures.

Reducing systemic importance. The first task – preventing a financial institution
from becoming so big or so interconnected that its failure could not be
tolerated – means confronting the systemic risks that its potential failure
creates. Systemic risk is like pollution. We employ a variety of means to
discourage people from dumping waste into the air or water. Likewise, we
have a variety of means that could discourage institutions from contributing
to systemic risk; among them are scope constraints and pricing policies.
On scope, policymakers are contemplating rules that would variously
limit the extent of financial intermediaries’ activities or simply limit the asset
size of institutions. An example of the activity limit is the Volcker proposal,
which would ban depository banks in the United States from proprietary
trading.13
Under pricing policies, banks and other institutions could be forced to pay
for the privilege of creating systemic risk. Among the several possible
approaches, a so-called systemic capital charge in the form of capital or

12 Nonetheless, in smaller countries with a small number of institutions, all of which are of systemic
importance, the only option is to eliminate nearly all possibility of failure.
13 Statement of Paul A Volcker before the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, US Senate,
Washington DC, 2 February 2010.

16

BIS 80th Annual Report

liquidity charges appears to be the best. The charge would compel systemically
important institutions to hold relatively more capital and liquidity, thereby
reducing the probability of their failure. In theory a tax system could achieve
the same objectives with the same incidence as a systemic capital charge, but
the ultimate complexities of the solution make it unappealing.14

Containing resolution costs and spillovers. Limiting the systemic importance
of institutions will help us achieve the second task – containing spillovers by
making an institution’s liability holders bear all costs of a failure. We can do
that if, before any failure occurs, we are able to identify where risk is
concentrated in the system and we have sound and transparent resolution
processes in place. This task has obvious international aspects, and the
transparency issue has implications for the structure of financial markets.
As the recent crisis taught us, resolution processes must include crossborder crisis management and resolution if we hope to limit spillovers from
the failure of a large, globally active financial institution.15 Measures aimed at
coordinating the supervision of such institutions to ensure consistency across
national authorities will allow regulators to step in ahead of a crisis.
In a supervisory college, national authorities involved in the supervision of
a large, internationally active financial intermediary meet to coordinate their
efforts. International progress on creating supervisory colleges for every large,
global intermediary is a combined project of the FSB, the BCBS and the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The European
Commission has already mandated such a scheme for the European Union.16
Regarding the market implications, information asymmetries are the fuel
that feeds financial panics. In the 2007–09 crisis, we saw contagion ignited by
uncertainty over counterparty exposures – not knowing who will bear losses
should they occur. Transparency and information are the keys to any solution,
including for markets. One of the core reforms to market infrastructure is the
conceptually simple but technically complex move to establish central
counterparties (CCPs) and require that more trading take place on registered
exchanges. Shifting trading away from a primarily bilateral, over-the-counter
system to one dominated by CCPs has a number of clear benefits. It improves
the management of counterparty risk because the CCP is the counterparty for
both sides of any transaction. It makes multilateral netting of exposures and
payments straightforward. And it increases transparency by making information

14 A third and much less palatable alternative is to tax all financial institutions ex post for the costs that
large failures impose on the public treasury. The problem with this tax is that it provides no effective
disincentive to take additional risk.
15 A number of steps are being taken to address this problem. In March 2010, the BCBS published a set
of recommendations. An FSB working group is looking at the resolution of financial firms under existing
national frameworks and how the frameworks would interact; by October 2010, the FSB expects to issue
principles to help harmonise those frameworks. The IMF has also been reviewing means of effective
resolution for cross-border financial institutions.
16 All European cross-border banking groups will need to have a supervisory college in place by
end-2010 following requirements in the 2009 amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD2);
and the Solvency II Directive requires that colleges be established for all cross-border insurance groups
by end-October 2012.

on market activity and exposures – both prices and quantities – available to
regulators and the public.17
Fortunately, legislators and regulators see the advantages of CCPs and of
centralised clearing and exchange trading and are making significant progress
on associated reforms that will improve systemic safety.18

Establishing a comprehensive regulatory perimeter. The third task, including
and keeping all systemically relevant financial institutions and activities within
the regulatory perimeter, arises from the lesson learned at high cost during
the financial crisis. Some progress has been made in this area – for instance,
the Joint Forum has recommended a broad set of measures that address the
consistency and inclusiveness of regulation across financial sectors and
products19 – but much still needs to be done.

Prescription: reducing procyclicality
As noted above, writing prescriptions for a more resilient financial system
means addressing the risks arising from two types of externalities. We have
covered the first type – joint failures arising from common exposures and
linkages. The second type, procyclicality, refers to the amplifying feedback
effects between the financial system and the real economy. The basics of the
procyclicality problem are straightforward. As the economy booms, lending
tends to become easier and cheaper. Banks are flush with funds and capital,
borrowers are more creditworthy, and collateral is more valuable. In a
downturn, these conditions are reversed. Banks are forced to absorb
unexpected losses, which makes them less well capitalised, so they cut back
on lending. Borrowers become less creditworthy. And collateral values fall.
Monetary and prudential authorities are developing automatic stabilisers
that complement discretionary monetary policy to reduce the natural
amplification effects at work in the financial system. As discussed in detail in
Chapter VII, these stabilisers are a key element of a macroprudential policy

18 A number of steps towards greater use of CCPs have been taken, among them: the establishment of
the OTC derivatives regulators forum in September 2009; the commitment, also this past September, by
G15 major derivatives dealers to achieve specific target levels for central clearing of OTC credit
derivatives; recommendations in January 2010 by the Joint Forum of banking, insurance and securities
regulators to strengthen regulatory oversight of credit transfer products; revised standards for CCPs to
better address risks associated with clearing OTC derivatives published by the Committee on Payment
and Settlement Systems and IOSCO in May 2010; Basel Committee proposals that adjust capital
requirements in a way that encourages a shift from OTC exposures to CCPs; and proposed reform
legislation in Europe and the United States.

In January 2010, the Joint Forum, composed of the BCBS, IOSCO and the IAIS, published its report
Review of the differentiated nature and scope of financial regulation: key issues and recommendations.
The report recommended a range of measures to address the appropriateness of the regulatory
perimeter, including: harmonising regulation across the banking, insurance and securities sectors;
strengthening the supervision and regulation of financial groups, particularly those providing crossborder services; establishing consistent and effective underwriting standards for mortgage origination;
broadening the scope of regulation to include hedge fund activities; and strengthening regulatory
oversight of credit transfer products.

framework. They include: capital buffers that are calibrated to aggregate levels
of credit relative to economic activity so that they rise in booms and fall in
busts; through-the-cycle provisioning; and margin and haircut practices at
lenders that are more stable over the business cycle. Capital buffers and
through-the-cycle provisioning are being addressed by the BCBS. Margin and
haircut practices are the subject of a recent report by the Committee on the
Global Financial System.20 A variety of countercyclical supervisory instruments
under development are also discussed in Chapter VII, including variation in
maximum allowable loan-to-value ratios and limits on currency mismatch.

Reforms: key areas of unfinished business
Policymakers have made significant progress towards building a more stable
financial system. The reforms in train should be enacted and enforced. But
more is needed. On the regulatory side, while work on institutions continues,
markets and instruments require more attention. And efforts should be
redoubled to ensure that the regulatory perimeter remains robust to the
inevitable efforts to erode it. Also needed is a clearer recognition that better
regulation will not be enough – macroeconomic policies have an essential role
to play, and their frameworks must be expanded to obtain the more stable
system needed.
As we wrote last year, success in building a safer financial system means
identifying and mitigating systemic risk in all three principal components of the
system: markets and instruments, as well as institutions.21 They must all be
made safer and more transparent without impairing productivity-enhancing
innovation or their essential function of improving the allocative efficiency
of the economy. For markets, initiatives to introduce centralised clearing
and settlement for OTC derivatives represent a helpful improvement to
infrastructure and a first step towards requiring trading on organised
exchanges.
For instruments, as discussed in last year’s Annual Report, one approach
to balancing innovation and safety is to require some form of product
registration that limits investor access to instruments according to their degree
of safety. Steps already taken in that direction include efforts to improve
instrument standardisation and documentation, including those that facilitate
the use of central counterparties, and efforts to better inform consumers by
strengthening disclosures on investment products. But those steps should be
just the start of more comprehensive reforms.
In a dynamic, market-based economy, in which the primary incentive is to
increase profitability, we must expect that financial institutions will always seek
to test the boundaries of regulation and escape the perimeter or place some of
their activities beyond it, whenever and wherever they can. Regulators should

not stifle innovation, but they have to ensure that the ground rules apply to new
ways of doing business. In other words, all systemically important financial
institutions – no matter how big or small, no matter what their legal form – must
be prevented from escaping the view and reach of regulators and supervisors.
That is especially true for macroprudential supervision, which – as the crisis
showed – must always be on the watch for threats to stability emerging from
obscure corners of the financial system.
Yet regulatory reform alone is not enough to deliver financial stability.
Monetary and fiscal policies also have a role, but if they are to play it, their
frameworks must become broader-gauged and more forward-looking. As
emphasised in Chapter VII, interest rates and countercyclical prudential
policies are complementary tools for delivering a more resilient financial
system. However, improved awareness of the implications of interest rate
policy for asset prices and debt need not come at the expense of the traditional
central bank objectives. Rather, monetary and prudential policies are essential
partners in delivering high and stable growth.
On the fiscal policy front, reform must put authorities in a position where
they can offset recessionary deficits with surpluses during booms and still have
some ammunition left for emergencies.
Moreover, national authorities must be mindful that they operate in a
global environment. For many emerging market economies, this means
that they must act knowing that capital flows can be destabilising, foreign
exchange reserve accumulation is no panacea, and export-led growth with
persistent current account imbalances cannot go on indefinitely. Above all –
as Chapter IV concludes – to promote orderly macroeconomic adjustment and
balanced global growth, there is no substitute for tighter monetary policy
conditions and increased exchange rate flexibility.

Conclusion
The financial disruptions in the first half of 2010 have brought the fragility of the
industrial world’s financial system into stark relief: a shock of virtually any size
risks a replay of the events we saw in late 2008 and early 2009. The sovereign
debt crisis in Greece is clearly jeopardising Europe’s nascent recovery from
the deep recession brought on by the earlier crisis.
Unlike then, however, we have hardly any room for manoeuvre. Policy
rates are already at zero and central bank balance sheets are bloated.
Although private sector debt has started to decline, public debt has taken its
place, with sovereign fiscal positions already on an unsustainable path in a
number of countries. In short, macroeconomic policy is in a vastly worse
position than it was three years ago, with little capacity to combat a new crisis
– it will be difficult to find a source of further treatment should another
emergency arise. Regaining the ability to react to economic and financial
crises, by putting policies onto sustainable paths, is therefore a priority for
macroeconomic policy.
For fiscal policy, the sizeable fiscal consolidation needed urgently in a
number of industrial countries should generally take two forms: reductions in

20

BIS 80th Annual Report

current deficits and action that ensures long-term fiscal sustainability. For
monetary policy, the fragility of the macroeconomy may be delaying tightening.
But policymakers should not lose sight of the risks to financial and
macroeconomic stability arising from a long period of very low interest rates.
The side effects will continue to cumulate – eventually reinforcing precisely
those factors that contributed to the fragility of the financial system and made
it crisis-prone in the first place.
Finishing the reforms to the financial system, particularly those that will
quickly increase its resilience, has acquired even greater urgency. They can
provide the most immediate protection to the financial system in the event of a
new crisis. Moreover, acting now to improve the capital base and the liquidity
of bank balance sheets will not jeopardise the recovery. Rather – by making
financial institutions sounder – those actions will promote a sustainable
recovery.
Those efforts will bring us closer to the long-term goal of making future
crises less likely and less severe. Finishing that job means tackling remaining
reforms without delay: implementing an impermeable regulatory perimeter
for all systemically important financial institutions, addressing systemic
weaknesses in financial market infrastructure and instruments, and integrating
financial stability concerns in macroeconomic policy frameworks.

II. From the emergency room to intensive care: the
year in retrospect

Asset prices and economic activity have rebounded from the lows they reached
during the financial crisis. The slide in financial market prices triggered by the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 halted in March 2009,
when prices of risky assets began rising, in some cases substantially. Global
economic activity stabilised in the middle of that year and began to expand
thereafter. The financial imbalances that lie behind the crisis have begun to
correct. Banks have started to repair their balance sheets and reduce leverage,
although the process is far from complete. Households in some of the countries
most affected by the crisis have also started to reduce their indebtedness, but
debt levels have fallen much less than after previous crises.
Recovery is thus under way, but it is fragile. The unprecedented policy
actions taken over the last three years have been successful in preventing
another Great Depression, but they are reaching their limits. Government
deficits have soared to an extent that raises questions about the sustainability
of public finances (see Chapter V). Indeed, public indebtedness has replaced
private indebtedness as investors’ main concern, as indicated by the
turbulence in financial markets in the second quarter of 2010. In response,
several countries have announced measures to consolidate their budgets.
In this environment, monetary policy faces a dilemma. On the one hand,
raising interest rates and shrinking bloated central bank balance sheets too
early could undermine the recovery. Tightening too late, on the other hand,
could delay the necessary adjustment process and result in a less stable
financial system in the medium term (see Chapter III).

Recovery uncertain
Market rebound
Recovery in financial markets preceded the upswing in economic activity in
the major advanced economies. Key economic indicators remained at
depressed levels in the first quarter of 2009, but investors focused on incipient
signs that economic conditions might stabilise sooner rather than later.
Between March 2009 and April 2010, equity prices around the world gained
strongly, although they remained below their pre-crisis peaks (Graph II.1).
Credit spreads narrowed to a level roughly in line with their long-term average,
implied volatilities fell to their lowest levels since the middle of 2007, and
government bond yields, particularly in the United States, rose from the lows
reached in late 2008. As tensions in money markets eased and banks became
more willing to lend to each other, the spread of Libor above the overnight
index swap (OIS) rate dropped sharply from its late 2008 peak.

Fears of sovereign
risk threaten to
derail financial
recovery

Graph II.1

Many, but not all, of the markets that had seized up during the crisis
started to function again. In late 2008, government guarantees had prompted
financial institutions to issue bonds, and non-guaranteed issuance followed in
2009. Non-financial corporations placed more bonds in the first half of 2009
than in the six months immediately preceding the crisis, although these gains
may have partly reflected the dearth of bank financing. Indeed, bank lending
to the private sector in the major advanced economies either stagnated or
contracted, and the market for securitised products continued to be weak. In
the United States for example, where the bulk of mortgages are securitised,
issuance of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are not backed by the
government remains at depressed levels.
The financial recovery during much of 2009 and early 2010 has been
impressive, but it is under threat. Concerns about the sustainability of public
finances and bank health triggered bouts of volatility in late 2009 and again in
early 2010. However, these were minor compared with the sell-off that took
place in April and May 2010, when risky asset prices fell sharply on investor

worries about the ability of Greece and, to a lesser extent, Portugal and Spain
to service their debts. Policymakers responded with the largest rescue
package in history and a new set of central bank emergency measures. These
measures succeeded in halting contagion in the euro area, but were not able
to restore investor confidence more broadly.

Uneven economic recovery
The decline in global economic activity began to slow in the second quarter of
2009 and gave way to growth towards the middle of the year. The size of both
the contraction and the expansion varied greatly across countries (Graph II.2,
left-hand panel). China, India and Poland avoided a contraction altogether –
output growth merely slowed and then soon returned to pre-crisis rates. In
Australia and Brazil, output contracted briefly but then grew fast to quickly
surpass pre-crisis levels. In contrast, by the first quarter of 2010, output in the
United States, the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom remained below
its pre-crisis level.
The drop in economic activity resulted in a steep rise in unemployment
in a number of countries, particularly those in which a construction boom had
preceded the crisis. Unemployment shot up by more than 8 percentage points
in Spain and Ireland and by almost 5 percentage points in the United States as
oversize construction sectors shed workers (Graph II.2, centre panel). In Spain,
the high share of temporary employment also contributed to the sensitivity of
unemployment to changes in output.1 Unemployment in the United States rose

to its highest level since the 1930s, even though GDP contracted less than in
most other advanced economies.
The employment consequences in most of the other advanced economies
were less severe. Job losses were particularly limited in some continental
European economies and in Japan. For example, unemployment in Germany
increased by just over 1 percentage point, despite a relatively large (6.5%)
drop in GDP. Helping to limit the job losses were measures that allow
reductions in hours by individual workers without laying them off. In Japan, a
combination of the Employment Adjustment Subsidy Programme and a decline
in hourly wages reduced incentives to lay off workers. Unemployment rose by
less than 2 percentage points, despite a fall in GDP of more than 8%.
The recovery in the large advanced economies is still far from selfsustained. In the G3, inventory rebuilding accounted for most of the 2.5%
annualised rate of growth in the first quarter of 2010 (Graph II.2, right-hand
panel). Private investment remained in negative territory for the eighth quarter
in a row, thus continuing to be a drag on economic growth. That said, few of
the adverse growth scenarios identified by forecasters during the period under
review have materialised.
A completely different picture has arisen in a number of emerging market
economies (EMEs). Expansionary policies at home, combined with the impact
of loose monetary and fiscal policies in the large advanced economies, have
resulted in signs of overheating in some cases (see Chapter IV). Wholesale
price inflation in India approached 10% in early 2010, and inflationary
pressures are also appearing in other EMEs.

Rapidly growing fiscal deficits raise sovereign risk concerns
Build-up of
government debt
fuelled concerns
about sovereign
risk …

The combination of large-scale fiscal stimulus plans, financial rescue packages
and falling tax revenues has led to historically large government budget
deficits and record levels of actual and projected public debt in most industrial
countries (Graph II.3, left-hand panel). These burdens come at a time when
governments in advanced economies are already facing the rapid growth of
unfunded implicit obligations related to their ageing populations. That
confluence of factors has raised serious concerns about the sustainability of
fiscal policy in the industrial world (see Chapter V), thus heightening worries
about sovereign risk. As a consequence, bond yields and credit default swap
(CDS) spreads on the government debt of several countries rose significantly
during the past year (Graph II.3, centre panel), prompting unprecedented
policy responses on several fronts.
Sovereign risk concerns first arose following the large financial rescue
packages and substantial fiscal stimulus programmes announced in late 2008
and early 2009. Those worries then remained relatively subdued for much of
2009, overshadowed by concerns about the slowdown in global economic
activity and the associated rise in unemployment. Sovereign risk first came to
the fore in November 2009, when sovereign CDS spreads on Dubai rose
sharply after Dubai World, one of the country’s three strategic investment
vehicles, unexpectedly announced that it was seeking a moratorium on its
debt payments.

Graph II.3

In late 2009, the spotlight shifted to the euro area, where large budget
deficits in several countries led to the prospect of rapidly increasing government
debt/GDP ratios. Worries centred on the fiscal situation in Greece, but also
extended to other countries facing a toxic combination of high fiscal deficits
and lack of competitiveness, such as Portugal and Spain. Greek sovereign bond
yields and CDS spreads started to drift upwards in December 2009 and then
exploded at the end of April 2010, when Standard & Poor’s downgraded Greek
debt to “junk” status. Within the same week, the agency went on to lower its
ratings of Portugal and Spain, triggering sharp increases in their CDS spreads
as well. In early May, euro area member countries and the IMF undertook to
provide a joint €110 billion emergency loan package for Greece after its
government pledged to implement severe austerity measures. Within days of
the announcement, however, it became clear that this was not sufficient to
calm investors’ nerves. In response to soaring bond and CDS spreads, EU and
IMF policymakers announced a €750 billion joint fiscal stabilisation package.
In the wake of this announcement, sovereign bond and CDS spreads declined
substantially from the highs they had reached during the previous week.
Governments that pre-emptively announced consolidation measures were
more immune to market pressures. Overall, the magnitudes of the changes in
sovereign CDS spreads in the euro area were positively, albeit not perfectly,
correlated with the budget deficits of the respective governments (Graph II.3,
right-hand panel). But in the case of Ireland, government debt spreads
remained relatively stable during 2009 and early 2010, although the country’s
budget deficit for the 2007–11 period is projected to be higher than those of
Portugal and Spain and close to that of Greece.2 The stability of the spreads

most likely reflected a combination of credible austerity measures announced
pre-emptively by Ireland’s government in March 2009 and a more favourable
outlook for economic growth.
The importance of timely fiscal consolidation was underscored in May,
when the austerity measures announced by the governments of Greece,
Portugal and Spain met with a lukewarm response in financial markets. Bond
and CDS spreads declined on the announcement of the fiscal tightening
packages, but by less than they did in reaction to the €750 billion joint EU-IMF
fiscal stabilisation package. Investors apparently regarded the austerity
measures, which included public sector wage cuts, tax hikes and increases
in the retirement age, as merely the initial steps on a long but inevitable
journey of fiscal consolidation. And they continue to harbour serious
questions about the ability and resolve of governments to carry out these
austerity measures.
Worries about sovereign risk quickly spilled over into the banking sector.
Not surprisingly, they had the greatest impact on equity prices and credit
spreads for banks headquartered in the countries whose perceived
creditworthiness had deteriorated the most (Greece, Portugal and Spain).
Nevertheless, other euro area banks were also significantly affected because
of their higher relative exposures to the public sectors of these countries.
At the end of 2009, five euro area banking systems (those of Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands) held roughly 17% of all
outstanding Greek government debt, equivalent to some 6.5% of these
banking systems’ combined Tier 1 capital. Similarly, their exposures to the
public sectors of Spain and Portugal stood at 8.9% and 4.1% of their Tier 1
capital, respectively.3

Monetary policy still highly stimulative

Tightening in some

countries …

Monetary policy remains highly expansionary almost everywhere, although
central banks in some of the faster-growing countries have started to withdraw
the stimulus put in place during the crisis. Policy rates in the larger advanced
economies remain at record lows, and central bank balance sheets have barely
shrunk from the bloated levels reached during the crisis (Graph II.4). Shortterm interest rates close to zero are holding down the cost of funding and
propping up the net present value of future payment streams. In addition,
central bank asset purchases have pushed up asset prices directly and
indirectly.
The unevenness of the economic recovery left its imprint on central bank
policy. In late 2008 and early 2009, the key challenge for central banks
worldwide had been to prevent the complete collapse of the financial system
and to limit the contraction in economic activity. As the recovery progressed,
the challenges started to diverge across regions. The central banks of
Australia, Brazil, India, Israel, Malaysia and Norway all increased policy rates

as the threat of a severe contraction receded and inflationary pressures
emerged, although rates remain low by historical standards. The Reserve Bank
of India also raised reserve requirements for its banks. A similar step was
taken by the People’s Bank of China to rein in rapid credit growth.
By contrast, the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan and Bank of
England all kept policy rates at the lows reached during the crisis. Exit from the
extraordinary policy measures of the past couple of years had been under way
until May 2010, when the turbulence in euro area government bond markets led
to a number of new measures as well as the reinstatement of some previous
ones. By this time, the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve had terminated
most of the liquidity facilities that were introduced during the crisis. The Federal
Reserve’s swap lines with other central banks formally expired in February
2010, though some partner central banks had already discontinued some or all
of their dollar auctions well before that. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of
England had stopped buying securities under their massive asset purchase
programmes, although they did not reduce the accumulated holdings.4 The
ECB had discontinued its special three-month, six-month and 12-month
refinancing operations.
The deterioration of financial conditions, especially in the euro area,
in April and May 2010 led to the introduction of yet another round of

These holdings can have expansionary effects even though actual purchases have ended, since they
influence the relative supply of securities and thus their relative price, given that assets are imperfect
substitutes. To empirically identify the magnitude of this “portfolio balance effect” is difficult.
Nevertheless, a recent study indicates that the portfolio balance effect was responsible for most of the
significant decline in long-term yields on a wide range of securities that followed Federal Reserve asset
purchases. See J Gagnon, M Raskin, J Remache and B Sack, “Large-scale asset purchases by the
Federal Reserve: did they work?”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Reports, no 441, March 2010.

unconventional policy measures. As part of the giant rescue package approved
on 10 May, the ECB announced that it would purchase securities issued by
euro area member states in an effort to provide liquidity and support market
functioning. It also reintroduced six-month tenders. The Federal Reserve
brought back the swap lines with other central banks to address resurgent
concerns about dollar funding shortages of non-US banks (see below).
The generally very expansionary stance of monetary policy will have to be
tightened at some point, for a number of reasons. First, although output in the
countries most affected by the crisis is still well below potential, the amount of
slack could be smaller than suggested by conventional measures of the output
gap. The build-up of imbalances in the run-up to the crisis suggests that
potential output growth during that period may not have been as high as
believed at the time. Moreover, the financial disruptions caused by the crisis
and the lost skills of the long-term unemployed could reduce potential output
for some time to come. Inflationary pressures could therefore reappear earlier
than anticipated. Second, low interest rates cause distortions that could have
unpleasant side effects (see Chapter III). That said, the consolidation of public
finances in a number of countries implies less fiscal stimulus, which in turn
will affect monetary policy.

Fragile banks
Following a devastating 2008, balance sheets improved at many of the major
US and European banks. After capital injections pulled the banking system
back from the brink, rising asset prices and a steepening yield curve helped
banks return to profitability in 2009 (Table II.1). As investors’ fears of imminent

collapse abated throughout the year, banks’ CDS spreads and bond spreads
narrowed considerably (Graph II.5, left-hand panel).
Overall, the new capital injected into banks, much of it from governments,
has almost matched banks’ revealed losses during the crisis. Total revealed
losses and writedowns reached $1,306 billion by mid-April 2010, compared with
$1,236 billion in new capital raised by banks.5 At the end of 2009, the new capital
acquired by US and European banks – combined with slower credit growth
and their shift into safer government securities and liquid assets – helped
push their Tier 1 capital ratios to the highest levels in 15 years (Graph II.5,
right-hand panel).
Despite the improvement in banks’ balance sheets, several factors raise
doubts about the sustainability of bank profits. First, for many European and
US banks, profits in 2009 were based heavily on revenues from trading in fixed
income and currency markets, which tend to be volatile (Table II.1). Loan-todeposit ratios for many large international banks fell in 2009. And aggregate
data for the United States, the euro area and Japan show that credit extended
to the private sector (Graph II.7, left-hand panel) shrank in 2009, following its
slowdown in mid-2008 as banks tightened lending standards.
Second, low volatility and the steep yield curve, particularly at the short
end, provided incentives for banks to take on duration risk. Carry-to-risk ratios
for such strategies increased substantially until April 2010 (Graph II.1, bottom
right-hand panel). Amid stagnant corporate and residential lending, banks were
able to generate profits simply by channelling funds into longer-dated defaultfree securities. As a consequence, they became exposed to the risk that a

By mid-April 2010, North American banks had raised $518 billion in new capital, amounting to 72% of
their recorded losses. European banks had raised $341 billion, roughly the same amount as their revealed
losses. The capital raised by Asian banks totalled more than three times their $34 billion in revealed losses.

flattening of the yield curve could raise their funding costs or result in mark to
market losses on their assets side.
Third, it is not clear whether all crisis-related losses have been
recognised. For example, less stringent and less timely reporting requirements
for banks in Europe have made it more difficult to ascertain the extent of
future writedowns by these institutions. In addition, there is growing
evidence that further losses can be expected from exposure to the commercial
real estate sector. Commercial property values in the United States are
down by more than one third from their peak, and the delinquency rate
on commercial real estate loans has risen to more than 8%, double the
rate at end-2008 and more than four times the rate at end-2006. Commercial
property markets in many European countries have not fared much better. In
Ireland and the United Kingdom, in particular, commercial property prices
have fallen by 39% and 46% respectively since their peak, and losses on
European bank balance sheets are expected to mount over the next few
years. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some banks have taken to rolling
over existing loans rather than inducing foreclosure, thus delaying loss
recognition.
Fourth, banks are highly exposed to sovereign risk, as was highlighted by
the sharp drop in the equity prices of banks with particularly high holdings of
Greek, Portuguese and Spanish government debt in the second quarter of
2010. The risk of such exposures had been long recognised in the case of
banks in EMEs but had been ignored in the advanced economies.
Fifth, banks may find it difficult to refinance given the expected demand
for funds by governments with significant borrowing needs. Funding maturities
have shortened to the lowest in 30 years (Graph II.6, centre panel), which
raises refinancing needs. Moreover, some 60% of banks’ long-term debt flows
come due over the next three years (Graph II.6, left-hand panel). Indeed,
widening Libor-OIS spreads after April 2010 (Graph II.1, bottom left-hand
panel) provide evidence that unsecured wholesale funding has become more
expensive. That said, these spreads are still tiny compared with their levels at
the height of the crisis in late 2008.
Finally, many banks in Europe and elsewhere still rely heavily on the
foreign exchange swap market to finance US dollar assets. Overall, European
banks still have an estimated $7 trillion in dollar-denominated assets on their
balance sheets, which tend to have long maturities. And those European
banking systems which had long dollar positions going into the crisis (German-,
Dutch-, Swiss- and UK-headquartered banks) still have substantial funding
needs. Lower bound estimates of their required short-term US dollar funding
stood at just over $500 billion at end-2009 (Graph II.6, right-hand panel). With
heightened credit risk concerns surrounding these banks’ exposures to Greek
and other European sovereign debt, providers of short-term funds have once
again become reluctant to extend dollar funding. On 9 May 2010, as part of a
comprehensive policy package to address the growing risk of contagion among
euro area sovereigns and financial institutions, the Federal Reserve and other
major central banks re-established temporary foreign exchange swap facilities
to alleviate the growing strains.

Household debt levels: where do we stand?
Before the crisis, household debt had increased substantially in a number of
advanced economies.6 The historical record suggests that financial crises
associated with credit booms have often been followed by a long period of debt
reduction in the private sector as firms and households repair their balance
sheets. Indeed, in most of the 24 systemic banking crises analysed in the box
on the following page, the ratio of private sector credit to GDP fell substantially
for several years after the crisis, reversing most of the increase which had
occurred during the preceding credit boom.7 That record suggests that
household debt ratios, which increased rapidly in many countries in the run-up
to the current crisis, will have to adjust further.
The private debt reduction process has already begun. Credit to the
private sector in the major advanced economies (except Japan) had expanded
strongly in the years before the crisis but contracted markedly in 2009 and
early 2010 as banks tightened lending standards (Graph II.7).8
Households in the countries that experienced real estate-related credit
booms have started to reduce their debt levels. By the end of 2009, the ratio of
household debt to disposable income in the United States and Spain had
declined by 7 percentage points from its respective peaks in 2007 and 2008

See BIS, 79th Annual Report, June 2009, pp 4–7.

debt are not available for most of the episodes.

By contrast, credit continued to expand – or even accelerated – in many emerging market economies.

Credit dynamics after crises: the historical record
Financial crises are often followed by protracted debt reduction. In a sample of 24 systemic banking
crises, 15 were followed by substantial declines in the ratio of credit to GDP. The average such
peak-to-trough decline was 39 percentage points, or roughly 8 percentage points per year. The decline
in the ratio was only slightly smaller than the preceding increase (48 percentage points on average).
Perhaps surprisingly, the degree of debt reduction did not differ much across emerging market and
advanced economies. After their banking crises of the early 1990s, the ratio of credit to GDP dropped
44 percentage points in Finland, 38 points in Norway and 35 points in Sweden, roughly in line with the
sample average. In Japan, the private sector credit ratio fell 25 percentage points after peaking in the
late 1990s. In most countries, the initial decline in debt ratios was driven primarily by a drop in real credit
outstanding; in the later years of deleveraging, GDP growth was the main driver.
The economic costs of deleveraging are hard to discern at such an aggregate level. Output grew at
an average annual rate of 2.4% during the post-crisis debt reduction phase, moderately below the
average growth rate during the preceding credit boom. But output growth varied widely across countries
during the post-crisis period: in Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, for example, output slowed
considerably; in other countries, growth accelerated.


The sample is taken from S Cecchetti, M Kohler and C Upper, “Financial crises and economic activity”, paper presented at
the symposium on Financial stability and economic policy organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, 20–22 August 2009. Of the 40 crises analysed in the paper, six were dropped because of the poor quality of
the credit data. Another 10 cases – the two that took place in periods of hyperinflation and the eight that occurred during
transitions from socialism to a market economy – were discarded as being unlikely to offer any insights relevant to the current
situation.

seen before the housing booms took off. The historical record thus suggests
that substantial further debt reduction is still to come.

Summing up
Financial and economic recovery is under way, but it is both incomplete and
fragile, at least in the major advanced economies. Monetary policy is still highly
stimulative almost everywhere, despite first steps towards a more neutral policy
stance in some economies. Fiscal policy remains expansionary, causing
government debt levels to rise at an alarming pace. Banks have returned to
profitability and reduced leverage, but several factors raise doubts about the
sustainability of their profits and their ability to obtain funding. Private
investment remains weak, and economic growth is still largely driven by
inventory rebuilding. At the same time, a number of emerging market
economies are facing quite the opposite problem: the direct impact of the crisis
on output was smaller than feared, and the expansionary policies employed
both domestically and abroad have boosted output growth to the point of
overheating.
Tighter fiscal policy is on the horizon. The re-evaluation by market
participants of the sustainability of public finances has already forced a number
of euro area economies to introduce austerity measures, which are bound to
have much more contractionary effects than a timely exit would have implied.
Monetary policymakers will have to take into account the effects of fiscal
consolidation when deciding on when to normalise their policy stance. That
said, in addition to the obvious risks of tightening too early there are also risks
associated with tightening too late. Cutting interest rates to record lows was
necessary to prevent the complete collapse of the financial system and the real
economy, but keeping them low for too long could also delay the necessary
adjustment to a more sustainable economic and financial model.

BIS 80th Annual Report

35

III. Low interest rates: do the risks outweigh the
rewards?

Central banks around the world first reacted to the economic downturn caused
by the financial turmoil by aggressively cutting interest rates. As a result, policy
rates in the main advanced economies range currently between zero and 1%,
leaving little to no room for additional cuts to accommodate any further
negative shocks (Graph III.1). In real terms, rates are around zero in the euro
area and negative in the United Kingdom and the United States. In Japan, by
contrast, mild deflation has pushed real rates just above zero again.
As the crisis worsened, central banks adopted unconventional policies to
help prevent what many observers feared might become a second Great
Depression.1 Among other things, they provided extensive liquidity in domestic
currency, made use of swap arrangements to offer foreign currency to domestic
institutions and intervened in fixed income markets. The unconventional
measures significantly increased the size and altered the composition of
central bank balance sheets (Graph II.4). Governments complemented the
central bank response by supporting individual financial institutions and
providing substantial fiscal stimulus (see Chapter V).

Policymakers have
started pondering
the exit

Low interest rates
and unconventional
monetary policies
cause distortions …

… that may create
problems in the
future

In the early months of 2010, when the danger of a financial meltdown
seemed to have passed and the macroeconomy appeared to be on the road to
recovery, policymakers in the major advanced economies began considering
their options for exiting from their crisis-related positions.2 While the
developments in the Greek sovereign bond market and the related turbulence
in April and May led some central banks to revise their envisaged timing for
these decisions, the commitment to an eventual exit has not changed. It
remains the case that the timing of the exit from unconventional monetary
policy can be determined independently from the exit from low interest rates.
The exact sequencing of the exit from those two areas will probably differ
across economies, depending on the relative speeds of recovery in financial
markets and real activity.
As they make these decisions, policymakers will need to consider the
distortions caused by prolonged conditions of monetary ease. After all,
sustained low interest rates have been identified by many as an important
factor that contributed to the crisis (see BIS, 79th Annual Report, Chapter I).
At the same time, policymakers should also closely monitor the distortions
arising from unconventional monetary policy tools. These include price
distortions in bond markets that can result from changes in central banks’
criteria for eligible repo collateral and from their asset purchases. Artificially
high asset prices in certain markets might delay the necessary restructuring of
private sector balance sheets. There are also distortions in market activity that
arise from central banks’ increased intermediation during the crisis. Moreover,
the asset purchases have exposed central banks to considerable credit risk,
which together with the changed balance sheet composition may expose
them to political pressures.
History offers little guidance on the economic significance of the side
effects of unconventional monetary policy. By contrast, distortions arising from
low interest rates have been observed in the past. In this chapter, we review
these risks in the current context and argue that, if not addressed soon, they
may contain the seeds of future problems at home and abroad. In doing so, we
draw on lessons from the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007– 09 and on
Japanese experiences since the mid-1990s.

Domestic side effects of low interest rates
Low interest rates

misallocations
before the crisis …

… and are now
delaying necessary
adjustments

Previous episodes of low interest rates suggest that loose monetary policy can
be associated with credit booms, asset price increases, a decline in risk
spreads and a search for yield. Together, these caused severe misallocations
of resources in the years before the crisis, as evidenced by the excessive
growth of the financial industry and the construction sector. The necessary
structural adjustments are painful and will take time.
In the current setting, low policy rates raise additional concerns since
they are accompanied by considerably higher long-term rates. This may lead

down naturally as markets have started to recover.

to a growing exposure to interest rate risk and delays in the restructuring of
the balance sheets of both the private and public sector. The situation is
further complicated because low interest rates may have caused a lasting
decline in money market activity, which would make the task of exiting from
loose monetary policy more delicate.

Decline of measured and perceived risk
Standard economic models predict that a decrease in real interest rates causes
faster credit growth, if it is expected to be sustained. Moreover, it raises asset
prices since it drives down the discount factor for future cash flows. Other
things equal, this leads to a rise in the value of collateral, which may induce
financial institutions to extend more credit and to increase their own leverage to
purchase riskier assets. Rising asset prices are also often associated with
lower price volatility, which is reflected in lower values for commonly used
measures of portfolio riskiness such as value-at-risk (VaR).3 These factors
in turn reinforce the amount of capital invested in risky assets and the
increase in asset prices and lead to a further narrowing of measured risk
spreads.
This mechanism is widely seen as a major driving force behind the
increase in asset prices and the decline in risk spreads in the run-up to the
financial crisis of 2007–09. The crisis then brought a surge in risk premia, a
sharp drop in asset values, higher VaRs and losses for investors, including
highly leveraged players who were not well positioned to bear them. Price
reversals triggered calls on collateral and a mass rush to sell, generating
further price declines.
Starting in the spring of 2009, a fast recovery in global equities and a rise
in house values in many economies (the euro area and Japan are exceptions)
were accompanied by a reduction in corporate bond spreads and other risk
premia (Graphs II.1 and III.2, top panels), though some risk measures have
meanwhile risen again in the context of the Greek sovereign debt crisis.
Reported VaR figures show that risk as measured by potential losses from
banks’ trading positions remains high (Graph III.2, bottom left-hand panel). At
the same time, a primary goal of central bank and government actions during
the 2007–09 crisis was to stop the collapse of asset prices and reduce the risk
of insolvencies. The broad rise in asset prices and the reduction in risk spreads
that took place in 2009 and the early months of 2010 is thus best seen as
reflecting both the success of these policies and a new build-up of potentially
overly risky portfolios.

The search for yield
Risky portfolios can also result from a search for yield, whereby low nominal
policy rates lead investors to take on larger risks in pursuit of higher nominal

returns.4 In the years preceding the financial crisis, many investors targeted a
nominal rate of return that they thought was appropriate based on past
experience. Furthermore, institutional investors, such as insurers and pension
funds, faced pressure to fulfil implied or contractual obligations made to their
customers at a time when nominal returns had been higher; they looked for
those returns in alternative investment opportunities. The fact that many
compensation schemes were linked to nominal returns also contributed to the
search for yield.
A number of symptoms can indicate a search for yield. The first is an
increase in asset prices and a reduction in risk premia. While the recovery in
many asset markets in 2009 and early 2010 in part represented a reversal of
crisis-related risk aversion, the search for yield phenomenon, against the
background of near zero policy rates, may have started to play a role towards
the end of this period.

A second symptom is distorted financial innovation. In the early 2000s,
intermediaries responded to investors’ desire for higher returns by engineering
financial products that appeared to minimise the risk associated with them.
A large variety of these “structured” products were widely sold in the years
before the crisis. On the surface they appeared to embody the investor’s holy
grail of low risk and high yield, but during the crisis their character proved
to be the opposite. As a consequence, the market has become reoriented
towards less exotic investment products. That said, financial innovation is
difficult to monitor and the shortcomings of new products are easier to spot
with hindsight.
A third symptom can be an increase in dividends and share buybacks. If
investors expect high nominal returns and if these are difficult to come by,
non-financial corporations may find themselves under pressure to return funds
to investors rather than pursuing risky but economically profitable real
investments in new plants or research and development. Buybacks and high
dividends, rather common in the run-up to the crisis, have become much rarer
in its aftermath, as is normal during cyclical downturns (Graph III.2, bottom
right-hand panel). Both dividends and buybacks rebounded somewhat in the
course of 2009 as the economic outlook brightened, but they remain below
pre-crisis levels, suggesting that this aspect of the search for yield is currently
not observable.

… fuel financial
innovation …

… and discourage

Interest rate risk
Low policy rates in combination with higher long-term rates increase the profits
that banks can earn from maturity transformation, ie by borrowing short-term
and lending long-term. Indeed, part of the motivation of central banks in
lowering policy rates was to enable battered financial institutions to raise such
profits and thereby build up capital. The heightened attractiveness of maturity
transformation since the crisis was reflected in rising carry-to-risk ratios
in 2009 and early 2010 (Graph II.1, bottom right-hand panel). Increasing
government bond yields, caused by ballooning deficits and debt levels and a
growing awareness of the associated risks, make the yield curve even steeper
and reinforce the appeal of maturity transformation strategies.
However, financial institutions may underestimate the risk associated with
this maturity exposure and overinvest in long-term assets.5 As already noted,
interest rate exposures of banks as measured by VaRs remain high. If an
unexpected rise in policy rates triggers a similar increase in bond yields, the
resulting fall in bond prices would impose considerable losses on banks. As a
consequence, they might face difficulties rolling over their short-term debt.
These risks may have increased somewhat in the aftermath of the 2007–09
crisis, because the poor credit environment for banks and the greater
availability of central bank funding have left many banks with funding structures
skewed towards shorter maturities. A squeeze on banks’ wholesale funding
might set off renewed asset sales and further price declines.

5
Banks may also have increased their holdings of government bonds so as to improve their results in
liquidity stress tests.

Thus, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy might cause serious
repercussions in the banking sector. Signalling policy rate changes early can
help to allow markets and institutions to make a smooth adjustment to the
anticipated shift in asset prices and funding costs.

Delays in balance sheet adjustments
Low policy
rates can delay the
restructuring of
balance sheets

Low rates can
lead to an
“evergreening” of
bank loans …

… which is difficult
to measure

The adjustment
of public
finances may
also be delayed

One legacy of the financial crisis and the years preceding it is the need to
clean up the balance sheets of financial institutions, households and the public
sector, which finds itself in a poor fiscal position, partly as a result of the
rescue measures adopted during the crisis. Low policy rates may slow down or
even hinder such necessary balance sheet adjustments. In the financial sector,
the currently steep yield curve provides financial institutions with a source of
income that may diminish the sense of urgency for reducing leverage and
selling or writing down bad assets (see also Chapter VI). Central banks’
commitment to keep policy rates low for extended periods, while useful in
stabilising market expectations, may contribute to such complacency.
Past experience has shown that low policy rates allow “evergreening”,
ie the rolling-over of non-viable loans. During the protracted run of low
nominal interest rates in Japan in the 1990s, banks there permitted debtors to
roll over loans on which they could afford the near zero interest payments but
not repayments of principal. Banks evergreened loans instead of writing them
off in order to preserve their own capital, which was already weak due to the
earlier fall in asset prices. This delayed the necessary restructuring and
shrinking of financial sector balance sheets. Moreover, the presence of
non-viable (“zombie”) firms sustained by evergreened loans probably limited
competition, reduced investment and prevented the entry of new enterprises.6
While there is no definitive way to establish the extent of evergreening
empirically, an indicator that it may be taking place would be data showing that
ailing industries are receiving a disproportionate share of loans. Such a pattern
was in evidence in Japan in the 1990s.7 Another indicator would be a loosening
of commercial banks’ lending standards for existing debtors. The Federal
Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey began reporting information on
the changes in the credit lines for existing customers in January 2009. On the
commercial and industrial side, credit lines have been decreasing but at an
ever slower pace. Once they start growing again, this will initially reflect a
normalisation of lending conditions, but might eventually signal evergreening
and thus delays in the adjustment of financial and non-financial balance
sheets in the private sector.
Low interest rates may also delay necessary balance sheet adjustments
in the public sector (see Chapter V for more details). By shifting their debt
profile towards shorter-term financing, governments can reduce interest rate

payments. While this provides them with useful breathing space for returning
sovereign debt levels to a sustainable path, it also exposes fiscal positions
to any increase in policy rates if the needed budgetary adjustments are not put
in place in a timely manner. This can raise concerns about the independence
of monetary policymakers.

Paralysed money markets
Once central banks begin the exit and raise their policy rates, it is essential that
money markets transmit this change to the wider economy. However, low policy
rates can paralyse money markets. When the operational costs involved in
executing money market deals exceed the interest earned – which is closely
related to policy rates – commercial banks may shift resources out of these
operations. Japanese money markets suffered such atrophy: the turnover in
the uncollateralised overnight call market fell from a 1995–98 average of more
than ¥12 trillion per month to a 2002–04 average of less than ¥5 trillion.8 As a
result, the tightening of Japan’s monetary policy in 2006 was complicated by
overstretched staff on the money market desks at commercial banks. In the
current setting, one reason why many central banks have refrained from lowering
their policy rate all the way to zero during the recent financial crisis has been to
avoid precisely this problem. International differences in how close policy rates
got to zero are probably related to diverging money market structures.
Money market volumes in the euro area and the United States have
declined since the onset of the financial crisis and are close to their levels during
2003–04, also a period when policy rates were low (Graph III.3). The drop in
market volumes in 2008 was mainly caused by liquidity hoarding, counterparty
and collateral concerns and the increased provision of liquidity by central banks,
but the continued low level may also reflect the reduced margins available in

advances – observed before the Greek sovereign debt crisis – may mirror an
easing of counterparty and collateral concerns and a reduction in central bank
open market operations. Whether volumes will eventually return to their previous
levels or whether low policy rates have indeed reduced money market activity
and thus complicated the implementation of exit strategies remains to be seen.

International side effects of low interest rates
Low interest rates in the major advanced economies cause side effects beyond
their borders, both in emerging markets and in commodity-exporting industrial
countries, which fared comparatively well in the crisis. The initial impact of the
financial crisis on these countries was in most cases a sharp decrease in
exports (Graph III.4, top panels), a withdrawal of US dollar funds by foreign
banks, liquidation of equity and bond holdings by investors, and a drop in
equity prices. The large emerging economies and the advanced commodity
exporters experienced a considerable weakening of their exchange rates
against the US dollar in the autumn of 2008, except in the case of China, which
held the renminbi fixed (Graph III.4, middle panels). Monetary policy was
loosened, both through lower interest rates and – in China, India and, later,
Brazil – through lower reserve requirements (Graph III.5). Moreover, many
central banks locally offered US dollar funds that some had obtained through
swap lines with the Federal Reserve.
As a result, domestic demand was able to offset some of the contractionary
impact of declining exports (Graph III.4, bottom panels). When also asset
prices recovered, central banks outside the major advanced economies started
tightening monetary policy again, despite the continued weakness of their
exports. By the end of May 2010, Australia, Brazil, India and Norway had begun
raising interest rates; and Brazil, China and India had all increased reserve
requirements. Market expectations at present point to further tightening.
Tighter monetary policy has created significant interest rate differentials,
both real and nominal, vis-à-vis the main crisis countries. Together with
better growth prospects, these differentials have generated capital flows to
countries with higher rates and increased the attractiveness of carry trades
(Graph III.6).

Graph III.6

Capital flows allow a better allocation of economic resources, and inflows
are important contributors to growth, especially in emerging market economies.
In the current situation, however, they may lead to further asset price increases
and have an inflationary impact on the macroeconomy. They have also caused
an appreciation of those target currencies that float, which corresponds to a
tightening of monetary conditions in those countries. Nevertheless, further
interest rate increases seem likely, and these may attract even more funds
from abroad. This exposes the receiving economies to the risk of rapid and
large capital outflows and the reversal of exchange rate pressures in the event
of a change in global macroeconomic, monetary and financial conditions or in
investors’ perception thereof. Chapter IV discusses the issues associated with
capital flows to emerging markets in more detail.

Summing up
The recent market turbulence associated with sovereign debt concerns is
likely to have postponed the necessary return to more normal monetary policy
settings in a number of advanced economies. Exactly when monetary
conditions will be tightened will depend on the outlook for macroeconomic

activity and inflation, and on the health of the financial system. But keeping
interest rates very low comes at a cost – a cost that is growing with time.
Experience teaches us that prolonged periods of unusually low rates cloud
assessments of financial risks, induce a search for yield and delay balance
sheet adjustments. Furthermore, the resulting yield differentials encourage
unsustainable capital flows to countries with high interest rates. Because
these side effects create risks for long-term financial and macroeconomic
stability, they need to be taken into account in determining the timing and
pace of normalisation of policy rates.

IV. Post-crisis policy challenges in emerging market
economies

Demand in the emerging market economies (EMEs) is recovering strongly.
Headline inflation rates have risen in most of emerging Asia, parts of Latin
America (including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) and Turkey. Core inflation
has increased sharply in India. Growth in the resource-intensive industrial
sectors of EMEs, especially China and India, has pushed up commodity prices.
In several countries, bank credit to the private sector has grown rapidly,
sometimes in association with strong increases in house prices.
Despite these developments, monetary conditions continue to be
accommodative in many EMEs, particularly in Asia. A return to large-scale
intervention to resist exchange rate appreciation has led to a rapid
accumulation of reserves (Graph IV.1, left-hand panel). In such circumstances,
some central banks need to tighten monetary policy, especially in those
economies where inflation pressures are mounting. With continuing low interest
rates in advanced economies, tighter monetary policy in the EMEs would
encourage capital flows in the short run. But resisting the exchange rate
appreciation pressures associated with these inflows would lead to faster credit
growth and increase the risk of asset price overshooting.
It is not surprising, therefore, that EMEs have shown a renewed interest
in using discretionary capital controls to deal with surges in inflows. Yet many

forms of capital controls can offer only temporary relief. Moreover, to the extent
that they are effective, capital controls reduce competition in the financial
system, distort the efficient allocation of capital and inhibit economic growth.
Macroprudential measures, however, can help limit the vulnerability of the
financial system to volatile capital flows and alleviate some important policy
dilemmas.
In view of these policy challenges, there may be no effective alternative to
raising interest rates, allowing greater flexibility in exchange rates and reducing
reliance on foreign exchange intervention. This approach is also essential in
order to achieve an orderly medium-term macroeconomic adjustment and,
ultimately, balanced global growth.
At the same time, EMEs and advanced economies need to continue
working together on strengthening international monetary arrangements to
ensure that, in any subsequent crisis, a sufficient supply of an international
currency is available: for the foreseeable future, that currency is almost certain
to remain the US dollar.

External imbalances and capital flows: resuming unhealthy trends?
Current account imbalances in EMEs are projected to widen. As a proportion
of their collective GDP, the EME combined current account surplus had fallen
sharply from 2006 to 2009, but it is projected to rise in 2010–12 (Graph IV.1,
centre panel). Indeed, under the influence of the underlying cyclical sensitivity
of trade flows, strong demand from China and a rise in commodity prices,
exports from many EMEs surged earlier this year.
Meanwhile, capital continued flowing into EMEs. Foreign direct investment
remained relatively strong during the crisis and continues to be the dominant
source of inflows. The pickup in other private capital inflows since mid-2009
has been led by an increase in equity portfolio flows (Graph IV.1, right-hand
panel). Debt flows have also resumed, but at a more modest pace. Only crossborder banking flows remained weak during 2009, although they rose modestly
in the fourth quarter.
Several domestic and external factors point to even heavier inflows in the
period ahead. First, short-term nominal interest rate differentials are expected
to widen in favour of the EMEs leading the global recovery, as their central
banks normalise policy rates faster than central banks in the advanced
economies (Graph IV.2, left-hand panel).
Second, expectations of exchange rate appreciation will attract additional
capital inflows. As before the crisis, the currencies of several EMEs are thus
likely to become the target of carry trades and to face heightened exchange
rate volatility.
Third, EMEs are expected to grow significantly faster than the advanced
economies over the next 10 years (Graph IV.2, left-hand panel). This prospect
is positive for capital inflows.
Lastly, the stronger EME recoveries have contributed not only to higher
real rates of return but also to a perception among investors of declining risk.
This has been reflected in lowered bond spreads (Graph IV.2, centre panel)

and a number of rating upgrades for EMEs in 2009–10, including for Brazil,
Indonesia, Korea, Peru, the Philippines and Turkey. These more favourable
funding conditions for EMEs have led to renewed interest on the part of
international investors in a range of EME asset classes. Emerging market bond
issuance in international and local markets has rebounded strongly as credit
default swap (CDS) spreads for emerging market names have narrowed
considerably from their peaks in late 2008. Indeed, EME corporate bonds are
increasingly being priced more like investment grade than high-yield issues
(Graph IV.2, centre panel). So far, however, the demand for EME assets has
primarily benefited the higher-quality borrowers, especially those in Asian and
Latin American economies where public finances and corporate balance
sheets have remained strong.
Moreover, low policy rates (Graph IV.2, right-hand panel) and the large
expansion of central bank balance sheets in the main advanced economies are
setting the stage for a significant resumption of portfolio and banking flows.
International investors still have large holdings of highly liquid assets such as
money market mutual funds, and these can be readily deployed to higheryielding and less liquid EME assets as conditions warrant. In addition,
international banks are strengthening their balance sheets and developing
local funding as they adapt to the new post-crisis banking environment (see
Chapter VI).
International financial integration offers significant benefits: capital
inflows stimulate financial development and are often a key ingredient
for economic growth over the medium term. Nevertheless, some forms of

BIS 80th Annual Report

capital inflows can be destabilising. The main concerns are portfolio – especially
debt – flows and cross-border bank lending, in which fund managers and
leveraged investors play a particularly big role. Those concerns underscore
the importance of monitoring not only the types of flows but also the ultimate
investors.

Policy options
The prospect of strong capital inflows presents a number of immediate policy
challenges for EMEs. Greater currency flexibility offers many advantages. It
may deter the build-up in the private sector of imprudent foreign exchange
exposures. Also, it can be particularly useful in discouraging short-term
capital inflows associated with carry trade dynamics. Yet, greater flexibility
means that the exchange rate may temporarily rise to unsustainable levels
but then fall back. Such dynamics, however, are of greater concern for
economies with thin domestic capital markets or foreign exchange markets
that are prone to over- and undershooting: their financial systems would be
overwhelmed by the pace of the inflows. Moreover, export industries have led
EME growth in the past decade; many worry that currency appreciation would
undermine the competitiveness of those industries and thereby impose
potentially costly structural adjustments on EMEs. Nevertheless, currency
appreciation is usually an important mechanism to reorient demand towards
domestic sources.
One response to the threat of appreciation posed by capital inflows has
been to keep policy interest rates low even as inflation pressures pick up. Low
policy rates would limit exchange rate pressures while strengthening
investment and boosting domestic demand more generally. But keeping
interest rates too low for too long increases the risks of domestic overheating,
inflation, excessive credit expansion and asset price overshooting.
Another option for managing the pressure on the exchange rate amid
rising inflows is foreign exchange intervention combined with a rise in the
policy rate to address the implications for inflation, credit growth and asset
prices. However, intervention alone, with the consequent build-up of reserves,
leads to distortions associated with the large expansion of bank balance sheets
and the increase in inflationary pressures. Likewise, restraining domestic
demand with higher policy rates and allowing only a modest or steady
appreciation may eventually stoke carry trades and even stronger capital
inflows, which in turn would only reinforce pressure on the exchange rate. In
addition, heavy intervention makes it more difficult for policymakers to set
monetary policy with the appropriate degree of restraint and may contribute
to financial stability risks.
In these circumstances, policymakers have looked to non-interest rate
options both to moderate the size of capital flows and to strengthen the
resilience of the economy and the financial system in the face of capital flow
volatility. The following sections explore the various policy trade-offs
associated with prolonged foreign currency intervention. Capital controls and
regulatory measures to address financial risks that arise from surging capital
inflows are also discussed.

Foreign exchange intervention – part of the problem or part of the
solution?
Intervention part of
EME toolbox

During the crisis,
reserves proved
useful

Changes in the stock of foreign currency reserves before, during and after the
crisis illustrate that foreign exchange intervention is an important tool for
emerging market central banks. But prolonged large-scale intervention in
foreign exchange markets can be both costly and risky.
Before the crisis, authorities in EMEs built up large foreign exchange
reserves (Graph IV.3, left-hand panel). In some EMEs (eg Korea), building a
stock of reserves considered adequate by market participants was a policy
goal in its own right. The views of the rating agencies, which use the size of
reserves as one element in assessing a country’s creditworthiness, were also
influential. But in other EMEs, particularly those with large current account
surpluses, the build-up of reserves was a by-product of exchange rate policies.
During the crisis, the large holdings of reserves proved useful. In the early
phase, they helped reassure foreign investors that EMEs had some form of
protection from external shocks. Later, after mid-2008, central banks drew
down reserves not only to support the exchange rate in the face of large
portfolio outflows (as in Korea and Mexico) but also to meet the dollar liquidity
shortages of domestic financial institutions (as in Brazil and Korea; Graph IV.3,
centre panel). Such use of foreign reserves to provide foreign currency funding
to domestic banks has reinforced the pre-crisis view of the desirability of
holding large reserve stocks. In the end, however, these reserves needed to
be supplemented with foreign exchange swap lines, particularly from the

Federal Reserve. This shortage of short-term dollar funding has also prompted
discussion of more robust institutional arrangements.
Another feature of intervention during the crisis was the use of foreign
exchange swaps and forwards. Authorities in Malaysia, the Philippines and
Singapore, for example, used forward positions as a first line of defence to
cushion foreign exchange reserves and limit the impact on domestic liquidity
(Graph IV.3, centre panel). This gave authorities a means to provide foreign
currency liquidity to the private sector, most notably to banks. From the
mid-1990s, EMEs have increasingly used derivatives as a tool in their reserve
management. Mexico used options in the aftermath of the Tequila crisis to
smooth the subsequent exchange rate adjustment. Forwards and swaps have
become the main types of derivatives used by central banks in recent years.
During the post-crisis recovery, many EME central banks have returned to
resisting appreciation and accumulating reserves on a substantial scale. Some
continued to build reserves throughout the crisis (eg China), while others that
saw some of the largest declines in foreign reserves have rebuilt them. For
example, Korea’s reserves declined by $64 billion during the crisis, but have
since returned to their pre-crisis level. These examples are consistent with
the more general positive association between reserve accumulation and
exchange rate pressures in EMEs (Graph IV.3, right-hand panel).
Prolonged and large-scale intervention has significant consequences
for the economies and the domestic financial systems in the EMEs. First,
reserve accumulation that results in easy monetary conditions and rapid
credit growth can add to inflation pressures or create financial system risks.1
In recent years, foreign reserves have grown to levels that are now large
relative to the size of the domestic financial system (Graph IV.4).
Second, even if sterilisation measures offset the unintended inflationary
consequences of reserve accumulation, intervention and sterilisation are almost
always costly. Typically, sterilisation entails the central bank exchanging highyield domestic assets for low-yield reserves.2 Such sterilisation also leads to
an expansion in the balance sheet of the banking system and adds to financial
system fragility in at least two key ways.3 First, it involves authorities swapping
foreign currency assets of the private sector for domestic currency assets of the
public sector, effectively transferring the foreign exchange risk arising from
the capital flows from the private to the public sector. Second, if the maturity of
central bank bills were to lengthen significantly, as was the case earlier in the
decade, private sector banks, which typically hold the sterilisation debt in EMEs,
would find themselves becoming increasingly exposed to interest rate risk.

Graph IV.4

The unwanted side effects of fully sterilising large-scale intervention have
led to the use of non-market instruments such as reserve requirements.
Indeed, some central banks (including those of Argentina, China, Croatia,
India, Korea, Poland and Romania) have actively used reserve requirements to
effectively sterilise the liquidity impact on the banking system. Compared with
issuing central bank bills, raising reserve requirements is relatively inexpensive
for the central bank as reserves are typically remunerated at below market
rates. But there are practical drawbacks. Especially in economies with more
developed financial systems, high reserve requirements over time drive
intermediation from the regulated banking system to less regulated entities.
Moreover, raising reserve requirements may be effective in constraining credit
creation during a boom associated with capital inflows, but lowering them may
be less useful than reducing interest rates on central bank bills when trying to
stimulate credit expansion. And unlike sterilisation with interest rate-based
tools, frequent changes in reserve requirements may unduly complicate
liquidity management at banks.
In sum, prolonged large-scale foreign exchange intervention generates
significant vulnerabilities in the financial system and accentuates dilemmas
facing policymakers. These inherent drawbacks help to explain the renewed
interest in administrative tools, such as capital controls and prudential
measures, as alternatives to intervention.

A role for capital controls and prudential policies?
Managing capital
flows

The policy issues that arise in the management of capital flows are receiving
wide attention.4 Although various controls have been used in the past, the

historical record suggests that they are unlikely to insulate recipient economies
from surging inflows. But some measures have for a time helped countries
keep local interest rates above those prevailing in international markets. In
addition, prudential measures have shown some promise in improving the
ability of the domestic financial system to absorb cross-border financial flows
and to weather exchange rate volatility.
The broad reduction in legal impediments to cross-border capital flows
over the past 25 years has supported a corresponding increase in financial
globalisation. Closer financial integration has brought many benefits – but there
are risks that need to be managed. The approach to controls among EMEs
differs across regions. Since the early 1990s, countries in central and eastern
Europe (CEE) have been steadily dismantling capital controls as part of their
ongoing integration with the European Union; EMEs in southern Asia and East
Asia have increased certain controls over the same period; and those in Latin
America fall somewhere in between, with a modest decrease in the incidence
of explicit controls.
The attractiveness of capital controls has several sources. One is that they
increase the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy by driving a wedge
between onshore and offshore financial markets. Another is that, if they reduce
the volume of capital inflows, capital controls moderate appreciation pressures
on the currency (but at the cost of distorting the international allocation of
capital).
Empirical studies suggest, however, that capital controls have limits. They
do not appear to have a durable impact on the size of capital flows. But
controls may change their composition (eg away from short-term flows) in ways
that reduce exchange rate volatility. Furthermore, there is little evidence that
capital controls render the economy less susceptible to crises or reduce the
real cost of such crises.5 Finally, controls create microeconomic distortions.
Jurisdictions with a still developing financial system now recognise that
any relaxation of existing controls on international capital flows should be
carefully sequenced. Nonetheless, as such economies develop and their
financial markets become more sophisticated, the effectiveness of, and the
rationale for, the controls tend to fade. A more promising and durable approach
to addressing volatile EME capital inflows would be to strengthen the ability
of the financial system and the economy to withstand them. Prudential tools,
which have been the focus of attention as a means of limiting systemic
financial risks (see Chapter VII), could play a valuable role.
Prudential tools have long been employed by emerging market economies
to enhance financial resilience. The authorities have been recalibrating many
of those tools recently to address capital inflows. In Hong Kong SAR, for
example, where heavy inflows had been driving up real estate prices, the
authorities in October 2009 lowered the maximum allowable loan-to-value

ratio on certain types of mortgage to reduce the risks associated with the price
run-up. Similar measures were employed in Korea. Limits on debt-to-income
ratios have also been used (for example in Korea) to contain ebullient credit
creation. Several CEE central banks (notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia and
Poland) adopted similar measures during the credit boom preceding the crisis
in order to limit currency mismatches and contain excessive credit creation
stemming from capital inflows.
Additional steps that EMEs have taken to ensure a resilient financial
system include strengthening the regulatory framework with respect to maturity
mismatches on the balance sheets of financial institutions, encouraging the
development of local currency bond markets and instruments for hedging
foreign exchange risk, limiting short-term foreign borrowing, promoting risk
management capacity and practices in the private sector, and strengthening
the surveillance of foreign currency exposures.

liquidity

While in the near term capital inflows are a dominant concern, EME
policymakers are also exploring reforms to the international monetary system
that may be important over the longer term. One particular concern is the role
of the US dollar as the dominant international currency. The dollar’s role in the
international monetary system – in particular as the vehicle currency for most
derivatives contracts – has been cited as a contributor to the international
financial and macroeconomic spillovers during the latest crisis. However, it is
important to note that the crisis spread from its US origins to the advanced
economies in Europe not because of the dollar but largely because banks in
those economies were heavily exposed to US toxic assets and were dependent
on short-term wholesale dollar funding. And the crisis spread to Asia, Latin
America and emerging Europe through trade linkages. Some banking systems
in EMEs did suffer a shortage of short-term dollar funds that exacerbated the
crisis, but the problem was addressed in some cases by the Federal Reserve
with bilateral swap lines.
The principal concern for monetary authorities during periods of crisis is
ensuring the availability of sufficient funds in the international currency,
whichever it is. Currently, it is the dollar and, to a much lesser extent, the euro
and Swiss franc (see box). The emergence of some other dominant
international currency or currencies (actual or virtual) would not change the
nature of the problem.
For EMEs, that problem can be serious. Any central bank’s ability to
provide liquidity in a foreign currency is limited, given that foreign currency
holdings are finite. Further, the issuer of an international currency cannot be
expected to provide liquidity insurance unconditionally. Use of an international
currency such as the SDR, which is based on a basket of national currencies,
will not solve this fundamental problem. In fact, it is likely to make it more
complicated: officials in countries whose currencies make up the basket would
tend to view the unconditional issuance of the composite unit no differently
from the unconditional issuance of their own currencies.

So the search continues for an enhanced global financial safety net, and
various proposals are under discussion. This is particularly important given
the absence of extensive formal foreign exchange swap line arrangements
between EMEs and major central banks. One approach is to modify the
Flexible Credit Line introduced by the IMF to make qualification for the line
more predictable and to extend its duration. Establishing a foreign exchange
liquidity insurance mechanism, which would combine paid-in insurance
premiums and pre-agreed credit lines from major central banks, is another
option. Regional solutions, such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation
and bilateral swaps of non-reserve currencies during periods of stress, are an
additional possibility. All these mechanisms are worthy of further consideration.
Important questions to be resolved are how to deal with the moral hazard
risks such mechanisms can create and how realistic it is to reach an agreement
on a global financial safety net large enough for a major crisis in which many
other elements would also need to be addressed.

Summing up
The economic situation for the EMEs is much improved, but they still face
significant policy dilemmas. Renewed growth and the return of capital inflows
confront policymakers once again with the familiar pressures – inflation, rapid
credit growth, currency appreciation and frothy asset prices – that they had to
cope with before the crisis. If capital inflows accelerate, the build-up of
macroeconomic imbalances could continue. Addressing inflows with a
resumption of large-scale foreign exchange intervention entails risks for the
financial system. In the alternative, macroprudential measures can help to limit
currency or maturity exposures arising from debt inflows and can limit adverse
consequences associated with the expansion in credit. But macroprudential
measures cannot substitute for tightening monetary policy and increasing
exchange rate flexibility as means to promote orderly and sustained domestic
and external adjustments. At the same time, further efforts are needed to
make the international monetary system more resilient.

Lesson from the crisis on the US dollar’s international role
In late 2008, turbulence in global money markets disturbed the US dollar’s outsize role in forward trading
of two currencies at the euro area’s edge, the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty. This natural
experiment on the resilience of the dollar ended in a quick reversion of this part of the global currency
market to its previous pattern. The case suggests that the dollar’s dominant position as an international
medium of exchange is stronger than is generally appreciated.

Background
During the global financial crisis, strains in dollar funding markets quickly and forcefully spread to other
money markets, in part owing to the predominance of the dollar in the foreign exchange swap market.
In that market, funds in one currency are temporarily exchanged for funds in another currency. In April
2007, the busiest currency pair was the dollar/euro, accounting for 28% of swap transactions. Other
currencies were swapped against the dollar in 64% of all transactions and against the euro in just 6%.
Dollar swaps led by 10 to one even in central European currency markets, where, in contrast, market
participants trade domestic currency spot mostly against the euro. In short, the dollar stood head and
shoulders above other currencies as a means of exchange in the swap market.
The dollar does not so dominate other international uses. In the international bond market, the
dollar and the euro stand more nearly equal in importance as stores of value: 45% for the dollar and
32% for the euro at the end of 2008, according to data from the BIS and ECB. One explanation for this
contrast is inertia in the medium of exchange because liquidity is concentrated in certain bilateral
exchange rates. Thus, only well after central European currencies became more stable against the euro
than against the dollar did they begin trading mostly against the euro in the spot currency market.
Beyond mere inertia, network externalities guide the choice of a medium of exchange. In particular,
if dollars swap most readily against other foreign currencies, then any domestic currency is most
usefully swapped against dollars. In this case, the predominance of dollar swaps may re-establish itself
even after a powerful disturbance that leads market participants to substitute the euro for the dollar for
a time. Mere inertia can explain persistence but not a return to dollar swaps.

The natural experiment
In April 2007, only a few currencies enjoyed a well developed swap market against both dollars and
euros, including the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty. Fortunately, the central banks of Hungary and
Poland collect monthly data that offer insights into the market dynamics in the period after the collapse

of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As noted, before the crisis the currency of choice for swaps in
both markets remained the dollar. As the dollar shortage became acute in September and October 2008,
dollar interest rates implied by dollar swap pricing rose above euro interest rates implied by euro swap
pricing. Foreign exchange traders in Hungary and Poland switched from swapping the domestic
currency against dollars to swapping it predominantly against euros. When massive Federal Reserve
swaps provided dollar funding to European banks, the premium on dollars came down and, one year
later, traders again swapped domestic currencies overwhelmingly against the dollar (Graph IV.A).
The structure of the market for Swiss francs could hold the key to explaining the return of the
Hungarian and Polish swap markets to the dollar. Because much lending in Hungary and Poland is
denominated in Swiss francs, banks there need to transform domestic currency liquidity ultimately not
into euros or dollars but into Swiss francs. In April 2007, in the spot market, the value of Swiss franc/euro
transactions approached the value of Swiss franc/dollar transactions ($33 billion vs $49 billion); but in the
swap market, the value of Swiss franc/euro transactions fell far short of the value of Swiss franc/dollar
transactions ($15 billion vs $81 billion). If, under normal circumstances, the Swiss franc can be swapped
against the dollar more readily than against the euro, then traders in Hungary and Poland would
understandably revert to swapping the domestic currency against the dollar in the aftermath of the crisis.
Amid the discussion of the dollar’s future as a store of value, the return of its use in the swap
market in the case of Hungary and Poland illustrates its resilience as a means of exchange. This
resilience reflects forces beyond mere inertia that are rooted in the complex links among internationally
active banks, cross-border lending and cross-currency liquidity operations. This practical perspective on
the current operations of markets should inform any discussion of changes to the international
monetary system.

V. Fiscal sustainability in the industrial countries:
risks and challenges

Remarkable declines in national incomes, large financial rescue programmes
and expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis have led to
a dramatic deterioration of fiscal positions in industrial economies (Graph V.1).
The aggregate public debt of the advanced economies is projected to rise
from 76% of GDP in 2007 to more than 100% in 2011 – a record high in
recent decades. Moreover, the full cost of cleaning up the balance sheets of
financial institutions – particularly against the backdrop of their continued
high vulnerability to adverse shocks – is not yet known. And beyond 2011,
many industrial countries face the large, rising pension and health costs
associated with their ageing populations. Unless tackled effectively and in a
timely manner, such costs could lead to ever increasing deficits and debt
levels.
Emerging market economies (EMEs) collectively entered the financial
crisis with a relatively strong fiscal position and emerged from it relatively
unscathed (Graph V.1). Hence, their aggregate public debt ratio, at around
35% of GDP at the end of 2009, remains low compared with that of the
advanced economies and seems unlikely to rise sharply. Nevertheless, fiscal
positions across EMEs vary significantly, with several countries struggling to
reduce their budget deficits to sustainable levels. And many EMEs face

long-term fiscal challenges from their ageing populations; the challenges are
likely to grow more difficult as those EMEs attempt to upgrade or expand
essential public services to a larger segment of their populations. These issues
are briefly discussed in the box on page 64.
High and rising levels of public debt imply significant risks for the global
economy. As demonstrated by the recent European debt crisis, concerns about
government default may lead to a sharp rise in interest rates, which could
further aggravate financial fragility and put the incipient economic recovery
at risk. The introduction of unprecedented support measures in May by
European governments, the IMF and the ECB helped to stabilise financial
markets, but concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability in Greece and a
number of other European countries persisted. A key risk is that those
concerns may worsen and engulf other countries unless governments take
resolute action to address their fiscal problems. Furthermore, over the long
run, persistently higher levels of public debt might make economies more
vulnerable to adverse shocks, reduce their long-run growth potential and
endanger prospects for monetary stability.
In fact, the increased scrutiny of fiscal positions by investors has already
persuaded a number of advanced economies to introduce new or enhanced
fiscal consolidation measures, which should facilitate a faster reduction of
fiscal deficits than was envisaged at the beginning of 2010. Any efforts to
reduce current fiscal deficits should also be accompanied by reforms that
ensure the long-term viability of public finances. The latter include measures
aimed at boosting productivity and future potential economic growth as well as
measures to contain the increase in age-related spending. Provided these
measures are implemented with the necessary determination by industrial
countries, their possible short-term adverse effects on output growth will be
largely outweighed by the benefits of lower and stable interest rates, a less
fragile financial system and improved prospects for economic growth.
The rest of this chapter addresses the short- and long-term fiscal
imbalances faced by industrial countries and discusses their potential
implications for the global economy.

The evolution of public debt and its near-term prospects
High levels of public debt are not unknown in the industrial countries. In the
wake of the Second World War, for example, public debt reached about 120%
of GDP in the United States and 275% of GDP in the United Kingdom. In those
two countries, where levels of public debt are projected to reach upwards of
90% of GDP in 2011, the recent rate of increase parallels only that seen during
the two world wars (Graph V.2, left-hand panel). What is worse, the current,
crisis-related surge took place against the backdrop of a long-term erosion of
the fiscal position in many countries. Indeed, from the 1970s to 2007, the
collective average public debt ratio in industrial countries had steadily
ratcheted up from 40% to 76% (Graph V.2, right-hand panel). The chronic
mismatch between revenues and committed expenditures (particularly agerelated spending) indicates that, to varying degrees by country, the fiscal

situation was already on an unsustainable path before the beginning of the
recent financial crisis.
By the end of 2011, public debt/GDP ratios in industrial countries are
projected to be on average about 30 percentage points higher than in 2007 –
a rise of about two fifths. But the increase for countries that have been hit
particularly hard by the crisis will be even greater: for the period from the end
of 2007 to the end of 2011, the debt/GDP ratio is expected to rise by more than
half in the United States and by four fifths in Spain and to almost double in
the United Kingdom and triple in Ireland (Table V.1).
The recent increase in public debt is unlikely to be halted any time
soon, for a number of reasons. The first is that the cyclical deficits caused
by the economic downturn – sharp declines in tax revenues combined with
a rise in some expenditures (mainly income support) – are unlikely to
vanish soon because, as current projections suggest, economic recovery will
be slow.
The second reason is that a large part of the currently projected fiscal
deficit in 2010 and 2011 is likely to persist despite the recovery in output. The
financial crisis is expected to have permanently reduced the level of future
potential output for many countries – and hence the tax base of the
government.1 Furthermore, in some countries (notably Ireland, Spain, the
United Kingdom and the United States) part of the large increase in tax
revenues before the crisis was associated with an unsustainable boom in the
construction and financial sectors. As output in these sectors is unlikely to

return to pre-crisis levels soon, neither is the level of taxes that they generate.
In addition, countries can also be expected to pay higher unemployment
benefits for many years due to a rise in the number of long-term unemployed
workers.
The third reason is the uncertainty surrounding the timing and extent of
the reversal of the exceptional discretionary measures implemented in several
countries to revive aggregate demand. The recent crisis has forced a number
of southern European countries to announce measures to reduce their
structural budget deficits more rapidly than previously envisaged, but it remains
to be seen whether the major industrial countries will also reverse fiscal
stimulus before growth and unemployment have returned to more acceptable
levels. Experience in industrial countries indicates that structural primary
deficits (deficits excluding interest payments, adjusted for cyclical increases
in expenditure and cyclical decreases in revenue) tend to be corrected only
slowly.2
Finally, the ultimate cost of cleaning up the financial system is still
unknown. Banks in several countries are still fragile and exposed to volatile

financial markets and a deteriorating commercial real estate market (see
Chapter II).3
How far and for how long the debt/GDP ratios will rise depends not only
on future decisions regarding taxes and primary expenditures (expenditures
excluding interest payments on outstanding debt) but also on real GDP
growth and the path of future real interest rates. In that regard, growth
prospects facing many industrial countries are at best weak, and real interest
rates are likely to rise.
Unfortunately, the large projected near-term fiscal deficits are not the
only source of worry. Governments in advanced economies with a markedly
growing ratio of the elderly to the working age population (Graph V.3,
left-hand panel) face yet another fiscal challenge – containing and funding
the rising costs for health care and pensions in the medium to long term.
Some of those countries also face lower growth of potential output, which will
make such funding even more challenging. Countries have different pension
and health systems – and some of them have already reformed their systems
to contain part of the rise in expenditures. Hence, countries with similar
projected increases in the ratio of the elderly to people of working age do
not necessarily face comparable increases in projected age-related public
expenditures. For example, given current policies, such expenditures as a share

The amount of resources pledged so far in support of the financial sector in advanced economies
(capital injections as well as purchases of assets and lending by the treasury) is currently estimated by
the IMF at 6.2% of 2009 GDP, of which only 3.5% of GDP has so far been used – a rather modest amount
compared with the average direct cost of financial rescue programmes in past crises. Yet these figures
may hide a more severe situation in some of the countries hardest hit by the financial crisis. For
example, the United Kingdom and the United States have pledged 11.9% and 7.4% of 2009 GDP,
respectively, of which 6.6% and 4.9% of GDP has so far been used. See IMF, Fiscal Monitor: Navigating

Fiscal prospects in emerging market economies
Emerging market economies (EMEs) are likely to face fiscal challenges in the years ahead. At first glance,
their fiscal position overall seems manageable. Indeed, unlike in the industrial countries, the ratio of
public debt to GDP for EMEs as a whole is projected to change very little from its pre-crisis level of
around 35%. Also, the rapid growth enjoyed by many EMEs raises the hope that their public debt ratios
will not rise as fast as those of the industrial economies. Moreover, the high return to public investment
in the EMEs can help sustain higher debt provided the latter is not financing wasteful consumption.
However, the aggregate fiscal position of EMEs masks important cross-country differences. For
instance, the ratio of public debt to GDP of some EMEs such as Hungary and India, at around 80% or
more at the end of 2009, remains high. More generally, some of the factors that have made EMEs less
capable of supporting levels of public debt similar to those of more advanced economies might continue
to be relevant.
First, weaker inflation credibility in EMEs requires their governments to depend to a greater extent
on foreign currency borrowing to finance their fiscal deficits, which exposes them to fluctuations in the
external value of their currency and to sudden reversals of capital flows. For example, foreign currency
debt accounted for 63%, 58% and 40% of total public debt in Indonesia, Hungary and Poland,
respectively, in 2009. However, Brazil and India, which are among the EMEs with the highest debt, finance
their deficits mostly from domestic sources.
Second, the tax base – and, hence, tax revenue relative to GDP – is generally smaller in EMEs and
cannot be easily expanded, given their lower degree of urbanisation and development. For example, the
revenue/GDP ratio is below 25% in several Asian EMEs, compared with an OECD average of about 38%
in 2008. Third, EMEs tend to be more vulnerable to adverse shocks in international trade and financial
markets. A great concern now is that a possible intensification of fiscal problems in advanced economies
may spill over to EMEs through weaker demand for exports as well as through an increase in investors’
risk aversion and a deterioration of credit conditions. Fourth, fiscal policy remains very expansionary in
some EMEs, contributing to booms in asset prices that may prove unsustainable. For instance, large
fiscal stimulus programmes in China have been associated with the recent rapid expansion of bank credit
there, which has created major risks for the economy and the financial system.
In addition to traditional challenges, several EMEs also face a rapidly growing elderly population as
well as an increasing demand for social welfare coverage. Expanding the social safety net is desirable
not only on its own merits but also because of the need to reduce large national savings in some
countries and, thereby, global current account imbalances. But any such expansion must not jeopardise
the long-term viability of the fiscal system.

of GDP are projected to rise in the period 2011–50 by several percentage points
in Germany, Greece, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States but by
a more modest amount in France, Italy and Japan (Graph V.3, right-hand panel).

Long-term projections of public debt
The severity of the fiscal problems facing industrial countries is illustrated by
long-term projections of public debt/GDP covering the period 2010–40 in
selected countries (Graph V.4). The first two years of the projections – 2010
and 2011 – correspond to the data shown in Table V.1; from 2012 onwards, the
projections abstract from short-term variations in output and interest rates. As
such, they are best thought of as trends around which actual debt ratios might
fluctuate. In addition, a number of simple assumptions are made. First, the
real effective interest rate paid on debt is assumed to be the same as its
10-year pre-crisis average (1998–2007). Second, real GDP is assumed to grow
at its potential rate as estimated by the OECD for the period 2012–25. Finally,

scenarios

Public debt will
continue on an
unsustainable
path …

… unless large
deficits are cut …

… and age-related
spending is
contained

possible interactions among output, interest rates and fiscal policy are not
considered.
In the first scenario (labelled “Baseline” in Graph V.4), revenues and
non-age-related spending as a share of GDP for the 2012–40 period remain
constant at the OECD-projected 2011 values, and the rate of increase in agerelated spending is set so as to make the cumulative increase up to 2040
match the estimates made by the sources used for Graph V.3.4 In this scenario,
part of the cyclical deficit is expected to linger for some years. As it moves
further into the projection period, the baseline scenario becomes increasingly
unrealistic. Sooner or later, something will occur to prevent debt from
exploding: governments will adopt corrective measures on their own, or they
will be forced to act as sovereign risk premia reach unbearable levels.
The second and third scenarios are simulations of two possible courses
of corrective action. In the second scenario (labelled “Gradual adjustment”),
the primary budget balance (revenues less expenditures excluding interest
payments on outstanding debt), excluding age-related spending, is assumed
to improve relative to GDP by 1 percentage point a year for 10 years (a total
swing of 10 percentage points – large by historical standards) and then to
remain constant at the new level as a share of GDP for the rest of the
projection period. In the third scenario (“Gradual adjustment and constant
age-related spending”), the 10 percentage point improvement is coupled with
the assumption that age-related expenditures will remain constant, as a share
of GDP, at OECD-projected 2011 levels throughout the projection period.
The second scenario’s gradual improvement of the primary budget
stance succeeds, after a decade or so, in putting the debt/GDP ratio on a
steadily declining path in France, Ireland and Spain but not in Japan, the
United Kingdom or the United States. The improved primary balance
stabilises the debt/GDP ratio in the United States only until 2025, after which
pressure from the increase in age-related expenditures causes the ratio to
start drifting up again. In Japan and the United Kingdom the ratio does not
stabilise, but its ascent is slowed. The second scenario thus suggests that, in
reality, the adjustment in the primary balance could be larger than assumed in
the projections, or front-loaded, in some of the countries with the worst debt
dynamics.
Coming on top of the improvement in the primary balance, the freeze of
the GDP share of age-related expenditures leads to a faster decline in the
debt/GDP ratio or a slower rate of increase. Preventing age-related spending
from growing faster than GDP for the entire projection horizon may be
somewhat unrealistic. Nonetheless, the results suggest that early efforts to
reduce future age-related spending or finance the spending through additional
taxes and other measures (discussed below) could significantly improve fiscal
sustainability in several countries over the medium term. Moreover, the fact

corresponds to 2008, the first full year of the crisis. 2 Based on the following assumptions throughout the BIS projection: constant
growth of potential real GDP at the rate estimated by the OECD for 2012–25, constant real effective interest rate at the 10-year pre-crisis
average, 2011 revenue and non-age-related spending (both as a percentage of GDP) held constant and age-related spending as a
percentage of GDP based on estimates by sources in Graph V.3 and on procedure detailed in footnote 4 in the main text of this chapter.
3 The baseline primary balance excluding age-related spending (as a percentage of GDP) improves from the 2011 level by 1 percentage

that the debt/GDP ratio falls in some countries to very low levels towards the
end of the forecasting period suggests that the fiscal adjustment in those
countries could be smaller than assumed in this scenario.

Consequences of high debt
History and compelling economic arguments warn against a large and rapid
build-up of public debt. Such profligacy threatens the government’s solvency,
reduces potential growth and lowers living standards. It also impairs the ability
of the monetary authority to control inflation.

Risks of sovereign default
Apart from Germany and Japan in the wake of the Second World War, no
industrial country has defaulted since 1945. But a longer view of history reveals

… and its

… and short-term

that large increases in public debt – often the consequence of banking crises –
tend to be followed by episodes of high inflation and an increase in the number
of sovereign defaults, even among the advanced economies of the time.
Typically, countries chose to incur the consequences of defaulting on their debt
or rescheduling it when they viewed the financial and other consequences of
inflation to be even worse.5
Recently, the spectre of sovereign default descended again on southern
Europe. Greece, with its bond yields spiralling upwards, had to ask for
external financial help to continue refinancing its debt. A combination of
factors – very weak growth prospects, high unemployment rates, a constant
erosion of international competitiveness and the lack of fiscal transparency –
had led to a continued weakening of investors’ confidence in the government’s
creditworthiness. The erosion of confidence accelerated when it became
clear that other European countries were struggling to agree on the extent
and conditions of financial support. Risk premia on Greece’s debt shot up,
exposing financial firms in several countries to potentially large capital losses
and the private sector to a tightening of credit conditions.
As the bailout package for Greece was being finalised, the crisis took a
turn for the worse when yields on sovereign bonds of other countries,
especially Portugal and Spain, began to rise sharply. The fiscal position
in both those countries is better than in Greece, but like Greece they have
poor growth prospects and large trade deficits and cannot adjust through
currency depreciation or monetary expansion. New support measures
announced in May by European governments, the IMF and the ECB managed
to calm markets’ fears, at least temporarily, allowing governments some
time to introduce the necessary measures to consolidate public finances and
improve the prospects for economic growth.
The recent European crisis also showed that the risk of adverse debt
dynamics taking hold is greater in countries with a low saving rate relative to
investment, which forces them to rely in part on inflows of foreign capital to
finance their budget deficits. Currently, non-residents hold a substantial part of
the government debt of many industrial countries, particularly of Greece, Italy
and the United States (Graph V.5, left-hand panel).
In addition, the vulnerability to a run on the debt is clearly higher when
a country has to refinance a large portion of its debt every year. As demand
for long-term bonds weakens, governments may be forced to increasingly
borrow short term, leading to a steady reduction of their average debt
maturities. In Italy, for example, the average maturity of public debt shortened
from about seven years in 1973 to only about one year in 1982, making the
country more vulnerable to a run in those years. Currently, the average
public debt maturity in most industrial countries is relatively long, but it could
start to shorten again if investors come to see long-term investment as risky
(Graph V.5, right-hand panel).

Macroeconomic consequences
Even if adverse debt dynamics can be avoided, three key factors that accompany
higher levels of public debt may lead over time to a reduction of potential
economic growth and a fall in living standards: higher interest payments,
greater competition for portfolio investment and the impairment of fiscal policy.
First, the larger share of fiscal resources needed to service a higher public
debt might crowd out productive expenditures (such as for infrastructure,
education and health) and could also lead to higher distortionary taxation.
Second, the higher level of public debt will compete with other investments
in private portfolios, including other countries’ government bonds. The
competition, along with higher default and inflation risk premia, could push
up real interest rates and lead to an offsetting fall in the private stock of
capital. International flows of capital could limit these effects, but the interest
paid to foreign residents would reduce domestic income. Third, higher debt
may limit the scope and effectiveness of fiscal policy, including the operation
of automatic stabilisers; the resulting higher macroeconomic volatility is likely
to discourage capital accumulation.
Although the evidence on the growth implications of high levels of public
debt is slim, it suggests that the effects could be significant. Among countries
with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 90%, the median growth rate of real GDP is
1 percentage point lower (and the average is 4 percentage points lower) than in
countries with a lower ratio. Recent evidence also suggests that the expected
increase in the debt/GDP ratio in the advanced economies for the 2007–15
period may permanently reduce future growth of potential output by more
than half a percentage point annually.6

The continued deterioration of fiscal balances could also complicate central
banks’ task of keeping inflation low and stable, for at least two reasons.
One is that rapidly mounting public debt heightens the temptation to tolerate
an unexpected rise in inflation to reduce the real value of the debt, particularly
when a large part of the outstanding domestic currency debt is long-term
and a large share is foreign-owned. That temptation will also be greater if
the public budget is based mainly on nominal flows, so that unexpectedly
higher inflation would boost the real value of tax revenues and reduce that of
public expenditure. As a result, the political pressure on the central bank to
accommodate higher inflation may increase. Yet any benefit from unexpected
inflation would be temporary, while the cost would certainly be higher and
longer-lived. The cost includes permanently higher future real interest rates,
the misallocation of resources caused by higher inflation, and the loss of
output that would probably be needed to bring inflation back to its original
level.
A second reason why high and rising debts may lead to higher inflation
is that the public, confronted with the continued failure of government to
close the fiscal gap, may eventually become unwilling to hold government
bonds. To avert an outright sovereign default when the outstanding debt
can no longer be rolled over, the central bank would be forced to purchase
government bonds and thus let the money supply expand. Unlike in the
previous case, this is more likely to occur the shorter the average maturity of
the debt. Moreover, when a large fraction of the debt is of short maturity,
efforts to reduce inflation by raising interest rates might eventually fail to
work: the rise in interest rates would be rapidly translated into higher interest
payments and hence higher debt, thereby bringing forward the likely time for
monetisation.
Even if these high-inflation scenarios remain unlikely in the immediate
future, any increase in the probability attached to them could quickly have
adverse effects. One is that agents would revise up their expectations of future
inflation as well as demand greater compensation for inflation risk, causing
medium- and long-term interest rates to rise.7 Another potential effect is that
investors would take refuge in foreign assets, causing a sharp depreciation of
the currency and a consequent rise in inflation. Any of these effects might
reduce central banks’ room for manoeuvre in stabilising inflation at both short
and long horizons.
How realistic is the worry that fiscal deterioration will lead to higher
inflation? So far, there is no evidence that inflation expectations have become
unanchored (Graph V.6). However, a failure by governments to make headway
in restoring fiscal sustainability increases the risk that inflation expectations
may abruptly and unexpectedly change.

7
For example, even if the central bank does not yield to political pressure to accommodate higher
inflation, the rise in perceived inflation benefits could be interpreted by financial markets as an increase
in the risk that the central bank will lose its independence under the pressure of unsustainable public
finances, and therein could lie a rise in expected inflation.

Addressing fiscal imbalances
Given the unsustainable trajectories of public debt in many industrial countries,
a prolonged period of fiscal tightening that brings the primary budget balance to
a sizeable surplus is inevitable. In this regard, the experiences with a number
of tightenings by industrial countries in the past 30 years offer grounds for
optimism (Table V.2). Several of the consolidation efforts involved swings in
the structural primary balance (SPB) of nearly 10% of GDP and lasted for
several years. Each instance of consolidation either stabilised the debt/GDP
ratio or reduced it; and in some episodes the reduction of the debt/GDP ratio
continued for several years after the end of the consolidation period.
For example, after a large rise in public debt in the early 1980s, Denmark
managed to raise its SPB from a deficit of 6.4% of GDP in 1982 to a surplus of
7.0% in 1986 (a swing of more than 13 percentage points in four years).
Sweden, still in the midst of a recession after a banking crisis in the early
1990s, launched a consolidation plan that raised its SPB from a deficit of 7.1%
of GDP in 1993 to a surplus of 4.7% in 2000 (a swing of almost 12 percentage
points). Despite an initial reversal and a change of government, Ireland
managed to move from a deficit of 7% of GDP in 1980 to a surplus of almost 5%
in 1989 (a move of nearly 12 percentage points). And after a comprehensive
spending review, Canada gradually adjusted its SPB from a 5.4% deficit in 1985
to a 5.7% surplus in 1999. Its run of surpluses lasted until 2008 and reduced
its debt/GDP ratio from a peak of 102% in 1996 to 65% in 2007.
An assessment of the relevance of these cases of large fiscal adjustments
to today’s needs shows that, on the one hand, they overcame employment
conditions that were quite difficult (Table V.2) – Canada, Ireland and Italy
in particular experienced rising unemployment at the beginning of the
consolidation period or at some point during its course. On the other hand, the
countries making the adjustments enjoyed real GDP growth over the adjustment
period that was comparable to the growth rates prevailing in several industrial

countries in the years preceding the recent crisis. In some episodes, favourable
external demand conditions may indeed have facilitated the adjustment.
Another fact that stands out is that large consolidation efforts took place
amid a wide range of conditions regarding real exchange rates and real interest
rates. In particular, currency depreciation and monetary policy accommodation
may have facilitated fiscal adjustment in some countries, but not in all.
Unfortunately, empirical research that seeks to control for the influence of
various factors has so far failed to reach a consensus on the role played by
external and monetary conditions in ensuring the success of fiscal consolidations.
The same research, however, unequivocally points to the importance of
the “quality” of fiscal adjustment.8 Most of the successful consolidations were

biased towards expenditure cuts – specifically, reductions in government
consumption including public wages – while the least effective were biased
towards cuts to productive public investment. In countries that started from a
low level of taxation, increases in tax revenues were also helpful, in which
cases taxes on consumption and measures to broaden the tax base were the
most effective. And consolidation efforts were often accompanied by structural
reforms that improved the functioning of the labour market and reduced taxes
on labour and capital.
One important conclusion from the examination of past episodes is that
consolidation efforts of the size required today can be implemented, although
the growth and employment conditions facing countries may be tougher now
than before. Countries with a high and rapidly increasing level of public debt
and whose creditworthiness has been questioned have no option but to
implement fiscal adjustment immediately. For those countries, any delay is
itself a threat to the financial system and the economic recovery. Indeed, if
they undertake fiscal tightening now, the improved confidence and lowered
risk premia that result will outweigh the short-term output cost. At the time
of writing, the governments of Greece, Portugal and Spain had announced a
number of austerity measures, including cuts to public wages and increases
in taxes. If implemented fully, such measures should lead to a sizeable
reduction in fiscal deficits in the short and medium term. Yet these countries
would still face significant challenges in making the adjustment needed to
restore investors’ confidence in the sustainability of their finances.
Other countries that continue to enjoy investors’ confidence have a higher
degree of fiscal credibility and so may have some flexibility in choosing the
timing and pace of their fiscal consolidation. But if they are to preserve that
flexibility – by forestalling any rise in default and inflation risk premia – they
should announce clear and credible plans to reduce their current fiscal deficits
and to address their long-term fiscal imbalances.
Countries have at least two broad options to ensure the long-term
viability of their public finances. The first is to promote an increase in overall
productivity and in the growth of potential output through measures such as
a commitment to cutting unproductive expenditures, changing the structure of
the tax system and implementing reforms in labour and product markets. The
speedy introduction of such measures would contribute to underpinning market
confidence and keeping interest rates low, thereby facilitating the reduction of
current fiscal deficits.
The second option is to boost the size of the labour force relative to the
size of the elderly population. To this end, one approach is to favour
immigration into countries with a rapidly growing elderly population. Another
is to increase the rate of labour market participation, especially of women (at
64% in the OECD countries in 2008, it is well below the rate of 84% for males)
and of older workers. In this regard, an effective and enduring solution is to
favour a lengthening of employees’ working life through some combination of
an increase in the statutory retirement age and an increase in the incentives
to retire later. An increase in the expected age of retirement may partly alleviate
the need to cut benefits – announcing such cuts could lead to higher saving

retirement age could alleviate the need to raise taxes to high levels, which
would significantly distort labour market choices and weigh more heavily on
young and future generations.9

Summing up
Deteriorating public finances in industrial countries pose major macroeconomic
risks to the global economy. Not only can high and rising levels of public debt
endanger medium- and long-term growth prospects, but they can also
undermine the credibility of monetary policy in maintaining low inflation. In
addition, the massive long-term fiscal imbalances in the industrial countries are
hidden by the much smaller current official figures for their public debt – a
problem that certainly points to the need for greater transparency in reporting.
Equally important is the need to base budget projections on prudent
assumptions. On both points, the establishment of independent agencies to
monitor public accounts and projections could prove beneficial.
The required adjustment currently facing advanced economies is surely
large but not unprecedented. A credible commitment by governments to reduce
or eliminate their current and future fiscal deficits will pay rewards over time.
Any possible initial costs of fiscal tightening in terms of reduced short-term
output growth will be outweighed by the persistent benefits of lower real
interest rates, greater stability of the financial system and better prospects for
economic growth.

VI. The future of the financial sector

At the current juncture, the financial sector faces several challenges. In the
near term, these stem directly from the crisis itself. In the longer term, they
are related to efforts by market participants and regulators to build a more
resilient financial system. Adjustments to the size of institutions, as well as
their scope, funding methods, risk management practices, revenue sources
and international operations, will reshape the financial sector.
The crisis revealed structural deficiencies in the sector’s business model. For
several decades, financial institutions have resorted to high leverage as a way to
boost short-term profitability, at the cost of a marked volatility in their performance.
Weak capital, illiquid assets and reliance on short-term funding created
vulnerabilities that led in recent years to large losses and systemic distress.
A new business model, based on stronger capital and liquidity buffers,
would make the performance of financial institutions more robust, thus stabilising
the flow of credit to the economy. Several factors will play a role in a successful
convergence to such a model. For one, the regulatory environment will need
to reward prudent behaviour by financial institutions and create incentives for
markets to do the same. For their part, institutions will need to reduce operating
costs and restructure their financing, including that of their international activities.
This chapter outlines the financial sector’s current business model and
then discusses its future evolution. It starts by comparing the risk-return
profile and size of the financial sector with those of other sectors of the
economy. After discussing likely near-term developments in the financial
sector, the chapter turns to the drivers of a new business model, in which
sustainable profits are based on strong balance sheets.

The financial sector in the context of the broader economy
A comparison across different sectors of the economy casts unfavourable
light on distinct features of the financial business model. Over the long term,
this model has produced a sub-par risk-return profile and has disappointed
investors at times of economy-wide stress. The importance of greater stability
in the financial sector is underscored by the sector’s increased weight in
overall economic activity and by its growing international dimension.

Relative performance
Finance is about managing risk and leverage. In fact, the performance of
financial firms has been underpinned by leverage that is about five times that of
firms in other sectors (Table VI.1). High leverage has allowed financial firms to
post a competitive return on equity – which is what matters to shareholders –
despite a low return on assets.
While the return on equity of financial firms has been comparable to that
of firms in other sectors, it has been less stable. Since leverage amplifies the

sensitivity of equity returns to economic conditions, financial stocks have been
consistently more volatile than non-financial stocks (Graph VI.1, left-hand
panel). Moreover, in many countries financial firms have posted lower equity
returns than the rest of the market over long periods (centre panel). In some
cases, the difference was 4% or more per year over a decade. Thus, despite
several decades of higher returns on financial stocks, their risk-adjusted
performance has been similar to or weaker than that of non-financial stocks
over the past 40 years (right-hand panel).
Given high leverage, the dependence of financial firms on short-term
funding and their opaque and illiquid risk exposures have heightened the
sector’s sensitivity to economic downturns. As a result, financial stocks have
posted particularly weak returns in periods of generalised market stress. When
returns on the overall market have been extremely low (concretely, in the
bottom 20% of their historical range), returns on financial stocks have tended to
be lower than those on non-financial stocks, by 10 percentage points or more
on an annual basis (Graph VI.2, left-hand panel). In comparison, financial
stocks have outperformed the rest of the market by modest margins during
booms (Graph VI.2, right-hand panel). These gains have typically failed to
compensate for losses in periods of general stress, reflecting the asymmetrical
effect of balance sheet illiquidity and high leverage on equity valuations.

consolidation have generally increased the relative size of the largest financial
firms, as indicated by their weight in the overall capitalisation of headline equity
price indices in many countries (Graph VI.3, right-hand panel). Patterns have
differed internationally. The increase has been steeper and more stable in
North America than in Europe. For its part, the share of Japanese financial
firms in Japan’s overall equity market capitalisation has plummeted since the
country’s financial crisis in the early 1990s.

Growth of international banking
… and also along
its international
dimension

The expanding international dimension of finance also increases the
importance of the sector’s stability. The growth in the international business
of financial firms has contributed to global economic integration but also to
the spillover of stress across borders. International lending – whether
conducted from the home office, or by local affiliates in foreign countries, or
via international hubs – has trended upwards as a share of banks’ total
(ie domestic plus international) lending to non-banks (Graph VI.4, left-hand
panel).2 For European banks, this share has grown strongly over the past five
years, and currently stands at more than one third. Partly because of their
larger domestic economies, Japanese and US banks channel abroad less than
15% of their lending.
Non-bank borrowers’ reliance on foreign banks has varied across national
economies but has been generally substantial (Graph VI.4, right-hand panel).

The different forms of international bank lending are associated with different degrees of currency,
funding, country and banking group-level risks. See P McGuire and N Tarashev, “Bank health and
lending to emerging markets”, BIS Quarterly Review, December 2008; R McCauley, P McGuire and G von

At one extreme are the countries of emerging Europe, which obtain more than
80% of their bank borrowing from banks headquartered abroad. At the other
extreme is Japan, where borrowers depend on international lenders for just 5%
of their financing. In between, foreign banks account for roughly one quarter
of overall bank credit in the United States and EU countries. And contrary to
conventional wisdom that foreign banks play a larger role in emerging markets,
their share in emerging Asian economies is less than 20%.

The financial sector in the near future
In the near term, sector developments will be closely linked to the fallout from
the crisis and the related policy responses. Currently, financial firms need to
address uncertainties about the post-crisis economic environment and
expected changes to the prudential regime. In addition, recent rises in the
effective funding rate – a result of market participants’ uncertainty about the
sustainability of the recent surge in bank profits and about the consequences
of financial exposures to troubled sovereigns – have slowed down the recovery
process (see Chapter II). Further ahead, institutions will need to address three
major challenges: refinancing a large portion of their liabilities; ending their
dependence on emergency support measures by the public sector; and
redressing balance sheet weaknesses and reducing operating costs.
The maturity profile of banks’ bond financing shortened during the crisis.
For some time, supply constraints prevented financial institutions (although not
borrowers from other sectors) from issuing debt beyond the short maturities
(Graph VI.5, left-hand panel). This implies particularly high refinancing needs
over the course of the next two years, when bonds worth a total of $3 trillion
are due to mature (Graph VI.5, right-hand panel).
Importantly, the refinancing will take place in an environment radically
different from that in which balance sheets expanded and securitisation could

be relied on. Recently, credit spreads on bank bonds have been markedly
higher than their pre-crisis levels. For medium-term maturities, they have
ranged between 50 and 200 basis points, a tenfold increase from before 2007.
Banks will compete for bond market funding amid an ongoing increase in public
sector borrowing and an eventual reduction in central bank holdings of public
debt. In the long run, banks that have trouble tapping new funding sources
will have to shrink.
The second major challenge for the financial sector arises from the
eventual phasing-out of public sector support. The extraordinary measures
introduced in response to the crisis helped to quell uncertainty and provide
necessary support for markets and institutions. Yet the situation will not be
normalised until these measures are fully withdrawn. Currently, only some
measures have diminished in importance. Examples are the reduced demand
from euro area banks for longer-term repos with the ECB and the declining
take-up of the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility in the
United States.
Moreover, evidence suggests that the remaining measures continue to
have an impact on banks’ funding costs. When gauged by the incremental
improvement in bank ratings, the impact of official support might actually be
stronger now than before the crisis. According to Moody’s, official support in
2009 for the 50 largest banks translated on average into a three-notch upgrade
of their rating (from A3 to Aa3), up from a two-notch upgrade in 2006 (from
A1 to Aa2). In addition, as recently as December 2009, about one quarter of all
bonds issued by banks with higher than average credit default swap (CDS)
spreads featured some form of government guarantee. Similarly, government
stakes – the outcome of capital injections into troubled banks – remain
substantial for a number of important institutions and are likely to diminish only
gradually as the performance of these institutions improves. Also, central

banks still hold large portfolios of assets that they purchased with a view to
supporting specific markets, such as that for securitised mortgages.
The third challenge facing the financial sector stems from the need to
repair balance sheets and strengthen profitability. After periods of distress, the
banking sector tends to act quickly to restore its health. In particular, it rebuilds
its liquidity buffers and cuts back operating costs within four years of a crisis
(Graph VI.6). In the aftermath of the 1990s crises in the Nordic countries, for
example, banks there cut costs by consolidating, shedding branches and
reducing staff numbers.3 In general, such actions are aimed in large part at
capturing the attention of investors via a competitive level of return on equity
(Graph VI.6, right-hand panel). Importantly, past experience also suggests that
post-crisis recoveries are facilitated when financial institutions provide
prudential authorities with a realistic picture of their health and convince
markets that they are effectively tackling the problem of excess capacity in the
sector.4

… and challenges
to profitability

Converging to a new business model
Both market participants and prudential authorities are demanding a
structural overhaul of the financial business model. Increased vigilance by
funding markets, as well as greater rigour on the part of rating agencies, has
led to more stringency and differentiation in assessing the risk of financial
firms. Looking forward, a key priority for the authorities is to embed the
current demands in prudential rules that will strengthen the resilience of the
sector, forming the basis for sustainable profits. Such rules would induce

Drivers of the convergence process

… is demanded by
market players …

Rating agencies, market participants and prudential authorities will guide the
transition of the financial sector to a new business model. From the onset of the
crisis, rating agencies have announced that their future ratings will reflect
greater scrutiny of financial institutions. Indeed, agencies have started to review
more carefully those elements of banks’ business that are more dependent on
market functioning and sentiment. Examples are large trading operations and
short-term wholesale funding. In addition, franchise stability and collateral
arrangements have gained importance in the determination of credit ratings.
Market participants have also revised their assessment of the risks
embedded in exposures to financial institutions. Increasingly, they are
supplementing information from the rating agencies with quantitative analysis
based on market and institutional data. As a result, the funding costs of
financial firms have become more sensitive to credit risk. For instance, even as
yields on bank bond indices in the United States and Europe have declined,
the differential between the yields on riskier and on relatively safer institutions
has remained wide (Graph VI.7, left-hand panel). Although it has come down
from its crisis peak, this differential (normalised by the average yield) is still
wider than that seen between 1998 and 2008. The CDS market paints a similar
picture, albeit over a shorter time period (Graph VI.7, right-hand panel).
Market pressures have already forced financial institutions to build more
resilient balance sheets. Even so, institutions’ progress in improving their
liquidity buffers and in finding more stable sources of funding was insufficient
to prevent the escalation of tensions in interbank markets in May 2010 (see
Chapter II). More generally, given the experience that financial markets amplify

the cycle, market participants are likely to slacken their vigilance during the
next boom phase. Prudential authorities must lock in and build on current
gains in market-driven discipline, thus supporting the structural resilience of
the sector.
Current regulatory efforts in this direction seek to improve banks’ risk
management, governance and transparency and to facilitate the orderly
resolution of large internationally active banks (see Chapter I). The proposed
changes will boost the quality and size of capital and liquidity buffers and will
constrain institutions’ leverage. In line with the renewed focus of market
participants, these changes will expand the risk coverage of the regulatory
framework and place greater emphasis on tangible equity. Furthermore,
international cooperation to improve the transparency and comparability of
financial institutions’ balance sheets aims to level the playing field, promote
market discipline and restrict the scope for regulatory arbitrage.

… and prudential
authorities

Towards improved funding and liquidity management
Stable sources of funding and strong liquidity buffers buttress the resilience of
the financial sector’s performance. In periods of stress, they support markets’
confidence in the ability of institutions to continue financing their operations
or downsize their balance sheets at a low cost. And this confidence, which is
reinforced by greater balance sheet transparency, is of the utmost importance
for financial intermediation. As soon as it vanishes, key financial markets seize
up, quickly inflicting material damage on fundamentally viable institutions.
From the outset, the crisis exposed deficiencies in banks’ funding strategies
and asset management. As financial losses started to mount, the scarcity of
information about financial institutions’ illiquid balance sheets heightened
market uncertainty. This aggravated the difficulties of banks dependent on
sentiment-driven short-term funding markets, creating a vicious circle.5
Banks’ liquidity and funding problems have been particularly acute on
the international scene, where information problems are greatest. In response
to disruptions in the foreign exchange swap market, central banks intervened
and provided emergency swap lines on an unprecedented scale in 2008. Similar
strains resurfaced more recently, necessitating a second wave of official
liquidity support in May 2010. In addition, host countries suffered disruptions
in intermediation as foreign banks experienced strains in their home market
or in third countries. Each case has triggered calls for a more decentralised
model of international banking, so that lending is funded, extended and
supervised to a greater degree in the same location.
The extent to which banks have adjusted the model of their international
operations over the years has differed across countries. Canadian, Dutch and
Japanese banks have moved towards a more decentralised model, which
involves more local funding of foreign lending and less reliance on intragroup

… entails trade-offs

transfers (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel). For their part, US, German and
Australian banks have moved in the opposite direction. Such developments
have resulted in a marked divergence in the degree of decentralisation of
national banking systems (Graph VI.8, right-hand panel).
From a borrower’s point of view, any shift towards a more decentralised
model of international banking will carry both benefits and costs. For instance,
such a model would help insulate the domestic economy from disruptions
elsewhere to the operations of internationally active banks. At the same time,
however, a more decentralised model would also imply a lower degree of
diversification against local shocks. In addition, to the extent that cross-border
banking flows support high levels of net external debt (top right quadrant in
Graph VI.9), any reduction in these flows would need to be offset by alternative
sources of financing.
The trade-offs associated with a move towards a more decentralised
model of international banking serve as a general reminder that it is impossible
to eliminate all risks via institutional reorganisation. Risks in liquidity and
funding management will need to be mitigated via stronger liquidity buffers
and greater reliance on stable funding sources, such as retail deposits.

Higher capital: is there a trade-off between resilience and profitability?
The success of regulatory reform depends on the balance it strikes between
the objectives of the prudential authorities and the incentives of financial
institutions. Contrary to an often repeated assertion, empirical evidence from
recent years fails to uncover any tension between banks’ capitalisation and
return on equity during the boom period although it does point to a link
between lower capital ratios and higher losses during the crisis. In addition,

bank shows that, by rewarding the long-term resilience of better capitalised
institutions, funding markets could actually help to ensure high long-term
profits in the financial sector. Investors also need to recognise that banks’
recent net earnings have been artificially supported by official guarantees.
Moreover, the sector will need to address overcapacity before its profitability
can become truly sustainable.
The experience of 40 large banks during the last boom reveals no
discernible link between return on equity and capital holdings. The banks with
low returns on assets between 2004 and 2006 were the ones that increased
leverage to attain a competitive return on equity. Such banks had relatively
lower capital ratios but posted a return on equity that was no higher than that
of banks with a stronger capital base (Graph VI.10, left-hand panel). To the
extent that higher capital ratios led to greater resilience, there is then no
evidence of a trade-off between enhanced safety and high returns.
Indeed, the crisis demonstrated that higher capital ratios did contribute to
the resilience of the best performers among the same 40 banks (Graph VI.10,
centre panel). The banks with high capital holdings in 2006 required low levels
of support in the form of emergency measures between 2007 and 2009. More
importantly, only banks with low capital ratios in 2006 needed extensive
emergency support during the crisis. This pattern is quite distinct even though
it leaves out additional major determinants of how banks fared in the crisis,
such as the size of their liquidity buffers.6
The crisis also exposed the precarious nature of bank profits. Banks that
had enjoyed high returns on equity just before the crisis needed high levels of

emergency support as it unfolded (Graph VI.10, right-hand panel). This is a
specific illustration of the structural fragility of banks’ business models.
Consistent with the long-term picture depicted by Table VI.1 and Graphs VI.1
and VI.2, high shareholder returns in the sector were unsustainable because
they were generated by high leverage and risk-taking that proved to be
unmanageable in a period of stress.
Looking forward, strong capital buffers should contribute to a resilient
performance by financial institutions. As markets recognise this resilience, the
cost of funding will decline and, with it, the return on assets in the sector will
rise. And since higher capital constrains leverage, it will also limit institutions’
capacity to boost return on equity in good times at the cost of elevated losses
in bad times.
Lower returns on equity could actually be a desirable outcome for the
long-term investor as well as for the economy at large. In the light of recent
experience (Graph VI.10, right-hand panel), equity holders will arguably require
lower but more stable returns on equity that are likely to translate into higher
profits in risk-adjusted terms. For the economy as a whole, a more stable
performance of the financial sector would imply a reduced incidence of
financial crises and a lower magnitude of the associated costs.
In addition, a reduction of returns on equity from the high levels
supported by explicit and implicit public guarantees would contribute to the
healthy functioning of the financial sector. As noted above, government
support has recently boosted the average Moody’s rating for the 50 largest
banks by three notches. For 2009 levels of bank CDS spreads, this upgrade
translates into a 1 percentage point decline in funding costs, which lifts
returns on equity. This amounts to a subsidy, which keeps profits in the sector
at artificially high levels and distorts economic decision-making. Thus, higher
capital holdings would not only improve institutions’ resilience but, by

Capital holdings and profitability of a representative bank
What effect will higher capital requirements have on banks’ profits and how might banks respond? This
box seeks to provide quantitative answers and to put them in perspective by measuring the benefits
that banks enjoy from government support. The results, presented in Graph VI.A, are based on end-2006
balance sheets and income statements for national banking systems in the euro area, as published by
the OECD. Averaging across banking systems delivers the balance sheet and income statement of a
representative bank, with leverage (ie assets-to-capital ratio) of 20, return on equity (or net income
divided by equity capital) of 14% and operating expenses equal to 40% of interest expenses. It is
assumed that, initially, the bank charges an interest rate on loans of 6% (which is the ratio of interest
income to interest earning assets) and that 60% of its capital qualifies as regulatory capital.
The graph’s two left-hand panels illustrate the impact of higher capital requirements on net income
and the return on equity. The assumption is that the bank meets higher capital requirements by
transforming a uniform fraction of its different debt instruments into equity, without changing the assets
side of its balance sheet. The resulting decline in leverage improves the bank’s creditworthiness, which
is assumed to depress the interest rate only on its bond issues. Keeping revenues constant, this decline
in funding costs raises net income to the extent indicated by the red lines in the graph. In addition to
their positive impact on net income, higher capital holdings also depress leverage, which results in a net
negative impact on the return on equity (green lines).
The stronger the reaction of funding markets to changes in the bank’s capital ratio, the greater is
the positive impact of higher capital requirements on net income and the smaller is the negative impact
on the return on equity. The top and bottom panels reflect different assumptions regarding this reaction.

BIS 80th Annual Report

A weak reaction by the funding market translates into a 15% (17%) decline in the funding rate for a 100%
(200%) rise in regulatory capital. At a risk-free rate of 3.5%, this decline corresponds to the narrowing of
CDS spreads in the euro area when credit ratings improved from A to AA (to AAA) in 2005. Corresponding
to the narrowing of CDS spreads in 2006, the decline in the funding rate under a strong market reaction
is set to 40% (48%).
The right-hand panels illustrate two alternative ways of restoring the bank’s initial return on equity
given its new capital requirements. One way is to increase the rate on loans (brown lines). Alternatively,
a cut in operating expenses could stabilise the return on equity at the same level (blue lines).
To put these results into perspective, the graph also shows how the removal of government
support might affect profits. According to Moody’s, the rating in 2009 of the 50 largest banks would have
worsened on average by three notches (from Aa3 to A3) in the absence of government support. Recent
data on bank CDS spreads indicate that such a downgrade would increase the interest rate that banks
pay on their securities by 1 percentage point. The dashed lines in the left-hand panels quantify the
resulting decline in the representative bank’s return on equity when capital holdings are at their initial
level. In the right-hand panels, the dashed lines plot the corresponding increase in the lending rate and
decrease in operating expenses that would maintain the initial level of the return on equity in the
absence of government support.

… and funding

reducing the return on equity, would also serve to offset the distortionary
impact of government support.
A back of the envelope calculation illustrates the extent to which higher
capital offsets the impact of government support on a representative bank
(see box). For a broad range of increases in capital holdings, the resulting
return on equity remains above the level that would prevail under the initial
capital holdings but in the absence of a subsidy due to public guarantees. In
Graph VI.A (left-hand panels), this is the range where the solid green lines are
above the dashed lines. Concretely, when the funding market provides high
rewards for building a resilient balance sheet, an increase in capital holdings
by up to 150% would have a smaller impact on return on equity than a removal
of public guarantees (bottom left-hand panel).
The bank could compensate for the higher cost of equity compared with
debt, by cutting its operating costs or raising its lending rate (Graph VI.A,
right-hand panels). Provided that the funding market reacts strongly to
improvements in the resilience of the bank’s balance sheet, the cut in operating
expenses would be modest (bottom right-hand panel). For instance, the cut
that keeps the return on equity at its initial level, given an increase in capital
holdings of up to 120%, is smaller than the cut that would achieve the same
result if capital holdings stayed fixed but government subsidies were removed
(solid vs dashed blue lines). A similar conclusion is reached if the bank adjusts
by raising its lending rate (brown lines).

Summing up
The crisis exposed deficiencies in the financial sector’s business model that
had prevailed for several decades. Since financial institutions have generated
competitive returns on equity via high leverage on opaque and illiquid balance
sheets, their performance has been volatile at all times and sub-par in periods
of general stress. The importance of strengthening the sector’s resilience has

increased in line with its weight in overall economic activity and with the scale
of the international component of financial intermediation. Higher prudential
buffers and lower leverage will help ensure the structural resilience of the
financial sector. Continuing progress by banks in restructuring their cost base,
stabilising their balance sheets and eliminating excess capacity will support
the trend towards sustainable profitability.

exposures …

… and the
vulnerability of the
financial system to
procyclicality

Addressing
procyclicality and
countercyclical
macroeconomic
policy are related

Macroprudential policy frameworks are critical to putting the financial system
on a more stable foundation. The financial crisis has accelerated efforts to
develop them.1 And authorities are acquiring greater experience with using
prudential instruments for system-wide goals. The opportunity to establish
credible macroprudential frameworks firmly must not be squandered.
The broad goal of macroprudential policy is to limit systemic risk – the
risk of financial system disruptions that can destabilise the macroeconomy.2 To
implement macroprudential policy, instruments typically used in the prudential
regulation and supervision of individual financial institutions are adapted to
limit risk in the financial system as a whole (see box).
Macroprudential policy limits systemic risk by addressing the two key
externalities of the financial system. The first is joint failures of institutions
because of interlinkages and common exposures among them. Chapter I
discusses a range of initiatives under way to reduce vulnerabilities arising
from these sources.
The second externality is procyclicality. Procyclicality is the phenomenon
of amplifying feedbacks within the financial system and between the financial
system and the macroeconomy. As we have seen recently, procyclicality
can promote the emergence of unsustainable booms. As boom turns to
bust, procyclicality can magnify the disruption and cause a deep economic
recession.
Addressing procyclicality is closely linked to traditional countercyclical
macroeconomic policy. And likewise, the development of an effective
framework to address procyclicality raises some questions that are familiar
from the development of fiscal and monetary policy. For example, how should
the objective be defined? What is the right balance between instruments that
vary countercyclically and static measures that act as automatic stabilisers?
How much room should be allowed for discretion as opposed to rules? Who
should decide on the instrument settings? And what should be the relationship
with macroeconomic policies, especially monetary policy? In this chapter,
these questions will be examined as we describe the essential elements of a
macroprudential framework to address procyclicality. Before proceeding,
however, we emphasise three broad points.

What is a macroprudential instrument?
The term “macroprudential” has become so popular since the crisis that its use has spread to many policy
measures whose primary goals lie beyond the specific realm of financial stability. Such indiscriminate
extension risks impeding and obscuring policy development, and thus undermining public support for
macroprudential policy.
Many policy functions – including monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policy – can, and often do,
promote financial stability in one way or another. But only instruments operated with the explicit primary
objective of promoting the stability of the financial system as a whole, and which have the most direct
and reliable impact on financial stability, should be thought of as macroprudential.
Those tools are prudential tools. Macroprudential policy essentially broadens the perspective of
traditional prudential policy, whose tools promote sound practices and limit risk-taking at the level of
individual financial institutions and instruments. The definition of a macroprudential instrument certainly
has grey areas, and the suitability of tools can change as the structure of the economy and financial
system changes. For example, reserve requirements are seeing increasing use in emerging market
economies for financial stability purposes, and could be seen as macroprudential to the extent that they
limit liquidity risk.
Conceiving of the core set of macroprudential instruments as overlays to existing prudential
instrument settings, or as adjustments to those settings, has the practical advantage of clearly distinguishing
macroprudential measures from microprudential settings of the instruments. Implementation in the form
of overlays highlights the independence of the macroprudential function and the difference between the
macroprudential and the microprudential perspectives. It clarifies the focus of macroprudential policy,
which is to target the stability of the financial system as a whole, rather than that of individual institutions
within it. Moreover, this rigorous definition of macroprudential instruments helps keep governance
arrangements simple and thus more likely to promote accountability and clear policy.


For more extensive discussion of the use of the term, see P Clement, “The term ‘macroprudential’: origins and evolution”,
BIS Quarterly Review, March 2010, pp 59–67.

First, the macroprudential objective should not promise more than
policymakers can deliver. In particular, the objective should not be defined in
terms of managing the economic cycle. An objective of eliminating credit cycles
or targeting asset prices would also reach too far. Rather, the most realistic
objective is to strengthen the resilience of the financial system to the
emergence of financial strains. This objective is achievable through the well
timed, countercyclical building-up and releasing of capital and other buffers in
the financial system. Such an approach should also help restrain excessive
credit growth and unsustainable asset price dynamics.
Second, the instruments used to promote resilience should be set as
much as possible using simple rules and guidelines, such as constraints on
extreme risk-taking and links to clear indicators of systemic risk. Such an
emphasis on simple rules will help policymakers manage the public’s typically
strong resistance to countercyclical actions during a boom. Closely tying
instrument settings to risk indicators that are not well understood and whose
reliability is not well established should be avoided.
Third, central banks will need to be closely involved in the development
and implementation of macroprudential policy. That imperative reflects both
the deep experience of central banks in system-wide analysis and intervention
and the close, two-way relationship between addressing procyclicality and
conducting monetary policy.

Several caveats are important. There is no silver bullet that will eliminate
financial system instability. Frameworks will need to reflect country-specific
circumstances. Improving financial system resilience will not prevent economic
recessions. And finally, monetary policy should be an essential partner in
promoting financial stability. In particular, monetary policy must lean more
against the build-up of financial system risks. It can do that while retaining its
focus on price stability by lengthening its effective policy targeting horizon.

Essential elements of a macroprudential framework
The essential elements of a macroprudential framework consist of: a clearly
defined and realistic objective; an operating strategy; choices about sectoral
specificity; governance arrangements; sensitivity to economy-specific
circumstances; and international coordination.

A clearly defined and realistic objective
Increasing the
resilience of the
system is an
achievable
macroprudential
objective

A broad range of
tools is available

The objective for macroprudential policy must aim for a clear but achievable
reduction in systemic risk. Given the current state of our knowledge, stability
can be most reliably achieved by emphasising strengthening of the resilience
of the system through countercyclical management of the system’s buffers
against shocks.3 The objective could include mitigating the build-up of
excesses in credit growth and asset prices, but we should recognise that that
is much more elusive. It would strain our current knowledge and probably
require measures that are less well tested. The objective should not go so far
as to aim explicitly at eliminating credit booms and unsustainable asset price
increases.
In contrast, the use of prudential instruments to manage buffers
countercyclically is not new. The most effective method for increasing the
strength of the system is to ensure that adequate buffers are available and
released during downturns. That would reduce the risk of fire sales and credit
crunches in the downturn, and might also moderate financial ebbs and flows
by restraining risk-taking during the boom.
Many instruments have been applied in such a manner and others are
under development. Some measures aim to reduce short-termism and other
procyclical features of decision-making in financial institutions. Their imposition
need not depend on prevailing financial and economic conditions (Table VII.1).
Other instruments constrain balance sheet structure (eg capital, liquidity
or provisioning standards), characteristics of lending contracts (eg maximum
loan-to-value ratios) or other types of risk exposure (eg limits on currency
mismatches) directly. They can be set once and for all, or varied according to
changing assessments of systemic risk (Tables VII.2 and VII.3).
The most efficient way to create countercyclical buffers is to build them up
during booms. Although still at an early stage and generally not done in the

context of an explicit macroprudential objective, such an approach has been
used more extensively since the crisis, and further proposals are under
review.4 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, for example, is using
this approach in its recommendations for the reform of banking regulation and
supervision.5
Recent evidence suggests that the use of traditional prudential
instruments for macroprudential purposes does help to enhance financial
system resilience.6 In particular, the fairly widespread use of such measures
in Asian economies to strengthen banks in the region over the past decade or
so might help explain why those banks were less affected by the exuberance
in property markets.
However, the overall experience to date does not suggest that
countercyclical variations in buffers have powerful and lasting effects on credit
and asset prices. Despite the fairly active use of measures related to property
lending in Asia, the region’s economies continue to see quite large and
frequent property price cycles.
Yet the benefits of successfully moderating both phases of the credit and
asset price cycle are clearly worth pursuing over the longer term. An approach
to actively restrain credit and asset market excesses in booms could develop
with improved knowledge of the relationships between macroprudential
instrument settings and financial and economic fluctuations. The approach
might require more restrictive or broad applications of the instruments
and greater reliance on judgment and discretion. Because the role of
macroprudential policy in macroeconomic policy would be more prominent in

that situation, macroprudential governance arrangements would have to be
stronger to manage the interaction with monetary policy.
Materially moderating credit and asset price cycles would maximise
the contribution of macroprudential policy to macroeconomic stabilisation
and hence would maximise its support of monetary policy. But experience
thus far suggests that an ambitious macroprudential objective specified in
such terms risks unintended consequences and should be avoided at this
stage.
The best approach to restraining excesses in credit and asset prices
would be achieved by a combination of macroprudential policy and monetary
policy leaning against the build-up of imbalances. Each alone should not be
expected to do the full job.

Operating strategy
Macroprudential operations can differ in terms of how much and how often
the instruments are adjusted in response to movements in systemic risk, and
in terms of whether those adjustments are governed by rules or discretion.
Instrument settings might even be completely fixed – “set and forget” – and still
act as automatic stabilisers by reducing the scope for extremes of risk-taking.

The use of fixed ratios, or absolute limits, in upswings has been quite
common. They have been applied to loan terms (eg loan-to-value (LTV) ratios,
ratios of debt service to income, and margin limits),7 currency mismatches8
and, less frequently, loan loss provisioning through the use of long-term
average loss experience (“through the cycle” or “dynamic” provisions).9
Greater use of set-and-forget instruments is currently under consideration.
The capital reforms advanced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
for instance, base minimum capital requirements for trading books on the
assumption of stress conditions rather than on recent loss history, which
varies highly procyclically.10 Similarly, the Committee on the Global Financial
System has recommended consideration of margin requirements based on
through-the-cycle valuations of collateral assets, which would reduce the
procyclical sensitivity of margins to financial and economic conditions.11

For bank capital, one can set fixed buffers above the regulatory minima that
can be released, or at least be allowed to be drawn down, as banks incur
losses.
Fixed settings for instruments can still be automatically stabilising to the
extent that their incidence, or “bite”, varies over the cycle. For example, a
maximum LTV ratio fixed at a low level will be more binding during a credit
boom, when banks seek to expand property lending, than in a bust, when
heightened risk aversion reduces their propensity to extend loans with a high
LTV ratio. At the same time, fixed instruments need to be designed with care
to avoid inducing procyclicality. For example, if binding during the upswing,
minimum capital requirements can constrain risk-taking. But if they become
binding as strains emerge, they can encourage hasty shedding of risky assets
and tighter credit conditions.
Instrument settings that vary according to developments in indicators of
risk can be tied tightly to the indicators or only loosely. For example, capital
buffers might be built up opportunistically, when capital is cheap, and varied in
only a roughly countercyclical way. Alternatively, leading indicators of systemwide financial distress could be relied on more rigidly for steering instrument
settings.
The development of systemic risk measures to guide instrument settings
is under way. Work at the BIS and elsewhere suggests that simple indicators
– based on simultaneous deviations from historical norms of both the
credit/GDP ratio and asset prices – can fairly reliably signal financial distress
years ahead, in real time and out of sample. As leading indicators of systemic
risk improve, the instrument settings could respond to them more sensitively.12
Ultimately, with enough improvement in modelling, policymakers could link
instrument settings closely to systemic risk to maintain it within an acceptable
range, in a manner akin to the use of inflation forecasts in inflation targeting
regimes.
In practice, policymakers have tended to rely heavily on discretionary
adjustments to instrument settings that are only loosely linked to quantitative
risk indicators. Especially in Asia, the adjustments have been made in
connection with property-related lending during financial upswings, in response
to concerns with overheating. Authorities have cited developments in property
prices, growth in property sector credit, secondary market sales and
construction activity as risk indicators warranting the actions. Adjustments have
included tightening limits on loan contract terms such as LTV ratios, raising risk
weights for regulatory capital, raising reserve and other liquidity requirements
and, sometimes, limiting foreign currency exposures. Often, policymakers have
made more than one adjustment at the same time – eg modifying LTV ratios
while limiting the concentration of lending to certain sectors (Table VII.4). They
have typically adjusted instrument settings at intervals of a few years, but the
degree of activism has varied across countries.

Review, March 2009, pp 29–46.

There are good reasons to base the adjustment of instrument settings on
simple and transparent rules. The main advantage of rules is that, once in
place, they do not require continuous justification. If well structured and
durable, they can reduce uncertainty. They can also contribute to automatic
stabilisation by reducing lags in recognition and decision-making and by
precommitting authorities to a tightening of instrument settings when needed.
Precommitment can be especially important in a boom, when the financial
industry, politicians and the public will all strongly challenge any discretionary
tightening on the grounds that the outlook is rosy. Moreover, the temptation to
believe that “this time things are different” can be very powerful for everyone,
including the authorities themselves. Rules can thus be particularly helpful in
relieving the pressure on supervisors to abstain from restraining actions during
economic expansions.
A range of domestic and international initiatives, including a project within
the Basel Committee’s capital reform programme, are examining rules for
countercyclical capital buffers. An example of such a rule would be to set the
buffers as a function of above-trend credit expansion and other rough
indicators of systemic risk. Rules could also specify that adjustments will be
made only if the indicators exceed certain thresholds. The better the signal
value of the indicators, the tighter the thresholds. The ability of rules to help
overcome the lobbying problem is less dependent on their precise form than
on their role in tying policy action to observable indicators.

However, no rule can be effective under all circumstances. Some degree
of discretion will inevitably be necessary. Discretion allows policymakers
flexibility to employ a wide range of risk indicators and to make judgmental
assessments about the evolution of systemic risk. Discretion also allows
tailoring of responses to the nature of the build-ups in risk-taking and
vulnerabilities (as long as these are identifiable in real time). Discretionary
measures are also harder to circumvent than a known and predictable rule.
The design of countercyclical capital buffers illustrates these issues. As
discussed in last year’s Annual Report, it is hard to design simple rules linking
the buffers to a small number of macroeconomic indicators that would reliably
build up and release buffers at the right time. For example, the credit/GDP
ratio works well during the build-up phase, but it tends to lag the emergence
of strains and so is slow in releasing the buffers (Graph VII.1).
What is needed is a variable that is both a leading indicator of financial
distress during the boom and a contemporaneous indicator of distress when it
emerges. Because such a variable might well not exist, some discretion is
probably inevitable in the operation of capital buffers.

Sectoral specificity
Sector-specific
interventions are
less blunt …

Policymakers can apply instruments broadly across the financial sector or
target exposures to specific sectors of the economy if these pose a threat to
the system as a whole. Localised sources of risk might warrant a targeted,
sectoral approach to avoid bluntly hitting the whole economy. For example, the
real estate sector is a popular target, as it has often been a source of financial
instability.

capital buffer for domestic exposures is the buffer for an average bank in the country indicated with
only domestic exposures. It is based on deviations of the domestic credit/GDP ratio from its long-term trend

the gap is above an upper threshold. 2 Quarter 0 is the onset of the respective crises, which is Q3 1991 for

shares of domestic and cross-border lending corresponding to the aggregate exposures for that country.
For each foreign country exposure, the domestic buffer for that country applies. Country weights for
cross-border lending are based on the BIS international banking statistics and fixed at Q4 2006 values.

However, sector-specific strategies can present some difficulties too. They
are less effective in protecting the whole system if they can be circumvented.
And because they can stray into (or be misrepresented as) credit allocation
policy, they put a heavy load on governance arrangements to keep policy
intentions properly focused and clear. And finally, they require more
information and judgment concerning the economy-wide impact of sectoral
developments. Policymakers should therefore be cautious about taking highly
sector-specific approaches.
The design of countercyclical capital requirements for banks illustrates the
issues of sectoral specificity. Linking the increase of capital buffers to a rise in
bank lending to the real estate sector would ensure that the buffers take
account of the systemic risks emanating from that sector. However, it would not
address the indirect exposures arising from the transmission of problems in
the sector to the financial system and wider economy. Moreover, banks might
respond to a narrowly imposed measure by relaxing loan terms in other areas
to maintain their overall loan growth. The temptation to apply ad hoc measures
to a growing list of credit instruments and sectors would be strong.

… but might be
circumvented more
easily and stray into
credit allocation

Governance
Governance mechanisms are needed both to constrain discretion and to
provide the independence needed for discretion to be exercised with some
insulation from lobbying pressures. Another reason for the first element we
addressed – a clear and realistic objective – is that it makes governance simpler.
However, measurement of the macroprudential objective, which is
important for the accountability of policymakers, is challenging.13 The concept
of financial stability is multidimensional. It is also elusive compared with, say,
price stability. The financial system might be fragile for a very long time before
financial distress emerges. And even if vulnerabilities can be measured
reliably, they might build up only gradually and so fail to signal a clear-cut case
for action. In the meantime, excessive risk-taking can be masked by surging
asset prices, low measured leverage, compressed risk premia and subdued
volatility. Even if the objectives cannot be precisely specified, however, the
strategy and intended actions for promoting financial stability need to be
clearly articulated.
Another challenge is that regulators and supervisors, who control the
instruments, have tended – or been required – to focus on the safety and
soundness of individual institutions rather than on the system as a whole. As a
result, they may tend to be less familiar with macroeconomic considerations. By
contrast, central banks have an edge in understanding the behaviour of markets
and the relationship between the financial system and the real economy. Indeed,
it is mostly central banks that have taken the discretionary measures noted above
in response to signs of overheating. Central banks have a stronger incentive
to activate tools for macroprudential purposes (such as by modifying lending
terms system-wide) to complement their macroeconomic policy functions.

Specific authorities

desirable

New and specific institutional structures would be desirable to support
further development of macroprudential frameworks. Those arrangements
should bring together the macroeconomic and financial market expertise of
central banks with the prudential expertise of financial regulators and
supervisors. Specific authorities are needed, with clear mandates, powers and
control over instruments. Financial stability committees, modelled along the
lines of current monetary policy committees, are one option.
Such arrangements should preserve the independence of central banks,
including financial independence. But they would also have significant
implications for central bank accountability. Financial stability decisions may in
many cases require more interaction with the government than monetary policy
decisions, especially under crisis management conditions.
More interaction with the government need not compromise central
bank autonomy. It does imply, though, a need for well specified coordination
mechanisms, and for clarity about the central bank’s financial stability
mandate and strategy. Accountability can be promoted by requiring that
actions and decision-making processes be disclosed to the public or
reviewed by the legislature. These procedures are common in both
monetary policy and financial stability policy. However, central bank
reporting on financial stability to date has been generally less frequent and
less policy-oriented than that on monetary policy. That will probably need
to change.

Economy-specific circumstances and international aspects

matter …

… as do

considerations

Authorities will choose objectives, strategies, instruments and governance
arrangements that reflect their economy-specific circumstances. For example,
to date, macroprudential interventions have been more frequent in bankdominated financial systems, which offer fewer opportunities for circumventing
the measures (eg through securitisation). The interventions also seem to
have been more common in economies with fixed or managed exchange
rates (such as Hong Kong SAR and other Asian economies) or in countries
within currency unions (such as Spain), where the scope for using official
interest rates for macroeconomic stabilisation purposes is limited or nonexistent.
The likelihood of international variation in macroprudential frameworks
and settings also highlights the need for international coordination.
Instrument settings will have to recognise that financial developments are not
synchronised across countries and that financial institutions operate across
borders. For example, settings for capital buffers should relate to an
institution’s exposures to systemic risk across all the countries to which it is
exposed, whether due to cross-border lending or to operations in host
countries. Taking international exposures into account can make a big
difference to the size and evolution of the capital buffers (Graph VII.1).
Close cooperation between home and host authorities will be inevitable.
And some responsibility will have to shift to host authorities for deciding on
the settings that apply to exposures in their jurisdictions and for advising
home authorities of local financial conditions.

Implications for monetary policy
The implementation of macroprudential frameworks will affect the behaviour
of the financial system and hence alter the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. Monetary policy will need to take account of the influence of
macroprudential actions on asset prices and yields.
By stabilising the financial system, a successful macroprudential policy
will lighten the burden on monetary policy in several ways. It will reduce the
frequency and intensity of financial disruptions that cause or amplify economic
fluctuations. It will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy by preventing
financial distress from blunting the impact of interest rate changes. And
perhaps most importantly, if macroprudential measures are effective, monetary
policy will face less pressure to cut interest rates unduly in order to address
threats to financial stability in the downturn.
Most of the time, both policies – macroprudential and monetary – will be
in the same phase of tightening or loosening. However, their relative efficacies
will still need to be weighed carefully. For example, if inflation risks are
emerging, macroprudential measures cannot take the place of interest rate
increases. Macroprudential measures are well suited to enhancing the
resilience of the financial system, but their effects on aggregate demand and
inflation expectations are weak and uncertain compared with those of interest
rates.
Sometimes, however, macroprudential policy and monetary policy will
move in opposite directions, most obviously when the financial system is
under stress but inflation risks are a threat. Under such circumstances,
macroprudential settings might be loosened to ease the stress, while monetary
policy is simultaneously tightened to reduce inflationary pressures. Such a
combination does not indicate policy conflict. Rather, it illustrates how the two
policies can complement each other.
In a system with a macroprudential framework, monetary policy will still be
primarily responsible for price stability. Ebbs and flows in financial activity can
still cause major economic fluctuations even if the financial system remains
resilient to them. And recessions and inflation threats can still arise without a
significant contribution from financial fluctuations.
Monetary policy must, however, increase its contribution to the promotion
of financial stability if it is to attain its own longer-term macroeconomic goals.
Experience shows that a monetary policy strategy narrowly focused on
stabilising inflation, looking out over a short horizon of about two years, is not
sufficiently forward-looking to ensure financial stability, and is thus not
sufficient to stabilise inflation over the longer term. Credit and asset prices
have boomed during periods of low and stable inflation as well as during high
inflation. Therefore, with a relatively short forecasting horizon, monetary policy
could inadvertently accommodate or even contribute to the build-up of financial
vulnerabilities. Monetary policymakers must give greater weight to that concern
by extending the horizon of their targeting period.
Moreover, for the reasons discussed in the previous section, one should
not necessarily expect nascent macroprudential policy aimed at enhancing the
resilience of the financial system to materially restrain credit and asset price

booms too. The potential impact on credit growth of building larger buffers
during the boom is not yet known. In contrast, the influence of monetary policy
on broader credit conditions is relatively well understood.
Monetary policy frameworks do not need extensive adjustment to take
account of financial stability. Systemic risk builds up over a long time. Adding
a few years to the monetary policy targeting horizon, beyond the two years
ahead commonly focused upon, would help monetary policymakers to
weigh longer-term threats to financial stability, including the impact of interest
rate settings, against nearer-term inflation. The result would be a more
comprehensive assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy. Many
central banks are already moving in this direction.
Central bank modelling and target horizons that incorporate longer-term
risks to financial stability obviate the need for an explicit financial stability
mandate for monetary policy. Such an approach would make clear that
financial stability is part of the widely accepted concern with macroeconomic
stability. But an explicit financial stability mandate for monetary policy might
still be helpful because, in a booming economy with low inflation, it could
alleviate the pressure on the central bank to refrain from monetary tightening.
In that situation, the financial stability mandate would allow the monetary
authority to tighten with the aim of countering longer-term threats to stability.
In any case, certain broad features of governance arrangements will be
critical in preserving the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to price
stability: clear mandates and strategies for the macroprudential and monetary
policy functions, operating independence, mechanisms that ensure effective
public communication of the decisions taken, and ways of addressing any
trade-offs that might emerge. Here, too, the arrangements will depend on
country-specific circumstances, including the central bank’s role in prudential
regulation and supervision.

Summing up
Preserving financial and macroeconomic stability over the long term requires
implementing carefully designed macroprudential frameworks and adjusting
prevailing monetary policy frameworks. The current policy consensus provides
a unique opportunity to accomplish those tasks.
The challenge for macroprudential policy is to establish a framework that
is effective and gains public support over time. Macroprudential policy clearly
cannot be an economic cure-all and should not be presented as one – we will
continue to see recessions even under conditions of financial stability. Public
expectations need to be kept aligned with what policy frameworks can actually
deliver.
Given the evidence on what is achievable, the objective of macroprudential
policy at this stage should emphasise strengthening the resilience of the
financial system. Pursuing that objective successfully could also help restrain
excessive credit growth and unsustainable asset price dynamics. Over time, as
we learn more, we can correspondingly enlarge the framework to include
greater emphasis on the moderation of credit and asset price cycles.

The resilience of the financial system can be strengthened by using
simple macroprudential tools. Fixed limits, automatic stabilisers and rough
adjustments of instrument settings – that is, adjustments commensurate with
the reliability of the available indicators of systemic risk – can be implemented
fairly easily. Particular sectors, such as real estate, can be targeted when it is
clear that they are frequent sources of system-wide problems. But, in general,
macroprudential policy should be cautious about targeting economic sectors
too precisely, because that can resemble credit allocation policy and because
the system-wide character of macroprudential policy needs to be established
firmly.
Macroprudential policymakers should design governance arrangements
carefully to ensure a sound basis for implementation. A degree of operational
independence for macroprudential policy is essential, but beyond such
general considerations, governance arrangements will reflect country-specific
circumstances.
Successful macroprudential policy will support monetary policy. But the
conduct of monetary policy must nevertheless adapt as macroprudential
frameworks are developed and implemented. In addition, to maximise its
contribution to both financial and macroeconomic stability, monetary policy
needs to look beyond near-term inflation. Lengthening the policy horizon would
naturally allow monetary authorities to consider financial stability more fully. In
doing so, they would in fact promote price stability more effectively over the
longer term.

Organisation of the BIS as at 31 March 2010

BIS 80th Annual Report

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central
banks and financial authorities in their pursuit of monetary and financial
stability, to foster international cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank
for central banks.
In the light of the Bank’s mission, this chapter reviews the activities of
the BIS and the groups it hosts for the financial year 2009/10; describes the
institutional framework that supports their work; and presents the year’s
financial results.
In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that have responsibility for
promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial system supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial
transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial
operations.
The BIS promotes international monetary and financial cooperation and
coordination through its meetings programmes for central bank officials and
through the Basel Process – hosting international committees and standardsetting bodies and facilitating their interaction. In particular, the BIS hosts the
Financial Stability Board and supports its mandate: to coordinate at the
international level the work of national financial authorities and international
standard-setting bodies in order to develop and promote the implementation
of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.
The BIS research and statistics function addresses the needs of monetary
authorities and supervisory authorities for data and policy insight.
The BIS banking function provides prime counterparty, agent and trustee
services appropriate to the BIS mission.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international financial and monetary cooperation in two
major ways:
•
through hosting bimonthly and other meetings of central bank officials;
and
•
through the Basel Process, which facilitates cooperation of the
committees and standard-setting bodies hosted by the BIS in Basel.

BIS 80th Annual Report

107

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior
central bank officials discuss current developments and the outlook for the world
economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of special and topical interest to central banks. In addition to the
bimonthly meetings, the Bank regularly hosts gatherings that variously include
public and private sector representatives and the academic community.
The principal bimonthly meetings of Governors and other senior officials
of the BIS member central banks are the Global Economy Meeting and the All
Governors’ Meeting.
The members of the Global Economy Meeting (GEM) consist of Governors
from 30 BIS shareholding central banks in major advanced and emerging
market economies that account for 82% of global GDP. Governors from
another 15 central banks attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM’s main role
has been to monitor economic and financial developments and assess the
risks and opportunities in the world economy and the global financial system.
In the course of 2009/10, the BIS Board of Directors added a new
responsibility to the duties of the GEM when it decided on an important
reform of the process of guiding the activities of the main central bank
committees. The responsibility of providing guidance to those committees –
the Committee on the Global Financial System, the Committee on Payment
and Settlement Systems and the Markets Committee – which had been in the
hands of G10 Governors for decades, was transferred to the GEM with effect
from January 2010. Therefore the GEM now sets work priorities for those
committees and, on the proposal of the Chairman of the new Economic
Consultative Committee (discussed below), appoints committee chairs and
approves changes in the composition and organisation of the committees.
The GEM also now receives reports from the chairs of the committees and
decides on publication.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, the Board created a new,
informal group called the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC) to assist it
by preparing proposals for discussion and decision by the GEM. The ECC,
limited to 18 participants, includes all Board member Governors, the central
bank Governors from India and Mexico, and the BIS General Manager.
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB and Chairman of the Global
Economy Meeting in its former capacity, has been elected by the Board to
continue his chairmanship of the GEM in its enhanced capacity and also to
become the Chairman of the new ECC.
In the All Governors’ Meeting, chaired by the BIS Chairman, the Governors
of all shareholding member central banks participate, discussing selected

1
The members of the GEM are the central bank Governors of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the President of the
European Central Bank and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Governors
attending as observers are from Algeria, Austria, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal and Romania.

108

BIS 80th Annual Report

topics that are of general interest to the members. In 2009/10, the topics
discussed were:
•
systemic risks in OTC derivatives markets: analysis and policy options;
•
systemic financial risk: drivers, measurement, policy tools;
•
the comprehensive response of the BCBS to the global banking crisis;
•
policy responses to capital inflows; and
•
interest rate risk in the financial system.
In reviewing the governance of BIS cooperative activities, the Board and
the GEM also agreed that the All Governors’ Meeting should remain in charge
of guiding the work of both the Central Bank Governance Group (which
oversees the operations of the Central Bank Governance Forum) and the
Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics, in particular because the
membership of the two groups goes beyond the participants in the GEM.
Regarding the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Bank
hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of
Supervision, which oversees the work of the BCBS. This oversight body met
twice during the period under review to endorse the comprehensive reform
package being developed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk
management of the banking sector.
The Bank regularly organises informal discussions among public and
private sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting
a sound and well functioning international financial system. In addition, the
Bank organises various other meetings for senior central bank officials on a
regular or ad hoc basis, to which other financial authorities, the private
financial sector and the academic community are invited to contribute. These
meetings include:
•
the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks
in Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in
various regions of the world for Deputy Governors and other senior-level
supervisors.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process directly supports the work of the international secretariats
hosted at the BIS, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which
coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities
and international standard-setting bodies. Another aspect of the BIS’s
facilitative role is the mandate of its Financial Stability Institute (FSI), which is
to assist financial sector supervisory authorities worldwide in strengthening
oversight of their financial systems.

Features of the Basel Process
The Basel Process is based on four key features: (i) the synergies of colocation; (ii) flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; (iii) support

BIS 80th Annual Report

109

from the economic research expertise at the BIS and its banking experience;
and (iv) the dissemination of work.

Synergies. The BIS hosts the secretariats of nine groups, including the FSB,
that contribute to the pursuit of financial stability. The following six enjoy a
significant degree of autonomy in setting their agendas and structuring their
activities:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): addresses
supervision at the level of individual institutions and its relation to
macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and
analyses macrofinancial stability issues;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS): analyses and
sets standards for the payment, clearing and settlement infrastructure;
•
the Markets Committee: examines the functioning of financial markets;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the
design and operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses
statistical issues of concern to central banks, including those relating to
economic, monetary and financial stability.
In contrast to the above six groups, the FSB has its own governance and
reporting lines, as do the remaining two groups hosted at the BIS, the
International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
The synergies created by physical proximity and the resulting exchange
of ideas among these groups have been considerable.
Flexibility. The limited size of these groups leads to flexibility and openness in
the exchange of information, thereby enhancing the coordination of their work
on financial stability issues and avoiding overlaps and gaps in their work
programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger than their limited
size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of the international
community of central bankers, financial regulators and supervisors.
Supportive BIS expertise and experience. The work of the Basel-based
committees is informed by the BIS’s economic research and by its banking
experience. The latter is derived from the BIS Banking Department’s working
relationships with market participants and its implementation of regulatory
standards and financial controls for the conduct of its banking operations.
Dissemination. Dissemination of the standard-setting bodies’ work to official
organisations is facilitated by the FSI.

Activities of BIS-hosted groups in 2009/10
The following pages review the year’s principal activities of the nine groups
hosted at the BIS.

110

BIS 80th Annual Report

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) was established by the G20 declaration of
2 April 2009 as the successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The charter
that formally confirms its objectives, mandate, membership and organisational
processes became effective on 25 September 2009, when it was endorsed by
G20 leaders at the Pittsburgh summit.
The FSB promotes international financial stability by coordinating the work
of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies in
developing strong regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.
It fosters a level playing field though coherent implementation across sectors
and jurisdictions.
More specifically, as part of its mandate, the FSB:
•
assesses vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identifies
and reviews the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to
address them and their outcomes;
•
promotes coordination and information exchange among authorities
responsible for financial stability;
•
monitors and advises on market developments and their implications for
regulatory policy;
•
advises on and monitors best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
•
undertakes joint strategic reviews of the policy development work of the
international standard-setting bodies to ensure that their work is timely,
coordinated, and focused on priorities and addressing gaps;
•
sets guidelines for and supports the establishment of supervisory colleges;
•
supports contingency planning for cross-border crisis management,
particularly with respect to systemically important firms; and
•
collaborates with the IMF to conduct early warning exercises.
The FSB comprises senior officials from finance ministries, central banks
and financial regulators in 24 countries and territories (including all countries
in the G20) as well as from the ECB and the European Commission. It also
includes representatives of international financial institutions (the BIS, IMF,
OECD and World Bank) and international standard-setting and central bank
bodies (the BCBS, CGFS, CPSS, the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB), the IAIS and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO)). The FSB is chaired by Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy.
The FSB operates through plenary meetings of its membership as well as
through the following groups:
•
a Steering Committee, chaired by Mario Draghi;
•
a Standing Committee for Assessment of Vulnerabilities, chaired by
Jaime Caruana, General Manager of the BIS;
a Standing Committee for Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation, chaired
•
by Adair Turner, Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority; and
•
a Standing Committee for Standards Implementation, chaired by Tiff
Macklem, Associate Deputy Minister of the Department of Finance of
Canada.
At its plenary meetings – in June and September 2009 and January 2010 –
the FSB advanced the international regulatory policy reform agenda to

BIS 80th Annual Report

111

strengthen financial stability, setting out clear principles and timetables for
implementation. Its September 2009 report, Improving financial regulation, set
out a reform programme in the following key areas:

Strengthening the global capital and liquidity framework for banks
The FSB and the BCBS, in collaboration with the IMF, are jointly assessing the
macroeconomic implications of the implementation of the BCBS capital and
liquidity reform proposals. The BCBS will take this assessment into account in
framing the appropriate transitional arrangements.

Making global liquidity more robust
In addition to the BCBS-proposed liquidity reforms for banks, the FSB is
coordinating work on international policy actions to address system-wide
cross-border liquidity risks, including the particular issues that arise for
emerging markets.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial
institutions
The FSB is developing by end-October 2010 a package of measures to reduce the
“too big to fail” problems that these institutions pose. This work covers three
areas: reducing the probability and impact of a systemically important firm’s
failure; improving the capacity to undertake an orderly resolution of a failing firm;
and strengthening the core infrastructures and markets. A preliminary assessment
and possible policy options will be presented to the June 2010 G20 summit.

Strengthening accounting standards
The FSB continues to encourage work to improve standards on valuation and
provisioning and achieve a single set of high-quality global accounting
standards. This includes monitoring the implementation of the FSF’s April 2009
recommendations that encourage accounting standard setters to consider
ways of dampening the potential adverse dynamics of fair value accounting,
as part of an effort to enhance transparency and accounting treatments while
mitigating procyclicality.

Improving compensation practices
In April 2009, the FSF released Principles for sound compensation practices
for significant financial institutions. The FSB followed up in September 2009
by issuing implementation standards for those principles. An FSB peer review
published in March 2010 said that significant progress had been made by its
members in incorporating the principles and standards into domestic regulatory
and supervisory frameworks, but it found that effective implementation was
far from complete. A follow-up review on compensation will be undertaken in
the second quarter of 2011.

Expanding oversight of the financial system
Work is progressing to ensure that all systemically important activities –
including those of hedge funds and credit rating agencies – are subjected

112

BIS 80th Annual Report

to appropriate oversight and regulation. The FSB welcomed the Joint
Forum’s January 2010 report on the differentiated nature and scope of
regulation, which makes recommendations to address current gaps in
supervision and regulation, and to increase the consistency of approach
across sectors. The FSB will monitor policy development on the issues the
report identifies and propose action where issues raised are not yet being
addressed.

Strengthening the robustness of the OTC derivatives market
Standards are being strengthened to address systemic risks, including covering
capital requirements to reflect the risks of OTC derivatives and further
incentivise the move to central counterparties and, where appropriate,
organised exchanges. The FSB has established a working group to report by
October 2010 on policy options to increase the standardisation of OTC
derivatives and to develop a clear process to consistently implement
mandatory clearing and trading requirements at the global level.

Relaunching securitisation on a sound basis
The official sector must provide the framework that ensures discipline in the
securitisation market as it revives. The FSB is assessing what further steps are
needed in areas such as transparency, disclosure and the alignment of
incentives.

Promoting adherence to international standards
The FSB is fostering a race to the top by encouraging all jurisdictions to raise
their level of adherence to international financial standards. FSB member
jurisdictions will lead by example, including by implementing financial
standards and disclosing their level of adherence. FSB member jurisdictions are
undergoing thematic and single-country peer reviews to evaluate their
adherence. The March 2010 peer review of compensation practices was the
first such review.
The FSB is also encouraging the adherence of all jurisdictions to
international financial standards, including through an initiative launched in
March 2010 to identify non-cooperative jurisdictions and assist them in
improving their adherence.

Other work
In November 2009, the FSB published reports on three other issues:
•
A note reviewing policies to withdraw from exceptional financial support
measures set out principles that such exit policies should be
preannounced, flexible, transparent and credible. The note includes a
report by the staffs of IADI and the IMF on strategies to unwind
temporary deposit insurance arrangements.
•
A joint report by the IMF, BIS and FSB, Guidance to assess the systemic
importance of financial institutions, markets and instruments: initial
considerations, outlines conceptual and analytical approaches for use by
national authorities. It discusses a possible form for general guidelines

•

that would be sufficiently flexible to apply to a broad range of countries
and circumstances.
A joint report by the IMF and FSB, The financial crisis and information
gaps, identifies gaps and sets forth proposals for strengthening data
collection to better capture the build-up of risk in the financial sector,
improve data on international financial network connections, monitor the
vulnerability of domestic economies to shocks, and improve the
communication of official statistics. The FSB has formed a working group
to handle its part of the implementation work.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, chaired by Nout Wellink,
President of the Netherlands Bank, seeks to improve supervisory understanding
and the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It supports supervisors by
providing a forum for exchanging information on national supervisory
arrangements, by improving the effectiveness of techniques for supervising
international banking, and by setting minimum supervisory standards.

Response to the financial crisis
The Basel Committee’s reform programme is at the core of global efforts to
mitigate systemic risk and promote more sustainable economic growth. An
essential lesson of the financial crisis is the need to build up capital and
liquidity buffers in the banking system: the quality and amount of capital must
be increased; the leverage ratio must act as a backstop to the risk-based
requirement and as a brake on the build-up of sector-wide leverage; and a
global liquidity standard must be introduced to provide greater resilience to
liquidity shocks both on and off the balance sheet.
Another key lesson is the need to focus supervision not just on the
soundness of individual banks but also on broader financial stability
objectives. That is, the microprudential foundation of supervision needs to be
supplemented with a macroprudential overlay. To mitigate the procyclical
behaviour of financial markets, the Committee is promoting capital conservation,
countercyclical buffers and loss provisioning that is more forward-looking. In
addition, it is proposing a number of steps to address the systemic linkages of
global banks and the associated moral hazard these create.
In July 2009, the Committee approved a final package of measures to
strengthen the 1996 rules governing trading book capital and to enhance the
three pillars of the Basel II Framework.
In December 2009, it published for consultation a comprehensive reform
package to substantially reduce the probability and severity of economic and
financial stress by strengthening global capital and liquidity regulations. The
Committee is conducting an impact assessment of those proposals during the
first half of 2010. The Committee’s goal is to deliver a fully calibrated set of
standards by the end of 2010, with a two-year phase-in to ensure a smooth
transition.

114

BIS 80th Annual Report

Bank capital: improving its quality
A key element of the December 2009 proposals is raising the quality,
consistency and transparency of the capital base. The proposal’s focus on
common shares and retained earnings as the predominant form of Tier 1 capital
will help ensure that any large, internationally active bank is in a better position
to absorb losses, whether as a going concern or as a firm that is being wound
down. The Committee is harmonising the other elements of the capital structure.
The December 2009 proposals also include a review of issues regarding
contingent and convertible capital instruments: the criteria by which to judge
their loss absorbency and the role of these instruments more generally both
within the regulatory capital minimum and as buffers.

Bank capital: expanding risk coverage
During the crisis, the majority of bank losses were in the trading book, which is
where most of the industry’s leverage was built up. The Committee’s July 2009
package called for higher capital requirements to capture the credit risk of
complex trading activities; and it introduced a stressed value-at-risk
requirement, intended to dampen the cyclicality of the minimum regulatory
capital framework.
The July 2009 enhancements to the Basel II Framework strengthened
Pillar 1 (minimum capital requirements) by raising the risk weights for
resecuritisation exposures – so-called CDOs of ABS (collateralised debt
obligations of asset-backed securities). The Committee also applied stricter
standards to short-term liquidity facilities for off-balance sheet conduits.
The December 2009 proposals included strengthening the capital
requirements for counterparty credit risk exposures arising from derivatives,
repurchase agreements (repos) and securities financing activities. These
enhancements will also increase incentives to move over-the-counter derivative
exposures to central counterparties and exchanges.

Bank capital: introducing a supplementary leverage ratio
The December 2009 package introduced a leverage ratio as a supplementary
measure to the Basel II risk-based framework with a view to migrating to a Pillar 1
treatment based on appropriate review and calibration. The supplementary
ratio would help contain the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking
system, introduce additional safeguards against attempts to game the risk-based
requirements and help address model risk. To ensure comparability, the details
of the leverage ratio will be harmonised internationally, fully adjusting for any
remaining differences in accounting. The ratio will be calibrated so that it serves
as a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based requirements, taking
into account the forthcoming changes to the Basel II Framework.

Bank capital: reducing procyclicality
One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis was procyclicality – the
amplification of financial shocks throughout the financial system and the
broader economy. Procyclicality arose through a variety of channels, including
accounting standards for both mark to market assets and held-to-maturity

BIS 80th Annual Report

115

loans, margining practices, and the build-up and release of leverage among
financial institutions, firms and consumers.
The Committee has proposed measures to make the banking sector serve as
a shock absorber instead of a transmitter of risk: building up capital buffers in good
times so that they can be drawn upon in periods of stress; and making provisioning
more forward-looking by calculating it on the basis of expected losses.
The build-up of buffers would be achieved through capital conservation
measures, including limits on excessive dividend payments, share buybacks
and compensation. The Committee is also reviewing a mechanism that would
adjust capital buffers countercyclically through a linkage with credit variables.
A move to expected-loss provisioning would capture actual losses more
transparently and would be less procyclical than the current incurred-loss
provisioning model.

Bank capital: addressing systemic risk and interconnectedness
To assist supervisors in measuring the systemic significance of particular
banks, and to reduce the probability and impact of the failure of a systemically
important bank, the Committee is evaluating the concept of a capital surcharge
for such banks and related supervisory measures.

Improving liquidity risk management and supervision
The inaccurate and ineffective management of liquidity risk was central to the
financial crisis. To help address the problem and promote consistent
supervisory expectations – and building on the Committee’s Principles for
sound liquidity risk management and supervision, issued in 2008 – the BCBS
has recently focused on further enhancing the resilience of internationally
active banks to liquidity stresses as well as increasing international
harmonisation of liquidity risk supervision.
For such banks, the December 2009 consultative package introduced a
global minimum liquidity ratio, which included a 30-day coverage ratio. That
ratio would be underpinned by a longer-term structural ratio and a minimum
set of tools aimed at identifying and analysing trends in liquidity risk at both
the bank and system-wide levels.

Enhancing risk management
The July 2009 enhancements to Basel II included supplemental guidance
under Pillar 2 (the supervisory review process) to address the risk
management flaws revealed by the crisis. The guidance, which became
effective immediately, covered:
•
firm-wide governance and risk management;
•
the risk of off-balance sheet exposures and securitisation activities;
•
risk concentrations; and
•
incentives for banks to better manage risk and return over the long term.
The supplemental guidance incorporates the Financial Stability Forum’s
April 2009 Principles for sound compensation practices. Further, the
Committee in January 2010 issued a supervisory assessment methodology to
promote sound compensation practices at banks.

116

BIS 80th Annual Report

In May 2009, the Committee issued Principles for sound stress testing
practices and supervision to address the weaknesses in bank stress tests that
were highlighted by the crisis.

Strengthening corporate governance
In March 2010, the Committee released for consultation a set of best
governance practices for banks in Principles for enhancing corporate
governance. The document addresses fundamental deficiencies that became
apparent during the financial crisis. Supervisors also have a critical role in this
area. Under the Committee’s principles, they should establish guidance or
rules for implementing best practice and regularly evaluate a bank’s policies
and practices according to the Committee’s principles.

Accounting for financial instruments
The application of fair value accounting to a wider range of financial
instruments, together with experiences from the crisis, has highlighted the
critical importance of robust risk management and control processes. Hence,
in April 2009 the Committee issued guidance for banks in its Supervisory
guidance for assessing banks’ financial instrument fair value practices. The
document also provides guidance to supervisors under the Pillar 2 supervisory
review process.
In August 2009, the Committee released a set of high-level Guiding
principles for the replacement of IAS 39 to assist the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) in addressing issues related to provisioning, fair value
measurement and related disclosures. The principles will help the IASB
produce standards that improve the usefulness and relevance of financial
reporting for key stakeholders. Moreover, the G20 recently recommended that
the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, in the United States,
achieve convergence between the International Financial Reporting Standards
and the United States’ generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP).
The Committee’s high-level guiding principles will advance those joint efforts,
and they will also ensure that accounting reforms address broader concerns
about procyclicality and systemic risk.

Improving transparency
The July 2009 Basel II package included enhancements to Pillar 3 (market
discipline) to strengthen disclosure requirements for securitisations, off-balance
sheet exposures and trading activities. These additional requirements will
help reduce market uncertainties about the strength of banks’ balance sheets
in relation to capital market activities.

Facilitating cross-border bank resolution
In March 2010, the Committee issued its final Report and recommendations of
the Cross-border Bank Resolution Group. The financial crisis exposed gaps in
techniques and tools needed for the complex and multidimensional process of
resolving a cross-border bank in an orderly fashion. First issued for
consultation in September 2009, the report sets out 10 recommendations

BIS 80th Annual Report

117

covering three topics: strengthening national resolution powers and their
cross-border implementation; firm-specific contingency planning; and
reducing contagion.

Establishing and improving deposit insurance systems
In June 2009, the Committee and the International Association of Deposit
Insurers published Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems.
The document responds to the need for effective deposit insurance to help
maintain public confidence during a crisis. In addressing issues such as
coverage, funding and prompt reimbursement, the Core Principles set an
important benchmark in establishing or reforming deposit insurance systems.

Expanded Committee membership
In 2009, the Committee and its governing body, the Group of Central Bank
Governors and Heads of Supervision, acted to enhance the Committee’s
ability to pursue its worldwide mission. They agreed to expand the number of
member jurisdictions, and thus the Committee’s membership, by inviting
representatives from Hong Kong SAR and Singapore and from the G20
countries that were not already represented: Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and
Turkey. The Basel Committee now consists of 27 member jurisdictions
represented by 44 central banks and supervisory authorities.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), chaired by Donald L
Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, monitors financial market developments and analyses their
implications for financial stability. CGFS members consist of the Deputy
Governors and other senior officials of 23 central banks from advanced and
emerging market economies and the Economic Adviser of the BIS.
The analysis of private and public sector responses to the financial crisis
shaped the Committee’s work in the period under review. In particular, various
CGFS groups reviewed specific aspects of international banking and funding
markets. The reports prepared by these groups were published during the first
half of 2010:
•
A joint CGFS–Markets Committee study group investigated the
performance of cross-border funding markets during the crisis and
possible ways to enhance their resilience.
•
A CGFS study group reviewed changes in the funding strategies and
liquidity management of internationally active banks in response to the
financial crisis.
•
A CGFS study group analysed the role of margining practices and haircut
setting in over-the-counter derivatives and securities lending transactions
and recommended policy measures for mitigating procyclicality arising
from such practices.

118

BIS 80th Annual Report

Moreover, the CGFS investigated the implications of the development of
macroprudential frameworks and instruments for central banks.
The Committee completed a review of enhancements to credit risk transfer
statistics. Also, in March 2010 the CGFS established an ad hoc group to review
various requests for enhancements to the BIS statistics collected under its
auspices.
In addition to these special initiatives, the CGFS continued its extended
monitoring of, inter alia:
•
the balance sheet constraints of major banks and the implications for
credit supply;
•
funding market conditions and the impact of unconventional central bank
policies; and
•
the financial system implications of rising government debt and growing
market concerns about sovereign credit risk.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) contributes to
the strengthening of financial market infrastructure by promoting safe and
efficient payment, clearing and settlement arrangements. During the year, the
membership of the Committee was extended to include 25 central banks from
both developed and emerging market economies. The CPSS is chaired by
William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York.
The CPSS reviewed its existing Recommendations for central
counterparties to provide guidance on how the recommendations should be
applied to central counterparties (CCPs) that clear over-the-counter (OTC)
derivatives. The review was carried out jointly with the Technical Committee of
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). When the
recommendations were originally published, in 2004, they were aimed at CCPs
for exchange-traded derivatives. The recent development of CCPs for OTC
derivatives, such as credit default swaps, thus required a review of the ways
in which differences between these two types of derivatives – exchangetraded and OTC – affect how the recommendations should be implemented.
The CPSS and IOSCO are also providing guidance for the design and
operation of trade repositories in OTC derivatives markets.
The CPSS and IOSCO also began a comprehensive review of all three
sets of their key standards: the Core principles for systemically important
payment systems (2001), the Recommendations for securities settlement
systems (2001) and the above-mentioned Recommendations for central
counterparties (2004). The review is intended to apply the experience gained
since the standards were issued – particularly experience during the
financial crisis – to clarify, extend and, where necessary, strengthen the
standards and the accompanying guidance. A consultation document will also
incorporate the new guidance for CCPs and trade repositories in OTC
derivatives.

BIS 80th Annual Report

119

The Committee continued to facilitate cooperation among non-member
central banks and provided support and expertise to workshops and seminars
on payment and settlement system issues organised in cooperation with
regional central banking organisations.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Assistant Governor of the
Bank of Japan, is a forum for senior officials from 21 central banks to jointly
monitor financial market developments and assess their implications for
market functioning and central bank operations.
The post-crisis rebound of global financial markets, accompanied by an
uneven recovery in real activity and rising fiscal concerns in some countries,
shaped the Committee’s discussion in the past year. The Committee examined
factors driving the revival of money, credit and asset markets and the role
played by public sector support. In particular, the conduct of unconventional
central bank policies, whether for alleviating market dislocations or for easing
monetary conditions, remained a key theme in Committee deliberations –
though the focus shifted over time towards the preparation for prospective
exit. The relative calm that prevailed during the period under review also
allowed the Committee more time to discuss longer-term structural issues
such as the implications of proposed OTC derivatives market reforms.
In addition, the Committee participated with the CGFS in two study
groups. One examined the conceptual and practical issues related to
unconventional central bank policies; the other assessed the functioning and
resilience of cross-border funding markets during the recent crisis. The latter
group published a report in March 2010. The Committee updated its MC
compendium: monetary policy frameworks and central bank market operations,
and it participated in the preparation of the 2010 BIS Triennial Central Bank
Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity.
Markets Committee: www.bis.org/markets

Central Bank Governance Group
The BIS supports research on the design of the central bank as a public policy
institution through its hosting of the Central Bank Governance Group, chaired
by Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel. The Group and the Central
Bank Governance Network – an informal mechanism to facilitate the flow of
information on central bank governance issues between central banks and the
BIS – together make up the Central Bank Governance Forum, served by its
secretariat at the BIS.
During the past year, the Governance Group produced a report on Issues
in the governance of central banks. The document reviews current governance
arrangements in central banks around the world and discusses issues that
arise when decisions are made about the mandate, structure and operations
of the central bank.

120

BIS 80th Annual Report

Beyond that report, the focus of work was on the governance
implications of changing financial stability responsibilities of central banks:
the macroprudential responsibilities that the central bank might undertake and
the relationship between such responsibilities and the governance of the
institution. In addition, the BIS continued to meet the needs of individual
central banks for governance information. Central banks can access this
information through a password-protected website.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
Sixty-six central banks and international and regional organisations formally
involved in central banking issues are institutional members of the Irving Fisher
Committee on Central Bank Statistics, which is chaired by Manuel Marfán,
Vice-President of the Central Bank of Chile. The Committee provides a forum
for central bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics
related to monetary and financial stability.
In August, the Committee organised 10 sessions at the 57th biennial
World Congress of the International Statistical Institute, held in Durban, South
Africa. On that occasion, it also co-sponsored a seminar with the South African
Reserve Bank for the central banks of the Southern African Development
Community; the topic was statistical requirements to support regional economic
and financial integration amid the global financial crisis. In addition, the
Committee sponsored two regional workshops on inflation measurement, one
for the Asian central banks associated with the South East Asian Central Banks
(SEACEN) Research and Training Centre and the other for the central banks of
the Gulf Cooperation Council. It also organised, in collaboration with Eurostat
and the International Association of Official Statistics, a conference on
methodological issues related to indices of residential property prices.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) contributes to the
stability of financial systems by promoting international cooperation and
encouraging wide international contact among deposit insurers and other
interested parties. IADI’s principal activities involve:
•
enhancing the understanding of common interests and issues related to
deposit insurance;
•
setting out guidance to enhance the effectiveness of deposit insurance
systems;
•
facilitating the sharing of expertise on deposit insurance issues through
training, outreach and educational programmes; and
•
providing guidance on the establishment or enhancement of effective
deposit insurance systems.
Currently, 78 organisations from around the world are involved in IADI’s
activities. Sixty of the organisations are deposit insurer members. The others
include a number of central banks and other organisations that have an

BIS 80th Annual Report

121

interest in promoting the adoption or operation of effective deposit insurance
systems.
One of the Association’s main objectives is to improve the effectiveness of
deposit insurance systems through the development of principles and practices.
In June 2009, IADI and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, in
collaboration with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI), published
the first international set of Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance
Systems. The Core Principles are designed to serve as a benchmark for
jurisdictions in strengthening existing deposit insurance systems and
developing new ones. IADI, the BCBS and the IMF are currently collaborating
on the development of a Deposit Insurance Core Principles Methodology that
can be used in the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to
assess and improve national deposit insurance systems, and by the FSB for
peer reviews. The EFDI, the European Commission and the World Bank are
also participating in this effort, which is to be completed by the end of 2010.
After the completion of the methodology, the FSB plans to include the Core
Principles in its Compendium of Standards.
At the request of the FSB, IADI and the IMF prepared a joint memorandum
on “Unwinding temporary deposit insurance arrangements” that identified
specific actions which various jurisdictions had carried out to enhance deposit
insurance systems in response to the financial crisis and steps taken to date
to unwind temporary measures and full guarantees.
IADI continued to work closely with the FSI on the joint development of
training programmes and conferences for deposit insurers, financial sector
supervisors and central banks worldwide. The Association was partnered by
the FSI and the Basel Committee in hosting its Eighth Annual Conference at
the BIS in September 2009, the topic of which was the Core Principles for
Effective Deposit Insurance Systems. The event provided a forum to consider
how the Core Principles could be applied in supervision and deposit
insurance, prerequisites for effective systems, individual principles and
practitioners’ experience, as well as the next steps – implementation and
assessment. During the conference, IADI organised the International Exhibition
on Deposit Insurance to share training and research materials.
IADI also entered into a partnership with the FSI to provide IADI members
with co-sponsored seminars, such as that on Cross-border Banking Resolution
Issues, as well as conferences and e-learning.
IADI’s Research and Guidance Committee (RGC) has, together with the
BIS’s Monetary and Economic Department, developed a worldwide deposit
insurance system database that constitutes a critical component of IADI’s
research priorities. The database will manage IADI’s survey data on deposit
insurance systems worldwide. IADI recently collected responses to its Survey
on interventions to protect depositors through higher coverage limits or
blanket guarantees and its Survey on strategic questions on payout systems
and processes. The RGC also released guidance papers on governance, public
awareness and funding. Two papers (Deposit insurance coverage and
Organizational risk management for deposit insurers) and four Research Plans
have been released for public consultation.

122

BIS 80th Annual Report

During its eighth year of operation, IADI continued to provide a number of
forums for deposit insurers and other safety net participants. Activities included
a capacity-building programme and an Executive Training Program component
to address deposit insurance programme weaknesses (claims management,
payout system tools for meeting fast payout challenges, cross-border issues,
and resolution of problem banks). The bank resolution training seminar agenda
included the least cost test for determining a bank resolution alternative, large
and small bank resolutions, and the use of bridge banks and conservatorships
for an orderly resolution process.
IADI’s seven regional committees and 12 partner organisations brought
together professionals for events such as the Conference on Bank Insolvency
in the Caribbean: Law and Best Practice and seminars on Understanding the
Fundamentals of Islamic Banking and Deposit Insurance (Middle East and
North Africa region and Asia), the Role of Deposit Insurance in the Current
Crisis (Latin America) and the Design of Deposit Insurance Systems (Africa) as
well as various regional outreach conferences.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), hosted by the
BIS since 1998, is the international standard-setting body for prudential
supervision of the insurance industry. The IAIS aims to contribute to global
financial stability through improved supervision of the insurance industry, the
development of standards for supervision, international cooperation based on
the exchange of information, and mutual assistance.
The IAIS has been actively involved in assessing the impact of the
financial crisis on the insurance sector and responding to recommendations for
regulatory reforms from the FSB and G20. The IAIS established the Financial
Stability Committee with the primary aim of discussing financial stability issues
and supporting the IAIS’s participation in the FSB. The Committee’s activities
include reporting on systemic risk and the insurance sector, consideration of
macroprudential tools, and the development of proposals on macroprudential
surveillance.
The Joint Forum – the joint working group of the BCBS, IOSCO and the
IAIS – published its Review of the differentiated nature and scope of financial
regulation in January 2010. New Joint Forum workstreams coming out of this
report are currently being considered.

Accounting
The IAIS has a strong interest in ensuring high-quality financial reporting
that offers a meaningful, economically sound portrayal of insurers’ financial
health. It closely monitors the international financial reporting developments
that will most influence the overall accounting model for regulated insurance
enterprises. The International Accounting Standards Board project on
accounting for insurance contracts will continue to benefit from the active
involvement of the IAIS.

BIS 80th Annual Report

123

In 2009, the IAIS adopted an issues paper on The roles of and relationship
between the actuary and the external auditor in the preparation and audit of
financial reports. The paper, which discusses the issue from the perspective of
the insurance supervisor, discusses roles and responsibilities, communication,
reporting, the relationship between external auditor and insurance supervisor,
professional standards, and qualifications and regulation.

Capital adequacy and solvency
In October 2009, the IAIS adopted both a standard and a guidance paper on
The structure of capital resources for solvency purposes. The guidance paper
outlines a number of approaches a supervisor could adopt for determining
capital resources.

Governance and compliance
In July 2009, the IAIS adopted an issues paper on Corporate governance,
prepared jointly with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. The paper discusses governance structures, functions of the
board of directors, control functions, the actuarial function and auditors,
disclosure and transparency, relationships with stakeholders, and interaction
with the supervisor.

Group-wide supervision
In October 2009, the IAIS adopted the guidance paper on The use of supervisory
colleges in group-wide supervision. The paper discusses supervisory colleges
as a mechanism to facilitate cooperation and exchange of information among
involved supervisors and the coordination of supervisory activities on a
group-wide basis. The paper complements the guidance paper on The role
and responsibilities of a group-wide supervisor, adopted in 2008.

Internationally active insurance groups
In January 2010, the IAIS Executive Committee approved the development of
the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance
Groups (ComFrame). ComFrame will be a multilateral framework reaching
beyond the regulatory approaches of individual jurisdictions and regions. It will
provide parameters for assessing group structures and group business from a
risk management perspective; set out quantitative and qualitative requirements
that are specific and focused but not rules-based; and cover the necessary
areas of supervisory cooperation and coordination. ComFrame should lead to
more consistency and better comparability and alignment regarding each
jurisdiction’s supervision of internationally active insurance groups. The IAIS
will develop ComFrame over the next three years, after which it will undertake
an impact assessment.

Reinsurance
Global reinsurers are important to the efficient functioning of insurance
markets. They bolster the ultimate security of ceding insurers, thereby
protecting customers and contributing to overall financial stability.

124

BIS 80th Annual Report

The annual IAIS Global Reinsurance Market Report is based on unique
data provided by more than 50 leading global reinsurers worldwide.
These firms have been actively engaged with the IAIS as it seeks to
facilitate better understanding, regulation and supervision of this key
financial industry. The 2009 report showed that, despite the ongoing
financial turmoil, the global reinsurance market has again demonstrated its
robustness and resilience. In June 2009, the IAIS published the first midyear
edition of the report, Developments in (re)insurance securitisation. It
supplemented the year-end report by providing a qualitative analysis of the
main characteristics, functions and developments in the insurance
securitisation market.

Multilateral memorandum of understanding
The IAIS multilateral memorandum of understanding (MMoU) is a framework
for cooperation and the exchange of information to improve the effectiveness
of cross-border supervision of insurance companies. It is also expected to
contribute to the global efforts to enhance the regulation of systemically
important financial institutions. The MMoU became operational in June 2009.
As of March 2010, a total of eight insurance supervisory authorities are
signatories, and another 16 applicants are being validated.

Training
Each year, the IAIS organises some 10–12 regional seminars and workshops
to assist insurance supervisors in implementing its principles and standards.
These training events are conducted in collaboration with the FSI, national
insurance supervisory authorities and other bodies. The FSI has also begun
releasing online tutorials addressing insurance sector supervision.
IAIS: www.iaisweb.org

Financial Stability Institute
To fulfil its mandate to support financial stability globally, the Financial
Stability Institute (FSI) of the BIS conducts a two-pronged programme
designed to disseminate supervisory standards and sound practices.

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The first prong of the FSI programme is its well established series of high-level
meetings, seminars and conferences targeted at banking and insurance sector
supervisors. In 2009, the FSI organised 52 such events at venues around the
world, many of which were held in partnership with regional groups of
supervisors. In response to the recent financial crisis and the revisions to key
standards being made by standard-setting bodies, the FSI placed special
emphasis on issues related directly to financial regulatory reform. More than
2,000 representatives of central banks and banking and insurance supervisory
authorities participated in the 2009 events. The FSI also continued its series of
high-level meetings for Deputy Governors of central banks and heads of
supervisory authorities, with such meetings taking place in Africa, Asia, Latin

BIS 80th Annual Report

125

America and the Middle East. Last year, besides covering ongoing supervisory
issues such as implementation of Basel II, these meetings focused on the
financial crisis and regulatory responses such as a macroprudential approach
to regulation and supervision.

FSI Connect
The second prong of the FSI programme is FSI Connect, an online information
resource and learning tool for financial sector supervisors at all levels of
experience and expertise. It includes more than 175 tutorials covering a wide
range of topics. The subscribers to FSI Connect consist of more than 200 central
banks and supervisory authorities representing more than 8,000 users. The
second phase of development of FSI Connect continued in 2009. In October,
the first 10 tutorials specifically addressing insurance sector supervision were
launched, and work is under way to develop tutorials for IADI.

Research and statistics
The BIS carries out research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks
and, increasingly, financial supervisory authorities. Most of this work appears
in the Bank’s regular outlets, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review
and the BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as in external
professional publications and on the Bank’s website (www.bis.org). In addition,
the research function develops background material for meetings of senior
central bankers and provides secretariat and analytical services to the various
groupings hosted by the BIS in Basel.
The BIS also collects, aggregates, analyses and disseminates statistical
information for central banks and the general public on key elements of the
international financial system. The Financial Stability Board and IMF have
made recommendations to the G20 regarding data gaps and the financial
crisis. Discussions in various forums regarding follow-up to those
recommendations have illustrated the importance of BIS statistical activities
and the need to continue strengthening them in key areas.

Research focus
In line with the Bank’s mission, the focus of BIS research is on monetary and
financial stability. As in the previous year, a core theme of the work this year
was the global financial crisis – its causes, dynamics and policy implications.
One strand of the research used the BIS international banking statistics to cast
light on the turmoil. The statistics were the only source that could help identify
the US dollar shortage in international markets; and that shortage highlighted
the banks’ dependence on cross-currency, short-term funding and the
consequent disruptions to foreign exchange swap markets. The BIS statistics
also helped trace the changes in the geography of international banking
associated with the crisis.
A second strand of research focused on the short-term policy responses
to the crisis, including financial support packages and unconventional

126

BIS 80th Annual Report

monetary policy measures. That work was complemented by research on the
transmission mechanism of monetary policy, notably the impact of changes in
interest rates on risk-taking.
A third strand explored the long-term policy responses within regulatory
and supervisory frameworks. Such responses included proposals to implement
a stronger macroprudential orientation: methodologies to measure systemic
risk, the calibration of prudential tools with respect to the systemic
significance of financial institutions, and arrangements for countercyclical
capital requirements.
The BIS staff also examined possible improvements to the financial
infrastructure, including the use of central counterparties for derivatives and
mechanisms to put securitisation on a stronger footing.
The BIS research function organises conferences and workshops,
typically bringing together senior policymakers, leading academics and
market participants. A principal venue for such gatherings has become the
BIS Annual Conference. In June 2009, the Eighth BIS Annual Conference
addressed the interactions between the financial system and the
macroeconomy, revisiting a theme addressed two years earlier in the light of
the new insights provided by the crisis. In September, the BIS and the ECB
jointly organised a conference on monetary policy and financial stability.

International financial statistics
The financial crisis has demonstrated that the banking sector raises serious
systemic risk issues. The BIS international banking statistics have proven
particularly useful for monitoring and analysing financial vulnerabilities.
Collected by the BIS in cooperation with central banks, the data cover the
international activities of some 7,000 banking institutions from about 40 countries.
Last year, central banks from two additional countries began participating:
Cyprus and South Africa. Efforts are under way to ensure the participation of
the few remaining G20 central banks not reporting such data to the BIS.
The statistics are available on the traditional basis of residency, which
follows balance of payments reporting concepts, as well as on a consolidated
basis, which tracks cross-border exposures of internationally active banks
headquartered in a particular country. The datasets are complementary and
provide key breakdowns by currency, maturity and instrument as well as by
counterparty sector and country.
The 2010 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and
Derivatives Market Activity has been prepared in cooperation with the
more than 50 central banks that will participate. It will measure average daily
transactions in global markets in April 2010 and amounts outstanding as of
June 2010.

Data repository
The BIS also provides a centralised repository of statistical data covering
almost all BIS member central banks (the BIS Data Bank), through which

BIS 80th Annual Report

127

participating institutions share key macroeconomic data. Given the attention
paid to financial stability issues, steps have been taken to improve the
coverage of these data in several areas. As a follow-up to FSB-IMF
recommendations, a growing number of central banks have agreed to post
their reported national data on residential property prices on the BIS website.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS has continued its active cooperation with other international organisations
and national and international statistical agencies. The BIS is a member of the
Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics, together with the
ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World Bank. This
group has been tasked with following up on a number of recommendations
made by the FSB and IMF to the G20 regarding data gaps and the financial
crisis. The group also co-sponsors with the IMF a new dataset website called
Principal Global Indicators. The Working Group on Securities Databases, which
includes the BIS, ECB and IMF, released the first part of a Handbook on
securities statistics in May 2009, covering the issuance of debt securities.
The BIS is represented in a number of international committees focused
on statistics, inter alia: the IMF Balance of Payments Committee; the IMF
Reference Group on Financial Soundness Indicators; the OECD Statistics
Committee; the OECD Working Group on Financial Statistics; the UN Statistical
Commission; and the ECB Statistics Committee and its various working
groups. All these groups worked during the year to address the information
gaps revealed by the financial turmoil.
Together with the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank, the BIS maintains the
Joint External Debt Hub, which consolidates information on external debt from
creditor and debtor sources. The BIS co-sponsors Statistical Data and Metadata
Exchange (SDMX), which produces and maintains technical standards and
content-oriented guidelines for the dissemination of statistical information. The
BIS and a number of central banks have started to use SDMX to provide their
statistics on their websites in standardised electronic formats. SDMX is also used
for all exchanges of data between the BIS and the central banks participating in
the international financial statistics programme and the BIS Data Bank.

Other central bank initiatives to which the BIS lends support
The BIS supports regional central bank groupings and training initiatives as
well as central bank cooperation in the areas of counterfeit deterrence,
information technology and internal audit.

Regional central bank groupings and central bank training institutes
The BIS contributes to the activities of regional central bank groupings by
providing speakers with relevant expertise for their meetings. Such speakers,
including from the secretariats of the Basel-based groups and the BIS
Representative Offices, were made available to:

planned economies was officially terminated.

Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group
The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) investigates threats
to the security of banknotes and proposes common solutions for
implementation by note-issuing authorities. The CBCDG has developed anticounterfeiting features to prevent banknote images from being replicated by
colour copiers and digital technology (personal computers, printers and
scanners). The BIS supports the work of the CBCDG and acts occasionally as
its agent in contractual arrangements.

Group of Computer Experts
The Group of Computer Experts (GCE) is drawn from a number of BIS member
central banks in industrial countries and financial centres. It provides a twiceyearly forum for sharing technical and organisational experiences in the
information technology (IT) area.
Common themes for both of the past year’s GCE meetings were: the
continuing impact of the financial crisis on central bank IT organisations; the
increasing use of virtualisation to reduce the number of servers and their
associated costs and space requirements; secure remote access; and
pandemic preparations. Meeting sessions also covered the adoption of “green
IT” and the ongoing migration from mainframes to distributed processing
environments.
Additionally, the Working Party on Security Issues (WPSI) meets twice a
year on issues related to IT security. Security threats have not diminished in
the past year, and central bank IT systems are experiencing more targeted
attacks. Information sharing among central banks is working towards more
effective alerting about these attacks and safeguarding against them. From the

BIS 80th Annual Report

129

WPSI perspective, secure communications and business continuity planning
remain areas of focus in central banks.

Internal auditors of central banks
Internal auditors of a number of central banks from industrial countries meet
regularly to share experience and knowledge. In June 2009, the 23rd Annual Plenary
Conference of Heads of Internal Audit was co-hosted by the BIS and the Swiss
National Bank. It covered topics such as changes and trends in internal controls,
outsourcing issues, talent management practices in internal audit, organisation
of compliance functions, and enterprise risk management. In addition, twice a
year, the BIS hosts the meetings of the Working Party on IT Audit Methodologies.
BIS Internal Audit has also established information sharing networks for
internal audit heads from central banks and monetary authorities in the AsiaPacific region, and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In September 2009,
the sixth meeting of heads of internal audit from central banks in the AsiaPacific region was hosted by the Bank of Thailand. Discussions focused on the
auditing of dealing room activities, fraud prevention and the use of continuous
auditing techniques.

Financial services of the Bank
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services tailored specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 130 such institutions, as well as a number of
international institutions, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of these credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit
reporting directly to the Deputy General Manager monitors the Bank’s credit,
liquidity and market risks. Similarly, a compliance and operational risk unit
controls the Bank’s operational risks.

Scope of services
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central banks,
the BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of
currency denomination, liquidity and maturity. In addition to traditional money
market placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the
Bank offers tradable instruments (Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS – FIXBIS,
and Medium-Term Instruments – MTIs), in maturities ranging from one week to
five years, and structured products with embedded optionality. The BIS also
provides short-term liquidity facilities and extends credits to central banks,
usually on a collateralised basis. The Bank also acts as trustee and collateral
agent (see below).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example,

130

BIS 80th Annual Report

regular rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocation. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as well
as swaps, outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In
addition, the Bank provides gold services such as sight accounts, fixed-term
deposits, earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining, and location exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities and
high-grade credit fixed income instruments. These may take the form of either
a dedicated portfolio mandate negotiated between the BIS and a customer or
an open-end fund structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing
customers to invest in a common pool of assets. Both investment structures
are offered as either single currency or multicurrency mandates in the major
world reserve currencies: US dollar, euro, sterling and yen. For multicurrency
mandates, the investor can choose from portfolios that are either hedged back
into the base currency or left unhedged.
Dedicated mandates are designed according to each customer’s particular
preferences with regard to investment guidelines and benchmarks. In contrast,
BISIPs are similar to mutual funds or unit trust funds but specifically cater to
the investment criteria typical of central banks and international institutions.
The two Asian Bond Funds (ABF1 and ABF2) are administered by the BIS
under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the BIS and ABF2 by a group
of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one at
the Bank’s head office in Basel and one at its Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR.
The Banking Department of the BIS also hosts global and regional
meetings, seminars and workshops on reserve management issues. These
meetings facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserve
managers and promote the development of investment and risk management
capabilities in central banks and international organisations.

Financial operations in 2009/10
After an extended period of turbulence, financial markets began to show
clearer signs of recovery in the second quarter of 2009. Against this more
favourable background, the Bank’s customer currency deposit base stabilised
at SDR 195.8 billion, after having contracted by SDR 38.9 billion in the
previous financial year.
The total balance sheet increased marginally by SDR 3.5 billion in 2009/10,
after recording a contraction of SDR 55.8 billion in 2008/09. As a result, the
balance sheet total amounted to SDR 258.9 billion at 31 March 2010.

Liabilities
Customer currency and gold placements constitute the largest share of total
liabilities (see graph). On 31 March 2010, customer placements (excluding
repurchase agreements) amounted to SDR 227.8 billion, compared with
SDR 220.3 billion at the end of the previous financial year. Around 86% of
customer placements are denominated in currencies, with the remainder in gold.

BIS 80th Annual Report

131

Currency deposits decreased from SDR 197.2 billion a year ago to
SDR 195.8 billion at end-March 2010 – representing some 3.2% of the
world’s total foreign exchange reserves of nearly SDR 5.3 trillion, up from
SDR 4.5 trillion at end-March 2009.2 The share of currency placements
denominated in US dollars was 67%, whereas euro- and sterling-denominated
funds accounted for 22% and 5%, respectively.
The net contraction of customer currency placements resulted mainly
from the combined decreases of 39% and 9% in investments in MTIs and sight
and notice accounts, respectively, and an 80% increase in fixed-term deposits.
Gold deposits amounted to SDR 32.1 billion at end-March 2010, an
increase of SDR 9.0 billion over the financial year.
A breakdown of placements with the BIS by geographical region shows
that Asian customers account for the highest share.

Assets
Most of the assets held by the BIS consist of government and quasigovernment securities, including reverse repurchase agreements and, to an
extent similar to that in the previous financial year, investments with highly
rated commercial banks of international standing. In addition, the Bank owned
120 tonnes of fine gold at 31 March 2010. The Bank’s credit exposure is
managed in a conservative manner, with almost all of it rated A– or higher at
31 March 2010 (see note 3, “Credit risk”, in the “Risk management” section of
the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 200.0 billion on
31 March 2010, down from SDR 209.3 billion at the end of the previous
financial year.

BIS 80th Annual Report

The Bank uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and
liabilities efficiently (see note 7 to the financial statements).

Trustee for international government loans
The Bank continued to perform its functions as trustee for the funding bonds
1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young Loans (for details, see the 63rd Annual
Report of June 1993). The Deutsche Bundesbank, as paying agent, notified
the Bank that in 2009 the Bundesamt für zentrale Dienste und offene
Vermögensfragen (BADV – Federal Office for Central Services and Unresolved
Property Issues) had arranged for payment of approximately €4.6 million
for redemption of funding bonds and interest. Redemption values and other
details were published by the BADV in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette).
The Bank maintained its reservations regarding the application by the
BADV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan (stated in detail in
its 50th Annual Report of June 1980), which also extend to the funding bonds
1990–2010.

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China; and a Representative Office for the Americas (the Americas
Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
cooperation within each region by organising meetings, conducting policy
research and fostering the exchange of information and data. The Asian Office
also provides banking services to the region’s monetary authorities.

The Asian Office
The BIS focused on the policy challenges facing shareholding central banks in
the Asia-Pacific region by organising high-level meetings and by pursuing
research. A Governor-level research conference on “The International Financial
Crisis and Policy Challenges in Asia and the Pacific”, organised with the
People’s Bank of China in Shanghai in August 2009, was the culmination of
the three-year BIS Asian Research Programme. After the conference, the Bank
placed the resources for research in Asia on a more permanent footing and
divided them between work on issues of monetary stability and work on those
of financial stability.
Working with the Monetary and Economic Department and the Banking
Department of the BIS, the Asian Office held 11 events, typically organised
jointly with a central bank or held in collaboration with the Executives’ Meeting
of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) or the South East Asian Central
Banks (SEACEN) organisation. These included the previously mentioned
August 2009 Governor-level research conference in Shanghai; the Fifth HighLevel Seminar on Financial Markets, organised with the Central Bank of
Malaysia, in Kota Kinabalu in December 2009; and the Special Governors’

BIS 80th Annual Report

133

Meeting, organised with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), in Sydney in
February 2010.
In addition, the Financial Stability Institute and EMEAP held the Sixth
FSI-EMEAP Working Group on Banking Supervision High-Level Meeting in
Tokyo. The theme of the meeting was “Lessons Learned from the Financial
Crisis: An International and Asian Perspective”.

The Asian Consultative Council and the Special Governors’ Meeting in Asia
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC), established in 2001 as an advisory
committee to the BIS Board, continued to offer Governors of shareholding
central banks in Asia and the Pacific an effective way of communicating with
the Board and an important forum for providing advice to the Asian Office. With
Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, as chair, the ACC
held two meetings during the year. At these meetings, Governors gave the benefit
of their views on meetings to be organised and research to be carried out.
The February 2010 Special Governors’ Meeting in Sydney coincided with
other events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the RBA. As in previous
such meetings, the 12 representatives of central banks in the region were
joined by other Governors from around the globe. They discussed recent
economic and financial developments, what exit strategies to follow as the
economies in the region continue to recover, and what policies to put in place
to foster more resilient financial systems.

Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
Central banks in Asia continued to make good use of the services provided by
the regional treasury in the Asian Office’s dealing room. Indeed, an increasing
number of these central banks have now been dealing with the regional
treasury in a wider range of products. Beyond offering these products, the BIS
Banking Department is working on strengthening its business continuity
management, in which the Asian Office is playing a key role. Additional staff
resources were shifted from Basel to the Hong Kong back office. Regular
cross-training and business continuity tests in the Asian Office’s banking
operations have been conducted in 2010 to help ensure that, in the event of a
business interruption in Basel, critical tasks would be performed through the
regional treasury.
As fund administrator, the BIS supported the second Asian Bond Fund
(ABF2) initiative of EMEAP, which sought to advance the development of local
currency bond markets. In March 2005, the 11 EMEAP central banks had
provided seed money from their international reserves to invest in sovereign
and quasi-sovereign local currency bonds in eight markets in the region. The
Pan Asia Bond Index Fund (PAIF) was listed as an exchange-traded fund on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange in June 2009. The overall size of the ABF2 reached
$3.52 billion at the end of March 2010, up from $2.86 billion at the end of
March 2009. Private sector investment increased to $797 million at the end
of March 2010, from $427 million at the end of March 2009. Central bank
holdings, which stood at $2.72 billion, were up from $2.43 billion at the end
of March 2009.

134

BIS 80th Annual Report

Research in the Asian Office
The choice of research projects at the Asian Office was influenced by the
policy challenges arising from both the lingering imprint of the international
financial crisis and the budding recovery in Asia and the Pacific. Progress was
made on a series of research projects that were intended to help regional
authorities improve monetary policy and operations, develop financial markets,
maintain financial stability and strengthen prudential policy.
Early in 2009/10, the research effort was directed at how the international
financial crisis had affected the region and at the associated policy challenges.
Later in the year, the focus of research shifted to policy issues arising from
Asia’s leading role in the recovery of the global economy.
On the monetary stability front, the Asian Office emphasised identifying
and assessing the new monetary policy challenges facing the region’s central
banks. The work examined the ability of the region’s diverse monetary policy
frameworks to deliver low inflation, explored the key spillover channels to the
region revealed during the crisis, and deepened the understanding of the
challenges posed by capital inflows for central banks in the region.
On the financial stability front, research focused on analysing channels of
financial market contagion. These channels included the role of time-varying
risk appetites in the pricing of sovereign risk as well as the interaction of credit
default swaps and cash bond markets. Methods of identifying systemically
important financial institutions in the region were analysed to complement an
ongoing monitoring of proposed revisions to supervisory frameworks in terms
of their effects on the region’s financial institutions. Another strand of research
assessed the effectiveness of policy measures to alleviate financial system
instability, including a study of loan loss provisioning in the region.
Building on the strong foundation laid by the Asian Research Programme,
collaborative research on topics of interest to central banks and supervisors in
the region continued to be organised with almost every BIS shareholding
central bank in Asia and the Pacific as well as the regional organisations of
central banks. This research not only fed into the numerous meetings
organised with regional central banks but also led to the publication of several
articles in refereed journals and the BIS Quarterly Review.

The Americas Office
The economies in Latin America and the Caribbean were affected in various
ways by the international financial crisis that began in the major developed
countries. Policymakers and researchers in the region have shown a
heightened interest in the ensuing international analysis and discussion on
how to revise key standards and strengthen financial stability. The Americas
Office has thus centred its efforts on closely monitoring developments that
would indicate the continued potential for contagion in the economies of Latin
America and the Caribbean and on regional dissemination of research and
analysis undertaken at the BIS.
As in the past, the Office has devoted its regional efforts not only to BIS
member central banks but also to contacts and events with non-shareholding

BIS 80th Annual Report

135

central banks, regulatory authorities and the academic community. These
activities generated several publications.
The Office again sponsored events at the annual meeting of the Latin
American and Caribbean Economic Association. For the 2009 meeting, the
events included a panel discussion with academics, directors from regional
central banks and former Governors and parallel sessions featuring contributed
papers.
The Office also co-organised and contributed to meetings at regional
central banks, including: the Open Economies Meeting hosted by the Central
Bank of the Dominican Republic; the Working Party on Monetary Policy in
Latin America, convened at the Central Bank of Chile; a meeting on risk
management for reserve managers, held in cooperation with the Central Bank
of Brazil; and several training events organised by the Financial Stability
Institute in cooperation with regional groupings of supervisors. In November
2009, the Office hosted workshops and meetings for the Group of Computer
Experts.
The Office provided speakers to various conferences and meetings
convened by regional central banks and by regional organisations such as
the Centre for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA), the Fondo
Latinoamericano de Reservas (FLAR), the Central American Monetary Council
(CMCA) and the Latin American Regional Committee of the International
Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI-LARC).

Consultative Council for the Americas
The Office provides the Secretariat to the Consultative Council for the
Americas (CCA). The CCA, which comprises the Governors of the BIS member
central banks in the Americas, was established in May 2008 as an advisory
committee to the BIS Board of Directors. Martín Redrado, then Governor of the
Central Bank of Argentina, chaired the CCA until January 2010. Since March
2010, it has been chaired by Henrique de Campos Meirelles, Governor of the
Central Bank of Brazil.
CCA members are regularly informed of the work of the BIS and the
Americas Office in the region and are invited to comment on ongoing work.
The most noteworthy initiative by the CCA in the past year was a March 2010
research conference on “Systemic Risk, Bank Behaviour and Regulation over
the Business Cycle”. It was conducted with the participation of CCA central
banks and academics and hosted by the Central Bank of Argentina.

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels:
•
the General Meeting of BIS member central banks;
•
the BIS Board of Directors; and
•
BIS Management.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland. At the end of the
financial year, the BIS employed 589 staff members from 54 countries.

136

BIS 80th Annual Report

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Fifty-six central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the
BIS.3 These 56 institutions have rights of voting and representation at General
Meetings. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four
months after 31 March, the end of the BIS financial year. The AGM decides the
distribution of the dividend and profit of the BIS, approves the annual report
and the accounts of the Bank, makes adjustments in the allowances paid to
Board members and selects the Bank's external auditors.

The BIS Board of Directors
Consisting of 19 members, the Board of Directors is assisted by four
subcommittees of Board members: the Administrative Committee, the Audit
Committee, the Banking and Risk Management Committee and the Nomination
Committee. The main responsibilities of the Board are determining the strategic
and policy direction of the BIS and supervising the Bank’s Management.
BIS shareholding institutions and members of the BIS Board of Directors are
listed on the following pages.

It will be recalled that, due to the constitutional changes in 2003 that transformed the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the legal status of the Yugoslav issue of the capital of the BIS had been
under review for several years. Following a Board decision of September 2009 and with effect from
23 October 2009, the National Bank of Serbia became the Bank’s 56th shareholder. It exercises the rights
corresponding to the former Yugoslav issue of BIS shares, which has been redenominated as the
Serbian issue.

Changes among the Board of Directors
Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, was elected by the Board in
March 2010 to succeed Guillermo Ortiz as Chairman of the Board of Directors
for a three-year term commencing on 7 March 2010. The term of Mr Ortiz
as Governor of the Bank of Mexico had finished at the end of 2009, at which
time he therefore stepped down as a member of the BIS Board and as its
Chairman.
In June 2009, the Board had re-elected Mr Ortiz and three other members
to three-year terms ending on 30 June 2012. The other re-elected members
were Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank; Nout
H E M Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank; and Zhou Xiaochuan,
Governor of the People’s Bank of China.
In January 2010, the Board elected Henrique de Campos Meirelles,
Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, as a member of the Board for the
remainder of Mr Ortiz’s term.
At the end of 2009, Jean-Pierre Roth retired as Chairman of the
Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and stepped down from the
Board. He had served as a member of the Board since 2001 and as its
Chairman from 2006 to 2009. In the month preceding Mr Roth’s retirement, his
successor as Chairman at the Swiss National Bank, Philipp Hildebrand, was
elected by the Board as a member for the remainder of Mr Roth’s term, ending
on 31 March 2010. In March, the Board re-elected Mr Hildebrand to a threeyear term ending on 31 March 2013.
Alfons Vicomte Verplaetse, Honorary Governor of the National Bank of
Belgium, retired from the Board at the end of his term, 31 December 2009.
Vicomte Verplaetse had been a member of the Board since 1989 and had
served as Chairman of the Board between 1997 and 1999.
Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, reappointed William C Dudley, President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, to a three-year term ending on 12 September
2012. Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, appointed Fabrizio
Saccomanni, Director General of the Bank of Italy, to a three-year term ending
on 31 December 2012.
In September 2009, the Board re-elected two members to three-year
terms ending on 12 September 2012: Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of
Canada, and Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan.

In memoriam
The Board noted with deep regret the deaths of Johann Schöllhorn on
6 December 2009 at the age of 87, of Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne on
22 January 2010 at the age of 94 and of Philippe Wilmès on 24 May 2010 at
the age of 72. All three had served as members of the Board, Mr Schöllhorn
from 1976 to 1989, Lord Richardson from 1973 to 1993 and Mr Wilmès from
1991 to 1999.
During the bimonthly meetings in May 2010, the Board and other
Governors of BIS shareholding institutions held a minute’s silence in memory of
Mr Sławomir Skrzypek, President of the National Bank of Poland, who died in

the tragic air crash near Smolensk on 10 April 2010. Mr Skrzypek was one of
many Polish dignitaries to lose their lives in the crash.

BIS Management
BIS Management is under the overall direction of the General Manager, who is
responsible to the Board of Directors for the conduct of the Bank. The General
Manager is advised by the Executive Committee of the BIS, which consists of
the General Manager as chair, the Deputy General Manager, the Heads of the
three BIS departments – the General Secretariat, the Banking Department and
the Monetary and Economic Department – and the General Counsel.
Other senior officials are the Deputy Heads of the departments and the
Chairman of the Financial Stability Institute.

Bank budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next
financial year starts about six months in advance with the setting by
Management of a broad business orientation and financial framework. Within
this context, business areas specify their plans and the corresponding
resource requirements. The process of reconciling detailed business plans,
objectives and overall resource availability culminates in a draft financial
budget. The budget must be approved by the Board before the start of the
financial year.

BIS 80th Annual Report

141

The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital
expenditures. In common with organisations similar to the BIS, Management
and staff expense – including remuneration, pensions and health, and accident
insurance – amounts to around 70% of administrative costs. The other major
expenditure categories, each accounting for about 10% of administrative
spending, are information technology (IT), telecommunications, and buildings
and equipment. Capital spending mainly relates to building expenses and IT
investment and can vary significantly from year to year.4 Most of the Bank’s
administrative and capital expenditure is incurred in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenses before depreciation for the financial year 2009/10
amounted to 252.2 million Swiss francs, 2.7% below the budget of 259.2 million
Swiss francs, while capital expenditure, at 19.2 million Swiss francs, was 2.6
million under budget. The largest sources of the underspending in
administrative expenses were lower than budgeted outlays for pensions, IT
and telecommunications.5
Administrative and capital expenditure in 2009/10 reflected the main
priority in the budget, which was to reinforce the Bank’s response to the
global financial crisis with the following measures:
•
Resources devoted to financial stability issues were increased by the
creation of additional staff positions to support the work of the Financial
Stability Board (FSB), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(BCBS) and the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS).
•
Dealing with the impact of the financial crisis on the BIS banking business
continued to be the main priority of the Banking Department and the Risk
Control, Finance and Compliance units. Work in the banking business was
oriented towards controlling the size and enhancing the management of
the banking operations with initiatives to implement integrated risk
management and enhance management accounting.
In addition, the budget for 2009/10 advanced the Bank’s global outreach
activities, further developing them through support for the Consultative Council
for the Americas; and through the creation of a permanent economics research
unit at the Asian Office following the completion of the three-year Asian
Research Programme in September 2009.
In March 2010, the Board approved an increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2010/11 of 0.9%, to 261.6 million Swiss francs.
It approved an increase in the capital budget of 1.6 million Swiss francs, to
23.5 million.
The Bank’s business plan, on which the proposed administrative budget
for 2010/11 is based, builds on last year’s plan and continues to give priority
to reinforcing the response of the BIS to the global financial crisis. The budget
for 2010/11 provides a further increase in human and financial resources

Some facilities in the BIS Tower were upgraded this year after more than 30 years of use.

The Bank’s budgetary accounting is cash-based and excludes certain financial accounting
adjustments, principally relating to retirement benefit obligations, which take into account financial
market and actuarial developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense”
disclosed in the profit and loss account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

devoted to financial stability issues, in particular to strengthen support of the
FSB and BCBS.
Dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis will be the main priority
of the Banking Department and the Risk Control, Finance and Compliance
units. Work in the banking business will continue to be oriented towards:
carefully managing the balance sheet; enhancing risk management,
operational controls and management accounting; and strengthening asset
management activities.

Bank remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a
number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are
associated with a structure of salary ranges. Every three years, a
comprehensive salary survey is conducted in which BIS salaries are
benchmarked against compensation in comparable institutions and market
segments. When benchmarking BIS salaries against comparators, the Bank
focuses on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly
qualified staff. The analysis takes into account differences in the taxation of
compensation for the staff of the surveyed institutions. The most recent such
survey took place in the second half of 2007. In years between comprehensive
salary surveys, the salary structure is adjusted primarily on the basis of the rate
of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted average real wage increase in
industrial countries. As of 1 July 2009, the salary structure was accordingly
increased by 2.1%. Movements of salaries of individual staff members within
the ranges of the salary structure are based on performance.
BIS staff members have access through the Bank to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-locally
hired, non-Swiss staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters, including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation
allowance. In proportion to annual salary, it currently amounts to 14% for
unmarried staff members and 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education
allowance for their children subject to certain conditions.
With regard to employment in the Representative Offices, a distinction is
made between staff members on an international assignment from the
headquarters and staff members recruited directly for a position in a
Representative Office. The employment conditions of the former are
determined in accordance with the Bank’s international assignment policy. For
staff recruited directly, employment conditions are aligned with those in the
market in which the Office is located. Those staff members have access to the
same health insurance and pension plans as staff engaged at the Bank’s
headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As with the
survey for other staff, the most recent executive compensation survey took
place in the second half of 2007. The results confirmed the appropriateness of

BIS 80th Annual Report

143

the current practice of annually adjusting the salaries of senior officials for the
rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2009, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before
expatriation allowances, is based on the following salary structure:
758,600 Swiss francs
•
General Manager6
•
Deputy General Manager
641,900 Swiss francs
•
Heads of Department
583,550 Swiss francs
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of
the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years. The
total fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was 1,049,520
Swiss francs as at 1 April 2010. In addition, Board members receive an
attendance fee for each Board meeting in which they participate. Assuming
the full Board is represented in all Board meetings, the annual total of these
attendance fees amounts to 973,788 Swiss francs.

Net profit and its distribution
The Bank recorded an exceptionally high net profit of SDR 1,859.8 million for
the 80th financial year, ended 31 March 2010. This compares with a profit of
SDR 446.1 million for the preceding financial year. This profit, which is unlikely
to be repeated in the coming financial years, was achieved against a
background of recovery in global financial markets, and in particular in the
credit markets, where many credit spreads against Libor narrowed back to
levels not seen since before September 2008. The lower profit in the previous
financial year was incurred in the exceptional market turmoil following the
events of September 2008, when a number of important financial institutions
failed or were threatened with failure. The principal factors behind the 2009/10
result are discussed below.

Principal factors behind the 2009/10 profit
Net interest income amounted to SDR 1,431.2 million in the financial year
2009/10 compared with the equivalent figure of SDR 1,601.9 million in the
preceding financial year. This decrease was mainly attributable to a lower
average volume of customer currency deposits in 2009/10 than in the previous
year. Intermediation margins, which had been wide in the first six months of
the financial year, narrowed as the market turmoil subsided in the second half
of the financial year. In these more normal market conditions, interest spreads
above Libor earned on risk-weighted assets and interest spreads below Libor
paid on the Bank’s liabilities both declined.
Net valuation movements amounted to a gain of SDR 520.5 million,
compared with a loss of SDR 1,181.7 million last year. The valuation gain in
the current financial year was attributable to the impact of narrowing credit
spreads (around SDR 670 million), which increased the fair values of the

enhanced pension rights.

144

BIS 80th Annual Report

bonds in the Bank’s credit portfolios. Most of the valuation gain took place in
the first half of the financial year. The valuation loss for the preceding financial
year was mainly attributable to the impact of an exceptional widening of
credit spreads on the Bank’s borrowed funds bond portfolios in the financial
market turmoil at that time.
Operating expense (see note 25 to the financial statements) amounted
to SDR 190.8 million, 14.6% above the preceding year’s figure of
SDR 166.5 million. In terms of Swiss francs, the currency in which most
of the Bank’s administrative expenses are incurred, operating expense
rose by 10.6%. Administrative expenses before depreciation amounted to
SDR 177.7 million, 15.1% above the previous year’s figure of SDR 154.4 million.
The depreciation charge of SDR 13.1 million was SDR 1.0 million above the
equivalent figure for 2008/09 (SDR 12.1 million).
After taking into account the above factors, the Bank’s operating profit
amounted to SDR 1,754.4 million, SDR 1,509.1 million above the equivalent
figure of SDR 245.3 million recorded in 2008/09.
A net gain of SDR 105.4 million was realised on the sale of investment
securities during the financial year, which the Bank acquired when interest
rates were higher. In 2008/09, a net gain of SDR 123.8 million was recorded for
the sale of investment securities and included gains on sales of securities that
were incurred when the investment securities portfolio duration benchmark
was reduced from four years to three.
There were no sales of gold investment assets during 2009/10. In 2008/09,
a gain (SDR 77.0 million) was recorded on the sale of five tonnes of the Bank’s
own gold.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for the financial year 2009/10
amounted to SDR 1,859.8 million, SDR 1,413.7 million above the equivalent
figure of SDR 446.1 million in the preceding year.

Movements in equity
In addition to the items reflected in the Bank’s profit and loss account,
unrealised gains and losses on the Bank’s own gold investments and
investment securities are recorded in the gold revaluation account and
securities revaluation account, which form part of the Bank’s equity.
The securities revaluation account decreased by SDR 112.5 million as a
result of net unrealised losses on investment securities (–SDR 7.1 million) and
the transfer to the profit and loss account of realised gains (–SDR 105.4 million)
on sales of securities.
The gold revaluation account increased by SDR 456.8 million as a result
of unrealised gains on the Bank’s own gold holdings of 120 tonnes, which
were attributable to the year-on-year appreciation of the gold price.
After taking these gains into account, the Bank’s total return7 for 2009/10
was SDR 2,204.1 million. This represented a return of 14.9% on average equity

7
The total return is shown as “Total comprehensive income” in the table entitled “Statement of
comprehensive income” on page 151 in the financial statements.

BIS 80th Annual Report

145

(SDR 14,795 million). In 2008/09, the total return was SDR 757.6 million, and
the return on average equity (SDR 13,149 million) was 5.8%. Taking into
account the payment of the dividend for 2008/09, the Bank’s equity increased
by SDR 2,059.4 million during the year ended 31 March 2010. This compares
with an equivalent increase of SDR 612.9 million in 2008/09.

Proposed dividend
The Board reviewed the dividend policy of the BIS during the financial year
2009/10. The review took into consideration the Bank’s capital needs and the
interests of BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair and sustainable return on their
investments in BIS shares. In framing the new dividend policy, the Board
adopted a number of governing principles, which are:
•
First, the need for the Bank to maintain a strong capital base at all times,
including during financial stress.
•
Second, the dividend should be relatively stable, set at a sustainable level
and changing in a predictable manner each year.
•
Third, while the Bank’s dividend policy should provide guidance for
the medium term, the dividend should continue to reflect the prevailing
financial circumstances of the Bank and should remain an annual decision
of the Board.
The dividend policy, which will be subject to further review by the Board
of Directors in five years’ time, now takes into account the Bank’s capital
adequacy requirements rather than the payout ratio. The policy incorporates:
•
a normal sustainable dividend in conformity with the medium-term
dividend policy decided ex ante which would increase by SDR 10 per
annum; and
•
a supplementary dividend, which would be decided ex post, while
keeping leverage and economic capital within desired ranges.
The policy will ensure that earnings are retained to augment the Bank’s
capital at a sufficient rate to support the Bank’s business and maintain its
capital position relative to the size of the balance sheet and its economic
capital requirements. In normal circumstances, it will result in a steady
progression in annual dividends, while retaining the flexibility to be operable
in years of low or high profits. In addition, the final approval of the dividend
each May would coincide with the outcome of the annual economic capital
allocation process (see note 2 of the capital adequacy section of the financial
statements), enabling the Board to pay an appropriate dividend, while ensuring
that the Bank’s capital base remains strong.
Consistent with the new dividend policy, it is proposed for the financial
year 2009/10 to declare:
•
a normal dividend of SDR 285 per share, SDR 20 above the dividend for
2008/09. Prior to last year, the dividend had increased by SDR 10 each
year in accordance with the medium-term policy agreed by the Board in
2005. The increase of SDR 20 per share would consist of an annual increase
of SDR 10 per share and a further increase of SDR 10 per share to
compensate for the absence of an increase in the dividend in 2008/09; and

146

BIS 80th Annual Report

•

a supplementary dividend of SDR 400 per share, which would be paid in
recognition of the exceptionally high net profit for 2009/10.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
to the Annual General Meeting that the net profit of SDR 1,859.8 million for
the financial year 2009/10 be applied by the General Meeting in the following
manner:
(a) SDR 374.1 million in payment of:
– a normal dividend of SDR 285 per share, costing SDR 155.6 million; and
– a supplementary dividend of SDR 400 per share, costing SDR 218.5
million;
(b) SDR 148.6 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;8
(c) SDR 12.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund;
and
(d) SDR 1,325.1 million, representing the remainder of the available net
profit, to be transferred to the free reserve fund.
If approved, the two dividends could be paid out in one amount of
SDR 685 per share on 8 July 2010 according to each shareholder’s instructions
in any constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs, to the shareholders
named in the Bank’s share register on 31 March 2010.
The full dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares. The number of issued
and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares, 1,000 were held in treasury at
31 March 2010, namely the suspended shares of the Albanian issue. No
dividend will be paid on these treasury shares.

Report of the auditors
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG, who
have confirmed that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s financial
position at 31 March 2010 and the results of its operations for the year then
ended. Their report is to be found immediately following the financial
statements.

8
Since the general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2010,
Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend shall be
paid into this fund, until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

4. Designation of financial instruments
1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
with the Bank.

Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss

Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as
well as the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank
are not included in these financial statements. Information
on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in
note 32.

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

2. Functional and presentation currency

The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is
the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2005 and
effective 1 January 2006. As currently calculated, one SDR
is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410,
JPY 18.4 and GBP 0.0903. The composition of this
currency basket is subject to review every five years by the
IMF; the next review is due to be undertaken in December
2010.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and
gold on behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank
takes limited gold price, interest rate and foreign currency
risk.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other
assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange
rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits and
losses are translated into SDR at an average rate.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of
monetary assets and liabilities and from the settlement of

156

The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The
use of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is
described in Section 9 below.
All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated
as loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.

BIS 80th Annual Report

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Except for the currency assets described in the next
paragraph, currency assets (other than cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks) are designated as available
for sale. Related securities sold under repurchase
agreements are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively managed portfolios. The currency assets in these
portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost. They are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest is
included in interest expense on an accruals basis.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies,
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios.
The realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency
deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by realised and
unrealised losses or profits on the related currency assets
and derivatives, or on other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant
assets, liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking
portfolios as held at fair value through profit and loss.

10. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets. They
typically have notice periods of three days or less and are
included under the balance sheet heading “Loans and
advances”.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with the
exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities,
are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums received and discounts paid are included in
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After the trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under the profit and loss
account heading “Net valuation movement”.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities
Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

BIS 80th Annual Report

157

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively managed investment portfolios.
The currency assets in these portfolios are trading assets
and as such are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income” on
an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net valuation movement”.

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at
market value on a trade date basis.

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bars held in custody and sight
accounts. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a financial
instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for
on a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of
gold are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 17 below.

12. Currency assets available for sale

15. Gold loans

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and
government and other securities.

Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans to commercial
banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a financial
instrument.

As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively managed investment portfolios.

Gold loans are included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.

These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent
accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income” on an
effective interest rate basis.

Accrued interest on gold loans is included in “Interest
income” on an effective interest rate basis. The treatment
of realised and unrealised gains or losses on gold is
described in Section 17 below.

After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The
movement in fair value is included in the statement of
comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised
gain / (loss) on securities available for sale”. Realised
profits on disposal are included under the profit and loss
heading “Net gain on sales of securities available for sale”.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise sight and fixed-term deposits of
gold from central banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to
be a financial instrument.
Gold deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold deposits is included in “Interest
expense” on an effective interest rate basis. The treatment
of realised and unrealised gains or losses on gold is
described in Section 17 below.

158

BIS 80th Annual Report

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold

Where these liabilities are associated with currency
assets available for sale, they are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets

After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included under the
profit and loss account heading “Net valuation movement”.

The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios
as loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives
included in the portfolios are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net foreign
exchange gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.

19. Derivatives

Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange gain /
(loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The
movement in fair value is included in the statement of
comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised
gain on gold investment assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as
“Net gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a
trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest
and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received
are included in “Interest income” on an effective interest
rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with
all realised and unrealised movements in value included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host
contract which is not accounted for as held at fair value
through profit and loss, it is separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though it
were a standalone derivative as described above.

20. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the
Board of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how
financial instruments are designated, which determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. This policy
is supplemented with detailed valuation procedures.

18. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss, they are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.

BIS 80th Annual Report

The majority of the financial instruments on the balance
sheet are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair
value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting to
the Board and shareholders reflects the way in which the

159

banking business is managed and is consistent with the
risk management and economic performance figures
reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active
markets as the best evidence of fair value. Where no
published price quotations exist, the Bank determines fair
values using a valuation technique appropriate to the
particular financial instrument. Such valuation techniques
may involve using market prices of recent arm’s length
market transactions in similar instruments or may make
use of financial models. Where financial models are used,
the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs (eg interest rates and volatilities) as
appropriate, and relies as little as possible on its own
estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair
values, the valuation models are subject to initial approval
and periodic review in line with the requirements of the
Bank’s model validation policy.
The Bank has an independent valuation control function
which periodically reviews the value of its financial
instruments, taking into account both the accuracy of the
valuations and the valuation methodologies used. Other
valuation controls include the review and analysis of daily
profit and loss.
The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its liabilities
at the offer price. Derivative financial instruments are
valued on a bid-offer basis, with valuation reserves, where
necessary, included in derivative financial liabilities.
Financial assets and liabilities that are not valued at fair
value are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are initially recognised at fair
value and subsequently included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes
an annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

24. Provisions

21. Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those designated as held at
fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for
indications of impairment at each balance sheet date. A
financial asset is impaired when there is objective evidence
that the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been
reduced as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset. Evidence of
impairment could include significant financial difficulty,
default, or probable bankruptcy / financial reorganisation
of the counterparty or issuer.
Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss
account under the heading “Net valuation movement” to
the extent that a decline in fair value below amortised cost
is considered other than temporary. If the amount of the
impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through
profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the
investment does not exceed that which it would have been
had the impairment not been recognised.

160

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,
provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. Best estimates and assumptions
are used when determining the amount to be recognised
as a provision.

25. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and
health and accident insurance for current and former staff
members. An independent actuarial valuation is performed
annually for each arrangement.

BIS 80th Annual Report

A. Staff pensions

D. Corridor accounting

The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.

Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside
the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the estimated
future cash outflows. The rate used to discount the cash
flows is determined by the Bank based on the market yield
of highly rated corporate debt securities in Swiss francs
which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of
the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously made),
changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to the
pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in
accordance with the “corridor accounting” methodology
described below. The resulting liabilities are included
under the heading “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet.

26. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and
notice accounts with banks, which are very short-term
financial assets that typically have notice periods of three
days or less.

B. Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss
account in respect of the Directors’ pension arrangement
are calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff
pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is
an international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930,
the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The
headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002
Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of
the People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and
in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).

There is no active secondary market for certain of the
Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets
and liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which
require judgment to determine appropriate valuation
parameters. Changes in assumptions about these
parameters could materially affect the reported fair
values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point change in
spread assumptions is shown in the table below:

The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its
Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks,
to provide additional facilities for international financial
operations and to act as trustee or agent for international
financial settlements. Fifty-six central banks are currently
members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting
at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the
number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries.
The Board of Directors of the BIS is composed of the
Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s
founding central banks, being those of Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States
of America, as well as the Governors of the central banks
of Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland, and the President of the European Central
Bank.

For the financial year ended 31 March

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving
at the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at
these estimates, Management uses available information,
exercises judgment and makes assumptions.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the
Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the
designation and valuation of financial instruments are key
elements in the preparation of these financial statements.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for
example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities,
the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations and
the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from those
estimates.

B. The valuation of corporate bonds
In the financial market environment at 31 March 2009 the
degree of judgment involved in valuing financial
instruments was significant. With few actual market trades
in certain financial assets held by the Bank, a high degree
of judgment was necessary to select valuation parameters
from within a wide range of potential alternative
assumptions. This was particularly relevant for the Bank’s
holdings of corporate bonds (included under the balance
sheet heading “Government and other securities”), for
which the potential range of alternative spread assumptions
was of the order of tens of basis points. Due to improved
market conditions, the degree of uncertainty at 31 March
2010 was lower.
Management believes that all of the valuation parameters
used by the Bank reflect market conditions at the balance
sheet date in a fair and prudent manner.

C. Impairment provision – financial assets
Gold loans include a provision of SDR 23.5 million following
an impairment review as at 31 March 2010 (31 March 2009:
SDR 18.3 million). The impairment review was conducted
at an individual counterparty level, identifying those
counterparties which were experiencing significant financial
difficulties at the balance sheet date. The increase in the

BIS 80th Annual Report

provision during the financial year ended 31 March 2010 is
due to changes in gold prices, which are included under the
profit and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange
loss”. No additional impairment charge was recognised
during the financial year (2009: SDR 18.3 million).
Impairment charges, when recognised, are included in the
profit and loss account under the heading “Net interest
income”.

D. Actuarial assumptions and medical cost inflation
The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care
arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions and
expectations of inflation and interest rates. Changes to
these assumptions will have an impact on the valuation
of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts
recognised in the financial statements.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the
balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed
cost value is included in the gold revaluation account which
is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”; the movement in this value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading
“Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”. Realised
gains or losses on the disposal of gold investment assets
are recognised in the profit and loss account under the
heading “Net gain on sales of gold investment assets”.
Note 18 provides further analysis of the gold revaluation
account. Note 27 provides further analysis of the net gain
on sales of gold investment assets.
The table below analyses the movements in the Bank’s
gold investment assets:

the contract.

BIS 80th Annual Report

5. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans,
and government and other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
comprise those currency banking assets that represent the
reinvestment of customer deposits and those currency
investment assets that are part of more actively managed
portfolios. Currency assets available for sale comprise the
remainder of the Bank’s currency investment assets and
represent, for the most part, the investment of the Bank’s
equity.

163

Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by
governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are transactions under which
the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
loan is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there
is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent
securities subject to the repayment of the loan. During the
term of the agreement the fair value of collateral is
monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit exposure.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with
commercial banks. Also included in this category are

As at 31 March 2010

investments made with central banks, international
institutions and other public sector organisations. This
includes advances made as part of committed and
uncommitted standby facilities. The balance sheet total
“Loans and advances” also includes notice accounts (see
note 6).

Government and other securities are debt securities
issued by governments, international institutions, other
public institutions, commercial banks and corporates.
They include fixed and floating rate bonds and assetbacked securities.

B. Currency assets available for sale
The Bank’s currency investment assets relate principally to
the investment of its equity. They are designated as
available for sale unless they are part of an actively traded
portfolio.

The amount of the change in fair value recognised in the
profit and loss account on fixed-term loans and advances
is SDR 38.5 million (2009: SDR – 50.0 million).

Note 18 provides further analysis of the securities

the net gain on sales of securities designated as available

The Bank uses the following types of derivative
instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.

Interest rate and bond futures are contractual obligations
to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest
rates or bond prices on a future date at a specified price
established in an organised market. Futures contracts are
settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin
payments are settled by cash or marketable securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements
under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but
not the obligation, to either buy (call option) or sell (put
option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency
or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration, the
seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps are commitments to
exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result
in an economic exchange of currencies, gold or interest
rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a
combination of interest rates and currencies (crosscurrency interest rate swaps). Except for certain currency
and gold swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no
exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards represent commitments to
purchase foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.

6. Loans and advances
Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans and notice
accounts.
Fixed-term loans are designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as
loans and receivables and are included as cash and cash
equivalents. These are very short-term financial assets,
typically having a notice period of three days or less, and
are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

BIS 80th Annual Report

Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement
at a future date for the difference between a contracted
rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are options under which the seller grants the
purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by
or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a
premium from the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which
contain embedded derivatives (see note 10). Where the
host contract is not accounted for as held at fair value,
embedded derivatives are separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though
they are regular derivatives. As such, the gold currency
options embedded in gold dual currency deposits are
included within derivatives as currency and gold options.

Comprising:

BIS 80th Annual Report

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate
investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to
10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of
the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between
June 2010 and December 2010 (2009: June 2009 and
December 2009). The balance sheet total for callable MTIs
includes the fair value of the embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the BIS for any
maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the BIS with
maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate
is reset in line with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS,
typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits
that are repayable on the maturity date either in the
original currency or at a fixed amount in a different
currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total
for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between
21 April 2010 and 12 May 2010 (2009: between 2 April 2009
and 15 May 2009).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term
financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three
days or less. They are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.

167

The Bank acts as a sole market-maker in certain of its
currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay at
fair value some of these financial instruments, in whole or
in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit
accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
This value differs from the amount that the Bank is
contractually required to pay at maturity to the holder of
the deposit. For total currency deposits the amount that
the Bank is contractually required to pay at maturity to the
holder of the deposit, plus accrued interest to 31 March
2010, is SDR 193,896.3 million (2009: SDR 193,629.2
million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair
value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques
comprise discounted cash flow models and option pricing
models. The discounted cash flow models value the
expected cash flows of financial instruments using discount
factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates
(eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based on assumptions
about spreads at which each product is offered to and
repurchased from customers.
The spread assumptions are based on recent market
transactions in each product. Where the product series has
been closed to new investors (and thus there are no recent
market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted
spread for the series as the basis for determining the
appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about
volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

12. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repo”
liabilities) are transactions under which the Bank receives a
fixed-term deposit from a counterparty to which it provides
collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the deposit
is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there is an
irrevocable commitment to repay the deposit subject to
the return of equivalent securities. Securities sold under
repurchase agreements originate entirely from commercial
banks.
As at 31 March 2010 there were no securities sold under
repurchase agreements (2009: nil).

13. Accounts payable
Accounts payable consist of financial transactions awaiting
settlement, relating to short-term payables (typically
payable within three days or less) where transactions have
been effected but cash has not yet been transferred. This
includes assets that have been purchased and liabilities
that have been repurchased.

14. Other liabilities
As at 31 March

SDR millions

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected
by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s
creditworthiness deteriorated, the value of its liabilities
would decrease, and the change in value would be
reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss
account. The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness
as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s
assessment of its creditworthiness did not indicate a
change which could have had an impact on the fair value of
the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

16. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s
annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the
proposal of the Board of Directors to three specific reserve
funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and
the special dividend reserve fund; the remainder of the net
profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated
to the free reserve fund.

Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at
10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 10%
of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently
must be allocated to the general reserve fund. When the
balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up
capital, such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the
remainder of the annual net profit.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder
of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special

3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident
benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this
arrangement is based in principle on the employee
remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the
completion of a minimum service period of 10 years.

The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for
its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund
without separate legal personality, out of which benefits
are paid. The fund assets are administered by the Bank
for the sole benefit of current and former members of
staff who participate in the arrangement. The Bank
remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the
arrangement.

All arrangements are valued annually by independent
actuaries.

2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its
Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum
service period of four years.

The Bank’s special legal status in Switzerland is set out
principally in its Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss
Federal Council. Under the terms of this document the
Bank is exempted from virtually all direct and indirect taxes
at both federal and local government level in Switzerland.

175

Similar agreements exist with the government of the
People’s Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong
Kong SAR and with the Mexican government for the Office
for the Americas.

Gold bars held under earmark are included at their weight
in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2010 gold bars held
under earmark amounted to 212 tonnes of fine gold (2009:
212 tonnes).
The financial instruments held under the above
arrangements are deposited with external custodians,
either central banks or commercial institutions.

The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value
measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the
significance of the inputs used in measuring fair value.
The valuation is categorised at the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy adopted by the Bank uses the
following levels for categorising valuation inputs:

The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets as the best evidence of fair value. The financial instruments
valued using active market quotes are categorised as level 1.
Where reliable published price quotations are not available for a financial instrument, the Bank determines fair value by using
market standard valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow models as
well as other standard market valuation methods. Where financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of
observable market inputs. The financial instruments valued this way are categorised as level 2.
A small percentage of the Bank’s financial instruments valuations are produced using valuation techniques that utilise significant
unobservable inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 3. The financial instruments
categorised as level 3 at 31 March 2009 and 2010 comprise illiquid corporate bonds.
The accuracy of the Bank’s valuations is ensured through an independent price verification exercise performed by the valuation
control function.

accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the Bank
based on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank on
staff accounts plus 1%. The total balance of blocked
accounts at 31 March 2010 was SDR 20.0 million
(2009: SDR 19.2 million). They are reported under the
balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

B. Related party central banks and connected
institutions
The BIS provides banking services to its customers, who
are predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and
international financial institutions. In fulfilling this role,
the Bank in the normal course of business enters into
transactions with related party central banks and connected
institutions. These transactions include making advances,
and taking currency and gold deposits.
It is the Bank’s policy to enter into transactions with related
party central banks and connected institutions on similar
terms and conditions to transactions with other, non-related
party customers.

Capital adequacy

1. Capital

2. Economic capital

The table below shows the composition of the Bank’s Tier 1
and total capital as at 31 March 2010.

The Bank’s own assessment of its capital adequacy is
performed on the basis of its economic capital frameworks
for market risk, credit risk, operational risk and other risks.
These are designed to determine the amount of equity
needed to absorb losses arising from its exposures to a
statistical level of confidence consistent with the objective
to maintain superior credit quality. The Bank’s economic
capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period,
except for other risks. The amount of economic capital set
aside for other risks is based on Management’s
assessment of risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in
the Bank’s economic capital calculations.

and other risks:

As at 31 March

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The
assessment is supported by an annual capital and business
planning process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is
consistent with the revised International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II
Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in June 2006. The implementation includes all
three pillars of the Framework, and takes the particular
scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into account.
Since the Bank is not subject to national banking
supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited
to the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy. This
assessment is based primarily on an economic capital
methodology which is more comprehensive and geared to
a substantially higher solvency level than the minimum
Pillar 1 capital level required by the Basel II Framework.

3. Risk-weighted assets and minimum capital requirements under the Basel II Framework
The Basel II Framework includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital
requirements. In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.
The following table summarises the relevant exposure types and approaches as well as the risk-weighted assets and the minimum
capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal
ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.
Under this approach, the risk weighting for a transaction is
determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function
using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. For certain
exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised
approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped
to exposure types.

More details on the assumptions underlying the
calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk,
market risk and operational risk.

Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following
an internal models approach. For operational risk, the
advanced measurement approach is used. Both these
approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The
minimum capital requirements are derived from the VaR
figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking
into account the 8% minimum capital requirement.

BIS 80th Annual Report

As required by the Basel II Framework, expected loss is
calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced
internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is
calculated at the balance sheet date taking into account
the impairment provision which is reflected in the
Bank’s financial statements. Note 2 provides details of
the impairment provision. In accordance with the
requirements of the Basel II Framework, the expected loss
is compared with the impairment provision and any
shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital. At
31 March 2010, the impairment provision exceeded the
expected loss.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and
performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering
its specific characteristics. As such, it maintains a capital
position substantially in excess of the minimum
requirement.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central
banks, monetary authorities and international financial
institutions, in the management of their reserves and
related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the
Bank’s objectives and as such ensure its financial strength
and independence. The BIS engages in banking activities
that are customer-related as well as activities that are
related to the investment of its equity, each of which may
give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk
and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational
risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of
Directors, the Management of the Bank has established
risk management policies designed to ensure that risks are
identified, appropriately measured and limited as well as
monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation

General approach
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a
prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•
•

seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;

•

investing its assets predominantly in high credit
quality financial instruments;

adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market
risk-taking and carefully managing market risk
associated with the Bank’s strategic positions, which
include its gold holdings; and
maintaining a high level of liquidity.

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General
Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of
the Bank, and is assisted by the Deputy General Manager.
The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s
independent risk control and compliance functions. The
General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are
supported by senior management advisory committees.

186

The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee,
the Finance Committee and the Compliance and
Operational Risk Committee. The first two committees are
chaired by the General Manager and the third by the
Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive
Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the
Bank’s strategic planning and the allocation of resources,
as well as on decisions related to the broad financial
objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General
Manager on the financial management and policy issues
related to the banking business, including the allocation of
economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and
Operational Risk Committee acts as an advisory committee
to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk
management throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is
performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent
operational risk control function is shared between Risk
Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification,
and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. Both units
report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of
this function is to provide reasonable assurance that the
activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable
laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s Code of
Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant
standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and
assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff
on compliance issues. The Head of the Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the
Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee to the
Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the
Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an
independent valuation control function, produces the
Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s
expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget.
The objective of the independent valuation control function
is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its
valuation policy and procedures, and that the processes
and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations
conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance unit has a
direct reporting line to the Secretary General.

BIS 80th Annual Report

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support
covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s
activities. The Legal Service has a direct reporting line to
the General Manager.

The Internal Audit function reviews internal control
procedures and reports on how they comply with internal
standards and industry best practices. The scope of
internal audit work includes the review of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct
reporting line to the Audit Committee and is responsible to
the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position
and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the
relevant units. Financial risk and compliance reports aimed
at various management levels are regularly provided to
enable Management to adequately assess the Bank’s risk
profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the
Board of Directors on a bimonthly basis. Furthermore, the
Audit Committee receives regular reports from Internal
Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the
Finance unit. The Banking and Risk Management
Committee, another advisory committee to the Board,
receives an annual report from the Risk Control unit. The
preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies
and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank uses a comprehensive range of quantitative
methodologies for valuing financial instruments and for
measuring risk to the Bank’s net profit and its equity. The
Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light
of its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles
and responsibilities and processes related to the
implementation of new or materially changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and
manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based
on value-at-risk (VaR) techniques. VaR expresses the
statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the
current positions of the Bank measured to a specified level
of confidence and a specified time horizon.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to
measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses
arising from its exposures to a statistical level of
confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the
highest creditworthiness.

BIS 80th Annual Report

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of
economic capital frameworks for market risk, credit risk,
operational risk and other risks, supplemented by
sensitivity and risk factor analyses. The Bank’s economic
capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk
categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set
aside based on Management’s assessment of risks which
are not, or not fully, reflected in the economic capital
calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements
the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic
capital calculations for financial risk. The Bank’s key
market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested.
The stress testing includes the analysis of severe historical
and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as
well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible
movements of the key risk factors identified. The Bank also
performs stress tests related to liquidity risk.

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet
its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual
terms and conditions.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and
policies set by the Board of Directors and Management.
These are complemented by more detailed guidelines and
procedures at the level of the independent risk control
function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty
and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk
control function, individual counterparty credit assessments
are performed subject to a well defined internal rating
process, involving 18 rating grades. As part of this process,
counterparty financial statements and market information
are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating
and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series
of credit limits covering individual counterparties
and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all
counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits
are reviewed at least annually. The main assessment
criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties
to meet interest and principal repayment obligations in a
timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by
the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by
the Board of Directors.

187

On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and
country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and limited
based on the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit
risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank
uses a portfolio VaR model. Management limits the Bank’s
overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of
economic capital to credit risk.

B. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and
legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The
corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the
balance sheet.

C. Default risk
The exposures set out in the table below are based on the
carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as
categorised by sector, geographical region and credit
quality. Gold and gold loans exclude gold held in custody,
and accounts receivable do not include unsettled liability
issues, because these items do not represent credit
exposures of the Bank. The carrying value is the fair value
of the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in
the case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and
notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised
cost net of any impairment charge. Commitments are
shown at their notional amounts.

The Bank obtains collateral, under reverse repurchase
agreements, some derivative financial instrument contracts
and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate
counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective
policies and procedures. The collateral value is monitored
on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, additional
collateral is requested.
The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established
clearing centres and by settling transactions where
possible through a delivery versus payment settlement
mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on
a continuous basis.

The ratings shown reflect the Bank’s internal ratings
expressed as equivalent external ratings. The vast majority
of the Bank’s exposure is rated equivalent to A– or above.
A financial asset is considered past due when a
counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual
due date. The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial
assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its

192

valuations monthly, taking into account necessary
adjustments for impairment.
Gold loans include a provision of SDR 23.5 million
following an impairment review as at 31 March 2010
(31 March 2009: SDR 18.3 million). The increase in the
provision during the financial year ended 31 March 2010
is due to changes in gold prices.

The Bank did not provide collateral on any of its financial instruments contracts at 31 March 2010 (2009: nil).
The above table shows the collateral obtained by the Bank. It excludes transactions which have yet to settle (on which neither
cash nor collateral have been exchanged). The Bank obtains collateral as part of reverse repurchase agreements and collateral
agreements for certain derivatives. The Bank is allowed to sell or pledge this collateral, but must deliver equivalent financial
instruments upon the expiry of the contract. Furthermore, the Bank grants to its customers collateralised loans and advances
under committed and uncommitted standby facilities.
The Bank accepts sovereign securities as collateral for derivatives. Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements
comprises sovereign and supranational debt as well as US agency securities. Eligible collateral for loans and advances includes
currency deposits with the Bank and units in the BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and securities in portfolios managed by the BIS.
As at 31 March 2010 the total amount of undrawn committed collateralised facilities which could be drawn down subject to
collateralisation by the customer was SDR 2,499.1 million (2009: SDR 8,412.3 million).
Due to the default of a counterparty during the financial year ended 31 March 2009, the Bank seized and sold SDR 735.5 million
of US Treasury bills held as collateral. No default occurred during the financial year ended 31 March 2010, thus the Bank did not
seize any collateral during the reporting period.

E. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a
one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence interval. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to credit
risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

F. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposures to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an
approach that is consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk
weights derived from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for
key inputs are also relevant to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.

BIS 80th Annual Report

193

The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD
as the notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivatives. The EAD for derivatives is calculated
using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II Framework. In line with this
methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
Framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated
loss-given-default (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the
Bank is not in a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD
estimates through a mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account.
Similarly, LGD estimates are derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the
risk-reducing effect of collateral obtained giving consideration to market price volatility, remargining and revaluation frequency.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits
into account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2010 includes SDR 4,687.7 million (2009:
SDR 7,024.8 million) for interest rate contracts and SDR 6,028.4 million (2009: SDR 5,108.0 million) for FX and gold contracts.

Securitisation exposures
The Bank only invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures.
Risk-weighted assets for these exposures are determined using the standardised approach.
Given the scope of the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the
standardised approach for securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to
determine the relevant risk weights. External credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service,
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the
exposures and the associated risk weights.

4. Market risk

A. Gold price risk

The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse
movements in market prices. The main components of the
Bank’s market risk are gold price risk, interest rate risk and
foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and
calculates economic capital based on a VaR methodology
using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor
volatilities and correlations are estimated using a one-year
observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes
sensitivities to certain market risk factors.

Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.

In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain its superior
credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic
capital usage within a framework set by the Board of
Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the
quality of available market data and, while forward-looking,
they extrapolate from past events.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of
potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank
has established a comprehensive regular backtesting
framework,
comparing
daily
performance
with
corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed
and reported to Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement
based on VaR modelling and related economic capital
calculations with a series of stress tests. These include
severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical
macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold
price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

BIS 80th Annual Report

The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through
its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to
120 tonnes (2009: 120 tonnes). These gold investment
assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with
commercial banks. At 31 March 2010 the Bank’s net gold
investment assets was SDR 2,811.2 million (2009:
SDR 2,358.1 million), approximately 18% of its equity
(2009: 17%). The Bank sometimes also has small
exposures to gold price risk emerging from its banking
activities with central and commercial banks. Gold price
risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology,
including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in interest rates, including
credit spreads.
The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk through the
interest bearing assets relating to the management of its
equity held in its investment portfolios and investments
relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios
are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a
VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into
account movements in relevant money market rates,
government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.

C. Foreign exchange risk

from customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction
intermediation.

The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite
currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and
GBP. Currency risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The
Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily through
the assets relating to the management of its equity. The
Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through
managing its customer deposits and through acting as an
intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between
central and commercial banks. The Bank reduces its
foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant
assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a
regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising

Foreign exchange risk is measured and monitored based
on the Bank’s VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses
considering movements in key foreign exchange rates.

196

The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities
by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange
and gold position in these tables therefore includes the
Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net
foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need to be
removed. The SDR neutral position is then deducted from
the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive
at the net currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR
neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations
between risk factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the
99.995% confidence interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes
in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the
SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to
market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a
banking book approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets
are determined for gold price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is
derived using the VaR-based internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR
methodology, assuming a 99% confidence interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily
VaR measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of
three plus a potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting
outliers observed remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk
development relevant to the calculation of minimum capital requirements over the reporting period and shows the Bank’s
minimum capital requirement for market risk and the related risk-weighted assets as at 31 March 2010.

5. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet
expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and
collateral needs without affecting its daily operations or its
financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits
from central banks, international organisations and other
public institutions are the key drivers of the size of the
Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to
repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit
instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank
is managed to preserve a high degree of liquidity so that it
can meet the requirements of its customers at all times.
The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model underpinned by
conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and
the liquidity of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board
of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio
which requires liquid assets to be at least 100% of the
potential liquidity requirement. In addition, liquidity stress
tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios are
performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity
requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The
Bank’s liquidity has consistently been materially above its
minimum liquidity ratio and the requirements of its stress
tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from
central banks and international institutions, comprise 93%
(2009: 91%) of its total liabilities. At 31 March 2010
currency and gold deposits originated from 174 depositors
(2009: 161). Within these deposits, there are significant
individual customer concentrations, with six customers
each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a
settlement date basis (2009: seven customers).
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows
for financial assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed
are the undiscounted cash flows to which the Bank is
committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of
financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both,
resulting from one or more risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite
knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training
and development, inadequate supervision, loss of key
personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of
integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly
designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented,
understood, implemented, followed or enforced.

•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly
designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not
operate as intended.

•

External events: the occurrence of an event having an
adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic
risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework,
policies and procedures comprise the management and

determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs,
business continuity planning and the monitoring of key
risk indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate
reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit develops action
plans with the respective units and follows up on their
implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital
and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has
adopted a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation
technique that is consistent with the advanced
measurement approach proposed under the Basel II
Framework. In line with the assumptions of the Basel II
Framework, the quantification of operational risk does not
take reputational risk into account. Internal and external
loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments
to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. The Bank
does not incorporate potential protection it may obtain
from insurance in the measurement of operational risk.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital
for operational risk to the 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year time horizon. The table below shows the key figures
of the Bank’s exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

B. Minimum capital requirements for operational risk
In line with the key parameters of the Basel II Framework, the calculation of the minimum capital requirement for operational risk
is determined assuming a 99.9% confidence interval and a one-year time horizon. The table below summarises the key figures of
the Bank’s exposure to operational risk in terms of minimum capital requirements over the past two financial years.

Report of the auditors

to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements.
These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet as at 31 March 2010, the profit and loss
account for the year then ended as required by the Bank’s Statutes, and the statement of cash
flows and notes thereto. The financial statements have been prepared by the Management of the
Bank in accordance with the Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under
significant accounting policies in the notes. The Management of the Bank is responsible for
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates
that are reasonable in the circumstances. Our responsibility under the Statutes of the Bank is to
form an independent opinion on the balance sheet and profit and loss account based on our audit
and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We have received all the information and explanations which we have
required to obtain assurance that the balance sheet and profit and loss account are free of
material misstatement, and believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements, including the notes thereto, have been properly drawn up
and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements at
31 March 2010 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in conformity with the
accounting principles described in the notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
