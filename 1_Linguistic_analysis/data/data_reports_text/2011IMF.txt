A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook. It
has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 18–August
15, 2011, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are
assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box
A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $103.20 a barrel in 2011 and $100.00 a barrel in
2012 and will remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered
rate (LIBOR) on U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012; that the three-month
euro deposit rate will average 1.3 percent in 2011 and 1.2 percent in 2012; and that the six-month Japanese yen
deposit rate will yield on average 0.5 percent in 2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event
be involved in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through
early September 2011.
The following conventions are used throughout the World Economic Outlook:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
–
between years or months (for example, 2010–11 or January–June) to indicate the years or months
covered, including the beginning and ending years or months;
/
between years or months (for example, 2010/11) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
Data for Estonia are now included in the aggregates for the euro area and advanced economies.
As in the April 2011 World Economic Outlook, WEO aggregated data exclude Libya for the projection years
due to the uncertain political situation.
Starting with the September 2011 World Economic Outlook, Guyana and Suriname are classified as members
of the South America region and Belize as a member of the Central America region. Previously, they were
members of the Caribbean region.
For Sudan, the projections for 2011 and later exclude South Sudan.
In figures and tables, shaded areas indicate IMF staff projections.
If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that
is a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial
entities that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or region. Unless otherwise noted, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or
more of the weighted group data.
The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on the maps do not imply, on
the part of the International Monetary Fund, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.

FuRTHER InFoRMATIon AnD DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook is available in full on the IMF’s website, www.imf.org. Accompanying it on the website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the
report itself, including files containing the series most frequently requested by readers. These files may be
downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO
exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country
desk officers in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis
of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis, as more information becomes available, and structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use
of splicing and other techniques. IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when
complete information is unavailable. As a result, WEO data can differ from other sources with official data,
including the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure, but
not guarantee, their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted
effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. For details on the terms and conditions for usage of the
WEO database, please refer to the IMF Copyright and Usage website, http://www.imf.org/external/terms.htm.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product
of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on
information the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are
carried out in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific
Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere
Department—together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department; and the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Olivier Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Jörg Decressin,
Senior Advisor, Research Department and Rupa Duttagupta, Deputy Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Abdul Abiad, John Bluedorn, Jaime Guajardo, Thomas Helbling,
Daniel Leigh, Andrea Pescatori, Shaun Roache, Marco E. Terrones, Petia Topalova, and John Simon. Other
contributors include Ali Alichi, Luis Catão, Ondra Kamenik, Heejin Kim, Michael Kumhof, Douglas Laxton,
Prakash Loungani, Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, Rafael Portillo, and Felipe Zanna. Toh Kuan, Gavin Asdorian,
Shan Chen, Angela Espiritu, Laura Feiveson, João Jalles, Murad Omoev, Katherine Pan, David Reichsfeld,
Marina Rousset, Andy Salazar, Min Kyu Song, Ercument Tulun, and Su Wang provided research assistance.
Kevin Clinton provided comments and suggestions. Tingyun Chen, Mahnaz Hemmati, Emory Oakes, Rajesh
Nilawar, and Steve Zhang managed the database and the computer systems. Shanti Karunaratne, Skeeter
Mathurin, and Cristina Tumale were responsible for word processing. Linda Griffin Kean of the External Relations Department edited the manuscript and coordinated the production of the publication. External consultants Anastasia Francis, Aleksandr Gerasimov, Wendy Mak, Shamiso Mapondera, Nhu Nguyen, and Pavel
Pimenov provided additional technical support.
The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as well as
by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on August 31, 2011. However, both projections
and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors or to
their national authorities.

elative to our previous World Economic
Outlook last April, the economic recovery
has become much more uncertain. The
world economy suffers from the confluence of two adverse developments. The first is a
much slower recovery in advanced economies since
the beginning of the year, a development we largely
failed to perceive as it was happening. The second
is a large increase in fiscal and financial uncertainty,
which has been particularly pronounced since
August. Each of these developments is worrisome—
their combination and their interactions more so.
Strong policies are urgently needed to improve the
outlook and reduce the risks.
Growth, which had been strong in 2010,
decreased in 2011. This slowdown did not initially cause too much worry. We had forecast some
slowdown, due to the end of the inventory cycle
and fiscal consolidation. One-time events, from the
earthquake and tsunami in Japan to shocks to the
supply of oil, offered plausible explanations for a
further slowdown. And the initial U.S. data understated the size of the slowdown itself. Now that the
numbers are in, it is clear that more was going on.
What was going on was the stalling of the two
rebalancing acts, which we have argued in many
previous issues of the World Economic Outlook are
needed to deliver “strong, balanced, and sustainable
growth.”
Take first internal rebalancing: What is needed
is a shift from fiscal stimulus to private demand.
Fiscal consolidation is indeed taking place in most
advanced economies (although not in Japan). But
private demand is not taking the relay. The reasons
vary, depending on the country. But tight bank
lending, the legacy of the housing boom, and high
leverage for many households all turn out to be
putting stronger brakes on the recovery than we
anticipated.
Turn to external rebalancing: Advanced economies with current account deficits, most notably the

United States, need to compensate for low domestic
demand through an increase in foreign demand.
This implies a symmetric shift away from foreign
demand toward domestic demand in emerging market economies with current account surpluses, most
notably China. This rebalancing act is not taking
place. While imbalances decreased during the crisis,
this was due more to a large decrease in output in
advanced relative to emerging market economies
than to structural adjustment in these economies.
Looking forward, the forecast is for an increase
rather than a decrease in imbalances.
Now turn to the second adverse development,
increased fiscal and financial uncertainty: Markets have clearly become more skeptical about the
ability of many countries to stabilize their public
debt. For some time, their worries were mostly
limited to a few small countries on the periphery of
Europe. As time has passed, and as growth prospects have dimmed, their worries have extended to
more European countries and to countries beyond
Europe—from Japan to the United States. Worries
about sovereigns have translated into worries about
the banks holding these sovereign bonds, mainly in
Europe. These worries have led to a partial freeze
of financial flows, with banks keeping high levels
of liquidity and tightening lending. Fear of the
unknown is high. Stock prices have fallen. These
will adversely affect spending in the months to
come. Indeed, August numbers indicate that this is
already happening.
Low underlying growth and fiscal and financial
linkages may well feed back on each other, and this
is where the risks are. Low growth makes it more
difficult to achieve debt sustainability and leads
markets to worry even more about fiscal stability. Low growth also leads to more nonperforming
loans and weakens banks. Front-loaded fiscal consolidation in turn may lead to even lower growth.
Weak banks and tight bank lending may have the
same effect. Weak banks and the potential need for

more capital lead to more worry about fiscal stability. Downside risks are very real.
I have been focusing so far on advanced economies. The reason is that, until now, emerging market economies have been largely immune to these
adverse developments. They have had to deal with
volatile capital flows, but in general have continued
to sustain high growth. Indeed, some are close to
overheating, although prospects are more uncertain
again for many others. Under the risk scenarios,
they may well suffer more adverse export conditions
and even more volatile capital flows. Low exports
and, perhaps, lower commodity prices will also create challenges for low-income countries.
In light of the weak baseline and high downside
risks, strong policy action is of the essence. It must
rely on three main legs.
The first leg is fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation
cannot be too fast or it will kill growth. It cannot
be too slow or it will kill credibility. The speed must
depend on individual country circumstances, but the
key continues to be credible medium-term consolidation. Some countries need substantial outside help
to succeed. Going beyond fiscal policy, measures to
prop up domestic demand, ranging from continued
low interest rates, to increased bank lending, to resolution programs for housing, are also of the essence.
The second leg is financial measures. Fiscal
uncertainty will not go away overnight. And even

xiv

under the most optimistic assumptions, growth in
advanced economies will remain low for some time.
During that time, banks have to be made stronger,
not only to increase bank lending and baseline
growth, but also—and more important—to reduce
risks of vicious feedback loops. For a number of
banks, especially in Europe, this is likely to require
additional capital buffers, either from private or
from public sources.
The third leg is external rebalancing. It is hard
to see how, even with the policy measures listed
above, domestic demand in the United States and
other economies hit by the crisis can, by itself,
ensure sufficient growth. Thus, exports from
the United States and crisis-hit economies must
increase, and, by implication, net exports from the
rest of the world must decrease. A number of Asian
economies, in particular China, have large current
account surpluses and have indicated plans to rebalance from foreign to domestic demand. These plans
cannot be implemented overnight. But they must
be implemented as fast as possible. Only with this
global rebalancing can we hope for stronger growth
in advanced economies and, by implication, for the
rest of the world.

T

he global economy is in a dangerous
new phase. Global activity has weakened
and become more uneven, confidence
has fallen sharply recently, and downside
risks are growing. Against a backdrop of unresolved
structural fragilities, a barrage of shocks hit the
international economy this year. Japan was struck
by the devastating Great East Japan earthquake and
tsunami, and unrest swelled in some oil-producing
countries. At the same time, the handover from
public to private demand in the U.S. economy
stalled, the euro area encountered major financial turbulence, global markets suffered a major
sell-off of risky assets, and there are growing signs
of spillovers to the real economy. The structural
problems facing the crisis-hit advanced economies
have proven even more intractable than expected,
and the process of devising and implementing
reforms even more complicated. The outlook for
these economies is thus for a continuing, but weak
and bumpy, expansion. Prospects for emerging
market economies have become more uncertain
again, although growth is expected to remain fairly
robust, especially in economies that can counter the
effect on output of weaker foreign demand with less
policy tightening.
World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections
indicate that global growth will moderate to about
4 percent through 2012, from over 5 percent in
2010. Real GDP in the advanced economies is
projected to expand at an anemic pace of about
1½ percent in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012, helped
by a gradual unwinding of the temporary forces
that have held back activity during much of the
second quarter of 2011. However, this assumes that
European policymakers contain the crisis in the
euro area periphery, that U.S. policymakers strike a
judicious balance between support for the economy
and medium-term fiscal consolidation, and that
volatility in global financial markets does not
escalate. Moreover, the removal of monetary accommodation in advanced economies is now expected

to pause. Under such a scenario, emerging capacity
constraints and policy tightening, much of which
has already happened, would lower growth rates in
emerging and developing economies to a still very
solid pace of about 6 percent in 2012.
The risks are clearly to the downside, and two
warrant particular attention from policymakers:
• The first is that the crisis in the euro area runs
beyond the control of policymakers, notwithstanding the strong policy response agreed at the
July 21, 2011, EU summit. Policymakers must
swiftly ratify the commitments made at the July
summit, and in the meantime, the European
Central Bank (ECB) must continue to intervene strongly to maintain orderly conditions in
sovereign debt markets. Leaders must stand by
their commitments to do whatever it takes to
preserve trust in national policies and the euro.
Furthermore, given declining inflation pressure
and heightened financial and sovereign tensions,
the ECB should lower its policy rate if downside
risks to growth and inflation persist.
• The second is that activity in the United States,
already softening, might suffer further blows—
for example, from a political impasse over fiscal
consolidation, a weak housing market, rapid
increases in household saving rates, or deteriorating financial conditions. Deep political divisions
leave the course of U.S. policy highly uncertain.
There is a serious risk that hasty fiscal cutbacks
will further weaken the outlook without providing the long-term reforms required to reduce
debt to more sustainable levels. News from the
housing market has been disappointing, with no
end in sight to the overhang of excess supply and
declining prices, and equity prices have corrected
sharply. These or other developments could
prompt households to accelerate their pace of
deleveraging, by raising their saving rates further.
Given growing downside risks to U.S. activity,
the Federal Reserve should stand ready to deploy
more unconventional support, and the pace of
International Monetary Fund | September 2011

fiscal consolidation could become more backloaded provided credible medium-term measures
are adopted.
Either one of these eventualities would have
severe repercussions for global growth. The renewed
stress could undermine financial markets and
institutions in advanced economies, which remain
unusually vulnerable. Commodity prices and
global trade and capital flows would likely decline
abruptly, dragging down growth in emerging and
developing economies. The extent to which this
could lower global growth is illustrated in more
detail in a downside scenario––the euro area and
the United States could fall back into recession,
with activity some 3 percentage points lower in
2012 than envisaged in WEO projections. Damage
to other economies would also be significant.
Homegrown risks in emerging and developing
economies seem less severe. Signs of overheating
still warrant close attention, particularly from the
monetary and prudential authorities. Risks related
to commodity prices and social and political unrest
in some parts of the world continue to loom large.
The uneven nature of the expansion and the
many risks that threaten activity are symptomatic
of a global economy that continues to struggle
to accomplish the two rebalancing acts identified
in earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook.
First, private demand must take over from public
demand. On this front, many economies have made
considerable progress, but the major advanced
economies lag behind. Second, economies with
large external surpluses must rely increasingly on
domestic demand, whereas those with large deficits
must do the opposite. This rebalancing act has
gone only halfway.1 Key advanced and emerging
market economies need to strengthen their policies to advance rebalancing and hedge against the
many downside risks. Policies must be calibrated to
reflect the transformed global environment, including lower potential output in many advanced and

crisis-hit emerging market economies, unusually
vulnerable financial sectors, high public deficits and
debt and more sovereign credit risk differentiation
among advanced economies, and the greater economic resilience of many emerging economies.
Rebalancing from public to private demand:
Policymakers in crisis-hit economies must resist
the temptation to rely mainly on accommodative monetary policy to mend balance sheets and
accelerate repair and reform of the financial sector.
Fiscal policy must navigate between the twin perils
of losing credibility and undercutting recovery.
Fiscal adjustment has already started, and progress
has been significant in many economies. Strengthening medium-term fiscal plans and implementing
entitlement reforms are critical to ensuring credibility and fiscal sustainability and to creating policy
room to support balance sheet repair, growth, and
job creation. Better short-term real sector prospects,
in turn, would help make medium-term adjustment
plans more credible. Should the macroeconomic
environment deteriorate substantially, countries
with more room for fiscal policy maneuvering
should allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully
and could choose a more back-loaded adjustment
profile.
• In the euro area, the adverse feedback loop
between weak sovereign and financial institutions
needs to be broken. Fragile financial institutions
must be asked to raise more capital, preferably
through private solutions. If these are not available, they will have to accept injections of public
capital or support from the EFSF, or be restructured or closed. Medium-term plans for fiscal
consolidation are appropriately ambitious. In the
economies of the periphery, a major task will be
to find the right balance between fiscal consolidation and structural reform on the one hand and
external support on the other, so as to ensure that
adjustment in these economies can be sustained.
• The top priorities in the United States include
devising a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan
to put public debt on a sustainable path and
to implement policies to sustain the recovery,
including by easing the adjustment in the housing and labor markets. The American Job Act
would provide needed short-term support to the

Executive Summary

economy, but it must be flanked with a strong
medium-term fiscal plan that raises revenues and
contains the growth of entitlement spending.
• In Japan, the government should pursue more
ambitious measures to deal with the very high
level of public debt while attending to the immediate need for reconstruction and development in
the areas hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
In all these economies, major progress with
respect to entitlement and tax reform would create
more room to adapt the pace of near-term fiscal
consolidation to the strength of domestic demand
and thereby limit further weakening of the recovery.
Rebalancing from external to domestic demand:
Progress on this front has become even more
important to sustain global growth. Some emerging
market economies are contributing more domestic demand than is desirable (for example, several
economies in Latin America); others are not contributing enough (for example, key economies in
emerging Asia). The first set needs to restrain strong
domestic demand by considerably reducing structural fiscal deficits and, in some cases, by further
removing monetary accommodation. The second
set of economies needs significant currency appreciation alongside structural reforms to reduce high
surpluses of savings over investment. Such policies
would help improve their resilience to shocks originating in the advanced economies as well as their
medium-term growth potential.
The Great Recession amplified a number of realsector problems, especially in advanced economies.
The United States could be facing a very sluggish
recovery of employment. Although unemployment
is below post–World War II highs, job losses during
the crisis were unprecedented and came on top of
lackluster employment performance during the preceding decade. Households are more worried about
future income prospects than at any time since the
early 1980s. Priorities include easing adjustment
in the housing market and strengthening active
labor market policies. In many ways, however, the
problem is so large that it warrants a drastic change
in macroeconomic policy: major entitlement and
tax reform with a view to creating more room for
fiscal policy to sustain the recovery in the short
term. In the euro area, abstracting from the large

problems posed by the financial turbulence, the
situation is more mixed. Households generally seem
less concerned than in the United States, and job
destruction has been much less severe, except in the
crisis-hit economies of the periphery. The key structural challenge is for the economies in the periphery
to adopt reforms that improve their capacity to
rebuild and maintain their competitiveness.
Structural challenges elsewhere in the world vary
widely. Large capital inflows in some emerging market economies underscore the need to improve their
absorptive capacity by further opening product and
services markets to foreign capital and strengthening financial stability frameworks. In addition, high
food prices underscore the need for many emerging
and developing economies to develop well-targeted
social safety nets.
In view of the slow pace of global demand rebalancing, high commodity prices, and the modest
growth outlook for advanced economies, long-term
interest rates for key sovereigns are likely to stay
low. This may foster risk taking in other economies––previous episodes of money recycling on
a massive scale have rarely been without financial
accidents. Symptoms of excessive risk taking are
in fact evident in a few advanced and a number
of emerging market economies: very high credit
growth, booming real estate markets, and large
flows into financial markets. More generally, the
financial crisis brought to the fore the extraordinary vulnerability of the global financial system to
disruptions in wholesale funding markets. At the
national level, central banks have responded by
putting in place temporary mechanisms that inject
liquidity if wholesale funding threatens to dry up.
There are, however, no such mechanisms at the
international level. In general, the latest financial
crisis illustrates the urgent need to beef up the size
and scope of international risk-sharing mechanisms,
which have fallen far behind the size of international financial markets.
To ensure that trade remains supportive of the
global recovery, policymakers must continue to
resist protectionist pressures. Just as important,
with negotiations on the long-running World Trade
Organization (WTO) Doha Round of trade talks at
a pivotal juncture, political leaders need to muster
International Monetary Fund | September 2011

xvii

the will and high-level attention to devise a credible
plan to move the negotiations forward, including by
strongly communicating the benefits to the public.
Failure of the round could lead to fragmentation of
the global trading system and a weakening of the
WTO and multilateralism.
Unless policies are strengthened, especially in
advanced economies, nothing beyond a weak and
bumpy recovery is in the cards. There are potential
major benefits to a stronger, collaborative policy
response. As explained in a separate IMF report
for the G20 Mutual Assessment Program, adopting growth-friendly medium-term fiscal consolidation programs in advanced economies, policies
to rebalance demand in emerging market surplus
economies, and structural reforms to boost poten-

tial growth everywhere could provide a considerable
fillip to global GDP.2 Perhaps even more important,
together with measures to facilitate balance sheet
adjustment by households and banks, such policies
would forestall a lost decade of growth in advanced
economies, which would be very detrimental for all.
However, achieving this will require that policymakers tackle difficult political economy challenges at
home and resuscitate the strong collaborative spirit
that prevailed at the height of the crisis.

Global proSpectS and polIcIeS

Slowing Global activity
Activity has weakened significantly (Figure 1.1),
following a number of quarters of growth broadly in
line with World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections. The slowdown reflects both anticipated and
unanticipated developments. The strong cyclical
rebound in global industrial production and trade
in 2010 was never expected to persist. However, in
crisis-hit advanced economies, especially the United
States, the handover from public to private demand
is taking more time than anticipated. In addition,
sovereign debt and banking sector problems in the
euro area have proven much more tenacious than
expected. Furthermore, the disruptions resulting
from the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami,
as well as the spreading unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) region and the related
surge in oil prices, were major surprises.
The shocks to Japan and the oil supply have had a
temporary effect on global growth, which is beginning to unwind. Various considerations suggest that
they may have lowered output in advanced economies by ½ percentage point, mostly in the second
quarter of 2011.
• According to some estimates, the number of cars
manufactured worldwide may have dropped by
up to 30 percent in the two months following
the Japanese earthquake and tsunami because of
supply-chain disruptions. For the United States,
some estimates put losses on the order of 1 percentage point of GDP in the second quarter of
2011;1 others report smaller effects of about ½
percentage point of GDP.2
• During the second quarter of 2011, oil prices
briefly rose more than 25 percent above the levels
that prevailed in January 2011. It is hard to determine the extent to which prices were driven up by
1See Macroeconomic Advisers (2011). Based on manufacturers’
announced plans, they argue that rising car assembly could add
1¼ percentage points to GDP in the third quarter.
2See IMF (2011).

stronger demand or by lower supply (for example,
from Libya). Assuming that a significant share of
the price increase reflected lower supply, it may
have reduced output in advanced economies by ¼
to ½ percentage point of GDP.
At the same time, emerging and developing
economies performed broadly as forecast, with considerable variation across regions. Activity began to
rebound fairly strongly in the crisis-hit economies of
central and eastern Europe (CEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), helped in the
latter by buoyant commodity prices. Surging commodity prices also propelled Latin America to high
growth rates. Activity in developing Asia weakened
modestly in response to global supply-chain disruptions and destocking in the face of more uncertain
demand from advanced economies. Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) continued to expand at a robust pace.
By contrast, economic activity in the MENA region
suffered from political and social conflict, although
strong revenues boosted the economies of oil exporters. The net result of the various developments in
advanced and emerging market economies was
unexpectedly weak global activity during the second
quarter (Figure 1.1, bottom panel).

renewed Financial Instability
Recently, financial volatility has again increased
drastically, driven by concerns about developments
in the euro area and the strength of global activity,
especially in the United States. Policy indecision has
exacerbated uncertainty and added to financial strains,
feeding back into the real economy. The September
2011 Global Financial Stability Report observes that
renewed doubts about the prospects for addressing the
problems in the euro area resurfaced in spring 2011
and have since deepened, notwithstanding the strong
measures agreed at the July 21, 2011, EU summit. It
is worrisome that investors have significantly pushed
up sovereign risk premiums for Belgium, Italy, and
Spain, and—to a much lesser extent—France (Figure

1.2, top panels); and that Cyprus has come under
major pressure. Interbank markets are again under
strain, and some banks reportedly are finding it difficult to continue to obtain funding (Figure 1.2, centerright panel). With accumulating signs of weakness in
key advanced economies, notably bad news about the
U.S. economy over the past couple of months, equity
markets have fallen sharply and equity price volatility
has jumped up (Figure 1.3, top panels); also, prices
for strong sovereign bonds and gold have risen—all
signs that investors have become much more cautious about the prospects for the major advanced
economies.

More Uneven expansion
Worryingly, various consumer and business confidence indicators in advanced economies have retreated
sharply, rather than strengthened as might have been
expected in the presence of mostly temporary shocks
that are unwinding. Accordingly, the IMF’s Growth
Tracker (Figure 1.4, top panel) points to low growth
over the near term. WEO projections assume that
policymakers keep their commitments and the financial
turmoil does not run beyond their control, allowing
confidence to return as conditions stabilize. The return
to stronger activity in advanced economies will then be
delayed rather than derailed by the turmoil. Projections
thus point to a modest pickup of activity in advanced
economies and robust growth in emerging and developing economies during 2011–12 (Figure 1.5; Table
1.1). Global growth is expected to be about 4 percent.
Real GDP growth in the major advanced economies––
the United States, euro area, and Japan––is forecast to
rise modestly, from about ¾ percent in the first half
of 2011 to about 1½ percent in 2012, as the effects
of temporary disturbances abate and the fundamental
drivers of expansion slowly reassert themselves. Activity
will be more robust in a number of other advanced
economies, especially in those with close ties to emerging Asia. In emerging and developing economies,
capacity constraints, policy tightening, and slowing
foreign demand are expected to dampen growth to
varying extents across countries. As a result, growth in
these economies will drop from about 7 percent in the
first half of 2011 to about 6 percent in 2012. Risks are
mainly to the downside over the near term.

Global trade and industrial production lost momentum during the second quarter of
2011, partly because an earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted global supply
chains and high oil prices slowed consumption in advanced economies. As a result,
global growth turned out weaker than expected, mainly in advanced economies.

Figure 1.2. Financial Strains in Europe and the United

The crisis in the euro area has deepened and broadened. Spreads on sovereign
bonds of economies in the periphery have reached new highs. Concurrently, spreads
of several other economies have also widened to varying degrees. Stock prices have
suffered sharp corrections, dragged down by concerns about weak activity and
financial sectors in advanced economies. Strains have resurfaced in interbank
markets. At the same time, credit default swap (CDS) spreads on U.S. government
bonds have moved up. This contrasts with the decline in U.S. bond rates. Both the
euro and U.S. dollar depreciated against the Swiss franc until recently.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Key drivers of stronger activity over the near
term include the rebound of activity in Japan,
the drop in oil and food prices (Appendix 1.1),
and solid demand growth in key emerging market
economies.
• Reports from Japan confirm a rapid recovery in
both output and domestic spending. Industrial
production is now growing rapidly, business sentiment is improving sharply, and household spending
is recovering quickly. Although electricity shortages
will likely weigh on production throughout the
summer, and the government’s rebuilding program
could suffer further delays, a V-shaped short-term
rebound seems to be under way.
• Oil prices are back where they were at the dawn of
unrest in the MENA region (Appendix 1.1). They
ended the second quarter at about $105 a barrel,
after peaking at about $120 by the end of April,
helped partly by more supply from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and the release of crude oil and
petroleum stocks from strategic emergency reserves
by International Energy Agency (IEA) members.
The IMF base metal price index declined by about
9 percent from its first-quarter peak in February. However, the decline in food prices has been
much more limited, amounting to about 4 percent,
mainly because food crops are now expected to be
below earlier estimates.
Activity is likely to receive further support from
several sources. The pace of inventory reduction
should slow with the repair of global supply chains
(Figure 1.6, middle-right panel). Investment in
machinery and equipment has been expanding at
a fairly solid pace in both advanced and emerging
market economies (Figure 1.6, bottom-right panel)
and is forecast to continue to do so, helped by
strong corporate profitability and relatively healthy
corporate balance sheets.

but consumption in major advanced economies is
expected to lag behind
Consumption in emerging market economies
has been going strong for some time, propelled by
rapidly expanding employment and incomes. But

chapter 1

consumption in advanced economies is likely to
remain anemic for these key reasons:
• Unemployment is likely to stay high for some
time. Employment may well exhibit more weakness during much of the summer, even if purchasing managers’ index (PMI) survey indicators for
employment have so far shown greater resilience
than those for production (Figure 1.6, top panels). Neither a significant acceleration nor a large
drop in employment seems in the offing.
• Sluggish wages and low funding costs have
boosted corporate profits, but this is not directly
benefiting households with a high propensity to
consume. Concerns about income prospects are
particularly elevated in the United States, where
an extraordinarily large loss of jobs has added to
an ongoing trend decline in the pace of employment creation (see below). Meanwhile, the share
of corporate profits in income has returned to
about 10 percent, which is close to the high
precrisis levels. A similar conclusion about jobs
and incomes emerges from an analysis of sectoral
output and employment (Box 1.1).
• House prices show no signs of stabilizing in key
crisis-hit economies such as the United States and
Spain (Figure 1.7, bottom-left panel). A large overhang of unsold properties with underwater mortgages continues to present a major downside risk to
consumption in the United States. House prices are
rising again in other advanced economies, such as
France and Germany, and remain high in Canada.
However, households everywhere have recently suffered significant losses in stock market wealth.

Financial volatility could hold back activity
As discussed in the September 2011 Global
Financial Stability Report, financial stability risks
have once again increased dramatically. The IMF
staff’s financial conditions indices, which consider
developments in equity and bond prices, spreads,
and bank lending volume in the United States and
the euro area, have tightened noticeably lately (see
Figure 1.3, bottom panel), reflecting mainly lower
stock prices and tighter spreads. How financial
markets will evolve—and how they will affect real
sectors in advanced economies—is still unclear.

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

Figure 1.3. Recent Financial Market Developments
Equity markets have retreated, and volatility has been on the rise. Investors have
taken flight in government bonds of perceived “safe-haven” countries. There were
signs that credit was bottoming until recently. Financial conditions indices have
tightened lately, but projections assume gradual easing.

1 The Growth Tracker is described in Matheson (2011). Within regions, countries are

listed by economic size.
2 Figures are based on the official GDP and consumer price index (CPI) data. The
authorities have committed to improve the quality of Argentina’s official GDP and CPI, so
as to bring them into compliance with their obligations under the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. Until the quality of data reporting has improved, IMF staff will also use
alternative measures of GDP growth and inflation for macroeconomic surveillance,
including estimates by: private analysts which have been, on average, significantly lower
than official GDP growth from 2008 onward, and provincial statistical offices and private
analysts, which have shown inflation considerably higher than the official inflation rate
from 2007 onward.
3 The method gauges inflation pressure relative to historical trends. In Japan, inflation
is higher than recent trends but still very low.

WEO forecasts assume that the latest bout of
volatility will not lead to large increases in saving rates and that it will delay, rather than derail,
the normalization of lending conditions. Spreads
on corporate lending in capital markets and on
emerging market sovereigns are still relatively low.
IMF staff projections assume that banks can do
without a sharp and sustained tightening of lending
conditions, in some cases thanks to liquidity support from central banks. However, weaker growth
prospects pose threats to public and private balance
sheets and significantly increase the challenge of
coping with heavy debt burdens.
Financial conditions remain supportive of
growth in emerging and developing economies,
notwithstanding higher volatility (Figure 1.8). In
most of these economies, bank credit is still going
strong (Figure 1.9, top panels). Search for yield is
spurring capital inflows and magnifying already
ample domestic liquidity. But flows are volatile
(Figure 1.8, bottom panels). WEO forecasts see net
private capital flows to most regions rising further,
assuming policymakers in advanced economies
forestall a cycle of deteriorating sovereign and
financial sector prospects. The effect of strong
growth and tighter monetary conditions in emerging market economies would then outweigh the
effect of more elevated risk aversion among investors. However, as noted in the Global Financial
Stability Report, with global downside risks rising,
emerging markets could also face a sharp reduction
in demand, a reversal in capital flows, and a rise
in funding costs that could impact the financial
soundness of domestic banks.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Monetary policy remains highly accommodative
in many advanced economies (Figure 1.10, top panels), notwithstanding the end of the second round
of quantitative easing (QE2) in the United States
and rate hikes in a number of advanced economies,
including the euro area. The financial turmoil has
already affected monetary policymaking. The central
banks of Japan and Switzerland have recently taken
steps to further ease monetary conditions, amid
rising deflation pressure on account of appreciating

chapter 1

currencies. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it
expects economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low policy rates at least through mid-2013. The
European Central Bank (ECB) has expanded its
liquidity operations and stepped up its Securities
Market Program. More generally, markets have been
pushing out their expectations for rate hikes much
further into the future. Despite monetary tightening by many central banks in emerging market
economies and other measures to slow credit growth,
real interest rates are still low and credit is growing
strongly in a number of these economies (Figure
1.10, bottom panels).

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

Figure 1.5. Global Outlook
(Real GDP; quarterly percent change from one year earlier unless noted
otherwise)
Global growth is forecast to regain some momentum during the second half of 2011.
Real GDP growth in the advanced economies is expected to gradually return to about
2 percent. Activity in emerging and developing economies is expected to decelerate
in the face of capacity constraints and tightening policies, settling at a still high rate
of about 6 percent in 2012. Growth is expected to remain very elevated in emerging
Asia, notably in China and India, followed by sub-Saharan Africa.

but fiscal consolidation will dampen short-term
growth
Fiscal consolidation will weigh increasingly
on activity (Figure 1.11, middle-left panel). In
advanced economies, fiscal policy was neutral in
2010, with loosening in Canada, Germany, Japan,
and the United States broadly offset by tightening
elsewhere. In many economies, there was significant
progress toward fiscal adjustment: policy tightened
further in the first half of 2011, and the pace of
consolidation is now estimated to be appreciably
above earlier estimates. In particular, the structural
fiscal balance of the United States is now expected
to improve by about ½ percent of GDP in 2011,
implying a 1 percentage point of GDP fiscal withdrawal relative to the April 2011 WEO projection.
Fiscal policy will tighten further in 2012, mainly
on account of tightening in the United States, but
also because of sizable consolidation in various euro
area economies. IMF staff analysis suggests that the
switch from fiscal stimulus to consolidation will
dampen short-term activity.3

expansionary forces are expected to offset
contractionary forces
On balance, the evidence points to continued, uneven growth. Relative to the June 2011
WEO Update, the most noteworthy revision is the
reduction in the real GDP growth forecast for the

continued expansion in the near term but at a slower pace than in 2010. The
indicators also suggest that cutbacks in payrolls are not expected. Data on retail
sales and industrial production suggest that inventories have not been rebuilt to a
major extent thus far. Further support from accelerated inventory building could be in
the offing once uncertainty about prospects diminishes again. Private consumption
has been strong in emerging economies and sluggish in advanced economies.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

United States, by 1 percentage point over 2011
and 2012. Other revisions for advanced economies
generally range between ½ and 1 percentage point.
The markdowns to most emerging and developing economies amount to about ½ percentage
point. Growth will remain relatively robust in these
economies because they can counter weaker foreign
demand with less policy tightening. The forecast
for CEE growth in 2011 has been lowered because
of less buoyant (but still strong) growth in Turkey.
In addition, prospects for the MENA region have
been marked down further, by about ¾ percentage
point for 2012.
• Among the advanced economies, real GDP
growth in the United States is projected to pick
up very gradually from about 1 percent in the
second quarter of 2011 to about 2 percent later
in 2012. Special factors that boosted activity in
the euro area (notably in Germany) during the
first quarter have already abated. Moreover, less
foreign demand and tensions from the financial
turmoil will weigh on investment and consumption, keeping real GDP growth at about ¼ percent during the remainder of 2011, before it
rises gradually to about 1 percent during 2012.
This assumes that national and euro area policies remain sufficiently strong to keep financial
turmoil under control. The Japanese economy is
set to expand vigorously during the second half
of 2011 and, to a lesser extent, in the first half
of 2012, as the economy recovers from the earthquake and tsunami.
• Real GDP growth in emerging and developing
economies during the second half of 2011 is
expected to be about 6¼ percent, down from
about 7 percent during the first half of the year.
Emerging Asia is forecast to continue to post
strong growth of about 8 percent, propelled by
China and India. In Latin America, growth is
expected to moderate to 4 percent in 2012, from
about 6 percent in 2010, as external demand
slows and tighter macroeconomic policies begin
to rein in strong domestic demand. With the
rebound in the CEE and CIS regions losing
some vigor in 2012, particularly in Turkey, real
GDP growth in emerging and developing economies is expected to settle at about 6 percent.

chapter 1

economic Slack alongside Signs of
overheating
The continued expansion of the global economy
has come with increasing cyclical diversity. The picture is one of excess capacity in advanced economies
and signs of overheating in emerging and developing economies. However, within each group there is
significant diversity.

despite permanent output losses, output gaps remain
in advanced economies
By the end of the first half of 2011, many economies had returned to close to precrisis output levels
(Figure 1.12, top-left panel). This includes a number
of advanced and emerging economies that were hit
severely by the crisis (for example, CEE and CIS
economies). However, Italy and Spain continue
to lag, and output in Japan was severely disrupted
by the earthquake and tsunami. Other advanced
economies in Asia, in contrast, are already far above
precrisis output levels, as are many other emerging
and developing economies.
Although the recession has ended, many economies continue to operate far below precrisis trends
(Figure 1.12, top-right panel). Output losses relative
to trends are largest for economies that were at the
epicenter of the crisis, such as the United States and
the United Kingdom, as well as for many CEE and
CIS economies, notably Russia. In these economies
output is some 10 percent below precrisis trends.
Losses also persist in economies with very close
economic linkages to crisis-hit economies, such as
Canada and Mexico, which have close trade ties with
the United States.
WEO estimates and forecasts suggest that crisisrelated output losses will be long-lasting, even
though output gaps remain (Figure 1.12, bottom-left
panel).4 For the United States, the gap is estimated
at about 5½ percent of potential GDP in 2011; output is some 10 percent below precrisis trends. With
the exception of Japan, output gaps in other major
advanced economies are much lower, generally ranging between 2 and 3 percent. Incoming data confirm

The accumulation of household debt has been slowing, but there are now signs that
this development is bottoming out. Although household debt is still contracting in
Japan and the United States, the pace is stabilizing or diminishing. Household saving
rates are forecast to move sideways, implying that disposable income growth will
translate fully into consumption growth. Although household wealth has received a
boost from the recovery of financial markets since 2009, house prices continue to
decline in crisis-hit economies.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Underlying inflation pressure remains relatively
elevated in emerging and developing economies
Headline and core inflation have been on the rise
in many parts of the world until recently. The IMF’s
Inflation Tracker confirms that inflation pressure is
still relatively elevated, especially in emerging and
developing economies (Figure 1.4, bottom panel;
and Figure 1.14). In the major advanced economies,
however, headline and core inflation appear to be
losing some momentum. Three factors will determine the path of inflation over the coming year:
• Energy and food prices: These were adding to inflation but have recently receded. Specifically, energy
prices are currently far below their 2011 peaks.
Food prices, which are particularly important for
inflation in emerging and developing economies,
have fallen to a much lesser extent. Forecasts
assume a stabilization of energy and food prices
at present levels. However, prospects are very
uncertain, and previous forecasts based on futures
markets have not proven accurate. Risks for
prices are still tilted toward the upside. Emerging and developing economies are more likely to
experience second-round effects on wages from
past food and energy price hikes, because these
account for a larger share of their consumption
baskets (Chapter 3).
• Output gaps: In general, these are not exceptionally large. Two notable exceptions are Japan and
the United States. However, even in the euro area,
wage growth may well remain subdued for some
time because employment is lagging the expansion of output. Evidence of labor market tightness is clearer for a number of smaller advanced
economies and for many emerging and developing
economies.

chapter 1

• Policy and the credibility of policymakers: Central
bank credibility is well established in advanced
economies but less so in many emerging and
developing economies, and this is likely to
amplify the second-round effects of external
price increases (Chapter 3). In anticipation of
such pressures, many central banks have begun
to raise policy interest rates toward less accommodative levels.
Although headline inflation is projected to
recede as food and energy prices moderate,
underlying inflation pressure may well rise further,
mainly in emerging and developing economies. In
advanced economies, headline inflation is forecast to be about 2½ percent in 2011 but then to
recede to close to 1½ percent in 2012, assuming
that energy and food prices evolve as the markets
expect. In emerging and developing economies,
headline inflation is expected to settle at about
6 percent in 2012, down from over 7½ percent
in 2011, as energy and food prices stabilize but
demand pressures raise core inflation. Inflation is
expected to stay high through 2011–12 in the CIS,
MENA, and SSA regions, averaging 7 to 10 percent. Within the broad trends, some economies
are seeing noticeably higher inflation than are their
regional peers (for example, Argentina, India, Paraguay, Venezuela, and Vietnam).

risks are clearly to the downside
Downside risks to activity have increased noticeably since the June 2011 WEO Update. Four types
of risk deserve particular attention and revolve
around (1) weak sovereigns and banks in a number
of advanced economies, (2) insufficiently strong
policies to address the legacy of the crisis in the
major advanced economies, (3) vulnerabilities in
a number of emerging market economies, and
(4) volatile commodity prices and geopolitical
tensions. Various market indicators confirm the
qualitative assessment that downside risks are now
much higher than in June or April 2011. A downside scenario illustrates how the major advanced
economies could fall back into recession and what
damage this could inflict on emerging and developing economies.

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

Figure 1.9. Emerging Market Economies with Strong
Credit Expansion1
Bank credit growth is high in a number of emerging market economies. In per capita
terms, credit close to doubled in real terms during 2005–10. Credit has also grown
much faster than nominal GDP in a number of economies. On the one hand, this
indicates financial deepening, which is desirable. On the other hand, it raises
concern, because the growth rates are so high that they are likely to come at the
expense of deteriorating credit quality. Furthermore, high credit growth coincides
with rapid increases in real estate prices in many emerging economies. These
conditions are reminiscent of those experienced ahead of previous banking crises.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

The risks concerning weak sovereigns and their
interaction with fragile banking systems and the real
economy are discussed in depth in the September
2011 Global Financial Stability Report. Specifically,
markets remain concerned about the euro area.
With fragile balance sheets and debt sustainability
influenced heavily by expectations, debt markets can
become subject to multiple equilibriums. Vulnerable sovereigns are prone to a sudden loss of investor
confidence in their debt sustainability if fundamentals deteriorate sharply. European banks are heavily
exposed to economies that have recently seen sharply
wider sovereign spreads. In this regard, a concern
is that capitalization of euro area banks is relatively
low, and they rely heavily on wholesale funding,
which is prone to freezing during financial turmoil.
Trouble in a few sovereigns could thus quickly
spread across Europe. From there it could move
to the United States––by way of U.S. institutional
investors’ holdings of European assets––and to the
rest of the world.

Weak policy responses to the crisis
Additional risks surround weak policies in the euro
area, Japan, and the United States. These give rise to
two concerns, including the potential for (1) sudden
investor flight from the public debt of systemically
important economies and (2) brute force fiscal adjustment or loss of confidence because of a perceived lack
of policy room. Under either scenario, major declines
in consumer and business confidence are likely, leading
to sharp increases in saving rates that undercut activity.
Investors could take flight from government debt
of key sovereigns
There are few signs of flight from U.S. or Japanese
sovereign debt thus far, and few substitute investments are available. Although sovereign credit default
swap (CDS) spreads on U.S. debt have moved up
lately and U.S. government debt experienced one
rating downgrade, the impact on long-term interest rates of the end of the Federal Reserve’s QE2 has
been offset by inflows into Treasury securities. Interest
rates on Japan’s public debt remain very low, despite

chapter 1

adverse shocks to the public finances resulting from
the earthquake and tsunami. Nonetheless, without
more ambitious fiscal consolidation, a sudden rise in
government bond yields remains a distinct possibility
as long as public debt ratios are projected to rise over
the medium term. Long-term rates on the debt of
France, Germany, and a few other economies are also
very low. However, this could change if commitments
at the national or euro area level are not met. The
risks could play out in various ways:
• Investors could increasingly reallocate their portfolios
to corporate or emerging market debt: This would
be the least disruptive scenario, because it could spur
demand, although not without potentially raising
problems related to absorptive capacity.
• The term premium could rise as investors turn to
short-term public debt: This would make the global
economy more susceptible to funding shocks.
• Rates could move higher across the yield curve,
with depreciation of the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen (mild credit risk): This might materialize in the context of a broader sovereign rating
downgrade that does not upset the status of the
United States as the major provider of low-risk
assets or an accelerated reduction in the home bias
of Japanese investors.
• A strong increase in credit risk could quickly
morph into a liquidity shock, as global investors
take flight into precious metals and cash: This
could occur if there were major political deadlock
on how to move forward with consolidation in the
United States or if the euro area crisis were to take
a dramatic turn for the worse. The global repercussions of such shocks would likely be very severe.

Figure 1.11. General Government Fiscal Balances and
Public Debt
(Percent of GDP unless noted otherwise)
Public deficits and debt rose sharply during the crisis, especially in advanced
economies. Major adjustment is required, especially in Japan and the United States,
to bring debt back down to prudent levels. Fiscal policy will turn increasingly
contractionary in the advanced economies during 2012–13. Because of the low share
of permanent consolidation measures in the United States relative to other countries,
fiscal policy will do little to alleviate global current account imbalances. However,
differences in fiscal policy stances will help reduce imbalances within the euro area.

In the systemically important advanced economies, activity and confidence are still fragile, and a
sudden increase in household saving rates remains
a distinct possibility. If fiscal consolidation were
suddenly stepped up further at the expense of the
disposable income of people with a high marginal
propensity to consume, these economies could be
thrown back into stagnation. For example, if (contrary to WEO assumptions) payroll tax relief and

Output in major advanced economies has returned close to or above precrisis levels, with some notable exceptions. In emerging and developing economies, it is already well
above precrisis levels, except in the CEE and CIS economies, which were hit hard by the financial crisis. Output in most advanced and CEE and CIS economies is still well below
precrisis trends. However, much of the loss relative to trends is not expected to be recovered over the medium term. Accordingly, output gaps are generally much lower than
losses relative to precrisis trends would suggest. Consistent with a view of generally limited output gaps, unemployment rates in most of the world are not much higher than
precrisis averages—notable exceptions include the United States and the United Kingdom, which were at the epicenter of the crisis.

not prolonged, U.S. growth could be significantly
lower. By the same token, if sound medium-term
consolidation plans are not implemented, households and businesses may take an increasingly dim
view of future prospects and drastically raise their
saving rates. The result could be a lost decade for
growth. Concerns among U.S. households about

14

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

future income prospects could be a symptom
of such risks. Also, the September 2011 Global
Financial Stability Report relates the latest bout of
financial volatility to concerns in markets about
policymakers’ ability to rally support for strengthening public and banking sector balance sheets and
growth-enhancing reforms. Moreover, as discussed
in the September 2011 Fiscal Monitor, even with

chapter 1

the plans currently in place, most major advanced
economies will not achieve a large reduction in
public debt over the medium term, which severely
limits the ability of fiscal policy to stabilize output
and employment in the future.

Vulnerabilities in emerging market economies
Overheating risks have become more differentiated since the April 2011 World Economic Outlook.
These risks relate mainly to rapid credit growth
and financial vulnerabilities. In a few cases, external vulnerabilities have begun to move into the
foreground.
High credit and asset price growth could
undermine financial stability
A number of major emerging and developing
economies, and advanced economies with very
close ties to them, continue to see buoyant credit
and asset price growth (see Figure 1.9). Credit
growth has been high in Brazil, Colombia, Hong
Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Peru, and Turkey. In
China, however, real credit growth has continued
to recede, to about 10 percent at an annual rate:
housing market transactions and prices have fallen
from exceptionally high levels, although construction is still going strong. Prices keep climbing
rapidly in Hong Kong SAR and continue to rise
in Brazil and Singapore. In India and Indonesia,
by contrast, house price increases have been more
contained, because credit is flowing mainly into
infrastructure and industry. Financial stability risks
in all these economies must be monitored for some
time, given the sheer volume of credit growth over
the past five years (see Figure 1.9, middle and bottom panels).
External vulnerabilities could cause an abrupt
slowdown of capital inflows
So far, buoyant credit and asset price growth in
emerging and developing economies has not led
to a sharp acceleration in domestic demand or a
precarious widening of current account imbalances.

Figure 1.13. Global Projection Model Estimates of the
Output Gap
The recent financial crisis had a significant impact on the productive capacity of the
economies at the epicenter: the United States and the euro area. Estimates of this
unobservable variable are critical for policymakers, indicating the degree of economic
slack and hence the appropriate policy stance. The top panels show the latest
estimates of the output gap from the GPM1 multivariate technique relative to those of
the Congressional Budget Office, the European Commission, and the April 2011
World Economic Outlook (WEO), which also considers judgmental factors. New data
and revisions to historical data have contributed to revisions in our estimate of the
U.S. output gap. Revisions to historical GDP data have led to an increase in the
estimate of excess supply at the trough of the recession. New data on inflation and
capacity utilization have led to a reduction in the estimate of excess supply at the end
of 2011:Q2 compared with our forecast of a year ago. For the euro area, faster than
previously forecast growth is the primary source of the revision to our estimate of the
amount of excess supply at the end of 2011:Q2.

Figure 1.14. Global Inflation
(Twelve-month change in the consumer price index unless noted
otherwise)
Inflation has been moving up, reflecting the sharp recovery of commodity prices and
emerging capacity constraints. However, core inflation remains low in the major
advanced economies. In emerging market economies, by contrast, it has risen
significantly but now shows signs of moderating. With commodity prices forecast to
stabilize or retreat, headline inflation can be expected to decline. In emerging market
economies, underlying inflation pressure is likely to continue to stay relatively
elevated because of strong activity and relatively low unemploy ment.

tal inflows (Box 1.2). A key reason for the limited
increase in current account deficits is the recovery
in commodity prices. In fact, the current account
surpluses of emerging and developing economies
have been rising during the recovery, from 1½
percent of GDP in 2009 to 2½ percent in 2011.
Energy-exporting MENA economies account for
the bulk of this widening, followed by CIS economies, with SSA economies contributing to a small
extent. By contrast, the Latin American economies
have seen a widening of deficits, from ½ percent to
1½ percent of GDP. Against the backdrop of large
terms-of-trade gains over this period, this development testifies to strong domestic demand pressures. The deficits are too low to present immediate
stability concerns, but they could rapidly escalate if
commodity prices fall significantly, potentially raising the threat of sudden stops. CEE economies also
have seen some widening of their current account
deficits as the sudden stop of capital inflows has
gradually let up, which is a welcome development.
However, in Turkey the deficit has reached disconcerting levels, and its funding is mostly short term.

Supply shocks in commodity markets could dent
household real incomes
With tight demand-supply balances, commodity markets continue to present significant sources
of downside risk to global activity. Disruptions to
the global oil supply could seriously affect activity
in advanced economies by cutting into the already
sluggish real growth of household incomes. Rising
food prices would do the same, with particularly
deleterious consequences for developing economies.
On both fronts, however, pressures have eased lately
because prices have moderated.
Various quantitative indicators paint a deteriorating picture of risks (Figure 1.15). The Chicago
Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index
(VIX) has recently reached very high levels again.
Over the past year, the risk of a serious global
slowdown––that is, global growth falling below 2
percent—was less than 5 percent, according to the
IMF staff’s fan chart. But now, according to the IMF
staff’s usual methodology, the probability of growth
below 2 percent is substantially higher—more than

chapter 1

10 percent. Regarding the four risk factors underlying the fan chart computed with the usual methodology, three point to downside risks for growth and
one points to upside risks for 2012 (Figure 1.15,
middle panel):
• Term spread: There is now a significant risk
that the yield curve flattens in 2012, indicating
downside risks to growth. For 2011, the risks are
roughly balanced, as they were in the April 2011
World Economic Outlook.5
• Oil market: Oil-related risks through 2012 remain
to the upside for prices and thus to the downside
for global growth, as in April.
• Inflation: Following significant upward revisions in
inflation forecasts for 2011, inflation risks for the
year are modestly to the downside, implying modest upside risks for growth. For 2012, there is now
a downside risk to growth from higher inflation,
unlike in April 2011,6 possibly reflecting downward
revisions to inflation forecasts.
• S&P 500: This risk factor still points to the
upside for output for both 2011 and 2012.

Figure 1.15. Risks to the Global Outlook
Risks to the outlook remain large, and downside risks dominate upside risks. The
probability of global growth below 2 percent is appreciably higher than in the April
2011 World Economic Outlook (WEO).
Prospects for World GDP Growth1
(percent change)

5In

this framework, a steepening yield curve is associated with
higher growth prospects. Generally, the term spread captures the
spread between long-term and short-term interest rates and is
interpreted as reflecting growth prospects. It can also reflect sovereign default risks. The results are based on the simple average of
Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For
further details on the construction of the fan chart, see Elekdag
and Kannan (2009).
6An upside surprise in inflation would warrant higher interest
rates and thus would entail lower growth. The results are based on
market forecasts for inflation in the G7 economies as well as in
Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Russia.

A downside scenario shows the repercussions of
major financial turbulence in the euro area, combined with a downscaling of expectations for U.S.
medium-term growth prospects and real-estate-related
financial stress in emerging Asia (Figure 1.16). This
scenario assumes that euro area banks need to suddenly absorb mark-to-market losses to such an extent
that their bank capital falls by 10 percent, and that
this triggers a new round of deleveraging. At the same
time, markets revise medium-term growth prospects
for the United States downward, while Asia experiences an increase in real-estate-lending-related losses.

Figure 1.16. WEO Downside Scenario
(Deviation from control; years on x-axis)
This downside scenario uses a six-region version of the Global Economy Model (GEM) calibrated to represent the United States, Japan, the euro area, emerging Asia,
Latin America, and the rest of the world. The scenario features shocks arising in three regions: the euro area, the United States, and emerging Asia. In the euro area, the
shock is to bank capital, reflecting primarily recognition of losses on holdings of public debt but also of other losses on loans arising from the macroeconomic fallout. In
the United States, the shock has two components. The first is slower potential output growth and the second is the resulting increase in loan losses (e.g., on the
mortgage portfolio). The shock in emerging Asia is loan losses, reflecting poor lending decisions in the past. Furthermore, corporate risk premiums in emerging Asia,
Japan, and Latin America are assumed to be correlated with the rise in risk premiums in the euro area and the United States, in a manner broadly consistent with what
was observed during the collapse of Lehman Brothers. As a result of the large shock to global output, especially in the euro area and the United States, commodity prices
plummet, dragging down activity in commodity exporters. The accompanying charts trace out the implications for GDP, firm net worth (in both the tradables and
nontradables sectors), the effective interest rate faced by firms in the various regions, and commodity prices.

chapter 1

Under such a scenario, global risk aversion would rise
sharply, and funding rates for banks and nonfinancial corporations would shoot up to varying degrees.
Emerging market economies would suffer from
slumping commodity prices and a sudden reversal in
capital flows. Given the limited room for monetary
and fiscal policy in advanced economies to respond
vigorously, a serious global slowdown would ensue,
which would undo much of the progress since the
end of the Great Recession. The United States and
the euro area would fall back into recession, with
output in 2012 more than 3 percent below WEO
projections. Output in Japan would be some 1½
percent below the WEO projection; in emerging Asia
it would be 2½ percent lower. Latin America would
suffer higher risk premiums and lower commodity prices, which would drag output down almost 1
percent relative to the baseline.
Separately, in the advanced economies of the G7,
recent falls in equity prices also point to a deterioration in growth prospects. As shown in Box 1.3,
there is some evidence that drops in equity prices are
associated with a greater chance of a new recession in
a number of economies. Specifically, using the behavior of equity prices over the past quarter, a simple
probabilistic model for these economies predicts
an increased risk of a new recession from the third
quarter of 2011 for the United States, and to a lesser
extent for France and the United Kingdom.

policy challenges
With increasingly diverse cyclical and financial conditions, national policy requirements have increasingly
diverged. In qualitative terms, requirements remain
similar to those in recent issues of the World Economic Outlook. But on key fronts the difficulties are
now greater, and even where there has been a policy
response more needs to be done. This is perhaps most
urgent in the euro area. In the meantime, global
demand rebalancing, commodity markets, and financial system reform pose multilateral challenges.
Addressing the crisis in the euro area
The crisis in the euro area continues to deepen.
The measures approved at the July 21, 2011, EU
summit represent significant progress, but further

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

efforts are urgently needed. Once implemented,
the measures imply that funding under the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) can also pay
for debt buybacks or bank recapitalization, can be
used on a precautionary basis, and will have much
longer maturities and lower interest rates. There are
three remaining challenges. The first is to quickly
adopt the summit’s decisions at the national level
while sending a clear signal that euro area members
will continue to do whatever it takes to preserve
confidence in the euro. In the meantime, the ECB
will need to continue to intervene forcefully (with
suitable sovereign safeguards) to support orderly
markets in sovereign debt. The second challenge
involves advancing programs with economies in the
periphery that strike the right balance between fiscal
consolidation and structural reform on the one hand
and external support on the other. The third challenge is to promptly finalize EU governance reforms.
These probably will have to be strengthened over the
medium term to ensure that the shared responsibility of all EU members for national macroeconomic
policies is commensurate with increased risk sharing.

national perspectives on policy challenges
releasing the brakes on lagging economies
In many advanced economies, the priority
remains fixing the financial system and, over the
medium term, greatly reducing high public deficits. Repairing financial systems by strengthening
incentives to build capital, including through public
intervention, is essential to reestablishing trust and
facilitating better pass-through of easy monetary
conditions to economic activity—thereby unlocking a key brake on growth. In addition, a number
of economies must deploy structural reforms that
improve their macroeconomic performance. Such
reforms may not boost growth in the short term,
but they can help build confidence and improve
medium-term prospects.
Continued monetary accommodation
Monetary policy can remain accommodative in
many advanced economies. Given increasing risks
to U.S. growth, the Federal Reserve should stand
ready to deploy new unconventional support for
International Monetary Fund | September 2011

19

world economic outlook: Slowing growth, riSing riSkS

the economy, provided inflation expectations stay
subdued. Given declining inflation pressure and
heightened financial and sovereign tensions, the
ECB should lower its policy rate if downside risks to
growth and inflation persist. Unconventional policies
should continue until there is a durable reduction in
financial stress, including resolution of the sovereign
debt crisis. In Japan, rates can stay at their present
levels, and unconventional policy support in the
form of private asset purchases could be stepped up
further to help accelerate the exit from deflation.
Many other advanced economies have tightened to
greater degrees already, because they are experiencing
higher inflation pressure. They may have to do more
but can stay on hold as long as downside risks are
unusually high.
Strong fiscal consolidation and reform
Given still tepid activity in many advanced
economies, immediate cutbacks to spending and tax
increases should ideally be small while strong entitlement and tax reforms are being implemented that
cut future deficits. Because major progress in cutting
future spending has proved hard to achieve, however,
postponing near-term consolidation is not an option
in most advanced economies. But economies with
relatively strong public balance sheets and strong
medium-term plans could slow the pace of nearterm adjustment if downside risks threaten to materialize. In crisis economies, gradual adjustment is not
in the cards. Similarly, in economies that investors
perceive to be vulnerable, it seems appropriate to err
on the side of consolidation. In all economies, stronger fiscal rules and institutions can help rebuild credibility. The specific recommendations are discussed
in the September 2011 Fiscal Monitor.
The key fiscal priority for major advanced economies—especially the United States and Japan—is
to implement credible and well-paced mediumterm consolidation programs focused on long-term
debt sustainability. Addressing this is of paramount importance to regain room for more policy
maneuvering.
• For the United States, the main priority is to soon
launch a medium-term deficit reduction plan—
including entitlement reform and tax reforms that
gradually raise revenues—so as to stabilize the
20

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

debt ratio by mid-decade and gradually reduces it
thereafter under realistic macroeconomic assumptions. This would allow for a short-term fiscal
policy stance that is more attuned to the cycle—
for example, through the adoption of measures
targeted to labor and housing markets, state and
local governments, and infrastructure spending. In
this respect, the American Jobs Act would provide
needed short-term support to the economy, but it
must be flanked with a strong medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan that raises revenues and contains
the growth of entitlement spending. With a less
ambitious medium-term fiscal strategy in place, fiscal consolidation should start in 2012, but its pace
should reflect the need to sustain a weak recovery,
and it should include the extension of unemployment insurance and payroll tax relief, with a fiscal
withdrawal of 1 to 1½ percent of GDP.
• Similarly, for Japan a more ambitious fiscal strategy is needed––equivalent to a front-loaded 10
percent of GDP fiscal adjustment over 10 years––
that brings the public debt ratio down decisively
by the middle of the decade. Given the limited
scope for cutting expenditures, fiscal adjustment will have to rely mainly on new revenue
sources, limits on spending growth, and entitlement reform. Specifically, the strategy should be
centered on a gradual increase in the consumption
tax to 15 percent.
• The major euro area economies have made good
progress in adopting and implementing strong
medium-term consolidation plans. They are committed to reducing deficits to below 3 percent
of GDP by 2013 and to stabilizing the level of
public debt by 2015. Based on WEO macroeconomic projections, Spain still needs to identify
new measures to achieve its objectives. France
may have to do the same from 2013 onward,
given the announcement in August of additional
deficit-reduction measures for 2011–12. Italy has
recently greatly strengthened its medium-term fiscal
plan and is now expected to come fairly close to a
structurally balanced budget in 2013. Adjustment
in Germany during 2011–16 (at about ½ percent
a year) is appropriately lower than elsewhere in the
euro area––on present plans, the general government would be close to balance in 2014.

chapter 1

• Importantly, in all these economies adjustment
will need to continue for some time, with a view
to reaching surpluses that help bring down high
public debt ahead of accelerated population aging.
This will also be necessary to provide sufficient
fiscal policy room to support balance sheet repair
and growth and job creation.
More financial repair
As discussed in the September 2011 Global Financial Stability Report, financial repair is essential along
two dimensions: injecting new capital and restructuring weak but viable banks while closing others, and
repairing wholesale funding markets. Progress along
both fronts has been slow, especially in Europe. In
general, European banks tend to be less strongly
capitalized and more reliant on wholesale funding
than are their peers elsewhere. The stress in sovereign
and interbank markets underscores the urgent need to
address weakly capitalized banks. Symptoms of their
difficulties include falling deposits or “deposit wars,”
in which banks aggressively bid up deposit rates;
exclusion from wholesale markets; heavy reliance on
ECB funding; and sluggish credit growth and tight
lending conditions. Prudential authorities now need
to foster private injections of capital in banks (as was
done for some Spanish cajas) and promote consolidation and cross-border investment (as recently seen in
Ireland). Absent these measures, they must make the
case either for injecting public funds into weak banks
or for closing them. They will need to ensure that
these banks do not “gamble for resurrection” by offering very high deposit rates or engaging in very risky
lending. Given prevailing balance sheet uncertainties,
capital requirements should be set ambitiously high
and be met well ahead of the Basel III timetable.
Facilitating gradual adjustment in housing
markets
In the United States, the large number of underwater mortgages poses a risk for a downward spiral
of falling house prices and distress sales that further
undermines consumption and labor mobility. The
challenge for policymakers is to facilitate gradual
adjustment. Administrative complexity, capacity constraints, and conflicting incentives among banks, loan
servicers, and bond investors have thus far hindered

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

potentially efficient loan modifications that would
forestall at least some costly foreclosures. Taken
together, these factors can provide justification for
further policy action to mitigate distress sales, such as
allowing mortgages to be modified in courts, expanding state programs that assist unemployed homeowners, and encouraging government-sponsored
enterprises to participate in principal write-downs.

putting the brakes on overheating economies
Since the April 2011 World Economic Outlook,
many emerging and developing economies have
implemented policy rate hikes or other measures to
reduce credit growth. With a few exceptions, the
overheating signals are mainly flashing yellow rather
than red (Figure 1.17). Vulnerabilities related to
strong credit expansion and, in some cases, buoyant
domestic demand are still a concern.
• In economies with large capital inflows and appreciated exchange rates, such as in Latin America,
fiscal tightening is urgently needed to roll back
deficits that expanded during the crisis and to
alleviate the burden of adjustment on monetary
policy. Such tightening appears less warranted,
however, in the emerging Asian economies with
large external surpluses and relatively low fiscal
deficits. In these economies, more exchange rate
appreciation could help contain inflation pressure,
while fiscal consolidation could be slowed with a
view to supporting domestic consumption, should
downside risks threaten to materialize.
• Regarding monetary policy, real interest rates
remain low relative to precrisis levels in a number
of economies, and more monetary tightening will
be needed under WEO projections. However,
requirements vary across countries, and some can
afford to pause their rate hike cycle for as long as
uncertainty remains exceptionally high.
More monetary tightening
The IMF staff’s Global Projection Model (GPM)
points to a need for rate increases of zero to 2 percentage points on average in Latin America and
emerging Asia (Figure 1.18, top-left panel). However, requirements vary appreciably across countries. Simple Taylor rules, which are based on IMF

Figure 1.17. Overheating Indicators for the G20 Economies1
Among G20 economies, a number of emerging market economies are seeing buoyant activity, low unemployment, and relatively high inflation in comparison with precrisis norms.
Output gap estimates of IMF country desks paint a more reassuring picture than the other indicators of internal balance. Indicators of external balance send mixed signals: terms of
trade are very favorable for some emerging market economies, limiting the deterioration of current account balances in response to strong domestic demand. In others, domestic
demand is not running far ahead of output. In a few, current account deficits have reached historically high levels. Indicators of financial developments raise concerns mainly due to
high credit growth.

1For each indicator, except as noted below, economies are assigned colors based on current predicted 2011 values relative to th eir precrisis (1997–2006) average. Blue indicates less than 0.5
standard deviation above the 1997–2006 average; yellow indicates greater than or equal to 0.5 but less than 1.5 standard deviations above the 1997–2006 average; red indicates greater than or equal
to 1.5 standard deviations above the 1997–2006 average. Each indicator is scored as red = 2, yellow = 1, and blue = 0; summary scores are calculated as the sum of selected component scores
divided by the maximum possible sum of those scores. Summary colors are assigned red if the summary score is greater than or equal to 0.66, yellow if greater than or equal to 0.33 but less than
0.66, and blue if less than 0.33.
2Output more than 2.5 percent above the precrisis trend is indicated by red. Output less than 2.5 percent below the trend is in dicated by blue.
3For the following inflation-targeting countries, the target inflation rate was used instead of the 1997–2006 average in the calculation of the inflation indicator: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia,
Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom. For the non-inflation-targeting countries, red is assigned if inflation is approximately 10 percent or higher, yellow if inflation is approximately 5 to
9 percent, and blue if inflation is less than 5 percent.
4The indicators for credit growth, house price growth, and share price growth are calculated relative to the 1997–2006 average of output growth.
5Arrows in the fiscal balance column represent the forecast change in the structural balance as a percent of GDP over the period 2010–11. An increase of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is indicated
by an up arrow; a decrease of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is indicated by a down arrow.
6Real policy interest rates below zero are identified by a down arrow; real interest rates above 3 percent are identified by an up arrow.

staff forecasts for inflation in 2013 and output gap
estimates for 2011, suggest that a few G20 economies would require larger rate hikes than suggested
by GPM estimates (for example, Argentina, India,
Russia); others need to tighten less or can afford to
postpone further moves, given growing uncertainty.7
However, even in economies in which interest rates
are already relatively high, the monetary authorities
will need to be vigilant.
• In emerging and developing economies where the
credibility of monetary policy is less well established, high headline inflation could fuel greater
than expected wage inflation. In fact, simple Taylor rules that use current headline inflation recommend more tightening than those that use IMF
staff forecasts for inflation. Risks for commodity
prices are tilted to the upside, and commodity
price inflation may well be more persistent than
expected. Thus, inflation forecasts for 2013 are
subject to upside risk.
• Output gap estimates are notoriously unreliable,
whether for advanced or for emerging and developing economies. They frequently overestimate
the extent of slack following periods of strong
growth, such as many emerging and developing economies have recently enjoyed. Replacing
IMF staff output gap estimates with deviations of
output from precrisis (1996–2006) trends reveals
a need for much greater tightening, according to
Taylor rules.8
• In a number of emerging and developing economies, credit growth and asset prices are still very
buoyant. Related financial stability risks are best
addressed with prudential measures. However, if
such measures do not prove effective, monetary
policy may need to be tighter than warranted
from the perspective of inflation.

Figure 1.18. Policy Requirements in Emerging
Market Economies
Estimates obtained from the Global Projection Model (GPM) point to the need for
further policy rate hikes in Latin America and emerging Asia. The GPM estimates
assume that a number of emerging market economies in Asia also adopt other
measures to tighten monetary conditions, such as controls on credit growth.
Requirements differ across economies. Simple Taylor rules point to a need for major
tightening in Argentina, India, Russia, and Turkey. In other economies, much less
tightening may be needed or tightening can pause while uncertainty stays high.
Also, in most economies structural fiscal balances should be brought back
up to levels prevailing before the crisis.

the quantitative indications of these simple rules
should not be taken literally because they cannot do justice to
country-specific factors, such as different objectives for inflation.
8 Three notable exceptions are Mexico, Russia, and Turkey.
However, Mexico and Russia are considered to have suffered some
permanent output losses relative to trends: Mexico on account of
close trade relations with the United States and Russia on account
of financial turmoil. Precrisis output trends in Turkey were generally not sustainable.

Figure 1.19. External Developments

More fiscal tightening

(Index, 2000 = 100; three-month moving average unless noted otherwise)

As discussed in more detail in the September
2011 Fiscal Monitor, public deficits must be rolled
back to rebuild fiscal policy room and—in some
cases—alleviate strong domestic demand pressure. Fiscal balances in emerging and developing
economies are still some 2 percent of GDP below
precrisis levels and are projected to stay there over
the medium term (see Figure 1.11, top-left panel;
Figure 1.18, bottom panel). Among G20 economies, the structural deficit is very large in India and
appreciable in South Africa. Rolling back deficits
in these economies and elsewhere (for example,
Brazil, Poland, Turkey) is a major priority not only
for alleviating upward pressure on inflation or the
real exchange rate (and thus the burden on monetary policy) but also for rebuilding room for fiscal
policy maneuvering. The experience of advanced
economies shows how much policy room may be
needed in the event the credit cycle suddenly turns.
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, deficits and debt are
less of a concern. In China, higher public spending has helped rebalance the economy toward more
internal demand, and more can be done if downside
risks materialize. Deficits and debt are high in many
MENA economies. Although spending has been
increased to address pressing social concerns, notably
those raised by high food prices, ultimately the needs
must be met by broadening the tax base or cutting
back on low-priority expenditures.

Real effective exchange rates of major economies and regions have not moved much
over the past six months; global current account imbalances appear to be widening
again; and the buildup of international reserves continues unabated. However, some
currencies are experiencing more pressure than others.

adjusting real effective exchange rates
Exchange rate misalignment relative to mediumterm fundamentals persists, with little change over
the past six months (Figure 1.19; Figure 1.20,
middle-right panel). Also, reserves accumulation by
emerging market economies has continued unabated
(Figure 1.19, bottom-right panel).
• The euro and yen have appreciated somewhat in
real effective terms since the April 2011 World
Economic Outlook, but remain broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals. The Japanese authorities recently decided to intervene in the currency
market to address excessive fluctuations and
disorderly movements in the market. The Swiss

chapter 1

authorities have adopted a minimum exchange
rate target in response to strong appreciation pressures given its “safe haven” status. The U.S. dollar
has weakened in recent months but still remains
on the strong side of fundamentals; some further
depreciation would contribute to global rebalancing and support the recovery.
• There has been no significant change for the
various currencies of Asian economies with large
external surpluses (for example, China), and they
have continued to build up their foreign currency
reserves. The renminbi still appears substantially
undervalued. China’s current account surplus is
set to expand again. For Brazil and South Africa,
the extent of overvaluation has remained broadly
unchanged.
In various economies, domestic and external
policy requirements point in the same direction.
Further appreciation in the emerging surplus economies of Asia would help bring down both inflation and large current account surpluses. In other
emerging market economies, however, monetary
policy tightening could exacerbate overvaluation
pressure. Economies with high fiscal and external
deficits should alleviate domestic demand pressure
by tightening fiscal policy. Whether this will significantly lower the pressure for their exchange rates to
appreciate is unclear, but at least it will help create
more room for fiscal policy to mitigate the repercussions of a sudden drop in capital inflows. Some have
introduced measures designed specifically to manage
capital inflows, such as taxes on certain inflows, minimum holding periods, and currency-specific reserve
requirements. Recourse to such measures has been
motivated by concerns about export competitiveness,
financial stability, sterilization costs, and political
constraints on fiscal policy. However, such measures
should not be used as substitutes for macroeconomic
tightening.

Implementing macrocritical structural reforms
Many economies are facing structural and social
challenges. Crisis-hit economies need to reallocate
labor away from construction and other struggling sectors. At the same time, they face declining

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

Figure 1.20. Global Imbalances
Emerging Asia is forecast to account for a rising proportion of global current account
imbalances over the medium term, reflecting mainly a large increase in the surplus of
China. Relative to precrisis levels, emerging market currencies have appreciated, and
this seems appropriate, given their relatively better growth prospects. However, the
appreciation has been distributed unevenly, worsening imbalances across emerging
market economies. The real effective exchange rates of the yen and the euro remain
broadly in line with fundamentals; the U.S. dollar is on the strong side of fundamentals; while Asian currencies (besides the yen) are undervalued (reflecting mainly the
currencies of China and Korea).

Figure 1.21. Employment and Unemployment
The United States and the euro area face major employment challenges, but they
differ appreciably. In the United States, the loss of jobs relative to long-term trends
has been unprecedented and has also been much larger than in the euro area.
Furthermore, it has added to a trend break in the employment-population ratio that
seems to have occurred during the decade before the crisis. By contrast, that ratio
was on the rise in the euro area during the same period. As a result, families’ income
expectations have hit an unprecedented low in the United States, unlike in the euro
area. Labor market challenges loom large not only in the advanced economies but
also in a number of emerging and developing economies, notably in the Middle East,
North Africa, and the CEE and CIS.

population growth or labor force participation rates,
which exacerbates their fiscal problems.
• In the euro area periphery, reforms should reduce
the growing gap between protected and unprotected workers, while improving employment
prospects for the young, including through better
education and vocational training. In addition,
reforms should seek to eliminate wage-setting rigidity, which has caused sustained losses in competitiveness in the face of low productivity growth.
More generally, the integration of euro area labor,
goods, and services markets must continue, and
obstacles to the free flow of equity capital must be
eliminated. Progress on these fronts would facilitate
financial restructuring and the transfer of skills
and technology. This, in turn, would help raise
productivity.
• In the United States, exceptionally high job losses
during the crisis overlay lackluster employment
generation during the previous decade. This left
many households much more worried about future
income prospects than during previous periods
with similarly high unemployment rates (Figure
1.21). Persistently high unemployment (with more
than 40 percent of the unemployed out of work for
six months or more) may result in a permanent loss
of work skills. Active labor market policies could
help stem the rise in such structural unemployment, as could measures to expedite the adjustment in housing markets, given that weak housing
market conditions can interact negatively with skill
mismatches to raise unemployment. In many ways,
however, the problem is so large that it warrants a
sea change in macroeconomic policy: major entitlement and tax reform with a view to allowing less
fiscal policy tightening.
• In many emerging and developing economies, rising food and commodity prices have exacerbated
social problems posed by underemployment or
high unemployment, especially among the young.
Social safety nets need to be strengthened, and
access to education and its quality need to be
improved. In other economies, regulatory reforms
would help ensure that capital inflows are used
for productive, as opposed to speculative, investments. In China, a strengthened social safety net
and a reorientation of the financial sector in favor

chapter 1

of households would provide much-needed support to global demand rebalancing.

Multilateral perspectives on policy challenges
Food and oil prices and policy spillovers
Food prices have risen for both temporary and more
lasting reasons. Among the temporary reasons, which
have begun to unwind with the new crop season, are
poor harvests due to bad weather and low inventories.
Among the more lasting reasons are high fossil fuel
prices, which are driving up fertilizer costs. Over the
medium term, high food prices can be expected to
significantly increase agricultural output. Regarding oil,
medium-term prospects appear more problematic. On
the one hand, supply growth is expected to moderate to an annual pace of 1.3 percent during 2011–15,
down from 1.8 percent during 1981–2005, according
to IEA estimates. This is due to drag from maturing
fields and a long period of reduced exploration.9 On
the other hand, at current prices and based on WEO
growth forecasts, demand might expand at an annual
pace anywhere between 1.3 and 3.0 percent, depending on whether estimates for short-term or long-term
elasticity are used.10 The extent to which futures prices
reflect this is unclear. Tensions in oil markets are thus
likely to remain elevated, notwithstanding the return
of Libyan output. Over the medium term, more rapid
than expected expansion of production in Iraq appears
to be the only major downside factor for the price of
oil, aside from lower global growth. Over the long
term, other downside factors could come into play,
such as technological innovation that reduces the production costs of alternative sources of energy or lowers
energy consumption.
The current high and volatile level of commodity
prices raises the risk of problems for global macroeconomic conditions, income inequality, and food security. Regarding the latter, direct interventions aimed at
limiting price fluctuations, such as curbs on financial
9See

Chapter 3 of the April 2011 World Economic Outlook
for further details. Reduced exploration reflected relatively low
demand during the 1990s—when the CEE and CIS economies
collapsed and emerging Asia faced a major financial crisis—and
restrictions on oil investment.
10See Chapter 3 of the April 2011 World Economic Outlook for

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

investment or trade restrictions, may be tempting, but
such measures address symptoms rather than causes
and are often ineffective if not harmful in the longer
term. Instead, policymakers should focus on protecting the poor through targeted social safety nets. Over
time, measures to strengthen the effectiveness of price
signals and to enhance price discovery may result
in more stable markets. In this regard, initiatives to
improve the gathering of information on food and
fuel markets need to be carried forward.
The influence of financial factors on commodity prices has come under close scrutiny. Low policy
rates in advanced economies and a search for yield are
seen in some quarters as having spurred large inflows
into commodity derivative assets, raising concern
about speculatively driven commodity price misalignments—that is, prices that are out of line with supply
and demand fundamentals. The empirical evidence to
date, however, points to limited, and mostly temporary,
effects of “financialization” (Box 1.4). In particular,
the main effects have not been on commodity price
levels, or volatility, but rather on the pricing of risk in
commodity markets. With the emergence of commodities as an asset class, markets increasingly price only
systemic, rather than idiosyncratic, risks for individual
commodities. Matters may change if this new asset
class attracts a large proportion of uninformed traders,
but any resulting problems would have to be addressed
as part of the broader initiatives under way to improve
investor education and protection.
Contrary to some claims, basing monetary policy
on commodity prices would likely worsen, not
improve, economic stability. As Chapter 3 explains,
narrowly targeting headline inflation is likely to lead
to policy errors, precisely because headline inflation is subject to some of the volatility in commodity prices. Instead, central banks should follow
policy frameworks that seek to stabilize the rates of
consumer price increases over the medium term,
with due allowance for the lagged effect of monetary
policy. This does not necessarily entail moving from
targeting headline inflation to core (or, more precisely, value-added) inflation. Although clearly desirable on the basis of principle and simplicity, such
a move could raise significant technical and communication challenges. Instead, central banks should
explain clearly what economic agents should expect
International Monetary Fund | September 2011

27

world economic outlook: Slowing growth, riSing riSkS

(for example, stabilization of domestic inflation
over a horizon of a couple of years) and what they
should not expect (for example, monetary policy
that responds directly to commodity price changes).
Central banks should spell out the path of headline
inflation to the desired rate over the forecasting
horizon. If central banks are concerned that such a
policy would raise inflation to unacceptable levels
for their constituencies, they can offset the effect of
long-term trends in the relative price of oil on the
headline inflation rate by adjusting the operational
targets for core inflation. If their constituents place
a very high value on stabilizing fuel or food prices,
central banks need to explain that this would come
at the expense of more instability in output and
employment.

Spillovers from low policy rates in advanced
economies
The issue of distortions flowing from low interest rates in advanced economies is complex. Low
interest rates can foster more risk taking, postpone
needed balance sheet adjustment, and delay fiscal
consolidation. In times of recession and financial
turbulence, these distortions are welcome because
they facilitate gradual adjustment. However, as economic expansion takes hold, policy efforts need to
focus increasingly on raising capital buffers and fiscal
consolidation. On both fronts, progress has been
lacking to varying degrees across the major advanced
economies. Although it is difficult to state with confidence, policy rates in these economies may therefore be lower than necessary because of the absence
of strong bank capital or fiscal consolidation that
strikes a good balance between near- and long-term
consolidation (for example, by emphasizing major
entitlement reforms). In addition, as discussed in the
September 2011 Global Financial Stability Report,
investors appear to be increasing their exposure to
risk through such products as high-yield corporate
bonds and emerging market assets. Low policy rates
may be playing a role in this increased risk tolerance
and thus may complicate the tasks of policymakers
in some emerging market economies.
Are the adverse spillovers from low policy rates so
large that they harm global output? All economies
28

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

would probably be better off if advanced economies
had implemented stronger financial and fiscal policies. Absent such policies, would many emerging
and developing economies be better off if policy
rates were higher and activity in advanced economies
commensurately lower? Several emerging market
economies have certainly had difficulty coping with
large capital inflows, suggesting that the answer
might be affirmative. But there are also reasons to
reach the opposite conclusion. First, capital inflows
are not exceptionally strong for the vast majority of
emerging and developing economies (see Figure 1.8,
lower panels). Only a few economies are experiencing strong enough pressure to keep their exchange
rates in overvaluation territory (for example, Brazil,
South Africa). Second, capital inflows are overwhelmingly a function of national rather than
international factors, such as U.S. or euro area policy
rates: evidence in Chapter 4 of the April 2011 World
Economic Outlook suggests that the share of national
factors in explaining the variability in net inflows
into emerging market economies has been about
70 percent during the 2000s. Third, most of the
theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that, as
long as monetary policy successfully stabilizes macroeconomic conditions in advanced economies, overall
spillovers to emerging and developing economies
are not detrimental.11 Fourth, with the exception of
Japan, the world’s major net exporters of capital have
for many years been emerging market economies.
The best response to financial stability challenges
posed by low interest rates lies in a sound framework
of regulation and supervision. It is in each country’s
national interest to strengthen its domestic financial stability framework to control incentives for
excessive risk taking by lenders and borrowers alike,
including those that may arise on account of low
policy rates. In addition, policymakers could look for
ways to accelerate balance sheet restructuring, such
as by improving insolvency frameworks, introducing
new instruments for deleveraging (such as household debt-equity swaps), and direct intervention in
undercapitalized institutions. Emerging and developing economies with appropriate macroeconomic
11This is summarized in Box 1.3 of the April 2011 World
Economic Outlook.

chapter 1

policies that still struggle with speculative inflows
can respond with supervisory, regulatory, or other
measures. Others that are exporting large amounts
of capital stand to benefit from policies that lower
domestic saving and thereby help solve the underlying problem of global demand imbalances.12

Spillovers from global demand rebalancing
Emerging and developing economies are increasingly seen as the drivers of global growth. For the
purpose of assessing their role in global demand
rebalancing, domestic consumption provides a
good gauge of global impact—consumption has an
advantage over GDP for this purpose, in that the
latter includes exports and therefore may overstate
the extent to which an economy offers an outlet for other economies’ exports.13 To assess the
contribution of each economy to the growth of the
global market, it is appropriate to measure national
aggregates in a common currency. The relative levels
of consumption, measured for convenience in U.S.
dollars, suggest that the effect of emerging and
developing economies’ growth on global demand
rebalancing has been limited by their low share
in global consumption (Figure 1.22, bottom-left
panel). The contribution of consumption to growth
in emerging market economies from 2011 through
2016 is smaller than before the crisis; for China it is
about the same.14 In short, these economies do not
make up for the lower consumption contribution of
advanced economies. Although the rebalancing journey may have started, based on announced policies
it will likely take a long time to complete.
Current fiscal policy is unlikely to provide much
help for global demand rebalancing. Chapter 4
finds that the lack of more permanent consolidation
12This

advice does not necessarily apply to economies that are
reinvesting proceeds from exports of exhaustible natural resources.
13Consumption in U.S. dollar terms offers the largest contrast
to GDP in purchasing-power-parity terms. The conclusions
are qualitatively quite similar for the sum of consumption and
investment, as opposed to consumption alone. Notice that part of
investment is geared toward exports.
14China’s consumption in 2009 would have had to have been
some 17 percent higher to fully make up for the lower contribution of U.S. consumption during 2008–09 relative to 2005–07.
This would have required a drop in the savings-to-GDP ratio
from about 54 percent to 45 percent.

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

Figure 1.22. Drivers of Global Growth and Rebalancing
Emerging and developing economies account for about half of global output and twothirds of global growth in purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms, much of which is
accounted for by China and India. However, for purposes of demand rebalancing, the
more relevant measure is not in PPP terms but, for example, in constant U.S. dollars.
Furthermore, for demand rebalancing, consumption might be a better variable than
GDP, considering that it is less related to exports. As shown, emerging and
developing economies account for a much lower share of global consumption and
consumption growth in U.S. dollar terms. Also, their contribution to global
consumption growth fell during the crisis and is not expected to exceed precrisis
levels because of large losses in the central and eastern European and Commonwealth
of Independent States economies and few gains elsewhere, including in China.

measures in the United States relative to elsewhere
means that fiscal policy will contribute little to
bringing down the U.S. external deficit (see Figure
1.11, bottom panels). This stands in contrast to
what can be expected in the euro area, where large
consolidation measures in other euro area economies relative to those adopted in Germany will help
reduce imbalances within the region. However,
unless demand picks up elsewhere, more consolidation in the United States would entail lower global
activity. In sum, the challenges with respect to global
demand rebalancing remain broadly unchanged:
there is still a need for more ambitious mediumterm fiscal consolidation in the United States and a
boost in domestic demand in large emerging market
surplus economies. Achieving the latter would be
facilitated by nominal exchange rate appreciation,
but it also requires further measures to boost social
protection and to reform corporate governance and
financial markets.

Vulnerabilities in the global financial system and the
implications for spillovers
Some vulnerabilities in the global financial system
are being addressed, but many others still are cause
for concern. These issues are discussed in more depth
in the September 2011 Global Financial Stability
Report. First among these are institutions deemed too
important to fail. Stronger prudential requirements
for so-called systemically important financial institutions, including “living wills,” would deter the pursuit
of size solely for the sake of size and would foster
more prudent behavior. The second vulnerability is
the role of the shadow banking system. And third
are the challenges presented by wholesale funding in
the international money markets, which has grown
rapidly over the past decade. The hope is that stronger
capital and liquidity requirements, more transparency
by moving over-the-counter activities to exchanges,
and better incentives through “skin in the game”
will help rebuild these markets and make them more
stable. How successful such measures will be remains
unclear. Recurring instability was a feature of financial
systems until the advent of deposit insurance, and it
is likely to be a feature of wholesale funding markets.

30

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

During the financial crisis, central banks had to resort
to extraordinary mechanisms to provide liquidity to
wholesale funding markets. There are no such mechanisms at the international level.
The challenges presented by wholesale funding have
a major international dimension, implying that problems in some regions of the world can very quickly spill
over to other regions. This international dimension also
makes it very hard to address the underlying problems.
In the decade ahead of the crisis, cross-border exposures
grew very rapidly between advanced economies (see
Figure 1.20, bottom panel). Large international shortterm net financial liabilities play a major role in debt
crises (Box 1.5), and they are a distinguishing feature
of economies that have suffered severe financial stress
in the euro area. Indeed, the euro area may well be a
bellwether for problems that could arise if financial globalization continues apace. More generally, a number
of fundamentally strong advanced economies have had
to tap Federal Reserve swap lines as wholesale funding
has dried up. Whether this is a sustainable solution is
an open question. The stresses made apparent during the crisis illustrate that there is an urgent need to
beef up the size and scope of international risk-sharing
mechanisms, which have fallen far behind the growth
of the international financial markets.

reforming the global trade system
Trade has been an important driver of the global
recovery. From its crisis-induced trough at the beginning of 2009, the volume of global trade has grown
by 25 percent and recently surpassed precrisis peaks.
To ensure that trade can continue to boost growth,
it is vital that policymakers continue to keep protectionist pressures at bay. Just as important, one of
the best ways to enhance and guarantee security in
trade relationships, as well as safeguard the multilateral approach for trade negotiations, would be to
conclude the long-running World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round of trade talks. Failure of
the round would put at risk significant agreements
reached during 10 years of negotiations, including
on new market access in major markets, global farm
trade reform, and recent unilateral trade liberalization. Moreover, failure could precipitate moves
toward fragmentation of the global trading system,

chapter 1

with further acceleration of bilateral preferential
trade agreements, which would weaken both the
WTO and multilateralism in general. In a worst-case
scenario, a 19th-century-style Great Powers trade
system could reemerge, and the poorest economies
could lose their ability to negotiate on equal footing.
The negotiations for the Doha Round are at a
pivotal juncture. In an attempt to break the persistent stalemate in talks, the focus shifted this year
toward forging agreement soon on a partial package—at a minimum, aimed at helping the poorest
or least developed countries (LDCs)—as a down

Global Prospects and Policies

payment for a more comprehensive package. However, momentum on the so-called LDC-plus package
has stalled, largely because of disagreement over
which “plus” (or non-LDC-specific) elements should
be included. It is now vital that political leaders
muster the will and high-level attention to move the
negotiations forward, including by showing flexibility and making compromises. Leaders should also
strongly communicate Doha’s benefits to the public
by arguing that trade liberalization is not a concession but instead spurs growth and is in a country’s
own best interest.

appendix 1.1. commodity Market
developments and prospects
The authors of this appendix are Thomas Helbling,
Shaun Roache, Joong Shik Kang, Marina Rousset, and
David Reichsfeld.

overview of recent developments and prospects
After rising through April, prices of major commodities abruptly eased in two waves, first in May
and June of 2011 and then again in August. The
overall IMF commodity price index declined by
5 percent between April and July and another 5
percent in August. The index remains at high levels,
from both a cyclical and a longer-term perspective.
In August, it was about 9 percent above the level
recorded in December 2010 and only about 14 percent below its most recent peak value in July 2008
(Figure 1.23, top-right panel).
The broad easing of commodity prices largely
reflects common macroeconomic and financial factors
that have led to a less favorable near-term outlook for
the global economy and commodity demand. Incoming data suggest a stronger than expected slowing
of global economic activity in the second quarter of
2011 and a gradual downgrade of near-term prospects, as discussed in detail in the main text of Chapter 1. Of particular relevance for global commodity
markets was the policy response to rising inflation and
surging housing prices in emerging market economies,
in particular China, which accounts for about 40
percent of global metal consumption and 18 percent
of energy consumption. The policy measures put
in place since fall 2010 have reduced credit growth
and succeeded in stabilizing economic growth at a
more sustainable pace. Against this backdrop, China’s
import growth for many commodities—which is
frequently considered a bellwether of global commodity demand conditions—has decelerated, which has
reduced pressure on global demand-supply balances
for some major commodities, notably base metals.
The increases in risk aversion in global financial
markets, owing to renewed concerns about sovereign
debt risks in the euro area periphery, and the related
appreciation of the U.S. dollar likely also contributed
to the broad decline in commodity prices. As usual,
the effects of these financial factors on commodity
32

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

prices are difficult to distinguish from those related
to global economic prospects, both because all these
factors are partly driven by the same underlying forces
and because the direction of their effects on prices is
the same. Nevertheless, increases in risk aversion can
have direct effects on commodity spot prices: inventory holdings become relatively less attractive unless
there is an offset from higher expected future returns
resulting from a decline in current spot prices.
The easing of commodity prices was associated
with noticeable declines in net futures positions of
noncommercial investors, including in the case of
crude oil (Figure 1.23, middle-left panel). More generally, commodity assets under management declined
by about 9 percent during May and June—reflecting
lower prices and net outflows—ending the quarter at
$410 billion (Figure 1.23, middle-right panel). Net
outflows took place across all commodity groups,
with agriculture and energy each accounting for
about 34 percent of the overall decline and precious
metals for about 27 percent. These net outflows of
investor funds for the commodity asset class as a
whole were larger than those during the Great Recession of 2008–09 (Figure 1.23, bottom-left panel).
Initially, the decline in commodity prices and
the outflows from commodity assets, which preceded declines in prices of other assets, were widely
perceived as a surprise, symptomatic of the recent
financialization of commodity markets. With financialization, sudden shifts in large investor portfolios
can cause abrupt changes in pricing that do not
appear to have an immediate fundamental trigger.
Nevertheless, subsequent incoming global economic
and financial data provided the fundamental backdrop
for the commodity price declines. And the experience
of the past few years suggests that although sudden
shifts in investor sentiment and prices are possible,
such events do not appear to have long-lasting or
destabilizing effects on commodity prices (Box 1.4).

near-term outlook
Commodity prices already reflect a weaker nearterm global growth outlook. Under the baseline
projections in this issue of the World Economic Outlook, global growth is expected to rebound slightly
in the second half of 2011, when the fundamental

chapter 1

drivers of the expansion will reassert themselves.
Nevertheless, this rebound is not expected to come
with renewed strong upward pressure on commodity
prices because it will be driven largely by a moderate, albeit still weaker than expected, earlier pickup
in growth in advanced economies. In contrast,
growth in emerging and developing economies,
which have accounted for almost all commodity
demand increases in recent years, is expected to
slow modestly in the second half of 2011 and in
2012, because tightening policies should begin to
affect domestic demand and prospects for external
demand are less favorable. Much will also depend on
commodity-specific demand and supply factors. For
a growing number of commodities, upward pressure
will likely also be contained by supply responses to
higher prices that are estimated to be above longterm marginal cost in real terms—in the near term
mainly in agriculture but increasingly also in metals.
The current commodity price forecasts are thus
for broadly unchanged prices for 2011 as a whole.
The IMF’s average petroleum spot price (APSP) is
expected to remain close to $100 a barrel for the
remainder of 2011 and through 2012 (Figure 1.23,
bottom-right panel). The IMF’s nonfuel commodity
price index is projected to moderate by about 5½
percent in the second half of 2011—largely owing
to improved harvests for many food commodities
and agricultural raw materials—as well as in 2012,
when base metal prices are also expected to decline
modestly because of improving supply conditions.
In the near term, broad commodity price risks
seem more balanced than at the time of the October
2010 and April 2011 issues of the World Economic
Outlook, because downside risks to global growth
have risen. On the upside, price spikes due to
supply factors remain the main concern. The balance of risks varies across commodities, however.
Upside price risks remain most pertinent and most
prominent for energy and food, the two commodity
groups that matter most for global growth and inflation prospects. In oil markets, geopolitical factors are
an important dimension of oil supply risks. More
broadly, given generally price-inelastic supply in the
short and medium term as well as recent declines
in spare capacity, relatively small upward surprises
to oil demand, such as the surge recorded last year,

or adverse supply shocks can trigger large price
increases. Oil market inflexibility thus continues to
present risks to global growth and inflation. Given
low global inventory levels for many crops, any
significant adverse shocks—including this summer’s
heat wave in the United States—have the capacity to
spike food prices higher.

energy Market developments and prospects
After surging through April, and peaking at $120
a barrel at the end of that month, oil prices eased
through the remainder of the second quarter and
again in August, trading at about $100 a barrel since
mid-August. During easing, the IMF’s APSP—a
simple average of the Brent, Dubai, and West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil varieties—fell below
the $100 threshold for some time and is expected
to move sideways at about $100 throughout the
projection period. Oil price volatility, as measured
by the implied volatility embedded in the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Crude Oil Volatility Index,
spiked during the brisk price corrections in May and
then again in August. On the latter occasion, the
expected standard deviation of daily price changes
temporarily rose above 50 percent (annualized),
above the levels seen in March during the height of
the Libya-related oil market disruption.
The easing in crude oil prices was driven primarily by the common macroeconomic and financial
factors discussed in the overview of this appendix.
These factors have underpinned concerns about oil
demand prospects. Although slower global oil demand
growth had been expected, given the overshooting
in the second half of 2010, the slowing turned out
to be stronger than projected in the second quarter
of 2011, mirroring developments in global activity (Figure 1.24, top-left panel; Table 1.2). The
main commodity-specific factor in the oil demand
overshooting in the second half of 2010, the sharp
acceleration in diesel demand growth in China due
to power outages and cuts, was reversed as expected.
Overall, oil demand growth in China has normalized
to rates consistent with the past relationships between
oil demand and economic activity (Figure 1.24, topright panel). Nevertheless, gasoline consumption has
grown at a higher rate over the past two years than

it did during the 2005–08 expansion (Figure 1.24,
upper-middle-left panel), suggesting that the growing number of cars per household may have begun
to change the slope of the gasoline demand path. In
advanced economies, fuel demand turned out weaker
than projected, declining in the second quarter. In the
United States, fuel demand has been slightly weaker
than expected, given the state of the cycle and retail
fuel prices (Figure 1.24, upper-middle-right panel).
This weakness reflects in part the higher fuel efficiency

of newer car models, which appears to be increasing the aggregate fuel efficiency of the U.S. car fleet,
which had remained relatively unchanged for years.
Oil supply has expanded at a steady annual rate of
about 2 percent since early 2010, although its relative
contribution has changed (Figure 1.24, lower-middleleft panel). After expanding rapidly in 2010, supply
growth from producers that are not members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) moderated in the first half of 2011. This

world economic outlook: Slowing Growth, Rising Risks

slowdown reflects the end of the base effect of new
capacity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2009 and
temporary shutdowns of producing fields for maintenance and capacity expansion. This moderation
was offset by increased OPEC production, although
it took time for other OPEC producers to ramp up
production after the disruption to Libyan production. Only in June did OPEC production reach the
levels seen early in the first quarter, largely due to
a production increase of about 12 percent in Saudi
Arabia compared with the levels of the first quarter of
this year (an increase equivalent to 1 percent of global
oil supply). Production in all OPEC members except
Libya has exceeded the December 2008 production
quotas, which are still in effect, for some time, but at
their most recent regular meeting in June, OPEC oil
ministers failed to agree on quota increases.
Turning to the demand-supply balance, demand
growth still exceeded supply growth through the
first half of 2011. As in the second half of 2010,
market clearing involved a strong draw on inventories. The release of emergency stocks by International Energy Agency members provided only
very temporary price relief. By the end of June,
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development member inventories had declined to
below-average levels over past cycles (in terms of
stock-to-use ratios). With the decline in inventory
buffers, futures curves for the Brent crude oil variety, the predominant price benchmark outside the
North American market, have returned to the usual
state of backwardation (spot prices exceed futures
prices). In contrast, futures curves for U.S. WTI
are still sloping upward at the front end, reflecting
localized pockets of excess supply in landlocked
areas of the North American oil supply system,
as a result of increased production and still weak
demand. Limited transportation capacity constrains
the scope for arbitrage to reduce price differentials.
These constraints are expected to persist for some
time; current futures prices imply that markets
expect WTI to be priced at a discount to Brent
through 2016. Historically, WTI has traded at a
premium, because it is a lighter and sweeter variety
of crude oil. If this anomaly continues, use of the
WTI price as a price benchmark will increasingly
come under scrutiny.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Near-term oil market stability will depend heavily
on two factors. First, oil demand growth is expected
to moderate further after strong growth through
2010. On the supply side, the call on OPEC will
increase further in the second half of 2011 and again
in 2012 under the WEO baseline projections, given
that non-OPEC supply growth is not expected to
recover until late in 2011.15 Higher OPEC production will thus be required for oil market stability,
although some of the increases in the call on OPEC
will be seasonal. There are risks on both sides. The
extent of the moderation in oil demand growth
will depend on whether global activity rebounds as
expected. OPEC spare capacity has declined since
the disruption to Libyan production, highlighting
risks to supply, including for geopolitical reasons.
In the medium term, futures prices indicate
that markets expect prices to remain high but also
broadly constant in real terms. Such expectations are
consistent with the view that at such prices supply can broadly keep up with relatively moderate
growth in global oil demand on the order of 1 to
1½ percent a year. The global oil supply growth of
about 2 percent observed over the past two years
is unlikely to be sustained, because it was made
possible by high postrecession spare capacity and
other special factors. Nevertheless, the recent supply
experience suggests that continued moderate net
capacity expansion is possible. Thanks to oil prices of
$100 a barrel in real terms, high-cost conventional
and nonconventional oil reservoirs continue to be
developed (Figure 1.24, lower-middle-right panel).
Upstream oil investment in non-OPEC members
has remained high, with continued exploration and
development. As a result, production in these economies is already some 2½ million barrels a day above
the previous peak in 2007, despite continued decline
in the North Sea and Mexico. The increases in shale
oil production in North Dakota in the United States
highlight the scope for and the benefits of techno-

15The

“call on OPEC” is the difference between global demand
and supply from sources other than OPEC crude oil production,
including OPEC natural gas liquids (NGL) production. In Table
1.2, the figure for OPEC production in 2011 reflects the call on
OPEC and OPEC NGL production.

chapter 1

logical innovation.16 Moreover, at such prices, efforts
at decline management are likely to intensify.17
Upstream investment in many OPEC members has
remained relatively more subdued, although some
major members are pursuing ambitious investment
programs.
Price differences across fossil fuels continue to
be large. Crude oil remains the most expensive fuel
per unit of energy produced compared with coal
and natural gas, reflecting differences in the extent
of supply constraints (Figure 1.24, bottom panel).
In the United States, shale gas development and
exploration have continued at a broadly unchanged
pace. Although costs and returns vary considerably
across shale gas plays, many have turned out to be
profitable at current gas prices of about $4 per 1,000
cubic feet. With such price differentials, recent
energy demand patterns will continue. In particular,
the decline in the share of crude oil in total use of
fossil fuels and the generation of primary energy
observed over the past three decades will continue.
Whether the current higher price differentials will
lead to faster decline in the share of crude oil is
uncertain, however, in some sectors, notably transportation, where the extent of substitution in the
short to medium term is limited (even though the
technology to run vehicles on natural gas exists). On
the other hand, in the U.S. power sector, natural gas
has become a more attractive fuel input compared
with coal, and its share in primary energy consumption is likely to increase. Natural gas could also play
a more prominent role in the energy mix elsewhere,
given that large shale gas deposits have also been
identified in other regions. Although foreign oil and
gas companies have acquired equity in U.S. shale
gas producers, preparing the ground for technology
transfer, exploration elsewhere has not really started
yet.18 Coal consumption also continued to increase
at a rapid rate in the first half of 2011, reflecting
lower costs compared with crude oil.

Metal Market developments and prospects
Base metal prices moved broadly sideways in the
first half of 2011, with relatively minor ups and
downs in sync with other commodity prices. In
August, the IMF’s base metal price index was down
by 0.3 percent compared with December 2010 (Figure 1.25, middle-left panel).19
Metal prices started easing earlier than other
major commodity group prices. This lead reflects
two China-specific factors. First, with a market share
of about 40 percent in global base metal markets,
domestic demand developments in China are much
more important for this commodity group than for
others. The key development in this respect has been
the Chinese authorities’ policy tightening measures
in response to rising inflation and surging house
prices since the second half of 2010. As a result,
activity in metal-intensive sectors has slowed. Fixed
investment, which had surged along with policy
stimulus and credit growth in 2009 and early 2010,
has moderated since then. Although real estate
investment has held up well, in part bolstered by
ongoing expansion in the construction of housing for lower-income groups, industrial production
growth has moderated to below the precrisis average
(Figure 1.25, top-right panel). As a result, global
base metal consumption growth moderated further
in the first half of 2011, with China’s contribution
falling to unusually low levels compared with the
past few years (Figure 1.25, middle-left panel).
The second China-related factor is the countryspecific base metal inventory cycle, which had a
hand in China’s dominant contribution to global
metal demand growth in 2009 and early 2010. This
inventory cycle has gone from a bullish to a bearish force for metal prices over the past six to nine
months. Following the 2009 policy stimulus, metal
inventories in China surged in anticipation of higher
demand, and local prices rose temporarily above
world market prices. In addition, inventories in
bonded warehouses started increasing because base
metals, notably copper, were increasingly used as collateral for trade credit as policy tightening reduced

19The price of gold rose strongly, by about 28 percent, during
the first eight months of 2011.

the supply of regular business credit.20 Increased
imports subsequently led to price equalization.
With the slowing in demand and restrictive policies
in place in some sectors, inventories have started
to decline. This decline added to local supply, and
metal import growth began to slow in the first half
of 2011. In contrast, global metal inventory holdings
(as measured by stock-to-use ratios) remain at high
levels considering the stage of the global business
cycle (Figure 1.25, middle-right panel).
Metal-specific supply developments have also
shaped price behavior, with marked differences
across metals, as evidenced in the recent increase in
the dispersion of price changes across metals. Copper prices rebounded in June as supply disruptions
in major mines due to strikes and adverse weather
conditions worsened already tight demand-supply
balances. Lead prices rose after one of the world’s
largest lead mine was closed indefinitely. Aluminum
markets remained broadly balanced in the first half
of this year, with record-high production levels
matched by continued strong global demand. In
contrast, nickel prices have stabilized despite tight
supply conditions, because the production of nickel
pig iron as a substitute for nickel has increased significantly, particularly in China.
Turning to the outlook, base metal consumption
growth in China is expected to remain broadly stable
at the rates seen in the first half of 2011, given prospects for economic activity overall. Economic growth
in China is projected to remain robust, with a slowly
increasing balance in contributions from investment
and consumption, reaching 9.5 percent for 2011
as a whole and 9.0 percent in 2012 compared with
10.3 percent in 2010. On the other hand, although
inventory destocking begun in late 2010 is expected
to end, the overall impact on demand should be
modest if inventories build up broadly in line with
the rebound in consumption. Indeed, copper inventories at the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE)
have rebounded since June, and aluminum price differentials between the SHFE and the London Metal
20Markets

share of copper imports being used as collateral in bank credit
(through letters of credit to finance imports with deferred payment), although there are no official data to assess the scope of
such deals.

chapter 1

Exchange have widened again, indicating tightening
local supply-demand balances and some increases in
base metal import growth (Figure 1.25, bottom-left
panel).
Base metal prices are expected to remain broadly
stable despite the moderate rebound in global economic growth in the second half of 2011. On the
demand side, as noted above, base metal demand
growth in China is expected to remain broadly
stable, while base metal consumption in advanced
economies, which was still 12½ percent below its
precrisis peak in the second quarter, is expected to
recover gradually in the context of subdued economic growth. On the supply side, production,
which surged in the first half of 2010 following a
sharp decline during the Great Recession, should
remain close to its average rate of expansion of about
3½ percent (year over year)—with some variations
across metals—making for broadly balanced market
conditions at current high prices (Figure 1.25,
bottom-right panel). Risks for base metals in general
seem more balanced than for oil or food, mainly
because overall supply does not seem as tightly
constrained as for oil—with copper and lead being
notable exceptions—and because of higher inventory
levels (relative to consumption) than in food markets. Risks to energy prices also affect metal prices,
however, given the high share of energy in the cost
of metal refining.

Food Market developments and prospects
Food prices have retreated modestly from their
peak in recent months, but they remain very high
compared with the decade through 2010 (Figure
1.26, top panels). The IMF food price index during
the third quarter to date of 2011 is about 20 percent
higher than for the same quarter of 2010 and significantly above the average real price over the past
10 years. Grain and oilseed prices are particularly
elevated, but prices of other food groups, including meat, are also well above their historical averages. A degree of respite from rising prices has been
provided in recent months by improving near-term
supply prospects for some important crops. Following the large weather-related supply setbacks during
fall 2010, expectations for harvests in 2011 have

world economic outlook: Slowing Growth, Rising Risks

stabilized, and there are signs, based on projected
acreage, that output growth will be relatively buoyant in 2012.
Food markets remain precariously balanced, however. Inventory buffers are very low for some important crops—notably corn—and this will keep prices
very sensitive to changes in the supply and demand
outlook (Figure 1.26, upper-middle-left panel). The
most immediate risk is that key crops will suffer from another round of weather-related supply
shocks. The recent pattern of extreme weather in
major crop-growing regions seems to be continuing:
following droughts in Europe and China, the United
States has experienced a very wet spring followed by
severe summer heat, leading to a reduction in projected corn yields. Even modest further downgrades
to the supply outlook could trigger a large price
response, cross-commodity spillovers, and higher
volatility, similar to developments in early 2011. For
example, rising supply uncertainty led to surging
precautionary demand in physical markets by major
food-importing economies during the first quarter of
2011, as reflected in U.S. export sales (Figure 1.26,
upper-middle-right panel).
At the same time, demand growth momentum
remains strong. Rapid increases in emerging market
economy food consumption are showing no signs
of moderating, reflecting income growth and a
diet shifting toward higher-protein foods, including grain-fed meat (Figure 1.26, lower-middle-left
panel). In advanced economies, notably the United
States, overall demand growth is modest, but the use
of food commodities as a biofuel feedstock continues to surpass expectations, most recently due to
higher oil prices during the first half of 2011 and
rising ethanol refining margins. Since 2000, ethanol
has accounted for three-quarters of the 40 percent
increase in the use of domestic corn output, with
ethanol by-products accounting for the remainder

40

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

(Figure 1.26, lower-middle-right panel). Use of
soybean oil in the production of biodiesel fuel is also
increasing rapidly. High energy prices and policy
support are bolstering biofuel production in Europe
and other regions as well, but again, limited data
availability continues to impede commodity market
transparency (Figure 1.26, bottom-left panel). Overall, global demand for major crops during 2011–12
is anticipated to grow by about 2¼ percent, considerably above the 20-year average and almost entirely
because of demand from China and other emerging
market and low-income economies.
Food prices should decline modestly but remain
high in real terms through 2012, assuming a return
to more normal weather conditions and stable
energy prices, which affect food prices through
biofuel and production costs. This scenario is built
into the futures prices of some key crops, notably
corn, which currently reflect some easing as each
new crop is harvested. Supply is responding to
higher prices, albeit with a lag. In particular, rising global acreage should offset the medium-term
moderation in yield growth due, in part, to emerging constraints in productive land and water. The
balance of risks to food prices is still to the upside,
however, and this is reflected in derivative market
pricing, which shows market participants pricing in
a higher-than-average probability of a price spike
over the next nine months (Figure 1.26, bottomright panel). A combination of low inventories,
volatile weather, and demand uncertainties related
to China and biofuels raises the prospect of further
price spikes over the next 12 to 18 months. The
renewed imposition of trade restrictions in the face
of using prices and tighter demand-supply balances
in physical markets—including through export
bans by important producers—could exacerbate
global supply conditions and heighten world price
volatility.

box 1.1. Slow recovery to nowhere? a Sectoral View of labor Markets in advanced economies
Employment took a deep hit in many advanced
economies during the Great Recession of 2008–09
and has been slow to recover, reflecting the still
weak and uncertain recovery. But even after a
cyclical recovery, structural trends that predate the
Great Recession could dim labor market prospects.
Skill-biased technological change and the increased
prevalence of global supply chains have added to
national income in advanced economies. But these
trends also have been associated with a striking loss
of middle-income and manufacturing jobs. This box
describes these unequal impacts of technology and
trade and their likely impact on potential output
growth. The main policy message is that advanced
economies need to address the human costs of these
structural trends just as they took steps to lower
the human costs of the Great Recession (Dao and
Loungani, 2010).

As in the past, these trends in technology and
trade have contributed to global welfare: millions
have been lifted out of poverty in emerging markets;
consumers everywhere have enjoyed the benefits
of lower prices; and national income has expanded
in advanced economies. But these trends have also
increasingly been associated with diminished prospects for large groups of workers in advanced economies. As Spence (2011) notes, “until about a decade
ago, the effects of globalization on the distribution
of wealth and jobs were largely benign, [but now] it
is changing the structures of individual economies
in ways that affect different groups within countries
differently. In advanced economies, it is redistributing employment opportunities and incomes.”
Documenting these effects requires going beyond
aggregates and looking at sectoral developments by
skill level and industry.

Technology and Trade Effects on Employment

Employment Shifts and Labor Productivity

Technological change and trade are as old as
civilization, but when it comes to their mediumterm impacts on the labor market, each time can be
different. In the two decades preceding the Great
Recession, a salient feature of technological change
was that it favored more highly skilled workers. This
is not always the case: during some periods in history, technological change has replaced rather than
complemented the highly skilled (Goldin and Katz,
2008).
The primary effect of trade on the labor market
during these same two decades was an increasing
reliance on global supply chains, a process helped by
the availability of large pools of workers in emerging markets who previously had been outside the
global production system. As Freeman (2007) notes,
“almost all at once in the 1990s, China, India,
and the ex-Soviet bloc joined the global economy,”
doubling the size of the global labor pool to nearly
3 billion. The concurrent advances in information
and communication technology helped give many
global businesses ready access to this expanded pool
of labor.

Acemoglu and Autor (2010) document a shift in
employment in the United States from mediumskill to low- and high-skill jobs during 1980–2007.
Middle-income jobs declined significantly in other
advanced economies between 1993 and 2006,
including in the euro area, Japan, and the United
Kingdom. Figure 1.1.1 suggests a shift away from
middle-income jobs and from industries with high
productivity levels and high productivity growth to
industries with lower productivity levels and growth
rates.
The top-left panel shows the striking hollowing
out of medium-skill and middle-income jobs, many
of which were lost from the manufacturing sector.
In contrast, much of the services sector, which
includes community, social, personal, and government services, remains dependent on low-skilled,
low-income labor.1
The top-right panel of the figure shows the
change in labor market share of various sectors
during 2000–07 for selected advanced economies. All five economies experienced a decline in
manufacturing and an increase in services. Even in
Germany, which has had a trade surplus since 2001,

the manufacturing share of employment fell from
22 percent in 2000 to 20½ percent in 2007. The
construction sector and the financial services sector
(which includes finance, insurance, and real estate)
also experienced large employment increases in most
of these economies during the housing boom of the
precrisis period.
Historically, reallocating labor from low-productivity to high-productivity sectors has been a primary
channel through which advanced economies have
increased national income (McMillan and Rodrik,

42

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

2011). But many observers fear that these economies
are now at a stage in their structural transformation at which they could “slow down, stagnate, and
decline” as labor is increasingly reallocated from
high-productivity manufacturing to lower-productivity services (Duarte and Restuccia, 2010).
The bottom-left panel shows labor productivity
growth by sector during 2000–07. Manufacturing was a high-productivity growth sector, whereas
services sector productivity barely increased (or even
declined) in every country during this period. There

chapter 1

Global ProsPects and PolIcIes

box 1.1 (continued)
was increased employment in construction, which
experienced below-average productivity growth,
and in financial services, which experienced average
productivity growth.
The bottom-right panel shows that relative productivity levels and productivity growth are highly
correlated. This occurs because sectoral productivity
growth rates have been relatively consistent during
the past decades.

Sectoral Productivity and Potential Output
Growth
The likely impact of these employment shifts on
aggregate productivity growth, and hence on potential output growth, can be illustrated through a
simple accounting framework. The labor productivity of country i in year t can be expressed as follows:
Ait = ∑ θijt × Pijt ,

(1.1)

j

where θijt is the share of labor input in industry j as
a fraction of the economy-wide labor supply, Pijt is
per unit labor productivity, and the summation is
over all industries j. The growth rate of productivity
can be expressed as follows:
A*it
1
—–
= —– ∑ θ*ijt × Pijt + ∑ θijt × P*ijt .
j
Ait j
Ait





(1.2)

An asterisk next to a variable indicates the change
with respect to time.
Taking sectoral productivity growth as exogenous,
this equation shows the impact on economy-wide
productivity growth as employment starts to shift
from an industry with high productivity and high
productivity growth rates to a low-productivity
(and low productivity growth) industry. During the
shift, the first term on the right side of the equation
is lower if there is a negative correlation between
changes in labor share and productivity levels. This
is referred to as a compositional or structural effect.
Moreover, once the shift takes place, the second sum
is also smaller, because there is now higher employment in sectors where productivity growth is lower
and lower employment in sectors where productivity
growth is higher. This is the within-industry effect.
Figure 1.1.2 illustrates these effects. The top-left
panel shows the relationship between changes in

labor share and productivity levels for five advanced
European economies from 2000 to 2007. There
is a clear negative correlation between relative
productivity and the change in the employment
share, although the finance sector is an outlier. The
top-right panel shows a similar and more striking
negative correlation between changes in labor shares
and productivity levels in the United States during
2000–07. The size of the bubbles represents the
relative size of the sectors.
The bottom-left panel shows both the structural
and within-industry effects on U.S. labor productivity growth for three typical years: 1991, 2000, and
2007. Each effect is the cumulative sum for six sectors, so that the sum of all 12 components is equal
to the labor productivity growth rate for the year.
Sectors differ greatly in the channels through which
they contribute to aggregate labor productivity
growth. The manufacturing sector has always had a
negative structural component, due to its diminishing labor share. In contrast, the services sector has
negative within-industry components for all three
years, a sign of its sluggish productivity growth.2
Thus, shifts away from high-productivity industries
have exerted a drag on per capita output growth due
to both structural and within-industry effects.
Although the shifts in the labor market documented above predate the Great Recession, the
evidence suggests that they persist. For instance, with
respect to the polarization of jobs, Autor (2010) finds
that “the Great Recession has quantitatively but not
qualitatively changed the direction of the U.S. labor
market.” The bottom-right panel plots the level of
productivity against the change in labor market share
in the United States during 2007–09. The services
sector continued to grow in terms of labor share
and the manufacturing sector to decline—both at
faster annual rates. Indeed, total employment fell 4½
percent and employment in manufacturing by 14
percent between 2007 and 2009, but employment in
services increased by 2 percent.3
2See

Peneder (2003) and Bosworth and Triplett (2007) for
further discussion on the decomposition.
3The experiences of the United Kingdom and Spain were
similar; Germany, however, had a slight increase in labor share
in manufacturing and a slight decrease in services.

Where Are They Headed?
What impact will technology and trade trends
have on labor markets in the coming years? Answering that question—and suggesting appropriate policy responses—requires some conjecture as to which
of the two forces is likely to dominate, though it is
not always easy to separate out their impacts. Early
analyses of these developments, particularly explanations for the rising skill premium, tended to conclude that technological change was dominant (for
example, Lawrence and Slaughter, 1993). And there

44

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

is no doubt that technology played an important
role in the gradual decline of middle-income and
manufacturing jobs since the 1970s. In particular,
automation has decreased employment in industries
with a higher share of routine tasks (Autor, Levy,
and Murnane, 2003).
Other factors besides technological change also
seem to be involved, however, not least because the
sharp decline in jobs occurred well after the arrival
of most new information and communication technology in the 1990s. Recent work therefore assigns
greater importance to the role of trade, particu-

larly to offshoring and soaring production within
multinational firms.4 These studies stress that it is
no coincidence that the decline in manufacturing
jobs accelerated during the 2000s and was accompanied by a huge increase in advanced economies’
imports from low-income countries. Autor, Dorn,
and Hanson (2011) estimate that at least one-third
of the aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing
employment during 1990–2007 can be attributed
to increased imports from emerging markets. The
top panel of Figure 1.1.3 shows the sharp decline
in U.S. manufacturing jobs and the increase in the
profits of multinational firms during the 2000s.5
4See, for instance, Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter
(2005).
5Over time, increasing labor costs in emerging market
economies may partially reverse the offshoring trend. As multinationals and foreign firms begin to reopen some plants

The bottom panel shows the sharp acceleration in
the share of intermediate goods imports in total
imports over the same period (Goel, 2011), reflecting the establishment of global supply chains.
The consequences of job losses are amplified if
there are interactions between international trade
and technological innovations. If economies’ comparative advantage is enhanced over time through
learning-by-doing, as suggested by many authors,
changes in patterns of specialization could persist
over time.6 Trade-induced technological changes
would lead to similar effects.7 As a result, the offshoring sectors with higher growth potential could
dampen growth in the advanced economies in the
long term.

Conclusions
This box documents the unequal impact on
advanced economies of structural trends—namely,
technological change and trade.8 Over the past 20
years, these trends have lifted living standards in
emerging markets and developing economies and
conferred the benefits of lower prices on consumers
everywhere. In advanced economies, technological
innovation and the ability to take advantage of a
global labor market have contributed to national
income. But at the same time, there has been
an adverse impact on a large class of workers in
advanced economies, particularly in manufacturing, and prospects for this class remain dim. This
adverse impact is reflected in increased income
inequality; for example, the Gini coefficient of
income inequality rose in six of the G7 economies
domestically, productivity growth may rebound. There are
differing views on whether offshoring trends can continue.
Blinder (2009) estimates that 25 percent of U.S. jobs are
potentially offshorable. In contrast, Manyika and others
(2011) and Deutsche Bank (2011) argue for a gradual shift
from offshoring to “on-shoring” as labor costs continue to
increase in coastal China and other emerging markets and
as companies become aware of many hidden costs and risks
intrinsic to doing business in emerging markets.
6See Krugman (1985), Lucas (1988), Boldrin and Scheinkman (1988), and Young (1991).
7See Acemoglu (2003) and Thoenig and Verdier (2003).
8The focus has been on medium-term trends rather
than the question of how much current unemployment in
advanced economies is structural (see Diamond, 2011).

between 1985 and 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The calculations discussed in this box also suggest
that, at least in the medium term, there could be a
dampening effect on potential output growth from
the ongoing shift in employment from industries
with high productivity growth rates to those with
low productivity growth rates.
The longer-term solutions to the hollowing out
of middle-income jobs lie in retraining, better
education, and increased productivity in nonmanu-

facturing sectors. But more immediate action is
also needed to cushion some of the human costs of
structural change. As Spence (2011) argues, redistribution must be part of the policy response: the
potential benefits include increased social cohesion
and continued support for globalization. Spence
cautions that if the employment challenges confronting the advanced economies are not tackled,
countries may resort to “protectionist measures on
a broad front [and] the global economy will be
undermined.”

which the cyclical component of credit is larger than 1.75
times its standard deviation––see Mendoza and Terrones
(2008) for more details and an analysis of these episodes for
advanced and emerging market economies. The focus on the
cyclical component of credit assumes that the trend captures
mostly healthy financial deepening.

Credit has been growing rapidly in a number
of emerging market economies, raising concern
in some quarters. Although there can be good
reasons for credit to grow rapidly––cyclical upturns,
financial deepening, and improved medium-term
prospects––in some circumstances credit expansion
can be excessive and can be followed by financial
turbulence, as shown by the recent global financial
crisis and the Asian crisis of the mid-1990s. Such
credit expansion is often called a “credit boom.”
What is a credit boom? It is an episode during which real credit to the private sector expands
significantly more than during typical economic
expansions.1 During the upswing of a credit boom,
economic activity expands strongly, housing and
equity prices rise rapidly, leverage increases sharply,
the real exchange rate appreciates, and current
account deficits widen. The opposite is observed
during the downswing of a boom: activity contracts
sharply, housing and equity prices drop, leverage
falls, the real exchange rate depreciates, and current
account deficits narrow. Financial vulnerabilities
heighten as a result of these large swings in macroeconomic and financial variables. In fact, there
is a strong association between credit booms and
currency crises, banking crises, and sudden stops
(Figure 1.2.1, top panel).
Given the strong association between such credit
boom-bust cycles and financial crises, it is important
to understand what drives them. This box studies
credit booms in 47 economies—19 advanced and
28 emerging market economies—during 1960–
2010. We find that capital inflows are good predictors of credit booms and merit close monitoring
not only because of their impact on competitiveness
but also because of other implications for financial
stability.

What Triggers a Credit Boom?
Credit booms can be driven by many factors.
Three in particular garner considerable attention and
are indeed strongly associated with credit booms:

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

47

world economic outlook: Slowing growth, riSing riSkS

box 1.2 (continued)
surges in capital inflows, financial sector reforms,
and productivity gains. In particular, credit booms
in emerging market economies seem to be associated
mostly with large capital inflows, whereas those in
advanced economies often coincide with productivity gains (Figure 1.2.1, middle panel). Although this
observation is useful, it does not indicate whether
these factors can help predict credit boom-busts and
which among these is most relevant. To address this
issue, we use a simple probabilistic model of credit
booms and the following factors:
• Past capital inflows: A surge in net private capital
inflows typically leads to a rapid increase in loanable funds. Banks, in an attempt to allocate these
funds, often lower their lending standards and
extend credit to firms and households previously
without access to financial markets. This can lead
to an overly rapid expansion of credit.2
• Past financial sector reforms: In an attempt to
improve their growth performance, countries
around the world have implemented measures to
eliminate financial repression and develop their
financial sectors, which has frequently spurred
credit growth. But the process of financial sector
development—that is, the emergence of financial instruments, institutions, and markets—can
involve risks, particularly when such development
is not accompanied by adequate evolution of the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks.
• Past productivity gains: Technological progress
and innovation are often financed with external resources. Indeed, there is evidence that
credit plays an important role in the process of
technological innovation. Optimism about rapid
technological progress and about future increases
in the value of collateral assets often accompanies
strong credit growth.3
Excessive credit expansion results in part from
propagation mechanisms associated with financial
market imperfections. One such mechanism is
the financial accelerator (Bernanke, Gertler, and
2 Végh (2011) shows that the macroeconomic consequences
of capital inflows are the same regardless of the nature of the
shock driving the inflows—that is, push or pull.
3 Zeira (1999), building on the idea of informational overshooting, shows how increased productivity for an unknown
period of time could lead to financial booms and crashes.

48

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Gilchrist, 1999; and Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997):
shocks to asset prices and relative prices are amplified through balance sheet effects. This propagation
process can be exacerbated by inadequate regulatory
and supervisory frameworks, including implicit
government guarantees, and herd behavior by banks.

Main Findings
The econometric results confirm that net capital
inflows, financial sector reform, and total factor
productivity are good predictors of a credit boom.4
Net capital inflows appear to have an important
predictive edge over the other two factors.
The main econometric results are summarized in
Table 1.2.1. This table shows the alternative specifications of a logit regression, with the dependent
variable an episode dummy that takes the value of
1 if country i is experiencing a credit boom in year
t, and zero otherwise. The estimated coefficients of
the different triggering factors have the appropriate signs and are all statistically significant. We are
interested in an assessment of the predictive power
of various regression specifications, and for that
purpose use the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve method.5 The ROC curve is a plot of
the true positive rate (TP) versus the false positive
rate (FP). If the number of true positives equals the
number of false positives, the three factors have the
same predictive value as a coin toss—that is, none at
all. Thus, the predictive value of the factors is given
by the extent to which the ROC curve lies above
the 45-degree line in the bottom panel of Figure
1.2.1. A summary measure of this curve—the socalled area under the curve (AUC) measure—is a
useful statistic to rank the predictive performance
4In the econometric model, the capital inflow variable is
proxied by the five-year average of net capital inflows as a
percent of GDP. Financial sector reforms correspond to the
five-year average of the yearly changes in the financial reform
index compiled by Abiad, Detragiache, and Tressel (2008).
The data were extrapolated to 2008. The productivity measure
was calculated using standard growth accounting methods
(Kose, Prasad, and Terrones, 2009) using data from the Penn
World Table 7.0.
5Berge and Jordà (2011) offer a detailed discussion of this
method and an application to the U.S. business cycle. Jordà,
Schularick, and Taylor (2010) use this method to examine the
extent to which credit expansions help predict banking crises.

of alternative specifications. If the ROC curve coincides with the 45-degree line, the AUC measure is
0.5 (half the square in Figure 1.2.1, bottom panel).
Thus, an AUC of 0.5 indicates the predictive value
of a coin toss. If the AUC is greater than 0.5, the
respective factor (or combination of factors) has
predictive value.
The results reveal that net capital inflows are the
most helpful factor in predicting credit booms.
Financial sector reforms and productivity gains also
help predict these booms; however, their predictive
value is lower. The predictive gains of combining

all these factors into a single model are marginal.
The model with net capital inflows as a covariate
(Table 1.2.1, column 1) shows that this variable is
highly significant and possesses an AUC of 0.7. Past
financial sector reforms and productivity gains are
also important predictors of a credit boom (Table
1.2.1, columns 2 and 3); however, their significance
level, fit, and AUC statistics are not as good as
those of capital inflows. The model that includes all
these factors simultaneously shows only marginal
predictive gains vis-à-vis the model including only
past net capital inflows (Table 1.2.1, column 4;

Figure 1.2.1, bottom panel). These results do not
change materially if interaction terms are considered. The specification that includes an interaction
term between productivity gains and the advanced
economy dummy suggests that past productivity
gains are strong predictors of credit booms in these
economies, but not in emerging markets (Table
1.2.1, columns 5 and 6).
To explore the possibility that net capital inflows
are capturing the effects of easy international
financial conditions on domestic credit booms, we
include in the regression analysis proxies for return
(the real interest rate) and volatility (Chicago Board
Options Exchange Market Volatility Index) in the
United States. Although these variables have the
expected signs, they are not statistically significant
(Table 1.2.1, columns 7 and 8). Moreover, when
included with net capital inflows, the predictive
power of the volatility variable remains broadly
unchanged (Table 1.2.1, columns 9 and 10).

What Are the Policy Implications?
Although net capital inflows have well-known
benefits for long-term economic growth, they often
raise concern among policymakers because they can

50

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

undermine an economy’s short-term competitiveness.
The findings of this box suggest that they are also good
predictors of credit booms and merit close monitoring
for this reason alone. Given the high costs of credit
boom-bust cycles, policymakers should closely monitor
the joint behavior of capital inflows and domestic lending.6 There is also evidence that financial sector reforms
are predictors of credit boom-busts. Policymakers
must ensure that financial liberalization programs
are designed to strengthen financial stability frameworks. Last, there is evidence that large productivity
gains increase the risk of a credit boom, particularly
in advanced economies, driven perhaps by exuberant
optimism in new sectors. Thus, even during particularly good periods for the economy, policymakers must
be on the lookout for emerging threats to financial
stability stemming from credit booms.
6Policymakers can use a combination of macroeconomic,
exchange rate, prudential policy, and capital control measures
to mitigate the adverse effects of large capital inflows. Ostry
and others (2011) discuss in detail policymakers’ diverse
policy options for addressing different kinds of capital inflows,
which is important in light of evidence that net debt flows are
better predictors of credit booms than foreign direct investment flows.

box 1.3. are equity price drops harbingers of recession?
The recent sharp drop in equity prices around
the world has raised concerns about the possibility
of a double-dip recession in a number of advanced
economies. Several factors may have played a role
in this fall in equity prices: the sovereign debt
problems in the euro area; a downgrade of U.S.
federal government debt; and the limited room for
policy maneuver by advanced economies that are
facing a weaker-than-expected economic recovery.
To the extent that such factors simultaneously
affect confidence and equity prices, an equity price
drop can be indicative of a greater risk of recession,
reflecting falling earnings expectations. In their own
right, weak or falling equity prices can be a drag on
consumption and investment through their effects
on private sector wealth and borrowing constraints.
Accordingly, many think that a double-dip recession
in the United States and other advanced economies
has become more likely. However, others have noted
that equity price drops have not always been good
predictors of recessions. As Paul Samuelson (1966)
famously remarked, “The stock market has forecast
nine of the last five recessions.”
This box examines the performance of equity prices
as coincident predictors of a new recession in France,
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.1
Table 1.3.1 displays summary statistics on quarterly
real equity price changes for these countries from the
first quarter of 1970 through the first half of 2011.
We find that real equity prices in these economies are
useful predictors of recessions. However, in contrast
with the existing literature, there is some evidence of
important nonlinearities in the relationship between
equity prices and recessions among those economies
for which equity prices had predictive power. Equity

1The beginnings of new recessions are defined according to
the method of Harding and Pagan (2002), as implemented by
Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2011c). A cyclical peak or start
of a new recession is defined to occur in a quarter if the level
of real GDP is higher than during both the prior two quarters
and the subsequent two quarters. For the United States, the
Harding and Pagan–identified peaks exactly coincide with the
NBER-identified peaks in four cases and precede the NBER
peak by one quarter in the other two cases.

real equity prices of 5 percent or more, significantly
improve the accuracy of recession predictions for the
United Kingdom and the United States but not for
France and Japan.2
We also investigate whether the predictive power
of equity prices in our simple probability model is
materially changed by the addition of other financial variables, including a measure of spillovers from
equity markets elsewhere, the term spread, real house
price growth, real credit growth, or real oil price
peaks. For Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States, real equity prices remain an important
and statistically significant coincident predictor of a
new recession across all checks. This may be a reflection of the fact that these economies are home to the
largest equity markets in the world. Apart from the
case in which a measure of international equity prices
is included, domestic equity prices are also an important predictor of a new recession in France.
Finally, we look at the predictive power of real
equity price declines in the three other G7 economies. For Canada and Germany, there is no evidence
2The

choice of 5 percent as the threshold is based on the
evidence presented in Claessens, Kose, and Terrones (2011c)
that equity price busts (the bottom quartile of periods characterized by equity price falls) have a median decline of about
5½ percent a quarter (Table 4, column 4).

that equity prices aid in predicting recessions, whereas
for Italy, their predictive power is consistently superseded by the inclusion of additional financial market
variables. Consequently, the remainder of the box
focuses on the evidence for France, Japan, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.3

Recession Forecasting
Real-time recession prediction remains an elusive
endeavor (Hamilton, 2010). Forecasters are confronted with data limitations, changing economic
relationships, and sometimes perverse incentive
schemes (Loungani and Trehan, 2002). Although
some leading indicator models find that equity
prices help improve output growth forecasts for the
United States, these models have failed to predict
recent recessions (Stock and Watson, 2003).
More recent efforts to forecast the onset of a recession have used straightforward probabilistic models,
such as logit or probit. These models take advantage of
the fact that cyclical peaks can be modeled as binary
indicators (with a value of 1 when the economy has
reached its peak and zero otherwise). The most important finding of this literature is that the term spread
(the difference between the long-term interest rate and
the short-term interest rate) is an important predictor
of recessions in the euro area (Moneta, 2003) and the
United States (Estrella and Mishkin, 1998; Estrella,
2005; Wright, 2006; and Nyberg, 2010). A number
of these studies also find that domestic equity prices
can be useful in predicting recessions (Estrella and
Mishkin, 1998; and Nyberg, 2010). This literature,
however, does not examine in detail the role that other
financial variables, such as international equity prices,
house prices, and credit, play in forecasting recessions.
Recent research indicates that developments in these
markets are associated with the characteristics of recessions and recoveries (Claessens, Kose, and Terrones,
2011c).

Predicting the Probability of a New Recession

Kingdom, and the United States, we use a simple
probabilistic model for each economy. The explanatory variables included in our baseline logit model
are the contemporaneous quarterly growth rate of the
economy’s average real equity price index, an indicator variable for whether the real equity price index
dropped quarter-over-quarter by 5 percent or more,
and the interaction (product) of these two variables.
This model allows us to explore the relevance of
nonlinearities in the information conveyed by equity
price changes about the likelihood of a recession. In
particular, sharp drops in equity prices are more likely
to be followed by a new recession, reflecting both
the destruction of private sector wealth and possible
underlying weaknesses in the macroeconomy.
The following findings stand out (Table 1.3.2):
• In the United Kingdom and the United States,
there is evidence of important nonlinearities in
the information that equity prices convey about
the probability of a new recession. This is shown
in the statistical significance of equity price
growth, the equity price drop indicator, and their
interaction as predictors of a new recession. The
in-sample performance of the baseline model for
these economies is very strong, as reflected by
AUC statistics of 0.85 and 0.90, respectively.4
As seen in Table 1.3.2, column 3, the average
probability of a new recession occurring in any
quarter, conditional upon observing a drop in
equity prices of 5 percent or more, is around
20 percent. By contrast, if no equity price drop
is observed, the estimated average probability is
insignificantly different from zero. To get a sense
for how equity price growth, which is continuous,
affects the probability of a new recession, we calculate the marginal effect on the average recession
probability of a 1 percent fall in equity prices. As
shown in Table 1.3.2, column 1, if only equity
price growth is included, the marginal effect of
4The AUC statistic is the area under the receiver operating
characteristic, which is described in Box 1.2. It is indicative of
how well the model classifies the start of a recession versus the
absence of recession observations in-sample, relative to a fair
coin toss (which would have a 50 percent chance of correctly
classifying the situation). A perfect classifier would have an
AUC statistic of 1.

a 1 percent fall is a rise in the estimated probability of a new recession by around 0.7 percent
for the United States and around 0.5 percent for
the United Kingdom. If the equity price drop
indicator and its interaction with equity price
growth are included, the marginal effect of equity
price growth alone is tiny and no longer statistically significant in helping to predict a recession,
revealing the importance of nonlinearities in the
form of large equity price drops.
• Interestingly, this nonlinearity in the predictive
power of equity prices is not evident for France
and Japan. Instead, there appears to be a robust,
linear relationship between equity price growth
and the likelihood of a new recession—large equity
price drops do not appear to convey any more
information than small drops. The in-sample performance of this model is also strong, as reflected
in an AUC of 0.82 for France and 0.91 for Japan.
The marginal effect of a 1 percent fall in equity
prices is associated with a rise in the probability of
a new recession of between 0.5 and 0.6 percent for
France and 0.6 and 0.9 percent for Japan.
As noted earlier, we also investigate whether
the predictive power of equity prices is materially
changed by the addition of other financial variables
(such as the term spread, real house prices, and real
credit) and real oil prices. Apart from one instance
in the case of France, equity prices remain important, coincident predictors of new recessions. The
additional financial variables that improve recession
prediction differed across these economies. For the
United States, a measure of spillovers from equity
price movements in the G7, the term spread, and the
change in real house prices are all significant predictors of new recessions.5 For the United Kingdom,
5The measure of spillovers from equity price movements
is defined as the weighted average of quarter-over-quarter,
real equity price growth in the G7 economies, with the
weight being nominal GDP in U.S. dollars. The term spread
is defined to be the difference between the interest rate on
a 10-year government bond and that on a three-month
Treasury bill. Real house price changes are calculated from real
house price data supplied by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Real credit growth is calculated from the CPI-deflated credit (line 22d) in the IMF’s
International Financial Statistics. Peak real oil price growth is

already in recession and the quarter just after a recession concludes.

index extends to the end of the quarter. We then calculate the

peak real oil price growth serving as a significant
predictor, while the measure of equity spillovers,

France, the measure of equity spillovers and the term
spread are important predictors. In the model that

Despite the statistical significance of some of the
additional financial variables, the in-sample performance (as measured by the AUC statistic) is not
statistically significantly different from the baseline
model (column 3 of Table 1.3.2) for any of the four
economies.

What Does This Say about the Future?
This box examines the performance of sharp
drops in equity prices in predicting new recessions
in France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States. The findings suggest that allowing
for nonlinearities in the effects of equity prices can
be useful in predicting recessions in the United
Kingdom and the United States. Although there
is no evidence of such nonlinearities in France
and Japan, equity price changes still show up as
useful coincident predictors of new recessions.
These findings suggest that policymakers should
be mindful of sharp drops in equity prices because

they are associated with an increased risk of a new
recession.
An application of the baseline model paints a
sobering picture about the likelihood of a doubledip recession in France, the United Kingdom, and
the United States in light of the recent sharp drop
in equity prices. As seen in Figure 1.3.1, the historical or unconditional probabilities of a new recession
starting in the third quarter of 2011 are about 3½
percent for France and the United Kingdom and
about 4½ percent for the United States. Assuming
that the recent behavior of the equity markets in
these economies during the third quarter of 2011
continues, the predicted likelihood of a new recession rises about fivefold for France and the United
Kingdom (to about 18 percent and 17 percent,
respectively) and eightfold for the United States (to
about 38 percent). By contrast, the model for Japan
indicates that there has been essentially no change
in the likelihood of a new recession there.

box 1.4. Financial Investment, Speculation, and commodity prices
Was financial speculation a major force behind
the commodity price boom of 2003–08 and behind
stubbornly high prices since the end of the Great
Recession? This question continues to be widely
debated against the backdrop of the financialization
of commodity markets—that is, the greater role of
noncommercial participants (including speculators
and long-term investors) in commodity derivative
markets and large increases both in trading volume
and in outstanding stocks of derivatives (Figure
1.4.1).
There is an element of déjà vu to this debate,
given the long tradition of attributing commodity
price increases and booms to speculation.1 In earlier
episodes, however, the focus was on traditional
speculation through inventory hoarding. This box
reviews the financialization of commodity markets
and its impact on commodity prices, building on
recent research.2 It argues that although financialization has influenced commodity price behavior,
recent research does not provide strong evidence
to suggest that it either destabilizes or distorts spot
markets. In this light, policy efforts should focus on
making markets work better at a time of structural
change in global commodity markets.

The Case for Attributing High Commodity Prices
to Financialization
Many arguments have been advanced to support
the view that financialization has driven commodity spot prices over the past decade.3 At the risk of
oversimplifying, their essence is that commodity
markets have had trouble adjusting to financialization because of one imbalance and two distortions.
• The imbalance is the continued large inflow into
derivative markets by long-only investors seeking
exposure to commodity prices. These inflows
have led to an upward shift in the demand for
commodity futures and upward pressure on

futures prices. Because commodity spot and
futures prices are connected through price discovery linkages and arbitrage, spot prices could also
be affected by this upward pressure.
• This imbalance contributes to the first distortion.
After years of rapid growth, open positions and
trading volumes in commodity derivative markets
now exceed transactions in physical markets, suggesting that investors now dominate commodity
price formation.4
• The second distortion arises from an investment strategy widely used by institutional
investors—indexing—which is seen as having
led to “noise trading” (trading by investors on
the basis of erroneous beliefs or other reasons
unrelated to market fundamentals or meaningful
new information).The strategy builds exposure through a synthetic derivative, issued by a
financial intermediary, which tracks returns on a
fixed-weight portfolio of commodity futures. The
noise trading arises through the intermediation
process, which implies that demand simultaneously increases for the whole set of underlying
futures, irrespective of specific market conditions
and prospects for the individual commodities. It
could thus affect both futures and spot prices, as
above.
Together, the distortions imply that fundamentals may not fully explain recent commodity price
increases, reflecting the destabilizing effects of noise
traders.5

Recent Empirical Evidence Concerning Such
Imbalances and Distortions
In the absence of a recognized fair value for commodities, recent research has tried to find evidence
that apparent imbalances and distortions have
destabilizing effects on prices. There is no general
evidence of increased commodity price volatility
since the onset of financialization in the early 2000s
(Figure 1.4.2).
4The well-known testimony of Masters (2008) at a U.S.
congressional hearing exemplifies this view.
5The effects of noise trading in finance are examined
by Shleifer and Summers (1990) and De Long and others
(1990).

If noise trading (and destabilizing speculation more
generally) had become more important, commodity
price volatility should have increased. On the other
hand, if investors provide liquidity and facilitate
price discovery, price volatility would be expected to
decrease. Although there is no general evidence of
increased price volatility across the 51 commodities
included in the IMF’s commodity price index, there
are two points worth noting. First, there are occasional increases in volatility, before and after financialization. But in most cases, times of higher volatility
can be attributed to specific factors, such as the Great
Recession of 2008–09 or times of low inventories

(metal prices during 2005–07). Second, the price
volatility of a number of major food commodities
has increased over the past few years (see also Roache,
2010). Although fundamentals likely contributed to
this increase (for example, low inventories and bad
weather), it is difficult to establish statistically significant relationships in this respect.
Evidence based on other approaches to assessing
the impact of financialization suggests the following.
• A large number of studies covering different time
periods and commodities have not found evidence
that changes in futures positions of financial
(“noncommercial”) investors in U.S. markets had
statistically significant effects on subsequent futures
price changes.6 If order flows from commodity financial investment affected price dynamics
beyond the usual horizon of a few hours to a few
days, such predictive power should be apparent.7
• The forecast performance of futures prices—the
success in predicting future spot prices—does
not depend on whether markets are in a bull
or a bear market phase (Roache and Reichsfeld,
2011).8 If bull markets involved an element of
price overshooting driven by the herd behavior
of uninformed long-only investors, the forecast
performance of futures prices would be expected
to deteriorate during such market phases.
• Global macroeconomic factors explain a large
and broadly stable share of commodity price
fluctuations.9 In addition, Kilian (2009) found
that shocks to global activity explain a large part
of the run-up in oil prices during 2003–08. If
noise trading had become more important, the
6See, for example, Büyükşahin and others (2009). Singleton
(2011) is a notable exception.
7This analysis, based on so-called Granger causality tests,
long suffered from data shortcomings. But more recent studies based on disaggregated data that allow identification of
trading behavior of specific investor categories (such as swap
dealers) have corroborated earlier findings. Studies based on
daily data have yielded similar results.
8Similarly, Alquist and Gervais (2011) do not find evidence
that changes in investor positions have statistically significant
effects on the spread between futures and spot prices. They would
have such an effect if expectations of future spot prices embedded
in futures prices were driven primarily by noise traders.
9See, for example, Vansteenkiste (2009); Helbling (2011);
and Roache (2011).

58

unexplained share in econometric models of commodity price fluctuations would have increased.
Because global macroeconomic factors influence
all commodities to some extent, comovement in
commodity prices over the past few years does
not seem unusual.
• Inventories of major commodities did not rise
steadily during the boom of 2003–08. If the price
boom had reflected simply the unrealistically bullish expectations of uninformed investors, such a
situation could be sustained only with increasing
inventory hoarding. Otherwise, physical markets
would not clear as consumption declined with
ever-rising prices.10 This stylized fact rules out
simple bubble explanations of the 2003–08 commodity price boom, but it does not preclude shortlived price overshooting because of noise trading
(given price-inelastic demand in the short term). It
also does not preclude interaction between financialization and the cyclical behavior of the demand
for commodity inventories, including because of
changes in the cost of hedging.

Why Is the Empirical Evidence of These
Imbalances and Distortions So Inconclusive?
Although recent research does not rule out spot
price effects of commodity market financialization,
it has not uncovered a smoking gun for obvious
price misalignments or destabilizing effects due to
financial speculation. This broad conclusion still
seems counterintuitive to many. A number of factors
can help reconcile evidence and intuition.
In practice, there is greater diversity among investors and investment strategies than the caricature of
new market participants as index investors suggests.
Hedge funds, which now account for a substantial
share of the holdings of commodity derivatives in
U.S. markets, often go long or short, depending on
10This argument was put forward in the oil market context
by Krugman (2008), drawing on Jovanovic (2007). Alternatively, as noted by Hamilton (2009), if producers shared
investors’ expectations, they would lower current production
to produce more later when prices are higher. But, again, if
unrealistic expectations by investors were the initial driving
force, they would ultimately be validated by fundamentals in
the physical market.

circumstances.11 They also pursue arbitrage strategies, which may offset distortions from indexing
strategies.12 Many of the large new investors are
also well informed and follow supply and demand
closely.
Supply constraints play very different roles in
commodity futures markets compared with physical commodity markets. In the latter, they are the
main reason for very small short-term supply price
elasticities (see below), whereas in futures markets,
limits to arbitrage by large informed investors and
financial intermediaries are the main obstacle to
highly elastic supply. Although arbitrage is sometimes limited—for example, because of capital
or risk constraints—it usually is a strong force
even though it may have occasional spillovers into
physical markets.13 As a result, price pressure from
increased futures demand by index investors typically seems small in practice.
Commodity market fundamentals can also
explain the large, abrupt price changes that are
sometimes attributed to speculation. Because physical demand and supply are highly price-inelastic in
the short and sometimes also in the medium term,
unexpected small changes in demand or supply
fundamentals, including, for example, in global
activity, can trigger large rapid price changes. In
other words, large initial price increases are often
needed to induce the demand reduction and supply increases needed for market clearing (and vice
versa). Temporary price spikes can be amplified if
inventory or spare capacity buffers are low and consumers fear physical shortages. Such amplification,
while not always present, can introduce regimeswitching behavior in commodity prices.
Another consideration is that, even if commodity market financialization does influence pricing, it
is not clear that the effects on spot prices are large,
especially at cyclical horizons. The price changes
11See

Büyükşahin and Robe (2010), among others.
and Sanders (2010) noted that the behavior
of index investors is very predictable, thereby facilitating
arbitrage.
13Spillovers are also possible because liquidity suppliers in
futures markets may seek to arbitrage index investors without
assuming additional risk by taking offsetting long spot and
short futures positions.

would be the result of closer integration of commodity derivative markets into global financial
markets.14 A first obvious channel for change is that
an expanding, broader set of market participants
(which includes participants who also invest in
other markets) means that unexpected changes in
global factors may now be priced more rapidly and
more in sync with other financial markets. Second,

for example, Tang and Xiong (2011).

box 1.4 (continued)
commodity prices might respond more to global
risk premiums, as investors compare their risks and
expected returns on commodities to those of other
financial assets in their portfolios.
These changes in pricing can be expected to affect
high-frequency price dynamics, but they may not
affect commodity price behavior at monthly or
quarterly frequencies. The reason is that these same
underlying factors influenced commodity prices
long before financialization. Factors such as prospects for global activity, for example, have always
influenced prices through their effects on commodity supply and demand. Similarly, the risk premiums
that compensate commodity futures investors—part
of the well-known risk transfer function of futures
markets—were present before financialization.
Although they have not yet been closely scrutinized,
there is no evidence of fundamental changes in
commodity futures risk premiums (Figure 1.4.3).
Finally, research remains constrained by a lack
of data. In particular, data that differentiate positions by type of trader have only recently become
available and cover only U.S. markets for a five-year
period. Such differentiation is needed to examine
the impact of new investors on indicators of market
performance such as futures returns and risk premiums, given the great diversity in trading strategies

60

among traders and investors. Promising research
along these lines has only begun.14

Does Commodity Market Financialization Call
for Policy Action?
In sum, recent research does not provide strong
evidence that commodity market financialization has
had obvious destabilizing effects. On the other hand,
there is evidence that it has added to market liquidity,
which generally enhances rather than distorts price
discovery. And a number of recent developments that
are often perceived to be anomalies can be explained
based on fundamentals. For example, after a recession,
when evolving expectations about the path of global
economic recovery are key factors in asset price fluctuations, high correlation between equity and commodity
prices should not be a surprise. The conclusion is that
commodity market financialization does not call for
urgent policy intervention. Nevertheless, at a time of
rapid structural change in global commodity markets—significant and largely permanent shifts in the
sources and strength of demand for major commodities amid new supply challenges and changing market
structures—it is important to ensure a framework for
the proper functioning of globalized markets.
14Etula (2009) and Büyükşahin and Robe (2010) are recent
examples.

box 1.5. external liabilities and crisis tipping points
The extent to which the level of a country’s net
external liabilities affects the risk of a debt crisis is an
important policy question. This is particularly true in
economies in which rising fiscal and current account
deficits have translated into an unprecedented accumulation of net foreign liabilities (NFLs), as in many
advanced economies and some emerging markets in
recent years. The aim of this box is to characterize
whether there are in fact “thresholds” beyond which
the risk of being tipped into an external crisis becomes
nontrivial and accelerates with further exposure.
Such thresholds can be gauged by examining
NFL levels around crisis episodes. Recent developments, particularly in Europe, suggest that such
tipping points in external liabilities are not exclusive
to emerging markets (EMs), so the analysis here
includes both EMs and advanced economies. Debt
crises are defined either as an outright external
default or the disbursement of a large multilateral
financial support package, including IMF support.
The latter is considered large when net disbursements from a program’s inception to its end are at
least twice as large as the respective economy’s IMF
quota. The sample contains 62 crisis events in a
panel of 74 economies over the period 1970–2010.
Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2011) provide additional
information on the data and sample selection.
The top panel of Figure 1.5.1 plots the evolution
of cross-country means of the ratio of net foreign
assets (NFA) to GDP, within an eight-year window
centered on the crisis outbreak, delimited by the
upper and lower quartiles around the mean. Crisis
events are split into two groups: one comprising
crises occurring during 2007–10 and the other comprising crises over 1970–2007. One reason for this
split is that the recent crises are ongoing, and so the
full set of pre- and postcrisis observations is not yet
available; the other reason is to allow comparison
between recent and past crises.
The top panel of Figure 1.5.1 shows that the runup period to external crises is typically characterized
by a gradual NFA deterioration, which tends to be
steeper during the two-year window before the event
The main authors of this box are Luis Catão and Gian
Maria Milesi-Ferretti.

box 1.5 (continued)
for both pre-2007 and post-2007 crises. Recent crises
were triggered at higher NFL levels: although the
cross-country mean points to a tipping point threshold between 40 percent and 50 percent, recent crises
point to a threshold around 60 percent.
Some models of debt and external crises emphasize
that openness tends to raise the cost of default and that
the ratio of exports to GDP is a rough gauge of an
economy’s capacity to generate revenues sufficient to
repay its external liabilities. This suggests that exports
of goods and services can serve as an alternative scaling variable for NFL. Such a metric is plotted in the
second panel of Figure 1.4.1, which shows narrower
differences in NFL positions between the pre- and
post-2007 crises: both recent and past crises are now
suggestive of a tipping point at about 200 percent of
exports of goods and services. This is equivalent to an
average NFL-to-GDP threshold of 60 percent once
the exports-to-GDP ratio averages 30 percent. So the
somewhat lower crisis threshold (about 50 percent)
that typically characterized pre-2007 episodes appears
attributable in part to lower trade openness.
Because debt liabilities—as opposed to equity
liabilities—tend to be particularly burdensome in times
of economic distress, including because for emerging markets they are often denominated in foreign
currency, it seems important to disaggregate NFL into
its debt and equity components.1 Specifically, the net
equity position is defined as the sum of a country’s net
foreign direct investment and portfolio equity positions, whereas the net debt position reflects the sum of
the net position in other investment instruments (such
as loans and deposits), portfolio debt instruments,
and net foreign exchange reserves. The third panel of
Figure 1.5.1 shows that crises have not typically been
accompanied by a rise in net equity liabilities, but
these have been on average much larger in recent crises
than in pre-2007 crises. Still, debt liabilities appear to
have a much stronger link to crises, and the bottom
panel shows in particular how the 2007–10 crises were
preceded by a dramatic increase in net external debt.
Although the above discussion has focused on
individual NFL variables, to establish causality between
1Data that would allow calculation of countries' net foreign
currency positions are unfortunately unavailable.

62

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

NFLs and debt crises allowance must be made for the
role of other factors. In addition, it is important to
examine econometrically whether the effect is in fact
nonlinear—that is, whether it grows stronger closer to
the crisis tipping points. To this end, the first column
of Table 1.5.1 reports the results of a probit regression
in which the dependent variable equals 1 when there
is a crisis and zero otherwise. The estimated coefficient
shows that as NFA decreases there is a statistically
significant increase in crisis risk. As with probit models,
the respective elasticity (marginal effect) varies nonlinearly with the level of NFL and approaches 1 percent
on average around crises—that is, a 1 percentage point
increase in NFL tends to increase the probability of
crisis by roughly the same amount.
The second column in the table disaggregates NFA
into the net position in debt instruments and equity
instruments. As discussed earlier, the net debt position
is far more important than the net equity position in
accounting for crisis risk. (The estimated coefficient
of 1.4 percent is statistically significant and some four
times as large as that for equity.) The third column of
Table 1.5.1 controls for a variety of variables that are
widely held to affect crisis risk. Of these, the negative
coefficient on foreign exchange reserves is notable. It
implies that higher reserves reduce the probability of a
crisis over and above their effects through an economy’s NFA and net debt position. One rationale for this
effect is that foreign exchange reserves are a tool under
the direct control of a policymaker, unlike, say, private
sector deposits overseas. As a result, foreign exchange
reserves can provide a more effective offset to external
liabilities than can private sector assets.
The effect of other variables is broadly consistent
with what economic theory suggests. A higher current
account balance relative to GDP lowers the probability
of crisis, whereas appreciation (a rise in the index) of
the real exchange rate relative to its five-year moving
average increases the probability of a crisis. Economies
that are historically more volatile (with volatility measured as the standard deviation of the output gap over
a 10-year window) tend to be more prone to crisis,
whereas richer countries (measured by their constant
GDP per capita in thousands of U.S. dollars) are
less so. Another important variable included in these
regressions—not featured in previous studies in this

literature—is the spread between U.S. AAA and AAB
corporate bonds, which is a proxy for global financial
conditions and attitudes toward risk. The estimates
show that the higher such spreads, the higher the crisis
probability. Interestingly, an independent role for fiscal
variables such as public debt to GDP and general
government deficits for GDP was considered but not
found to be statistically significant. This suggests that
the effect of these fiscal variables on crisis risk occurs
via their effects on net foreign debt and/or the remaining explanatory variables.
The final column in Table 1.5.1 distinguishes
between pre- and post-2007 crises by interacting
the net debt and net equity variables, respectively,
with a dummy variable, defined as 1 for 2007–10
and zero otherwise. The purpose is to gauge whether
the effect of net foreign debt and net foreign equity
positions on crisis risk has changed since 2007. The
point estimate of –0.74 for the debt variable indi-

cates that higher debt positions have had a stronger
effect during recent crises. A similar result is found
for net equity positions, but the effect is not statistically significant at 5 percent.2
How well does this empirical model predict “out
of sample” the most recent wave of crises? To address
that question, the specification of column (3) was
run for the period up to 2007, and fitted values were
constructed for the probability of a crisis in the subsequent period. Results in Table 1.5.2 show that the
model correctly predicts a “high” probability of crisis
(10 percent or above) for 6 out of 11 economies that
actually suffered a major debt crisis during 2008–10.3
2A fuller set of regressions and discussion, including a
robustness analysis for an alternative crisis definition, is available from Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2011).
3Because the unconditional probability of a crisis in the sample
is about 3 percent (62 crisis events in close to 2,000 observations), a 10 percent probability of a crisis is quite elevated.

Moreover, several countries in the table designated
as having “no crisis” according to our strict default/
multilateral bailout definition (for example, Bulgaria,
Estonia, Lithuania, Spain) did undergo severe output
contractions (contemporaneously and/or a year later)
and faced macroeconomic distress related to the need
for broader external adjustment.
To sum up, once economies’ NFL rises above 40
percent of GDP and is composed mostly of debt
liabilities, the risk of crisis accelerates with further
net liability exposure. There is also evidence that
this threshold may have shifted upward—to the 50
to 60 percent range—in recent years, reflecting, at
least in part, greater trade openness. The effect of
net external debt on the probability of a crisis is
strong even after controlling for other fundamentals
such as real exchange rate appreciation, the current
account balance, and the level of development. We
also find evidence that higher reserves mitigate crisis
risk, over and above their effects on the net debt
position.
Among the G20 countries, the model generally finds crisis probabilities below or close to
the unconditional sample crisis probability of 3
percent (62 crises/1,999 observations), with the

past information and historical crisis patterns and
hence do not fully take into account the current
and expected future trend behavior of some important variables (including, for example, public debt
dynamics in the euro area, Japan, and the United
States; the strong public sector balance sheet and

external liabilities predominantly in domestic
currency in Australia; as well as NFL in some
current account deficit countries) and likely place
too much weight on the mitigating effect of high
per capita income on crisis risk (given the small
number of external crises in advanced economies
during the sample period).

country and regional perspectives

The global economy has slowed, financial volatility and
investor risk aversion have sharply increased, and performance has continued to diverge across regions (Figure 2.1).
In the United States, weak growth and the lack of a credible medium-term fiscal plan to reduce debt are draining
confidence. Europe is gripped with financial strains from
the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area periphery. How
these advanced economies confront their fiscal challenges will
profoundly affect their economic prospects. Emerging and
developing economies as a group continue to expand, a few
at rates well above their precrisis averages. However, growth
will likely moderate as the slowdown in major advanced
economies weighs on external demand. Finally, inflation
remains elevated (Figure 2.2). Although this is explained
mainly by resurgent commodity prices in the first half of
the year, in some economies, demand pressures—stoked by
accommodative policies, strong credit growth, and capital

inflows—have contributed as well. Policy tightening, to
eliminate inflation pressure and strengthen fiscal accounts,
is essential to sustain balanced growth in these economies.
Where overheating and fiscal risks are not imminent, further
tightening can wait until risks to global stability subside.

Almost three years after the crisis, the global
economy continues to be challenged with intermittent volatility. Economic performance has become
even more bipolar in nature, with anemic growth in
economies with large precrisis imbalances and robust
activity in many others. As discussed earlier, the
unbalanced expansion reflects an inadequate transition from public to private demand in advanced
economies and from external-demand-driven growth
to domestic-demand-driven growth in key emerging and developing economies. Without progress on

Economies that experienced the worst financial crises are still struggling with modest
growth and persistent economic slack. Others are growing relatively strongly, with
many emerging and developing economies hitting up against capacity constraints.
Notwithstanding economic cycles, inflation remains elevated, reflecting resurgent
commodity prices earlier in the year as well as demand pressures in some economies.

these fronts, global economic and financial stability
will remain at risk.
This chapter outlines the variable global outlook by
region. Growth in the United States has weakened with
a sluggish transition from public to private demand. In
Europe, spillover risks from the financial and economic woes in the euro area periphery have intensified.
Elsewhere, growth is more solid, but the loss in U.S.
and euro area momentum will weigh on prospects.
The recovery of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) is being helped in part by strong commodity prices thus far. Japan is successfully pulling out of
its recession inflicted by the March Great East Japan
earthquake and tsunami. In emerging Asia, activity is
still robust, despite the supply-chain disruptions caused
by the Japanese earthquake. South America also shows
strong growth but the Caribbean and Central America
less so. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many economies
are gaining momentum. In the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA), social unrest has hurt growth in some
economies, but solid oil prices have boosted output in
the region’s oil exporters.

the united states: Weakening again amid
daunting debt challenges
The U.S. economy is struggling to gain a strong foothold, with sluggish growth (Figure 2.3) and a protracted
job recovery. Downside risks weigh on the outlook given
fiscal uncertainty, weakness in the housing market and
household finances, renewed financial stress, and subdued
consumer and business sentiment. Bold political commitment to put in place a medium-term debt reduction
plan is imperative to avoid a sudden collapse of market
confidence that could seriously disrupt global stability. At
the same time, renewal of some of the temporary stimulus
measures—within the medium-term fiscal envelope—
and accommodative monetary policy can partly cushion
private activity. The prompt implementation of the
Dodd-Frank Act will minimize risks to financial stability
from a prolonged period of low interest rates. In Canada,
downdrafts from its southern neighbor will be offset in
part by relatively healthy economic fundamentals and still
supportive commodity prices.
U.S. economic activity has lost steam in 2011
(Figure 2.4). Growth slowed from an annual rate of

2¾ percent in the second half of 2010 to 1 percent
in the first half of 2011. Although a slowdown was
expected—given the automotive supply disruptions
resulting from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami
and the drag on domestic demand from steep oil price
gains until April—the deceleration in activity was
deeper than projected in the June 2011 WEO Update.
In the meantime, household and business confidence
have markedly deteriorated and market volatility significantly increased on concerns about the tepid recovery,
the recent downgrade in the U.S. sovereign credit rating, and rising tensions from Europe. Inflation appears
to have peaked with the recent retreat in commodity
prices. Weak job growth and persistent economic slack
are holding back wages.
Economic growth is projected to average 1½ to
1¾ percent in 2011–12 (Table 2.1). The forecast
assumes that the negative effects of the Japanese
earthquake and energy prices will taper off in the

second half of the year and that the temporary
payroll tax cuts and increase in unemployment
insurance will be renewed in 2012. However, the
damage to consumer and business confidence from
the ongoing equity market losses, weak house prices
(which are assumed to pick up slowly from the
second half of 2012), and, last but not least, the
pressure to deleverage imply that growth will be
modest relative to historical averages for years to
come. Unemployment, currently at 9.1 percent, is
expected to remain high through 2012. The sustained output gap will keep inflation in check, with
headline inflation receding from 3 percent in 2011
to 1¼ percent in 2012, in line with the pullback in
commodity prices.
In Canada, growth is forecast to moderate from
3¼ percent in 2010 to 2 percent during 2011–12,
reflecting ongoing fiscal withdrawal and downdrafts from the U.S. slowdown. Although jobs

Growth has weakened, and growing concerns about the recovery and uncertain fiscal
stance have undermined confidence and financial stability. Fiscal policy needs to
achieve medium-term debt sustainability while supporting the recovery through the
renewal of temporary stimulus measures beyond 2011. Current fiscal plans will not
help reduce external imbalances over the medium term, given more durable fiscal
tightening projected for the largest U.S. trading partners.

have rebounded at a faster pace than in the United
States, a slower pace of recovery over the near term
is expected to keep unemployment at 7½ to 7¾
percent during 2011–12.
Downside risks to the U.S. outlook have significantly increased. Growth will suffer if the temporary payroll tax cuts and increased unemployment
insurance are not continued into 2012. Also, failure
to reach political consensus on the design of debt
reduction by this fall will result in more front-loaded
deficit cuts than currently assumed, with attendant
negative effects on growth. More fundamentally,
delays in accomplishing an adequate mediumterm debt-reduction plan could suddenly induce
an increase in the U.S. risk premium, with major
global ramifications. As recently observed, shocks to
the U.S. bond and stock markets tend to reverberate through major economies, and U.S. interest rate
shocks have a strong bearing on emerging market
spreads.1 Other risks include a more protracted house
price recovery than assumed under the baseline,
sustained losses in equity markets, and upside risks
on commodity prices, which would further depress
consumer spending. On the upside, growth in the
second half of the year could be stronger if financial
stability and consumer and business confidence are
restored sooner than anticipated. However, risks
point down overall. These risks also shape Canada’s
outlook, through real and financial spillovers.
The first priority for the U.S. authorities is to
commit to a credible fiscal policy agenda that places
public debt on a sustainable track over the medium
term, while supporting the near-term recovery. For
this, the fiscal consolidation plan should be based
on realistic macroeconomic assumptions and should
comprise entitlement reform and revenue-raising
measures (for example, gradual removal of loopholes
and deductions in the tax system and enhanced
indirect taxes).2 This would allow the near-term
fiscal policy stance to be more attuned to the cycle,
for example, through temporary stimulus to support
labor and housing markets, state and local governments, and infrastructure spending. With a less

ambitious medium-term fiscal strategy in place, fiscal
consolidation would need to be more front-loaded,
comprising a withdrawal of 1 to 1½ percent of GDP
in 2012, but including at least temporary payroll tax
cuts and increased unemployment insurance through
2012 to contain the drag on near-term growth.3
For Canada, which is in a sounder fiscal and financial position than the United States, ongoing fiscal
tightening can continue, but there is policy room to
pause if downside risks to growth keep rising.
The much weaker than previously projected U.S. outlook calls for a more sustained period of accommodative interest rates, as recently announced by the Federal
Reserve. The Federal Reserve should also stand ready to
implement further unconventional support, as needed,
as long as inflation expectations remain subdued.
3See Chapter 1 and IMF (2011g) for details. In September, President Obama proposed a package of additional stimulus measures
that would extend unemployment benefits, extend and deepen payroll tax deductions for workers, introduce new payroll tax reductions
for employers and special tax credits for hiring the long-term unemployed, and increase spending on infrastructure and on transfers to
state and local governments. The equivalent of about 40 percent of
this package was already incorporated in IMF staff forecasts. The
proposed package would be financed through revenue measures,
including a cap on tax deductions and exemptions for high-income
earners. If the package were approved and implemented in full, the
fiscal deficit reduction projected for 2012 would largely disappear,
and it would also imply a sizable fiscal withdrawal in 2013 if policies
assumed for that year were to remain unchanged.

Given the U.S. dollar’s dominant role as a global
monetary anchor, U.S. monetary policy changes have
significant global spillovers, which underscore the
importance of maintaining financial sector stability
both at home and abroad. Indeed, low U.S. interest
rates may be driving capital flows elsewhere, which
can be challenging to absorb for economies that are
operating at or above potential.4 Moreover, recent
volatility in global risk aversion may increase capital
flow variability. At the same time, an insufficiently
accommodative monetary policy could stall the
U.S. recovery and, as a consequence, hurt the global
economy. In this regard, the bigger concern from an
accommodative U.S. monetary policy stems from
whether it could induce excessive risk taking. Thus, a
prompt implementation of the U.S. financial sector
reforms—combined with similar action to enhance
financial stability elsewhere—would contain the
buildup of excessive financial leverage in a low interest rate environment. The Dodd-Frank Act should
be implemented as planned, with timely allocation
of resources to fund the needed enhancements in
regulation and supervision. Progress also needs to be
made in identifying systemically important institutions—including nonbank institutions—that would
be subject to higher regulatory standards and in

addressing cross-border resolution issues involving
them. Heightened focus on systemic risks is also critical in an environment in which the financial sector is
at the front line of renewed market volatility.
Policies to achieve internal balance, centered on
judicious fiscal consolidation, will also help reduce
the U.S. current account deficit—which is key to
broader global rebalancing—but there are constraints.
Unless fiscal consolidation proves durable, the current
account deficit will widen again over the medium
term, even if not above precrisis levels. Moreover,
the effects of fiscal tightening on the U.S. current
account balance will be diminished by the fact that
key U.S. trading partners, including Canada and the
United Kingdom, have already embarked on more
ambitious and permanent fiscal adjustments (see
Chapter 4).

europe: enduring economic and Financial
turbulence
High public deficits and debt, lower potential output,
and mounting market tensions are weighing on growth
in much of advanced Europe (Figure 2.5). In addition, there is a transition under way toward greater
differentiation between the sovereign debt risks of the
euro area members, a shift that is proceeding in fits
and starts. Outside the euro area, many central and
eastern European (CEE) economies are enjoying a fairly
strong rebound from their deep recessions. Even so,
the forecast is for a slowdown in activity for much of
Europe, with risks to the downside (Figure 2.6; Table
2.2). The responses of policymakers to the euro area’s
debt crisis will shape the continent’s near-term prospects.
In particular, a speedy implementation of the July EU
summit measures will be key to gaining market credibility. Increased sharing of risk will need to be matched,
however, with increased sharing of responsibility for
macroeconomic and financial policies.
Europe is grappling with renewed market volatility and sharply elevated risks to financial stability.5
Spreads have risen to new highs in sovereigns and
banks in the euro area periphery (especially Greece).
5See also the September 2011 Global Financial Stability
Report.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Strains have proved contagious, with elevated spreads
even in economies that had not been affected thus
far (Belgium, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, and to a lesser
extent France), and markets further differentiating
sovereign risk within the euro area on the basis of
individual countries’ economic and fiscal challenges
and their banks’ exposure to sovereigns and banks in
the periphery. Global risk aversion, as measured by
the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX), recently surpassed levels reached at
the onset of the Greek debt crisis in spring 2010. The
European Banking Authority’s July 2011 stress tests
did little to stabilize bank stocks in the short term.
Investors remain concerned, notwithstanding recent
modifications to the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), the July 2011 package of measures to
help Greece address its debt crisis, and extension of
the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) unconventional
measures.
After a strong first quarter, growth in the euro
area fell sharply in the second quarter of 2011, in
part due to the pressure of high commodity prices
on real disposable incomes and to ongoing fiscal
tightening, but also because of the effect of the crisis
on consumer and business confidence across the
region, including in the core economies. Domestic
demand growth generally lagged behind GDP growth
in most advanced European economies, reflecting
mainly sluggish household consumption. In contrast,
domestic demand growth in many CEE economies
remained strong in the first half of the year, either
reflecting demand pressures amid accommodative policy conditions thus far (Turkey) or a strong
rebound from the recent crisis (Lithuania). External
demand slowed for much of Europe, and will likely
continue to moderate in line with the midcycle
global slowdown.
Real GDP growth in the euro area is expected to
slow from an annual rate of about 2 percent in the
first half of 2011 to ¼ percent in the second half,
before rising to a bit above 1 percent in 2012. The
ongoing financial turbulence will be a drag on activity through lower confidence and financing, even as
the negative effects of temporary factors such as high
commodity prices and supply disruptions from the
Japanese earthquake diminish. However, the projections assume that European policymakers will

contain the crisis in the euro area periphery, consistent with their commitments at the July EU summit.
In the CEE economies, growth will slow from 4¼
percent in 2011 to about 2¾ percent in 2012, as
both domestic and external demand moderate.
Economic performance will vary widely across
Europe:
• A few economies are operating close to average
precrisis rates, with little or no excess capacity
(for example, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands,
Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey), and in
some cases unemployment rates are at or below
typical precrisis levels. These economies avoided
major precrisis imbalances and have benefited
from the strong rebound in global manufacturing. Turkey, however, is experiencing a boom,
driven to a large extent by overly accommodative
policies.
• Some economies are noticeably below precrisis
growth rates because of sharp economic adjustments
in the context of financial crises. These include the
euro area periphery countries that remain engulfed
in deep sovereign debt crises (Greece, Ireland,

Portugal) with concurrent recessions or fragile
growth. Others are recuperating from recent crises
while addressing a number of challenges, including
weak banking systems and/or high unemployment
(Iceland, Latvia). These economies must steadfastly
continue their balance sheet adjustment, which will
likely keep output below capacity for some time.
• The rest of the region includes a wide spectrum
of economies, most of which are likely to grow
at less than precrisis averages. A few are shaken
by contagion from the euro area periphery and
are experiencing increasing market volatility and
rising bond spreads (Italy, Spain), while others are
less affected. Among the latter, some are projected
to enjoy relatively solid growth (Bulgaria, Serbia);
others continue to struggle (Croatia, United
Kingdom).
Inflation pressure is expected to stay well contained, assuming receding commodity prices. Inflation in the euro area is expected to fall from 2½
percent in 2011 to about 1½ percent in 2012. In the
CEE economies, the decline is expected to be from
5¼ percent in 2011 to 4½ percent in 2012.

European economic performance has been unbalanced, with growth in many
economies in the core euro area and emerging Europe stronger than in the euro area
periphery. However, contagion pressures from the deteriorating situation in the latter
are a rising concern, the containment of which is critical for regional and global
stability. Current fiscal consolidation plans should help reduce intra-euro-area
external imbalances.

growth in emerging Europe, given tight financial and
economic linkages. External risks also point down,
with negative spillovers from a slower U.S. growth
path or collapse in market confidence in U.S. fiscal
policy resulting in a sharp retrenchment of capital
inflows, or from rebounding commodity prices.
Fiscal policies are generally appropriate as currently planned in the euro area economies, although
additional entitlement reform would help create more
policy room. Recent announcements by several countries of measures to further tighten the fiscal stance
and/or bring forward some measures are welcome
and should be implemented as announced. However,
some countries need to identify the measures that
will be used to attain their medium-term fiscal targets
(France, Spain). In some European countries (for
example, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden), stronger
fiscal prospects provide room to allow automatic
stabilizers to work fully to deal with growth surprises.
If activity were to undershoot current expectations,
countries that face historically low yields should also
consider delaying some of their planned adjustment
(Germany, United Kingdom). Where the recovery
has already been established (for example, Poland,
Turkey), stepped-up fiscal consolidation is needed
to strengthen fiscal accounts and build fiscal room
in the event of a sustained reversal in capital inflows
and also to stave off inflation pressure. Everywhere,
fiscal consolidation should be supported by structural
measures to bolster growth prospects.
In the euro area, given a weak recovery, declining inflation pressure, and an overall highly uncertain economic and financial environment, the ECB
should lower its policy rate if downside risks to
growth and inflation persist. Also, the ECB should
maintain its unconventional support to contain market volatility at least until the implementation of the
July EU summit commitments. Elsewhere, including
in most CEE economies, monetary tightening could
be more gradual in light of the significant weakening
in the economic environment.
Strengthening the financial system remains a major
priority. Efforts to raise capital from private sources
to fill the gaps identified during the recent stress
tests should move ahead immediately and should be
more ambitious than supervisors deemed necessary.
The objective should be to lift bank equity beyond

the Basel III minimums and well ahead of the Basel
III timetable, while allowing flexibility in the use of
macroprudential tools to address country-specific
financial and systemic risks. Given the greater vulnerability of euro area banks to potentially impaired
wholesale funding markets, the July EU summit
commitments must be promptly adopted by fully
implementing the EFSF’s expanded mandate through
purchasing securities from secondary markets and
supporting bank capitalization. Among the crisis
economies in the CEE, banking systems are gradually
stabilizing, but financial sector vulnerability persists
where asset quality and profitability remain low. In
these cases, a slower withdrawal of crisis-related support measures is justified as the banking sector heals.
Among others, including those that until recently
experienced strong credit growth driven by capital
flows, financial supervision should remain watchful
for a possible worsening in banking system stability
affected by a potential drying up of wholesale financing or deterioration in asset quality.
The overriding policy challenge, beyond containing
the crisis, is to push forward with European integration. Stronger European governance frameworks
are essential to aligning fiscal policies and limiting
external imbalances. More integrated and flexible
labor, product, and services markets would facilitate
adjustment in response to shocks. This is particularly
important for the financial sector, which urgently
needs a truly integrated financial stability framework,
featuring a single rules book, integrated supervision,
and burden sharing. This offers the greatest hope for
greater resilience against future shocks. Good progress
has been made in putting in place a framework for
sharing sovereign risk in the euro area.7 The challenge
is to ensure that any support disbursed through it
is conditional on arrangements that foster sustained
adjustment to better fiscal and external positions.
Crucially, increased sharing of risk will need to be
accompanied by increased sharing of responsibility
for macroeconomic and financial policies. Countries
must stand ready to sacrifice some policy autonomy
for the common European good.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

External rebalancing has progressed in the euro
area, owing primarily to low domestic demand
growth. However, current account deficits have
narrowed much less in the crisis-hit euro area
periphery, compared with some CEE economies
during their 2008–09 crises (Latvia, Lithuania).
In the former, private capital inflows have been
replaced largely with ECB and official financing. In
the latter, the reversal of capital flows forced a sharp
adjustment in the current account deficits, which
are now gradually unwinding. Therefore, in the euro
area periphery, rebalancing will need to continue
for some time with domestic adjustment programs
and resulting weak growth fostering wage moderation and restructuring. In this regard, the current
nature of euro area fiscal plans––with less adjustment in surplus economies and more in deficit
economies, including use of permanent measures
rather than simply the end of stimulus––supports
further narrowing of intra-euro-area current account
imbalances. In many other economies in emerging Europe (for example, Turkey) continued fiscal
tightening remains key to reducing the risks of an
unexpected sharp adjustment in the current account
in the future.

commonwealth of independent states:
Moderate growth performance
The recovery in the CIS region is taking hold even
as ongoing household and financial sector deleveraging
continues to bridle activity. Growth has thus far been
supported by strong commodity prices, but downside
risks have risen with the global slowdown. As in other
emerging and developing economies, efforts should be
focused on rebuilding fiscal room and keeping inflation
in check. Major reforms are also needed to enhance the
business environment, develop financial systems, and
build strong institutions to raise the region’s growth
potential.
With strong commodity prices thus far, growth in the
CIS region has continued to recover, although modestly compared with precrisis rates of expansion (Figure
2.7). Private demand is still subdued in economies with
weak financial systems and ongoing deleveraging. Also,
remittances and capital flows are well below their levels

chapter 2

during the run-up to the crisis, when many economies
in the region were facing growing overheating pressures.
The global economic slowdown and increase in investor
risk aversion will challenge the region through a more
subdued external financing environment.
Growth is expected to average 4½ percent during
2011–12 (Figure 2.8; Table 2.3). However, prospects
vary considerably across the region:
• Growth in Russia is projected to reach about 4¼
percent during 2011–12. Prospects for oil prices,
although still strong, are weaker than in the June
2011 WEO Update. Moreover, capital flows—
which fueled credit, private demand, and growth
before the crisis—have yet to return because investors remain wary of the political uncertainty in the
run-up to presidential elections and the uninviting
business climate.
• In most of the other energy-exporting economies,
growth is also projected to moderate as energy
prices recede somewhat in 2012. However, in
Azerbaijan, maintenance-related disruptions in
oil production will result in a sharp slowdown

country and regional perSpectiveS

in growth in 2011—despite an acceleration in
non-oil GDP growth, reflecting a sizable supplementary budget approved in May—followed by a
rebound next year. In general, growth of oil output
is expected to decline over the medium term as
existing fields approach their capacity. In Kazakhstan, the increase in oil production is expected
to be lower than in previous years. Non-oil GDP
growth is also expected to ease slightly from the
strong rebound in 2010 in Kazakhstan as well as
in Turkmenistan.
• Energy-importing economies, on average, are
expected to expand at roughly the same pace as in
2010. However, various idiosyncratic factors will
lift growth in some of these economies: a recovery
from last year’s poor harvest in Armenia and a
rebound in the Kyrgyz Republic from the contraction caused by previous civil unrest and political
turmoil. At the other end of the spectrum, Belarus
is expected to experience a sharp slowdown as
domestic demand contracts with the currency crisis
and a reversal in capital flows.

A Gradual Recovery1
The recovery in the CIS region is taking hold on the back of strong exports and a
pickup in activity in Russia. Strong commodity prices have helped strengthen
external and fiscal balances. However, the priority is to discontinue procyclical
policies, build policy buffers, and increase the region’s resilience to future
shocks.

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Headline inflation has begun to pick up and is
forecast to reach double digits in several of the region’s
economies. This reflects mostly the sharp uptick in
commodity prices in the first half of the year and the
high share of food in the consumption baskets, but in
some cases, it is also due to current or recent demand
pressure (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyz Republic,
Uzbekistan).
The CIS region is particularly vulnerable to
spillovers from the rest of world, as evidenced by the
economic collapse during the global financial crisis.
Commodity prices largely determine the economic
fortunes of most of the large economies in the region,
whereas foreign funding has been crucial for growth
in investment and consumption. In turn, economic
performance in these economies, particularly in Russia, has major repercussions for many others in the
region, notably through workers’ remittances.8
Against this backdrop, net downside risks to
the outlook have increased. On the upside, energy
exporters stand to benefit from a further rise in oil
prices, and higher import costs for energy importers
will be somewhat cushioned by higher remittances
from Russia. Conversely, a sharper global slowdown
would further reduce commodity prices, dampening the prospects for the region. In addition, with
elevated global risk aversion, capital flows may stay
away from these economies for longer than expected,
dragging down regional growth. Finally, the region’s
sociopolitical environment, with long-standing tensions and unresolved conflicts, remains a source of
risk, further exacerbated by the possibility of spillovers from events in the MENA region.
It is time for the CIS region to discontinue
procyclical policies and build on structural reforms
to increase its resilience to future shocks. A number of countries have started raising interest rates
to contain price pressure (for example, Azerbaijan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Russia) and strengthening reserve
and liquidity requirements. However, with increased
uncertainty in the global outlook, the pace of
monetary tightening could be slower in economies
where overheating pressures are still well contained.
In this light, increasing the transparency of monetary

policy—by more clearly communicating inflation
developments and objectives—will also help anchor
expectations.
Establishing a prudent fiscal stance is crucial for
macroeconomic stability and sustained, balanced
growth in the region. To ensure its durability, consolidation must be supported by strong fiscal frameworks
and fundamental structural reforms, including in
pensions, health care, and social protection. For energy
exporters, the challenge will be to resist pressure to
increase spending while there is still ample fiscal room
and to improve the efficiency of public spending.
Energy importers should start rebuilding the fiscal buffers depleted during the crisis to prepare for potential
future needs and to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability (for example, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan).

Further action is also needed to restore financial
system strength. In Russia, the financial system
remains fragile due to the high share of nonperforming assets and inadequate provisioning. Regulatory
gaps need to be addressed, including enhancing the
central bank’s authority to conduct effective supervision. In other economies (for example, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Ukraine), impaired balance sheets still weigh on credit growth and efficient
resource intermediation. Strengthened risk management practices, reforms in the legal and regulatory
system to improve collateral recovery and increase
bank competition, and an end to directed lending
would prevent the recurrence of such impairments.
These immediate economic challenges should
not distract from the region’s longer-term objecInternational Monetary Fund | September 2011

tives of reducing external vulnerability and raising
potential growth through a more diversified pattern
of economic development. Improving the business
environment, increasing the role of the private sector,
further developing the financial sector, and enhancing
institutions are key to such efforts. These measures
will also help increase the region’s export potential
and improve external balances—independent of commodity prices—and help attract more durable sources
of external financing and capital flows.

asia: securing a More Balanced expansion
Asia’s track record during the crisis and the recovery
has been enviable. Growth remains strong, although it
is moderating with emerging capacity constraints and

weaker external demand. Downdrafts from weaker
activity in major advanced economies suggest that a
pause in the policy tightening cycle may be warranted
for some economies, and underscore the importance of
rebalancing growth toward domestic sources. Greater
exchange rate flexibility needs to be a key policy tool for
much of the region to alleviate price pressures in goods
and asset markets and—along with structural reforms—
to foster more balanced growth in economies with
persistent current account surpluses.
Activity in Asia remained solid but moderated
somewhat in the first half of 2011 owing to the
temporary disruption in supply chains from the
Japanese earthquake and tsunami, especially in the
automotive and electronics sectors. Some economies

Asia comprises all economies in Developing Asia and the Newly Industrialized Asian Economies.

in emerging Asia also experienced a slowdown in
export growth, although domestic demand continued
to be supported by relatively accommodative policies,
solid growth in credit and asset prices in the first half
of the year, firm consumer and business sentiment,
and strong labor markets. Also, capital flows were
sizable until recently, although more volatile in 2011.
Activity in advanced Asia also bounced back fairly
strongly after the initial setback caused by the natural
disasters. However, the recent volatility in U.S. and
euro area financial markets rippled through many
Asian equity markets, which if sustained could affect
the region’s future economic prospects.
Growth is projected to decelerate but remain
strong and self-sustained, assuming that the
global financial tensions do not escalate (Figures

2.9–2.10; Table 2.4). For emerging Asia, although
the slowdown in the United States and euro area
will dampen external demand, domestic demand
is expected to continue supporting growth. In
advanced Asia, activity will be boosted by reconstruction investment.
The nature of expansion and the drivers of growth
will differ significantly across the region:
• In China, growth will average 9 to 9½ percent
during 2011–12, less than the average of 10½
percent during 2000–07, as ongoing policy tightening and a smaller contribution from net external
demand moderate activity. Investment growth
has decelerated with the unwinding of the fiscal
stimulus, but it remains the principal contributor
to growth. Although inflation pressure remains,

Figure 2.10. Asia: A Bright Spot in the World Economy1
Growth is expected to remain strong, with weaker external demand offset by still
solid domestic demand. That said, there has been limited progress in external
rebalancing that would durably enhance the role of domestic demand in growth—
currencies have appreciated at a slower pace in economies with current account
surpluses than in others, and these surpluses are projected to remain large or to
widen further over the medium term.

efforts to withdraw credit stimulus—through
administrative limits on credit growth, higher
interest rates, and tighter reserve requirements—
and to rein in property price inflation through
loan-to-value limits in mortgage credit and
restrictions on multiple home purchases have been
gaining traction: property price inflation and credit
growth have softened from recent record levels.
In India, growth is forecast to average 7½ to 7¾
percent during 2011–12. Activity is expected to
be led by private consumption. Investment is
expected to remain sluggish, reflecting, in part,
recent corporate sector governance issues and a
drag from the renewed global uncertainty and less
favorable external financing environment. A key
challenge for policymakers is to bring down inflation, which is running close to double digits and
has become generalized. Despite policy tightening,
real interest rates are much lower than precrisis
averages, and credit growth is still strong.
In the newly industrialized Asian economies
(NIEs), growth is expected to slow from almost
8½ percent in 2010 to a bit above 4½ percent
during 2011–12, as activity moderates to close
positive output gaps. The contribution from net
exports is forecast to remain positive, in part due
to limited appreciation of real effective exchange
rates despite sustained current account surpluses.
Near-term growth in the ASEAN-59 is projected to
average 5½ percent, pulled by domestic demand—
in particular, robust investment—which will
offset the slowdown in export momentum. While
commodity prices will remain supportive, they will
provide less of a boost to growth for the commodity exporters (Indonesia, Malaysia).
In Japan, the supply constraints from the March
earthquake and tsunami have been easing, confidence has picked up, and activity is starting to
rebound. The economy is expected to contract
by ½ percent this year, but growth is forecast to
reach 2¼ percent in 2012, with activity sharply
rebounding on reconstruction investment.
Recent natural disasters slowed growth only
temporarily in Australia, and despite recent

earthquakes, New Zealand’s recovery has gained
traction, supported by strong terms of trade and
positive trade spillovers from the region. Growth
is forecast to pick up from 1¾ percent in 2011
to 3¼ percent in 2012 for Australia and from 2
percent to 3¾ percent for New Zealand.
Headline inflation in Asia is projected to average
5¼ percent in 2011, before receding to 4 percent
in 2012, assuming commodity prices remain stable.
However, inflation pressures are disparate across the
region—higher in economies with sustained strong
credit growth, positive output gaps, and/or relatively
accommodative policies (for instance, India, Korea,
Vietnam). For these economies, the risks around
inflation continue to point up. For the rest of the
region, risks are more balanced. In Japan, prices are
expected to remain broadly flat, with little or no
inflation. Property prices have also continued to rise
(China, NIEs), although thanks to the use of a wide
range of macroprudential measures, the pace has
started to ease in many economies.
As elsewhere, the risks around the outlook point
down, mainly due to the deterioration in the external
environment. Upside risks from continued support
from accommodative policies are more than offset by a
potentially larger drag from external demand, potential
pressure on commodity prices, and persistent financial
shocks from the euro area and the United States that
threaten to eventually impinge on domestic demand
and regional financial stability. Conversely, if upside
risks to inflation materialize, the authorities could
be forced to sharply tighten policies and provoke a
hard landing. Given Asia’s rising systemic importance,
a sharp deceleration in activity in some key Asian
economies could stall regional and global activity
through standard trade channels, a fall in demand
for commodities and in their prices, or confidence
effects.10 In Japan, in addition to external negative
risks from downbeat external demand and potentially
sustained appreciation pressure from safe haven flows,
longer than anticipated delays in correcting its supplyside disruptions and rebuilding electricity-generating
capacity could undermine confidence and further
restrain domestic demand. Despite its small share in
global trade, the aftereffects of the earthquake were a
10See

Country and Regional Perspectives

reminder of Japan’s ability to originate and transmit
shocks because of its role as a key supplier of sophisticated inputs in the global supply chain. Moreover,
although Japanese government bond yields remain
low, a loss of market confidence related to Japan’s high
public debt could lead to a rise in bond yields in other
economies with similar problems.11
Against this backdrop, further exchange rate flexibility remains a key policy priority for emerging Asia.
However, real effective exchange rates in many current
account surplus economies (for example, China,
Korea) have moved less than those in deficit economies
(for example, India) and are lower than their precrisis
levels, and foreign reserves have continued to build
up. For these economies, a stronger exchange rate,
combined with structural reforms (see below), would
raise domestic purchasing power and allow external
rebalancing, while also containing inflation pressure.
More generally, exchange rate flexibility complemented
with macroprudential tools would reduce the perception of a one-way exchange rate bet and slow the pace
of debt-creating capital inflows and the buildup of
short-term external liabilities (for example, in Korea).
Beyond further exchange rate appreciation in
surplus economies, monetary policy requirements
vary across Asia. Given the unusual uncertainty in the
external environment, a wait-and-see approach may
be warranted for some economies. However, inflation
pressure needs to be carefully monitored. In some
economies, despite nominal policy rate hikes, the real
cost of capital is at historical lows because of elevated
inflation (India, Korea, Vietnam), and inflation expectations are inching up. In these economies, the monetary tightening phase needs to be sustained for as long
as the baseline scenario prevails. Elsewhere, tightening
could be paused unless upside risks to inflation grow
further. In China, the transparency and effectiveness of
monetary policy should be enhanced by relying more
on interest rates than quantitative measures of monetary control. In Japan, monetary policy should remain
accommodative to eliminate the risk of deflation given
a chronic output gap. In particular, the Bank of Japan
could purchase more longer-dated public securities and
expand its asset purchase program for private assets.

world economic outlook: Slowing growth, riSing riSkS

Although the region has made good progress in
enhancing the strength of its financial system, significant growth in credit and property prices over the
past few years raises financial stability risks. In many
economies, banking systems are strong, thanks to
comfortable capital positions and loan loss provisioning levels, high liquidity, and enhancement of
domestic stress-testing frameworks (China, Indonesia,
Korea). However, the rapid rise in nonbank intermediation means that the perimeter of financial supervision needs be widened to ensure that vulnerabilities
are detected early and contained. In addition, financial sector development and liberalization still remain
a top priority in some economies. For instance, in
China further progress in financial liberalization,
including the use of market-determined interest rates,
will create incentives for financial institutions to better manage their market risks; remove the artificially
low cost of capital, which favors investment over
consumption; and, at the same time, strengthen the
transmission of monetary policy.12
Fiscal policy priorities are also diverse across the
region. Under baseline assumptions, increasing the
pace of fiscal withdrawal is more urgent in economies
with limited fiscal room and high public debt (for
example, India, Vietnam). Fiscal savings will also
create the room needed for funding infrastructure
needs (for example, India, Indonesia, Malaysia). For
Japan, although the immediate focus should be on
infrastructure reconstruction, a comprehensive plan
to put public debt on a sustainable footing over the
medium term is essential. In this light, the proposed
increase in the consumption tax to 10 percent by the
middle of this decade is an important first step. However, a more ambitious deficit reduction plan—based
on entitlement reform and a gradual increase of the
consumption tax to 15 percent—is needed to put the
debt ratio on a downward track. Adoption of a fiscal
rule could help safeguard fiscal adjustment gains. In
Australia, the planned return to surplus by 2012/13
is welcome, as it will increase fiscal room and take
pressure off monetary policy and the exchange rate.
The mining boom also provides an opportunity to
build fiscal buffers further over the medium term and
contribute to national saving. In New Zealand, while

the recent earthquake will adversely affect near-term
fiscal balances, planned medium-term consolidation will help build policy room, contain the current
account deficit, and put the budget in a stronger
position to deal with rising costs related to aging
and health care. If downside risks to growth materialize, however, most countries in the region have
the fiscal room to slow or reverse the pace of fiscal
consolidation.
Asia needs a durable and multifaceted approach
to demand rebalancing. The narrowing of surpluses
relative to precrisis highs is explained largely by the
moderation in the global cycle and slower domestic demand growth in advanced economies. In key
surplus economies (China), current account surpluses
are set to remain high or widen again as the global
expansion continues. In others, surpluses narrow very
slowly over the medium term. Moreover, the ongoing
fiscal stimulus withdrawal will likely boost external
surpluses, with the exception of Thailand, where
recently announced public policies target boosting
domestic demand and in particular consumption. As
a result, strong emphasis needs to be put on other
elements of the policy agenda, including further
exchange rate appreciation for some economies and
structural reforms to enhance the role of domestic
demand in growth. This would imply raising the
contribution of household consumption for some
(for example, China) and investment for others (for
example, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia).13 Given Asia’s
large and rising systemic importance, steady and wellpaced rebalancing in Asian economies would help
foster more balanced growth in its trading partners
as well.

latin america and the caribbean: Moving
toward More sustainable growth
Much of the region has thus far benefited from strong
terms of trade and easy external financing conditions.
In many economies, activity is above potential, credit
growth is high, inflation is trending near or above the
upper target range, and current account deficits are widening despite supportive commodity prices. The outlook
is still strong, although downside risks have come to the

fore and commodity prices will provide less momentum
in the future. Further macroeconomic tightening is still
essential to rebuild room for policy maneuvering and to
contain demand pressures. But in most economies, monetary tightening can pause until uncertainty abates.
The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region
expanded rapidly in the first half of 2011, led by
vibrant activity in many of the region’s commodity
exporters. Buoyant domestic demand underpinned
by accommodative macroeconomic policies, strong
capital inflows (although more volatile lately), and
favorable terms of trade supported the momentum.
The pace of expansion, however, has begun to mod-

erate, as many economies have fully recovered from
the global crisis, and macroeconomic policies are
being tightened (Figure 2.11). Nonetheless, growth
remains above potential, and a number of economic
indicators—including positive output gaps, abovetarget inflation levels, deteriorating current account
balances, rapid credit growth, strong asset prices,
and sustained appreciation of real exchange rates—
suggest that some economies may be overheating
(Figure 2.12). Elsewhere, including in Central
America and the Caribbean, economic activity is
still subdued, reflecting stronger real linkages with
the United States and other advanced economies,
and in some cases, high levels of public debt.

Growth in the region remains strong, supported by buoyant domestic demand, easy

maintain healthier growth momentum as macroeconomic policies move to a more
neutral position. Boom-bust risks must be contained, including through tighter fiscal
and macroprudential policies.

Financial conditions have become somewhat more
unsettled with the synchronized increase in volatility in global equity markets and the rise in global
risk aversion, but the impact on the region has been
limited thus far.
The LAC region is projected to expand by 4½
percent in 2011, moderating to about 4 percent
in 2012, with output remaining above potential
(Table 2.5). Economic growth is projected to slow,
as domestic demand growth moderates in response
to less accommodative macroeconomic policies and
external demand weakens as projected. Overall,
external conditions are projected to remain supportive, although with somewhat greater risk aversion and
a weaker push from commodity prices. Near-term
baseline growth prospects vary substantially across the
region:
• Growth will be led by many of South America’s
commodity exporters—particularly Argentina,
Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay—all of which
are expected to grow at levels near or above 6
percent in 2011. Growth in South America is
projected to moderate toward potential in 2012,
in the range of 3½ to 5½ percent. In the case of
Brazil, growth has already begun to moderate,
with activity expanding by 4 percent in the first
half of 2011, compared with 7½ percent in 2010.
Near-term growth is expected to slow below potential and bring inflation toward the target, in part
reflecting the less favorable external outlook.
• In Mexico, growth was fairly robust during the
first half of the year, despite weak U.S. growth and
the effects on the automotive sector of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. However, negative
spillovers from the anemic U.S. recovery will keep
growth around 3¾ percent for 2011–12.
• In Central America and the Caribbean, growth
will continue to be constrained by a slow recovery
in remittances and tourism, and in much of the
Caribbean by the challenges posed by high public
debt.
Inflation is forecast to recede from 6¾ percent in
2011 to 6 percent in 2012 as activity moderates and
commodity prices stabilize, although with considerable intra-regional differences. In the inflation-targeting countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru,
Uruguay), it is projected to stay within the target

such as Argentina and Venezuela, inflation is projected to remain in double digits, reflecting expansionary policies.14

spending, and remittances (the Caribbean, Central
America, Mexico). If global risk aversion continues to
stay elevated, it could increase external financing risks
for the region through a potential reversal in capital
inflows and a sharp adjustment of current account
imbalances and exchange rates. The strong presence
of Spanish banks in the region could raise some risks
in a tail scenario, but these risks should be offset by
the existing subsidiary model. Last, potential spillovers from China could show up through trade—that
is, manufacturing and commodity prices—in that

dampen the outlook for the region’s commodity
exporters. However, some upside risks still remain—
domestic demand growth could exceed expectations
if global risks unwind relatively quickly, resuming
the strong wave of capital flows to the region and if
macroeconomic policy tightening does not progress
sufficiently.
Against this backdrop, policies need to be designed
to address two offsetting forces: containing domestic
overheating pressure and the buildup of financial
vulnerabilities, while responding appropriately to the
souring external environment. In this context, efforts
thus far to normalize monetary policies to a neutral
stance are welcome, although in countries where
inflation pressure has lessened, a temporary pause in
monetary tightening could be considered until uncertainty abates. Further monetary tightening is likely
warranted in a few economies where overheating risks
appear more imminent (Argentina, Paraguay, Venezuela). In Mexico, given firmly anchored inflation
expectations along with potentially larger downdrafts
from the United States, monetary policy can remain
accommodative as long as inflation pressure and
expectations remain at bay.
Fiscal consolidation should continue, however
(especially where it is needed to maintain debt sustainability), while protecting social and infrastructure
spending.15 Fiscal policy in commodity-exporting
countries needs to avoid procyclical spending, and
consideration should be given to adopting structural
fiscal targets (that control for the cycle and commodity prices) and binding medium-term plans. In Central America, policies should shift toward rebuilding
the policy buffers used during the crisis and adopting
structural reforms aimed at boosting medium-term
growth. Greater resolve is required for reducing debt
overhang in the Caribbean while addressing weak
competitiveness.
The postcrisis rapid increase in credit and equity
prices in many LAC economies, boosted in part by
strong capital flows, calls for continued vigilance to
limit the attendant risks to financial stability. The
region has responded to capital flows and vibrant
credit growth with a combination of policies.
Countries mostly have allowed their currencies to

be flexible and have intervened in foreign exchange
markets to different degrees (Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay more than Colombia and Mexico). Others have
also introduced macroprudential measures, including
tightening reserve requirements and raising capital
requirements for certain consumer credit operations
(Brazil, Peru). In some cases, these measures have
been complemented with capital controls (Brazil).
Overall, the banking system is strong, and prudential indicators have generally improved, including
capital adequacy, the ratio of nonperforming loans,
and provisioning levels.16 That said, the sheer growth
of credit points to a potential deterioration in credit
quality, and banks’ exposure to wholesale funding
has increased, although from a small base. In this
regard, it is important to continue to monitor potential financial sector vulnerabilities and strengthen
financial sector supervision, including for nonbank
financial intermediaries, to contain the buildup of
excessive leverage and avoid boom-bust credit cycles.
The region’s external current account deficits are set
to widen slightly during 2011–12, despite the strength
in commodity prices. Indeed, the reliance on capital
flows to finance these deficits has increased the region’s
susceptibility to a sudden turnaround in investor
sentiment. Enhanced macroprudential measures and
supervision (discussed above) remain imperative for
maintaining financial stability, and capital controls
could provide some temporary relief in the face of
strong capital inflows, but these measures should not
substitute for needed macroeconomic adjustment. The
greater use in the region of exchange rate flexibility as
a shock absorber is indeed welcome, but more fiscal
policy tightening is needed, not just to reduce fiscal
vulnerability but also to abate the pressures on the real
exchange rate and support external balances.

sub-saharan africa: sustaining the expansion

increased perceptibly in a number of countries in the
region. Under the baseline scenario, with a strong recovery under way, this is an opportune time to return to the
region’s long-standing priorities of improving policy and
institutional frameworks, building resilience to commodity price swings, and developing financial markets, all of
which would help lift the region’s potential growth and
alleviate poverty. In the event of a pronounced global
downturn, countries that have policy buffers should aim
to support growth.
Real activity in the region expanded strongly in
2010 and so far in 2011. Robust private and public
consumption underpinned this strength, as many
countries used available macroeconomic policy room
to help speed the recovery from the crisis-induced
slowdown. The earlier surge in commodity prices
fueled a rise in inflation. Reflecting the relatively

accommodative monetary conditions, there are signs
of nontrivial inflation pressure in some economies
(including Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda). However,
private capital flows, which had been gaining importance as a source of external financing before the crisis,
have resumed only to a handful of emerging and frontier economies (Ghana, Mauritius, South Africa).
The region is poised for continued economic
expansion in the near term, provided the recent
rise in financial and economic instability in major
advanced economies remains contained (Figure
2.14; Table 2.6). Real GDP growth in the SSA
region is projected to average 5¼ to 5¾ percent
during 2011–12, with considerable differences
across the region:

Recovery is well under way, with growth in many economies back to the highs of the

for normalization of the fiscal stance. Building policy room is key to containing risks
emanating from a further deterioration in the global outlook.

region’s low-income countries (LICs) have returned
to their precrisis growth rates. The severe drought
in the horn of Africa has precipitated a major
humanitarian crisis in a few economies in the region
and caused inflation to increase to sharply higher
levels. Average growth for the LIC group is projected at 6 percent in 2011, on the back of strong
domestic demand and accelerating exports. In 2012,
growth is expected to gather speed to 6½ percent as
investment strengthens in Kenya, economic activity
normalizes in Côte d’Ivoire after severe disruption
following the 2010 elections, and large oil and mining projects come online in Niger and Sierra Leone.
• Oil-exporting economies have a similarly positive
outlook, with growth of about 6 percent in 2011,
increasing to 7¼ percent in 2012. The acceleration in growth in 2012, despite lower oil prices
than projected in the June 2011 WEO Update,
reflects continued strength in domestic public
investment spending, as well as some idiosyncratic factors, such as a strong rebound in oil
production in Angola following a disruption in
2011.
• Middle-income countries (MICs), whose greater
integration with global markets made them more
vulnerable to the crisis, have yet to fully recover
from its impact. A surge in unemployment, high
household debt, low capacity utilization, the slowdown in advanced economies, and substantial real
exchange rate appreciation are making for a hesitant recovery in South Africa, the largest economy
in the region. Yet, over the next 12 months, its
output gap is projected to close as growth picks up
to about 3½ percent during 2011–12. Economic
growth will be driven by private consumption and
reinvigorated investment, supported by a low interest rate environment and a return to the issuance
and renewal of mining licenses.
Across the SSA region, there has been a marked
increase in inflation. The earlier surge in commodity
prices risks fueling inflation further amid the limited
economic slack of the LICs (for example, Uganda),
especially in net staple importers (such as Ethiopia) or
where there is significant pass-through from international to domestic food prices (for example, Kenya).
Among oil exporters, inflation is projected to remain

high, dominated by price developments in Nigeria and
Angola, where rapid monetary expansion before the
crisis (Nigeria) and a sharp increase in domestic fuel
prices (Angola) fed into price increases. The incomplete
recovery from the crisis in the region’s MICs will limit
the rise in inflation in these economies.
A further deterioration of the global economic
environment could have substantial spillovers to the
SSA region. A faltering U.S. or European recovery
could undermine prospects for exports, remittances,
official aid, and private capital flows. Asset market
spillovers from continued market turbulence or spikes
in risk aversion would likely be limited to the few
frontier markets, as they were during the 2008–09
crisis, and the situation thus far is well contained.
Finally, a sharp increase in oil prices, while boost-

ing growth in oil exporters, would pose significant
challenges for oil importers.17 Similarly, a continued
surge in non-oil commodity prices would entail large
social and fiscal costs for the region’s net commodity
importers. Other risks to the outlook are primarily
domestic—for example, political uncertainty and
weather shocks also have the potential to dampen
growth prospects.
Under the baseline scenario, with growth recovering, especially among the LICs, rebuilding fiscal
room and reorienting fiscal policy toward longer-term
investment and poverty-reduction objectives should
17Simulations suggest that growth in oil-importing SSA economies would decline by 0.5 to 0.7 percent should oil prices increase
to an average of $150 in 2011 (see the April 2011 Sub-Saharan
Africa Regional Economic Outlook).

be a priority. For oil exporters, the challenge will be
to manage the current revenue bonanza, especially
given the somewhat weakened outlook for prices.
Spending targets guided by absorption capacity and
anchored within a medium-term fiscal framework
will help. Targeted and time-bound policy interventions to mitigate the impact of high commodity
prices on vulnerable groups should be considered.
With inflation picking up, monetary policy should
also revert to a more neutral stance, as is already happening in a number of economies (Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda).
Should global growth slow down significantly,
economies with adequate policy buffers should aim
to support growth. The likes of South Africa, for
example, should allow automatic stabilizers to operate
on the fiscal side and ease monetary conditions. LICs
should also aim to support activity by using the available room for maneuvering—by protecting spending
while allowing revenues to fluctuate with activity to
the extent financing allows.
The region’s aggregate external balance is expected
to improve slightly in 2011, but to deteriorate in
2012. External current account surpluses in commodity exporters will narrow somewhat with the
slight retreat in commodity prices. Current account
deficits are projected to be sustained among the
remaining economies, in line with the continued
strength in their domestic demand, although they
will remain contained over the medium term.

Middle east and north africa: growth stalling
amid uncertainty
Commodity price movements and social unrest
continue to shape the region’s experience and prospects.
The short-term outlook is still subject to unusually large
uncertainties, stemming mainly from the fluid political
and security situation in some MENA economies as well
as growing uncertainty about external demand. Preserving macroeconomic stability while building social cohesion
is a key immediate priority; restoring fiscal health and
designing a growth model to achieve inclusive mediumterm growth and employment also remain critical.
Elevated oil prices thus far have boosted the
fortunes of the region’s oil exporters, while creating
96

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

challenges for oil importers. Among oil exporters,
activity has also been spurred by broadly stimulatory
macroeconomic policies. At the same time, activity in
several MENA economies is being adversely affected
by social unrest and ongoing conflict, which are
weighing heavily on tourism receipts, capital flows,
and investment.
Growth in oil-exporting economies is forecast
to reach 5 percent in 2011 and about 4 percent
in 2012 (Figures 2.15 and 2.16; Table 2.7)—with
growth led by Qatar (driven by expanding natural
gas exports), Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. The outlook
for oil importers is much more subdued (especially
for Egypt, Syrian Arab Republic, and Tunisia), with
growth projected at 1½ percent in 2011. Activity
in a few economies will be constrained by domestic
social unrest and an associated slow recovery in tourism receipts and remittances. Oil importers’ growth
is projected to reach 2½ percent in 2012, underpinned by a slow recovery in investment.
MENA inflation will remain elevated in 2011
but will fall somewhat in 2012, reflecting receding
commodity prices. Inflation is forecast to fall from
10¾ percent in 2011 to 7½ percent in 2012 for
oil exporters, while staying under 8 percent during
2011–12 for oil importers.
The outlook is subject to large downside risks.
External risks relate to the unfolding weaker
outlook in the United States and Europe, which
could sharply depress activity and hence commodity
prices or further slow external financing flows to the
region. However, most risks pertain to continued
domestic instability, compounded by intraregional
contagion. The political turmoil has seen risk
premiums rise and private financing and tourism
receipts fall—not only in those economies directly
affected by the turmoil but throughout the region.
Any intensification of the political crises would
exacerbate the economic plight of the region, with
the tail risk that MENA oil production could be
further affected with ramifications for global energy
markets. Global spillovers from the disruption of oil
production in Libya until recently were mitigated by
increased production from other MENA economies,
notably Saudi Arabia.
The region faces serious policy challenges. Beyond
securing economic and social stability, shorter-

term challenges focus on the need to place public
finances on a sustainable footing. For oil exporters,
governments need to seize the opportunity presented by high oil prices to move toward sustainable and more diversified economies. In addition,
the social disruption seen in MENA countries
highlights the need for an inclusive medium-term
growth agenda that establishes strong institutions to stimulate private sector activity, opens
up greater access to economic opportunities, and
addresses chronically high unemployment, particularly among the young.
Fiscal policy priorities in MENA economies are
quite diverse, with the need for fiscal consolidation
greatest among oil-importing economies, which
face growing concerns over fiscal sustainability. In
all MENA countries, a key medium-term objective is the reorientation of fiscal policies to attain

poverty reduction and productive investment goals.
However, governments recently have been under
pressure to increase current spending—to support
both increased social spending and commodity
subsidies—and to address pressing social problems.
Increased spending on fuel and food subsidies (with
the Islamic Republic of Iran an important exception), along with pressures to raise civil service
wages and pensions, is placing a strain on public
finances (particularly for oil-importing economies),
which will not be sustainable over the medium
term. Moreover, procyclical fiscal expansion could
further crowd out needed private investment,
perpetuating the problems with job creation in the
private sector.
The region’s external balance is expected to remain
high during 2011–12, although it will narrow somewhat in 2012 with the slight pullback in commodity

maintain strong external positions and enhance reserves.
Current account deficits in oil importers will remain
wide at about 4¾ percent amid pressing commodity import bills, declining remittances, and shrinking
tourism receipts. Current account balances are projected
to deteriorate most in the Mashreq (Jordan, Lebanon,
Syrian Arab Republic). In terms of external financing in 2011, private capital inflows (chiefly foreign
direct investment) will likely be insufficient to offset oil
importers’ growing current account deficits, resulting in
a drawdown of international reserve cushions.

target What You can hit:
commoditY price SWingS and monetarY policY

This chapter examines the inflationary effects of commodity price movements and the appropriate monetary
policy response. Commodity prices tend to have stronger and longer-lasting effects on inflation in economies
with high food shares in the consumption basket and in
economies with less firmly anchored inflation expectations.
The chapter’s analysis suggests that central banks in these
economies should set and communicate monetary policy
based on developments in underlying inflation rather than
headline inflation, where underlying inflation means a
measure that reflects the changes in inflation that are likely
to be sustained over the medium term. Because shocks to
commodity price inflation are typically beyond the control
of policymakers, hard to predict, and often not sustained,
central banks seeking to establish credibility are generally
better off setting and communicating their monetary policy
in terms of underlying inflation rather than headline
inflation. A headline framework may be preferred,
however, if economic agents place a much higher value
on the stability of headline inflation than on the stability
of output. Finally, in emerging and developing economies
with excess demand pressures and inflation already above
target, a food price shock is likely to have larger secondround effects and require a more aggressive policy response
than in the absence of such preexisting demand pressures.

International food prices have risen to levels last seen
during the 2003–08 commodity price surge. After
falling during the Great Recession, world food prices
surged again in late 2010 and are now around their
mid-2008 peak (Figure 3.1). Oil and energy prices
also rose in recent months on the back of increased
demand and concerns about supply disruptions.
The spot price of a barrel of Brent crude oil reached
$110 in April 2011, compared with an average of
$34 a barrel over the past 30 years.

The authors of this chapter are John Simon (team leader),
Daniel Leigh, Andrea Pescatori, Ali Alichi, Luis Catão, Ondra
Kamenik, Heejin Kim, Douglas Laxton, Rafael Portillo, and
Felipe Zanna. Shan Chen, Angela Espiritu, and Min Song provided research support.

The significant volatility in commodity prices and
the prospect that food and fuel prices may remain
elevated for a sustained period are a significant
challenge for monetary policymakers. One concern
is that the recent rises in food and energy inflation
may prove to be persistent, leading to expectations
of rising inflation that could spill over into higher
wage demands and underlying inflation.1 Another
concern is that attempting to stabilize inflation in
the face of such high volatility could have significant
economic costs. These concerns are most acute in
economies where the share of food in the consumption basket is high and the effects of these shocks
are largest.
How then should monetary policy respond to
these risks? Standard advice, particularly in advanced
economies, is to accommodate the first-round effects
of food and energy price swings on the consumer
price index (CPI) but not the second-round effects
on other CPI components.2 Because shocks to food
and energy inflation are typically transitory, the
standard advice amounts to a recommendation that
central banks set and communicate their monetary
policy in terms of underlying inflation. When
commodity shocks are indeed largely transitory,
this approach can deliver more stable headline CPI
inflation over the medium term and lower output
volatility than a framework that requires the central
bank to stabilize headline inflation in the short term,
which entails countering even the first-round effects
of such shocks.
Central banks often operate in line with standard advice, but the details vary across countries.
A number of central banks closely watch underly1For

example, recent studies suggest that oil prices may trend
higher for many years to come on the back of scarce supplies and
rising demand from emerging market economies such as India
and China. For a further discussion of these risks, see the October
2008 and April 2011 issues of the World Economic Outlook and
Helbling and Roach (2011).
2The rationale for accommodating first-round effects rather
than attempting to prevent them is that such an approach reduces
output fluctuations.

ing inflation measures that down-weight or exclude
certain volatile components, notably food and
energy prices.3 Some central banks set their price
stability goals in terms of a core inflation measure.4
Most others target headline inflation but define their
targets over the medium term and thus down-weight
the influence of transitory shocks, such as those to
food and energy prices.5 In this respect, the effect is
similar to using an underlying inflation measure as
the target.
Overall, a variety of measures of inflation are
used either as targets or as guides. In what follows,
underlying inflation is measured simply by headline

Figure 3.1. World Commodity Prices, 2000–11
(In real terms, as deflated by U.S. consumer price index)
Food and fuel prices have risen dramatically since 2000. Food and fuel prices peaked
in 2008 at levels 80 percent and 250 percent above the levels in 2000. Current prices
are 75 percent and 150 percent above 2000 levels, and there are concerns that
structural forces will push prices higher over coming years.

3For

example, the Bank of Japan, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and
the Reserve Bank of Australia all pay close attention to measures
of underlying inflation that are not directly affected by movements in commodity prices. In the case of the Bank of Japan, a
closely watched indicator of price stability is the year-over-year
rate of change in the CPI, excluding fresh food. In the case of the
Federal Reserve, food and energy components are excluded from
the core personal consumption expenditure inflation measure used
to describe the outlook for inflation in monetary policy reports.
The Reserve Bank of Australia monitors a wide range of measures
of underlying inflation, including trimmed mean and weighted
median measures that down-weight volatile prices.
4For example, the Bank of Thailand currently defines its target
in terms of a core inflation measure that excludes fresh food and
energy prices. In the past, especially during periods of transition,
some central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, the
Czech National Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
(RBNZ), defined their targets in terms of a measure of core inflation. More recently, having achieved low inflation, some of these
central banks have moved to a headline measure in their formal
targets. This evolution is discussed in a speech by the deputy
governor of the RBNZ: “As inflation expectations have subsided,
it has been possible to assume a degree more flexibility in the
regime, and the current PTA [Policy Targets Agreement] reflects
that. Rather than detailed calculations of the impact of specific
shocks, as embodied in the old underlying inflation measure, the
PTA now explicitly acknowledges that outcomes will occasionally
fall outside the target range for a variety of reasons, even when the
Bank is ‘constantly and diligently’ striving to deliver price stability” (Sherwin, 1999).
5The experience of the RBNZ, with its “hard-edged” targets,
shows why such “flexible” medium-term targeting is the general
practice. As stated by the deputy governor of the RBNZ: “While
clearly a useful device for communicating the strength of the
Bank’s resolve to a wider public audience, the portrayal of the
inflation target as hard-edged also carried risks given the lags
and uncertainties in monetary policy decision making. A ‘strict’
approach to inflation targeting encouraged a search for precision
in calculating ‘core’ or underlying inflation measures for accountability purposes and may have encouraged a shortening of policy
horizons as the direct price effects of the exchange rate became
more important to the achievement of the target outcomes”
(Sherwin, 1999).

chapter 3

Target What You Can Hit: Commodity Price Swings and Monetary Policy

inflation, excluding food and energy inflation––
also commonly referred to as “core inflation.” The
reason is that, in practice, food and energy prices
are less indicative of medium-term inflation pressures than are the price changes of other goods and
services. That said, using this simple “exclusion”
measure as an indicator for underlying inflation
raises some problems. Because it places zero weight
on food and fuel prices, core inflation can be a
poor measure of the cost of living. In addition,
some argue that food and energy price inflation
does contain useful information about underlying
inflation and, therefore, hints at the likely evolution of inflation pressure over the medium term.
These issues are discussed below.
Given the variety of approaches to the implementation of monetary policy, the range of inflation measures now in use, and the size of recent
commodity price shocks, it is timely to reconsider
the policy advice. Thus, this chapter addresses the
following key questions:
•• What are the effects of international commodity price swings on inflation across a variety of
economies? What economic factors influence
these effects?
•• What is the appropriate monetary policy response
to commodity price shocks? In particular, how
does the approach of targeting underlying inflation rather than headline inflation perform in
terms of delivering macroeconomic stability in
different types of economies? Should central banks
respond to persistent commodity price shocks any
differently than to one-time shocks?
•• Finally, what are the implications for monetary policy in today’s environment, with excess
demand pressures in some emerging and developing economies and economic slack in advanced
economies?
These are the main findings of the chapter:
•• Food price shocks tend to have larger effects
on headline inflation in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies. On
a related note, because medium-term inflation
expectations are weakly anchored in many emerging and developing economies, food price shocks
have larger effects on inflation expectations in
these economies.

•• The measure of inflation used to define a central
bank’s target matters because of its effect on the
central bank’s credibility. In economies with low
initial monetary policy credibility and high food
shares in the consumption basket, focusing on
underlying inflation—that is, a measure that
reflects the changes in inflation that are likely to
be sustained over the medium term—rather than
on headline inflation, makes it easier to build
credibility. The reason is that it is harder to hit
headline inflation targets when commodity prices
are volatile. Higher credibility, in turn, leads to
better-anchored inflation expectations and lower
volatility of both output and headline inflation.
•• The desirability of setting and communicating
monetary policy based on a measure of underlying inflation depends on the relative importance
of headline inflation and output to a country’s
welfare. A headline framework can lower the
volatility of headline inflation, but at the cost of
significantly higher volatility in output (and hence
in household income).
•• Finally, in economies where central bank credibility is still limited and the share of food in
consumption is high (as in a number of emerging
and developing economies), a food price shock is
likely to have even larger second-round effects and
require a more aggressive policy response when
excess demand pressures are high and inflation
is running above target. This assumes that the
economic costs rise as the gap increases between
actual inflation and the target. In contrast, in
economies where the central bank’s credibility is
strong, where food accounts for a low share in
consumption baskets, and where there is substantial economic slack (as in major advanced
economies today), the monetary policy tightening
required to stabilize inflation is more gradual.
The first section of this chapter establishes some
stylized facts about the effects of international commodity price swings on inflation in different types of
economies. The following section considers how the
monetary policy responses most appropriate for dealing with these shocks might differ across economies.
The analysis uses simulations from a small open
economy model that focuses on the difference in

work based on underlying inflation (proxied by core
inflation in the model) and one based on headline
inflation.6 The chapter then draws some policy conclusions and explores some practical considerations
related to the definition of underlying inflation.

This section examines the size and nature of the
inflationary effects of international commodity price
swings in different economies. It starts by reviewing
recent developments in international commodity
prices and then considers the various channels likely
to affect how much international price movements
pass through to domestic price movements. Finally,
it looks at the overall pass-through from food
prices to headline inflation. This discussion serves
to explain the challenges commodity price shocks
present for monetary policymakers and to identify
what key characteristics of economies influence the
size of these challenges. These characteristics become
the building blocks for the model presented in the
following section.

Swings in international commodity prices
Figure 3.1 shows that food and fuel prices have
been rising since 2000. World food prices are about
80 percent higher in real terms than in January
2000, and oil prices are 175 percent higher. On
the other hand, from a longer perspective, food
prices hit a historical low in 2000 (Figure 3.2) after
declining for decades.7 Clearly, the potential range of
swings in commodity prices is large.
Another key characteristic of international food
and energy price movements is that it is difficult to
predict their direction and persistence. Figure 3.3
compares real food prices with forecasts of food
prices based on futures market prices over the past
6Numerous

studies focus on the relative forecasting power of
core versus headline inflation for future headline inflation (see,
for example, Cogley, 2002; and OECD, 2005). However, because
central banks tend to forecast inflation based on a wide range of
economic indicators and modeling techniques rather than solely
on headline or core inflation, this line of analysis is not pursued
here.
7See Southgate (2007) for a discussion of the reasons behind
the price declines.

around 2005, the forecasts became more inaccurate
and, most dramatically, missed the turning points in
2008 and 2009.8

prices, see Groen and Pesenti (2011).
9See Appendix 3.1 for the countries included in the sample and
Appendix 3.2 for details on the pass-through analysis.
10Throughout this chapter, advanced economies and emerging
and developing economies are defined according to the classification in the Statistical Appendix. This classification does not separate emerging market economies from developing economies, but
Appendix 3.1 shows the division between advanced and emerging
and developing economies.
11We examine the pass-through of international oil prices to
transportation prices rather than to domestic fuel prices, because
only limited data are available for domestic fuel prices. The
median pass-through of oil to transportation is 0.13 for advanced
economies and 0.17 for emerging and developing economies.

Index, 2000 = 100

We now examine the pass-through from international commodity prices to domestic commodity prices. In particular, we estimate the effect of
a 1 percent increase in international food prices
(expressed in local currency) on domestic food
prices.9 Figure 3.4 shows the estimation results,
which suggest that pass-through tends to be larger
in emerging and developing economies than in
advanced economies.10 However, the size of the
pass-through is relatively small. The median longterm pass-through of a 1 percent food price shock
to domestic food prices is 0.18 percent in advanced
economies and 0.34 percent in emerging and developing economies. There is even less pass-through—
and little difference between advanced and emerging
market economies—from oil prices to transportation
prices.11
A number of factors help explain this incomplete
pass-through. There is a significant local component
in the production of food, including retail and distribution margins, excise taxes, and customs duties.
Food and fuel subsidies may limit the degree of
pass-through. In addition, there is generally significant domestic production of food, making domestic
agricultural and weather conditions more influential
than global market developments. Moreover, world

commodity price indices do not necessarily reflect
the consumption bundle in any given country. The
world index includes, for example, wheat, barley,
and rice in proportion to their value in international
trade, but domestic consumption patterns vary
across countries.
Focusing on more tightly defined consumer product categories, such as bread and bakery products,
can help shed more light on the extent of passthrough when compositional effects are mitigated.
Based on data for economies for which this more
exact breakdown is available, Tables 3.1 and 3.2
show the pass-through of world crude oil prices to
gasoline prices and the pass-through of world wheat
prices to flour and bread. The higher pass-through
for fuel is evident; however, even for such closely
related food products as wheat, flour, and bread, the
rate of pass-through is low.
Within the detailed pass-through results is
evidence of price subsidies for certain commodities. For example, there is virtually no correlation between the gasoline price in Brazil and the
world price, which reflects both the government’s
ownership of the largest national oil producer and
the highly developed ethanol market. Similarly,
government subsidies explain the lack of correlation
between Indian flour and bread prices and world
wheat prices. Subsidies generally transform a monetary policy challenge into a fiscal policy challenge.
But because this chapter focuses on monetary
policy and because such subsidies are generally outside the control of the monetary authorities, price
subsidies are taken as a given.
One final note is that the results reveal a wide
variation in effects across economies. The wide range
in pass-through coefficients helps explain why, as
Figure 3.5 shows, real domestic food price increases
since 2000 have ranged from –15 percent to 70
percent despite the 80 percent increase in the real
U.S. dollar world food price index over the same
period. One reason real food prices have fallen over
this period in some countries (for example, Bulgaria,

higher the direct effect on headline inflation. To the
extent that food prices affect wage demands, higher
pass-through to nonfood price inflation might be
expected when the food share is higher. In countries
with a poor track record of controlling inflation,
food and fuel price shocks might also raise expectations of larger inflation in the future and might
thereby raise pass-through when these expectations
are reflected in prices.

The share of food in the CPI consumption
basket is typically higher in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies. For
advanced economies in our sample, the median
food share is 17 percent, whereas in emerging and
developing economies, the median is 31 percent
(Figure 3.6). Such a high food share implies that
food price shocks will have a strong direct effect
on headline inflation in these economies. These
direct effects are shown in Figure 3.7: in 2008,
food prices contributed about 5 percentage points
to headline inflation in emerging and developing
economies on average but only about 1 percentage
point to advanced economy inflation. More recently,
the contribution exceeded 2 percentage points for
emerging and developing economies and about 0.5
percentage point for advanced economies. These
averages also mask significant variations among
economies—in some, food prices raised headline
inflation by about 10 percentage points in 2008 and
5 percentage points in recent months. The contribution of transportation to headline inflation was more
limited than that of food during 2003–08, possibly
reflecting the minimal effect of world oil prices on
transportation prices and the smaller share of fuel in
consumer baskets.12

inflation in LICs was similar to that of emerging and developing
economies as reported here.

Domestic food and transportation prices have generally risen far less than world food
and oil prices since 2000, with a wide range of country experiences. These
divergences reflect the fact that domestic food and transportation baskets are different
from the world commodity price indices and also reflect incomplete pass-through
from commodity prices to domestic consumption items.

to depend on how well inflation expectations are
anchored. If monetary policy credibility is low, then
medium-term inflation expectations are likely to
be revised upward in response to incoming inflation news. By contrast, if the private sector believes
that the central bank will stabilize inflation, then
medium-term inflation expectations should respond
little to incoming inflation news, thus requiring
smaller adjustments in monetary policy.
The extent to which inflation expectations are
anchored is estimated using the response of mediumterm inflation expectations to an unexpected increase
in inflation in the current period by means of statistical analysis. In particular, we estimate the average
response of expectations of future inflation to an
unexpected 1 standard deviation increase in inflation in the current year.13 The inflation expectation
data are based on surveys of professional forecasters
conducted in 20 advanced and 18 emerging and
developing economies over the past two decades, and
the statistical approach is based on that of Levin,
Natalucci, and Piger (2004) and the October 2008
World Economic Outlook. We also explore how the
response differs between advanced and emerging and
developing economies and across different monetary
policy regimes.
A key result is that expectations are generally less
well anchored in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies. On average, in
emerging and developing economies, a 1 standard
deviation shock to current-year inflation expectations, equal to 1.8 percentage points, has a substantial effect on medium-term inflation expectations.
As Figure 3.8 illustrates, even as far as five years
into the future, inflation is still expected to rise by
0.3 percentage point in response to such a shock.
By contrast, in advanced economies, a 1 standard
deviation shock to current-year inflation expectations, equal to 0.6 percentage point, has a negligible
effect on medium-term inflation expectations (0.04
percentage point), suggesting a higher degree of
policy credibility.14
13See Appendix 3.2 for details on estimates of inflation
expectations.
14These results imply that medium-term expectations change
2.5 times more in emerging and developing economies than

108

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Not all emerging and developing economies,
however, have weakly anchored inflation expectations. Inflation expectations appear to be well
anchored in emerging and developing economies
in which the central bank has an explicit inflation
target (see Figure 3.8). In particular, in emerging
and developing economies that use an inflationtargeting framework, expectations of inflation two
or more years in the future respond little to currentyear inflation surprises.15 In these economies, after a
1 standard deviation shock equal to 1.3 percentage
points, inflation expectations five years out rise by
only 0.07 percentage point, which is statistically
indistinguishable from the response estimated for
advanced economies. By contrast, where there is no
inflation-targeting framework, inflation expectations
as far as five years out rise by 0.5 percentage point
following a 1 standard deviation surprise in currentyear inflation.16 However, as discussed in the October 2008 issue of the World Economic Outlook, the
apparent benefits of inflation targeting may reflect
the general quality of domestic monetary management and institutions in economies that adopt such
a framework rather than the particular benefits of
inflation targeting.

in advanced economies following a given inflation surprise—
(0.3/1.8) divided by (0.04/0.6).
15For the purposes of the analysis, an inflation-targeting framework is identified based on the definition in Roger (2010), which
includes four main elements: (1) an explicit central bank mandate
to pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary
policy and a high degree of operational autonomy; (2) explicit
quantitative targets for inflation; (3) central bank accountability
for performance in achieving the inflation objective, mainly
through high-transparency requirements for policy strategy and
implementation; and (4) a policy approach based on a forwardlooking assessment of inflation pressures, taking into account a
wide array of information.
16Most of these economies have pegged exchange rates, which
reduces their ability to respond to shocks to domestic inflation.
However, additional analysis suggests that inflation expectations are just as weakly anchored in emerging and developing
economies that do not have an inflation-targeting framework and
have floating exchange rates (according to the de facto classification compiled by Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff, 2008). Thus,
the association between inflation targeting and the anchoring of
expectations is not driven by the exchange rate regime.

Given the preceding discussion, pass-through
from food to headline inflation might be expected
to be higher where the share of food in consumption is larger and inflation expectations are less well
anchored. This is indeed what we find. An estimation of the effect of food prices on headline inflation
is shown in Figure 3.9.17 The figure also includes, for
reference, the median pass-through from international food prices to domestic food prices as calculated earlier in Figure 3.4.
The pass-through is much higher in emerging
and developing economies, where the food share is
typically higher and inflation expectations are less
well anchored than in advanced economies. When
combined with the fact that the pass-through from
international to domestic food prices is higher in
emerging market economies, it highlights that the
effects of commodity prices on those economies are
much larger than for advanced economies.
Overall, the preceding discussion has highlighted
the following key characteristics of the data, which will
inform the model-based analysis in the next section:
• Distinguishing between one-time and persistent
commodity price shocks is difficult.
• Food has a high share in the consumption baskets
of emerging and developing economies.
• Inflation expectations are well anchored in
advanced economies and in inflation-targeting
emerging and developing economies.
• Inflation expectations are less well anchored in
some emerging and developing economies without
inflation-targeting regimes.
• The pass-through from food prices to headline
inflation is higher on average in emerging and
developing economies than in advanced economies.

policy response to international food price shocks using

monetary policy credibility and the food share in consumption baskets. For simplicity, energy price shocks
are not included. The model assesses the implications
of defining the central bank’s inflation goal in terms of
headline inflation versus a measure of underlying inflation. This measure is not directly affected by temporary
food price shocks and here is called “core inflation.”18

implied above, within the context of this model, there is
no distinction between core inflation and underlying inflation. The
key feature of the food component is that it is subject to exogenous
shocks that are largely beyond the control of domestic policymakers
and that the core measure is not directly affected by these shocks.
In practice, this food component might apply more to items such
as fresh fruit and vegetables than to restaurant meals and other
prepared meals, which largely reflect more slowly moving rental
and labor costs. The core measure could also be constructed as a
trimmed mean rather than an exclusion-based measure. Such practical matters are discussed in the final section of this chapter.
19The Phillips curve links current core inflation to past and
expected core inflation, the output gap, and the real exchange
rate change. The IS equation relates output gap growth to the
real interest rate and the real exchange rate. Finally, the uncovered
interest parity links exchange rate depreciation to the domestic
and world interest rate differential.
20The monetary policy literature is divided over the credibility
problem: the monetary authority either is fully credible, and the
central bank is able to manage the private sector’s expectations, or
it is not credible at all. The latter case corresponds to “discretion,”
which means that the central bank conducts policy while taking
the private sector’s expectations as given (see Woodford, 2003). The
approach here seeks a middle ground between those two extremes.

The analysis focuses on a small open economy that
takes international commodity prices as given. The
structure of the model is relatively standard and in
line with the recent “New Keynesian” macroeconomic
literature. It consists of three equations: an aggregate
supply schedule (expectations-augmented Phillips
curve); an intertemporal aggregate demand (IS) equation; and an exchange rate–real interest rate parity
equation.19 Within this three-equation bloc the model
shares results commonly found in the New Keynesian
literature. In particular, regardless of the food share
in the consumption basket, the central bank is fairly
well able to simultaneously stabilize both core inflation
and the output gap—although at the cost of a volatile
nominal interest rate.
A distinguishing feature of the model is the
introduction of an endogenous credibility formation
process, as in Alichi and others (2009).20 The cred-

Note: Estimates of pass-through from international to domestic food price inflation are
from Figure 3.4. Estimates of the pass-through from domestic food prices to headline
inflation are obtained by regressing headline inflation on lags of itself and current and
lagged values of domestic food price inflation. To control for endogeneity, domestic food
price inflation is instrumented by inflation in the international food price index expressed
in domestic currency. The reported result is the median of country-by-country
regressions.

ibility of monetary policy depends on the evolving
track record of inflation relative to a long-term target. More precisely, it is assumed that a low-inflation
target is announced once and for all by the central
bank and is thereafter held constant. The central
bank builds credibility over time by consistently
attaining an inflation rate close to the targeted rate.
The idea is that, in the long term, if monetary policy
consistently holds inflation to the target rate, private
sector inflation expectations become anchored to the
inflation target.21 Therefore, higher inflation volatility can complicate the task of establishing credibility,
because it generally results in missing the target.
To make the model more realistic, inflation that is
above the target is assumed to imply a higher loss
of credibility than inflation that is below the target;
moreover, when inflation is way off target (a big
miss), the effects are assumed to be disproportionately larger than for a small miss.
How does credibility affect the rest of the
economy? An imperfect level of credibility substantially amplifies the trade-off between outlook
and inflation that central banks face. In the model
we assume that this amplification can happen in
at least three different ways: (1) inflation expectations become more backward-looking and less well
anchored (which increases inflation’s persistence and
makes it more difficult to stabilize inflation once it
is off target); 22 (2) inflation expectations gain an
upward bias; and (3) the pass-through from food to
core inflation rises. This last channel captures the
idea that cost-push inflation pressures stemming
from the wage-bargaining process are stronger when
central bank credibility is low. In other words, the
lower the credibility, the higher the second-round
effects. Most important, this introduces a clear tradeoff between stabilizing core inflation and stabilizing
the output gap. With full credibility, second-round
effects disappear and inflation expectations are
21However,

the credibility stock is also assumed to gradually
rise over time, capturing the transitional process of building credibility typical of many economies. Starting from a relatively low
initial credibility stock allows us to study how this convergence
process can be hampered by commodity price shocks.
22The inflation bias and its importance when there is a lack of
central bank credibility have been documented in various studies,
such as Pasaogullari and Tsonev (2008), who examine the experience of the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s.

entirely forward-looking, implying that even a highly
persistent increase in food prices has little effect on
expectations. By contrast, if credibility is low, even a
one-time rise in food prices can de-anchor inflation
expectations and induce strong second-round effects
on core inflation. Restraining inflation then requires
substantial monetary policy tightening (see Alichi
and others, 2009).
The analysis also distinguishes between three
stylized economy types. The key features that
distinguish these economies are the degree of policy
credibility and the share of food in households’
consumption baskets. In the first economy, the share
of food in the CPI is assumed to be 30 percent—in
line with the average for emerging and developing
economies—and the degree of policy credibility is
low. In the second, the share of food in the CPI is
still high, but the degree of policy credibility is also
high. Finally, in the third economy, the share of food
in the CPI is low (set at 10 percent), and the degree
of policy credibility is high.23 These can be considered, respectively, as an emerging and developing
economy, a high-credibility emerging and developing
economy, and a high-credibility advanced economy,
but the emphasis is on the food share and credibility
rather than on the stage of development.
For a given credibility level, the pass-through
from food prices to core inflation is proportional to
the food share. This implies that a high-food-share
economy faces stronger second-round effects (and,
hence, a worse policy trade-off) than one where the
food share is low. In addition, to capture the fact
that the wage-bargaining process is more affected by
changes in food inflation in emerging market economies, the weight on relative food price inflation in
driving inflation dynamics is assumed to be relatively
high.
The model determines the optimal monetary
policy response—through changes in the shortterm interest rate—given the central bank’s policy
objectives. These relate to the variances of inflation,
23A

10 percent food share was chosen rather than the 17 percent estimated for the advanced economies in the empirical section to accentuate the differences between the two groups. There
is also, logically, a fourth kind of economy to consider: one with
a low food share in the CPI and a low degree of credibility. As a
practical matter, the evidence from the previous section suggests
that this kind of economy is rare, and it is excluded.

the output gap, and changes in short-term interest
rates. The model postulates that the central bank
sets interest rates to minimize variability along all
three dimensions.24 With food price shocks, a policy
trade-off arises because substantial movements in the
policy rate may be required to stabilize inflation and
the output gap. Moreover, second-round effects—in
the Phillips curve, from domestic food inflation to
core inflation—generate a policy trade-off between
the output gap and core inflation. The central bank’s
policy preferences determine how it trades off gains
from reducing inflation against the costs of lower
output and higher interest rate volatility.

Food price Shocks with core or headline inflation
targets
We consider two policy frameworks: one in which
the target of monetary policy and the credibility
formation process are based on headline inflation,
and one in which they are based on core inflation.
Each framework has two elements: the measure
of inflation targeted by the central bank and the
measure of inflation the private sector uses to evaluate the central bank’s track record relative to the
target––its credibility. Under a headline framework,
the public evaluates the performance of the central
bank based on how close headline inflation is to the
target. Under a core framework, the public evaluates
the performance of the central bank based on how
close underlying inflation is to the target. The choice
of the framework has important consequences for
conducting monetary policy and the resilience of the
policy framework to various shocks. For example,
keeping core inflation at the target would imply no
loss of credibility under the core framework, even if
headline inflation were to rise above core inflation.
Missing the headline inflation target in the headline
24Formally, the central bank minimizes a loss function consisting of the weighted sum of the squared deviations of inflation
from target, the squared output gap, and the square of the change
in the short-term nominal interest rate. The weights in the loss
function reflect the central bank’s preferences regarding the
stabilization of these three variables. In the baseline, the weights
on inflation and output stabilization are equal (set to 1) and four
times larger than the weight on interest rate stabilization (set to
0.25). We also test the robustness of the results to alternative
weights, as discussed in the text.

framework comes with a loss of credibility and thus
a worsening output-inflation trade-off.
Through its effect on credibility, the choice of the
framework eventually may affect the way expectations are formed.25 More precisely, a low level of
credibility implies that private sector expectations
are barely managed by the monetary authority. At
the extreme of no credibility, monetary policy has
no effect on private sector expectations. At the other
extreme, policy announcements by a perfectly credible monetary authority have a substantial effect on
private sector expectations.
The next paragraphs compare how these two
frameworks perform in the three different types of
economies following a shock to international food
prices.
Stylized emerging and developing economy
We first consider a high-food-share (30 percent),
low-credibility economy that is hit by a one-time
international food price shock.26 To abstract from
cyclical factors, inflation is set initially at its target
level, and the output gap is set to zero. We relax
these assumptions later. The shock is assumed to
raise international food inflation by 5 percentage
points. The simulation is conducted twice, first
assuming that the policy framework is defined in
terms of headline inflation and then assuming it is
defined in terms of core inflation.
Under the headline framework, the central bank
loses policy credibility in the short term because the
shock’s direct effect raises headline inflation above
the target (Figure 3.10). In response, to stabilize
headline inflation, the central bank tightens policy,
thus raising real interest rates and causing a real
25There are elements of this idea in the Central Bank of Egypt’s
(CBE’s) recent decision to publish a core inflation measure. As the
CBE Annual Report 2009/2010 explains (p. A), “By timely communicating the core inflation measure, the CBE aims to improve
understanding of inflation dynamics. This is expected to reduce
the pass-through of temporary price shocks to inflation expectations and, in turn, minimize the variability in inflation.” Similarly,
the RBNZ has stated, “…the initial move to inflation targets
arose from a wish to influence inflationary expectations by stating
clearly the Government’s commitments” (Sherwin, 1999).
26International commodity prices have historically been well
modeled as random walks, with changes that are unpredictable
and not systematically followed by further changes in the same
direction.

114

appreciation of the currency.27 This policy tightening
directly reduces the domestic price of imported food
by raising the value of the domestic currency, and
also restrains inflation by causing an output contraction. In addition, with the initial loss of policy credibility, inflation expectations become de-anchored
and more backward-looking. Restoring policy
credibility and reducing inflation expectations then
require a sustained output slump with headline inflation a little below normal (inflation undershooting).
By contrast, under the core framework, the output cost of keeping core inflation close to its target
is lower. In the short term, headline inflation rises by
about the same amount as in the headline framework. However, with the central bank’s mandate
specified in terms of core inflation––which rises
by less than headline inflation on impact––policy
credibility is much less affected. The effects of this
are significant. The enhanced policy credibility keeps
inflation expectations better anchored and implies
less need for policy tightening and output contraction. Consequently, both core and headline inflation are more stable under the core framework than
under the headline framework. When combined
with the smaller output loss, this implies that the
core framework delivers superior macroeconomic
stability. Nonetheless, if the central bank also cares
about output gap stabilization, it must accept some
second-round effects on core inflation.
The striking finding that targeting core inflation
can deliver more stability in terms of both output and headline inflation than targeting headline
inflation is robust to alternative weighting of policy
priorities between inflation and output stabilization.
This result is illustrated in Figure 3.11, which shows
the policy frontier with respect to output gap and
headline inflation volatility.28 The core framework
shifts the frontier toward zero. This implies that,
over certain ranges, it is possible to simultaneously
27The

result—the real exchange rate appreciates in response to
a rise in the price of imports (food)—is similar to the case of the
“worst sufferer” economy modeled by Catão and Chang (2010),
in which a rise in food or other commodity prices entails a termsof-trade deterioration and a concomitant real exchange rate appreciation. See Box 3.2 for a further discussion of the implications
of commodity price shocks for the comovement of the terms of
trade and the real exchange rate in different types of economies.
28See Figure 3.11 for details on the policy frontier calculations.

achieve lower headline inflation volatility and lower
output volatility by adopting a core framework.
A key element underlying the better performance
of the core framework is that the temporary shock to
headline inflation is not taken as a signal of central bank failure, and thus credibility and inflation
expectations are not negatively affected. Focusing on
core inflation here protects the central bank’s credibility from the effects of international commodity
price shocks that are, broadly speaking, beyond the
control of domestic policymakers.29
The headline framework can deliver the lowest
levels of headline inflation volatility—at the cost of
significantly higher output volatility. In an economy
in which headline inflation is much more important
than output in determining overall welfare, it may
be optimal to choose a headline framework.30 We
return to the implications of these findings, particularly for countries with a high food share in consumption, in the final section of this chapter.
Stylized emerging and developing economy with
high policy credibility
The case of an economy with a high food share
but also high policy credibility illustrates the benefits
of high credibility for emerging and developing
economies. As the analysis above suggests, some
emerging and developing economies have betteranchored inflation expectations than others.
As Figure 3.12 shows, in this case, with betteranchored inflation expectations, the degree of
monetary policy tightening needed is smaller than
in the previous case. Moreover, high credibility
substantially reduces second-round effects, which
is particularly important for economies with a high

29This would be equally applicable to a country that is self-sufficient in food. In this case, however, food prices would be subject
to domestic weather shocks rather than international food price
shocks. The conclusions are the same: a central bank will be better
able to preserve its credibility in the face of food price shocks if
that credibility is built on core rather than headline inflation.
30Numerous studies in the literature assume equal weights
placed on inflation and output in the loss function, including
Gilchrist and Saito (2006). By contrast, in Figure 3.11, a weight
on inflation that is approximately six times as large as that placed
on output is required for the headline inflation framework to be
preferable to the core inflation framework.

Figure 3.11. Inflation-Output Policy Frontier
In emerging and developing economies with a high food share and low monetary
policy credibility, targeting core inflation after a one-time food inflation shock helps
to stabilize both output and headline inflation. Only when the relative weight on
inflation is very high is it preferable to target headline inflation.

food share.31 Overall, higher credibility contributes
to more stable economic outcomes, because expectations are better-anchored and policy responses to
shocks can be more measured—reducing the resultant output fluctuations.
The core inflation framework still achieves greater
output stabilization than the headline framework.
As with the first simulation, the policy frontier shifts
toward zero (although both frontiers are closer to
zero as a result of the higher level of credibility).
In both cases, optimal policy requires that some
second-round effects be allowed. Core inflation rises
slightly above the target under both frameworks, but
it then undershoots under the headline framework
because the real exchange rate, after the initial appreciation, takes longer to normalize.
Stylized advanced economy
Finally, we consider how the results change for an
economy with a low food share––set at 10 percent
of the CPI rather than 30 percent as in the previous
simulations––as well as higher initial policy credibility (as introduced in the second simulation).
Figure 3.13 shows that, for this type of economy,
the difference between the two frameworks in terms
of macroeconomic stability following food price
shocks is negligible. In particular, with the small
food share and with well-anchored inflation expectations, the effect of the international food shock is far
smaller than in the other simulations.

Variance of output gap
Source: IMF staff estimates.
Note: The policy frontier is traced out by varying the weights attached to the three
target variables in the central bank’s loss function—namely, variances in inflation, the
output gap, and policy rate changes. In particular, we normalize the weight on the
variance of the output gap to 1 and fix the weight on the policy rate at 0.25. The points
on the frontier are then computed by changing the weight on inflation variance from
zero to 500. In this model these weights correspond to a society’s preference for
output volatility or inflation volatility.

persistent Shocks
The above analysis considers the response to
food price shocks under the assumption that they
are known to be one-time occurrences. However,
as discussed in the introduction, there are concerns
that shocks may be becoming more persistent. This
section therefore explores the effect of a larger, more
persistent food price shock.32 Figure 3.14 shows
the response of a high-food-share, low-credibility
31Recall

that the pass-through from food inflation to core inflation is proportional to the food share and the credibility gap.
32The initial size of the shock is the same as for the one-time
shocks considered above. However, for this experiment, prices
continue to increase after the initial shock, although at a declining
rate. More formally, we consider a shock with an autoregressive
parameter of 0.5, such that the first period increase is 5 percent-

economy to a persistent international food price
shock and shows that the response is stronger than
to the one-time shock. With a persistent shock, the
central bank anticipates further food price increases
down the road and increases the interest rate by
more to minimize a potential loss of credibility.
This, in turn, mitigates the effect of expected future
pass-through from food to core inflation, dampening the surge of expected inflation. This interaction
between credibility losses and second-round effects is
less relevant when the shock is known to be purely
temporary: with no expectation of further food price
shocks, pass-through from food to core inflation is
not relevant. This logic also can be seen in the reaction of the credibility index. In the case of a temporary shock, credibility is allowed to drop in the first
period, given that no further inflation pressures are
expected. In the case of persistent shocks, the central
bank is more concerned about losing credibility
because of the difficulty of regaining it in the face
of continued inflation pressure from food prices.
That is, if one anticipates further price shocks in the
future, it is more important to preserve credibility
than if no further price shocks are expected.

commodity price Shocks and cyclical conditions
How does the appropriate monetary policy
response to a persistent food price shock differ for
advanced economies with substantial economic slack
and for emerging and developing economies with
excess demand pressures and relatively low initial real
interest rates?33
In Figure 3.15, the contrast between the two types
of economies is dramatic. The different outcomes
are driven mainly by two elements: the change in
inflation for a given change in the output gap is
increasing with the size of the output gap (that is,
the slope of the Phillips curve is increasing in the
output gap), and the additional loss of credibility is
higher the greater the miss. Hence, in the emerging
and developing model economy, policy credibility
age points, the second period increase is 2.5 percentage points,
the third period increase is 1.25 percentage points, and so on.
33For the purposes of this exercise, we assume central banks are
using a headline framework, but the main conclusions are similar
for a core framework.

Figure 3.12. Response to a Food Price Shock in a
Stylized High-Credibility Emerging and Developing
Economy
In economies with a high food share in consumption and high monetary policy
credibility, less monetary policy tightening is needed after a one-time food price
shock. Targeting core inflation still achieves greater output stabilization, but there is
now a slightly greater increase in headline inflation in the short term.

is already negatively affected by preexisting excess
demand pressures and above-target inflation. The
persistent food price shock exacerbates this credibility loss. A rapid rise in interest rates to well above
normal is then required to restore policy credibility
and re-anchor inflation expectations. By contrast,
for the advanced model economy, the disinflationary effect of economic slack dominates the small
inflationary effect of the food price shock. With
medium-term expectations well anchored and thus
small pass-through to core inflation, the required
policy adjustment involves only a gradual withdrawal
of monetary policy stimulus.

policy implications for responding to
commodity price Shocks
This section outlines some key policy implications
of the chapter’s analysis and some practical considerations about how to measure underlying inflation.
First, changes in commodity prices are likely to
have a stronger and longer-lasting effect on inflation in emerging and developing economies than in
advanced economies. There are three main reasons
for this: in emerging and developing economies (1)
the pass-through from international commodity
prices is higher, (2) food and energy consumption
shares tend to be higher, and (3) medium-term inflation expectations are less well anchored.
Second, the simulations show that central banks
in economies with low credibility and high food
shares in consumption may be able to better preserve
and build monetary policy credibility by setting
and communicating monetary policy in terms of
underlying inflation (taken to be core inflation in
our model) rather than headline inflation. Basing
the policy objective on a measure of inflation that is
inherently more stable and less subject to large and
unpredictable international commodity price shocks
is thus preferable. The higher policy credibility in
turn allows the central bank to stabilize inflation
(both headline and core) with less monetary policy
tightening and a smaller associated output loss.
For these economies, the choice between focusing
on core or headline inflation depends on the relative
welfare gains from stabilizing headline inflation versus stabilizing output. It is sometimes suggested that,

chapter 3

with high food shares in the consumption basket,
the economic costs of volatility in food prices and
headline inflation are high, and that it is therefore
more appropriate to tie monetary policy closely to
headline inflation targets. However, lowering the
volatility of headline inflation means increasing the
volatility of output and unemployment, and the
economic costs of unemployment can also be very
high in these economies. Although assessing the
social and economic factors involved in ranking
such priorities is beyond the scope of this chapter,
the analysis does illustrate that there are significant
trade-offs involved.
Setting and communicating monetary policy in
terms of underlying inflation are likely to require
significant effort on the part of the central bank. The
importance of effective communication is evident in
the sustained and ultimately successful efforts of the
initial cohort of inflation-targeting central banks in
this regard. The central banks in Australia, Canada,
and New Zealand established their inflation-targeting frameworks in terms of a core inflation measure
or with a prominent short-term role for core inflation and undertook sustained efforts to explain what
they were doing to the public.34 When inflation was
successfully brought down and the policy was highly
credible, these central banks moved to targeting
headline inflation.35
In the absence of an effective communication
strategy, however, simply changing the operating
target to a measure of underlying inflation, such
as core inflation, could be counterproductive. For
example, policy credibility could suffer and economic outcomes could deteriorate if the central
bank’s performance continued to be evaluated based
on the volatility of headline inflation when it is tar34For

example, in the case of Australia, in 1999 Glenn Stevens,
the assistant governor (and now governor) of the Reserve Bank
of Australia observed that “One important presentational change
that we did make was a progressive upgrading of the quality and
quantity of our published material on the economy. Financial
markets and the media began to take much more notice of the
quarterly pieces we put out. The extent of this change has been
quite substantial. In early 1992, these documents were typically
4 or 5 pages in length. By the middle of 1994, they had grown to
15–16 pages. In more recent years, Semi-Annual Statements have
on occasion approached 50 pages, and exceeded 20,000 words”
(Stevens, 1999).

geting core inflation. Any policy transition must be
built on a firm foundation that includes effectively
demonstrating the relevance of the chosen measure
of underlying inflation.
Another important element in establishing a
regime is the precise definition of the inflation
target. As noted, a common criticism of exclusionbased core inflation measures is that they ignore the
effects of food and fuel prices, which can undermine
the credibility of the target in the eyes of the public.
Additional credibility problems can arise if the average rate of inflation varies depending on which measure is used. In that respect, one of the key findings
of this analysis is that the target measure of inflation
should be resilient to transitory shocks from commodity prices, but an exclusion-based measure of
inflation is not the only such target. For example,
trimmed-mean or median measures of inflation do
not automatically exclude food and fuel prices but
still provide a less volatile and more robust measure
of overall inflation trends than headline measures.36
Such measures have tended to have the same average
rates of inflation as headline measures over the long
term.37
In practice, there is no perfect measure of
underlying inflation, and different measures may be
appropriate depending on the country and circumstances. Many central banks have chosen to target
a headline inflation forecast and clarify what that
forecast assumes for food and fuel prices. At least
with respect to commodity price shocks, this is akin
to targeting a measure of underlying inflation. The
use of forecasts also allows for more flexibility than
does a framework tied closely to current inflation,
because the central bank can monitor a wide range
of indicators of underlying inflation and place varying weights on these indicators as circumstances
change. One drawback to using forecasts is that it is
36See Bryan and Cecchetti (1993) for a discussion of these
measures.
37See Brischetto and Richards (2007) for a discussion of the
long-term performance of trimmed-mean measures in Australia,
the euro area, Japan, and the United States. It is possible to calculate asymmetric trims if the long-term averages do diverge (see,
for example, Roger, 1997). However, as Brischetto and Richards
argue, asymmetric trims may be harder to explain to the public
and this may complicate the establishment of a targeting regime
based upon them.

chapter 3

difficult to monitor the central bank’s performance,
because tomorrow never comes, which only increases
the importance of a strong communications policy.
(Other aspects of forecast targeting, such as the optimal time horizon, must also be carefully considered,
but these are beyond the scope of this chapter.)38

38A

related question regards the appropriate level for the inflation target when there are permanent shifts in the relative prices
of commodities such as food and fuel. In such cases, targeting
headline inflation implies a different long-term level for core
inflation, and vice versa. If, for some reason, annual growth of 2
percent in the CPI index were deemed appropriate, the central
bank could communicate an equivalent target for underlying
inflation. However, a discussion of the appropriate level for an
inflation target is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Target What You Can Hit: Commodity Price Swings and Monetary Policy

Finally, the simulations related to the current
global environment underscore the policy advice
implied by the cyclical positions alone. In emerging
and developing economies with excess demand pressures, inflation already above target, and a high share
of food in consumption baskets, tighter monetary
conditions can help mitigate the negative effects of
potential future food price shocks and the associated loss of monetary policy credibility. In contrast,
in advanced economies with substantial economic
slack, well-anchored inflation expectations, and a
low share of food in consumption, there is ample
room for monetary policy to accommodate any
future commodity price shocks with little loss of
credibility.

Simulation model details
Headline inflation ptH is the weighted average of
domestic food inflation ptF and core inflation pt .
ptH = (1 – wF )pt + wF ptF.

(3.1)

The parameter wF represents the share of food in the
consumption basket.
A Phillips curve relates current core inflation to
past and expected core inflation, previous period
output gap xt–1, the change in the real exchange rate
change, DRER, and a term related to second-round
effects from food to core inflation:
pt = apw,t + (1 – a)pb,t–1 + g(xt–1) + be DRERt
+ (1 + d – St )wF (pFt–1 – pt–1).
(3.2)
The function g(x) is increasing and convex in
its argument, S is the credibility stock bounded
between zero and 1, and a and d are parameters.39
The variables pw and pb represent the forward- and
backward-looking terms of the Phillips curve, which
are defined as follows:
pw,t = Stpb,t+4 + (1 – St )(pb,t–1 + biast )

(3.3)

4 p

pb,t = ∑ ——.
i=0 4

(3.4)

The lower the current credibility stock, St , the higher
the importance of past inflation and the inflation
bias term (bias) associated with imperfect credibility.
The current stock of credibility has the following law
of motion:
St = ϑSt–1 + (1 – ϑ)st

(3.5)

(mh,t – pttg)2
st = ——————————.
(mh,t – pttg)2 + (ml,t – pttg)2

(3.6)

The credibility signal st is bounded between zero
and 1, and the parameter ϑ (0 < ϑ < 1) governs
the rate at which credibility converges to st . The
variables mh and ml represent the inflation rates
prevailing in the high- and low-inflation regimes,
as perceived by the private sector. The variable pttg

represents the inflation measure for which the central bank is held accountable. The closer pttg is to the
high-inflation level, the greater the loss in credibility.
The perceived inflation rates prevailing in the highand low-inflation regimes are as follows:
tg + (1 – a )phigh
mh,t = ahpt–1

(3.7)

tg + (1 – a )plow .
ml,t = alpt–1

(3.8)

We interpret plow as the (constant) target chosen
by the central bank, and we assume phigh >> plow
such that we can focus on cases where pttg ≤ mh,t at
all times. The lowest level of credibility occurs when
mh,t = pttg, implying that credibility, St , declines to
zero at rate ϑ.
The choice of the framework boils down to the
choice of pttg. In the case of the core framework, we

The output gap is governed by an intertemporal aggregate demand (IS) equation that links the

the current real exchange rate, RER. An uncovered

analysis of pass-through from international Food
prices to domestic Food prices
The pass-through analysis is based on a countryby-country regression of monthly domestic food
price inflation on current and 12 lags of monthly
international commodity price inflation (converted
to domestic currency), controlling for 12 lags
of domestic food price inflation. The economies
included in the database are listed in Appendix 3.1.
The regression is run on the inflation rates because,
despite long-term trends in the price levels, there
is no evidence of a long-term relationship between
the world food price index and domestic CPI food
baskets. (Likely reasons for this are discussed in the
section “From International to Domestic Commodity Prices.”) In particular, the estimated equation is
as follows:
12

12

j=1

k=0

dom + ∑ g pint + e ,
ptdom = ∑ bj pt–j
k t–k
i,t

(3.14)

where ptdom denotes domestic food inflation in
month t, and pint
t–k denotes international food
inflation in month t. The long-term pass-through
coefficient is computed as the sum of the coefficients
on international food price inflation (gk) divided
by 1 minus the sum of the coefficients on lagged
domestic food inflation (bj). An analogous equation
is estimated to investigate the pass-through from
international oil prices to domestic transportation
prices. The sample includes 31 advanced economies
and 47 emerging and developing economies over
the period 2000–11. The long-term coefficients are
generally statistically significant.

analysis of inflation expectations
The change in future inflation expectations is the
dependent variable on the left side of equation 3.15,
and the explanatory variable on the right side is the
unexpected change in current-year inflation, defined
as the revision of expectations for inflation in year

t made between spring and fall of year t. Thus, the
equation estimated is
DEitpi,t+N = a + bDEit pit + mi + lt + ni,t ,

(3.15)

where the subscript i denotes the ith country, the
subscript t denotes the tth year, and DEitpi,t+N
denotes the revision of expectations for inflation in
year t+N. The approach includes a full set of country
dummies (mi ) and a full set of time dummies (lt )
to take account of global shocks such as oil prices
and the global business cycle. The estimation results
are similar without controlling for global shocks,
suggesting that inflation expectations are anchored
roughly equally following global and domestic inflation shocks. The data on inflation expectations come
from Consensus Economics and are based on surveys

ber) from 1990 to 2010. An alternative measure of
inflation expectations is based on the difference in
yields between conventional and inflation-linked
bonds (see, for example, Söderlind and Svensson,
1997). However, such yield-based estimates are not
widely available for the economies considered in this
chapter.
Additional analysis suggests that the response of
medium-term expectations is similar for positive and
negative inflation surprises. In particular, allowing
positive and negative inflation surprises to have different effects by estimating an augmented equation,
DEitpi,t+N = a + bDEitpit + gDPositiveit
+ mi + lt + ni,t ,

(3.16)

where the term gDPositiveit denotes a positive inflation surprise, yields an estimate of coefficient g that
is statistically indistinguishable from zero.

Box 3.1. inflation in Sub-Saharan africa during the 2008 commodity price Surge

Structure of Sub-Saharan Economies
The majority of SSA economies have low income
levels. The median gross national annual income in
our sample was $950 per capita during 2001–05,
much less than the median country in the world
($5,200). Because households in these economies
tend to be poor, they spend a larger fraction of
their income on food—about 50 percent—than do
households in middle- and high-income countries
(about 30 and 15 percent, respectively). There are,
however, considerable variations in both income
per capita and the share of expenditure allocated
to food (Figure 3.1.1), with some countries
(Botswana, Gabon, South Africa) in the middleincome category.
Economic performance in SSA economies is
particularly vulnerable to changes in the external

This box focuses on the experience of 31 subSaharan African (SSA) economies during the food
and fuel price surge of 2008 to highlight potential challenges for policymakers when facing such
shocks. We start by considering these economies’
broad macroeconomic environment and inflation experience during this period. Drawing on
IMF Staff Reports, we then examine broad policy
responses that help explain the experience of these
economies during this price surge. Finally, we summarize the experience of the median SSA economy.
Although in most economies inflation increased
during this period, experience varied widely and
largely reflected differences in the policy mix rather
than the effects of the food price shock itself. These
results point to the importance of the policy stance
in maintaining stable inflation in low-income
countries facing external shocks. We also find that,
although food inflation increased considerably for
the median African country—accounting for most
of the increase in headline inflation—domestic food
prices were partially shielded from international
prices due to sizable real currency appreciation,
differences in food baskets, and the incomplete
tradability of food. Spillovers from food and fuel
to nonfood, nonfuel inflation were also somewhat
limited, suggesting moderate second-round effects.

environment. The region’s trade consists primarily of
commodities, with many economies specializing in
one or two commodities. As net importers of food
and fuel, all economies are exposed to large fluctuations in their terms of trade. In addition, access to
international capital markets is limited, although
countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia
experience large movements in private capital flows.
In addition, most countries rely on official flows,
such as grants and concessional loans, and remittances to finance sizable current account deficits.

Although SSA economies have often been
subject to episodes of high inflation associated
with economic and political instability, the
region generally succeeded in stabilizing and
reducing inflation during the first half of the
2000s. During this period, fiscal dominance—
subordination of monetary policy to fiscal
needs—subsided and growth accelerated. The
median inflation rate in the region stood at 6

percent by mid-2007, compared with 15 percent
in 2000. Low inflation was achieved using a
variety of monetary and exchange rate policies.
About one-third of SSA economies (half our
sample) operate hard pegs, of which most are
in the CFA franc area. The rest have flexible
exchange rate arrangements, ranging from soft
pegs to fully floating arrangements. In the latter,
central bank intervention in foreign exchange
markets is common. Most countries with managed floats target monetary aggregates, although
with considerable flexibility, and some can be
considered to be practicing “inflation targeting
light.” In particular, although they target inflation, they do not have the institutional framework to formally adopt inflation targeting.1

1See Carare and Stone (2003). South Africa is a full-fledged
inflation targeter, and Ghana is formally transitioning to inflation targeting.

126

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

Although inflation in SSA economies generally
increased during the 2008 commodity price surge,
there was a broad range of experience. Figure 3.1.2
illustrates this range using a histogram of the change
in inflation in SSA economies between September
2007 and September 2008.
The variation in food and nonfood inflation was
associated with a number of policy variables and
economic features. In particular, as Table 3.1.1
shows, economies that reduced taxes on food or
introduced export bans or quotas experienced
smaller increases in food prices. The relationship
between these policies and nonfood inflation was
less clear. In addition, economies with lower income
levels faced larger increases in food inflation, possibly because they could not afford the fiscal measures
that would have offset the short-term effects of
world food prices on domestic food prices.
The case of Madagascar illustrates the role of
policy. Rice is the most important item in the food
basket in Madagascar (15 percent of total consumption, and 55 to 70 percent of the daily caloric intake
of households). As international prices increased in
2008, domestic prices—measured in U.S. dollars—stayed broadly constant (Figure 3.1.3). The
government intervened actively in the rice market,
imposing a suspension of rice exports in April and
lowering value-added taxes on rice in the second
half of the year, at an estimated budgetary cost of
0.3 percent of GDP.2 In addition, the gap between
domestic production and consumption in 2008 was
closed by means of imports at preferential prices.
IMF Staff Reports shed light on these factors.
These reports suggest that the policy responses and
outcomes fall into three broad categories:
• Economies where increases in food and fuel
inflation account for most of the inflation
dynamics: Economies in this group include most
of the CFA franc area countries that are not oil
exporters (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde,
Central African Republic, Comoros, GuineaBissau, Mali, Togo) as well as some with managed
floats (Uganda, Mozambique). In these countries

nonfood, nonfuel inflation did not increase,
partly because inflation expectations were better
anchored. (Uganda has a track record of low
inflation, while historically fixed parity with the
euro has kept inflation low in the CFA franc
area.) In some CFA franc countries, monetary
policy tightened endogenously as these countries
faced pressures on the balance of payments—
partly due to their status as food importers—and
lost reserves during this period. Note that, in
spite of the solid anchor, CFA franc countries
experienced very large increases in food and fuel
inflation, consistent with large pass-through
of international prices to domestic prices. The
policy response in Uganda and Mozambique was
different, however: money targets were relaxed
and interest rates stayed broadly constant.
• Economies with expansionary macroeconomic
policies: These economies experienced high or
accelerating inflation during both 2007 and
2008, partly because of rising food inflation but
also because of aggregate demand pressures and a
loose policy mix. In some cases (Angola, Gabon,
Nigeria), the aggregate demand pressures reflected
an expansionary fiscal policy driven by higher
oil revenues. In others (Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Tanzania), the aggregate demand expansion
reflected a combination of higher aid-financed
government spending with unsterilized accumulation of reserves.3 Many of these economies had
higher public wage bills. With the exception of
3This policy combination is often referred to as “spending
but not absorbing” the aid (see Berg and others, 2010).

Angola and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria, fuel prices
were also increasing, suggesting possible fueldriven inflation pressures.
• Economies that monetize debt: These are the
countries with the highest inflation increases
(about 20 to 30 percent), reflecting generalized
price pressures—that is, very large increases in
both food and nonfood prices. Unlike the previous group, the inflationary spike resulted from
the complete subordination of monetary policy to

fiscal needs during this period. The Democratic
Republic of Congo and Ethiopia fall into this
category.
In sum, the cross-country experience suggests
that, although all economies faced the same international commodity price shock, the policy stance
helped shape the specific outcomes.

Inflation in the Median SSA Economy
Having discussed the variation across economies,
we now summarize the experience of the median
SSA economy during the 2008 commodity price
surge. Given the large weight of food in consumer
expenditures, a hefty increase in domestic food
prices was to be expected in low-income countries
(first-round effects). Nonfood inflation could also
be expected to rise sharply due to higher fuel prices
and potential spillovers from food to nonfood prices
(second-round effects).
The experience of the median SSA economy
provides evidence of first-round effects. In particular, as Table 3.1.2 shows, by September 2008—the
month prices increased the most—food inflation
had increased by 9.4 percentage points (from 6.4
percent to 15.8 percent) relative to the previous
year. The increase, although large, was considerably
smaller than the increase over the same period in the
inflation rate in U.S. dollars of an index of internationally traded food commodities (29.3 percent).
Two factors account for this large discrepancy. First,
the median SSA economy experienced a nominal
exchange rate appreciation of 9.3 percentage points
against the U.S. dollar. This reduced, by one-third,
the local currency equivalent of international food

inflation—that is, “imported” food inflation.
Second, because baskets are different and the law of
one price does not hold perfectly for all commodities, slightly less than half the increase in imported
food inflation was passed through to domestic food
prices. As discussed above in the case of Madagascar,
government intervention is one reason for incomplete pass-through in this region.4
Table 3.1.2 also looks at changes in the domestic
relative price of food for the median African economy—that is, it adjusts for headline inflation. We
observe a broadly similar pattern, except that passthrough from international prices is now smaller.
Just as the nominal appreciation helped dampen the
effect on domestic food inflation, the real appreciation in 2008 also helped reduce the effect on the
domestic relative price of food. Note that the real
appreciation is consistent both with an improved
external environment and with recent work on
the macroeconomic adjustment to imported food
prices—which emphasizes appreciation of the CPIbased real exchange rate in countries where the share
of food in consumption is large.5
As Table 3.1.3 indicates, most of the increase in
inflation observed during this period is the result
of higher food prices. However, nonfood prices
also increased by 2.9 percentage points. To assess
whether the increase in nonfood prices reflects fuel
prices or second-round effects of higher food prices,
we estimate the direct and indirect effects of higher
fuel prices on nonfood prices. The direct effect is
given by the share of fuel in nonfood consumption expenditure—which we calibrate at 3 to 4
percent—whereas the indirect effect is given by the
share of fuel in nonfood production—which we
calibrate at 5 to 6 percent.6 Because fuel prices in the
median economy increased by 20 percent during this
period, our calibration suggests that nonfood prices
should have increased by 1.6 to 2 percentage points,
which accounts for most of the 2.9 percentage point
4Relative to 2008, the spike in commodity prices that
started in 2010 and peaked in April 2011 appears, thus far,
to have had a smaller effect on inflation.
5See Catão and Chang (2010).
6The calibration is based on the input-output tables for
Uganda and the share of fuel in production in economies
that do not produce oil.

increase observed during this period. In sum, there
appears to be little evidence of large second-round
effects from food inflation to nonfood inflation.
An analysis by exchange rate regime finds a
similar pattern but with interesting differences.
Starting from a low base in mid-2007 (1.7 percent
inflation), economies with hard pegs experienced
larger increases in inflation (10 percent), mostly on
account of food. Managed floats, on the other hand,
experienced smaller increases in inflation (6 per-

cent), but starting from a higher base (8 percent).
Note that the increase in inflation in hard pegs
occurred despite a larger nominal appreciation visà-vis the U.S. dollar (9 percent versus 3.4 percent in
managed floats), because these economies’ exchange
rates are fixed to the euro. The larger increase in
inflation therefore reflects a larger pass-through of
international prices.
What accounts for the relative stability of nonfood inflation? As Table 3.1.4 indicates, the macroeconomic environment was broadly neutral during
this period. There was a small increase in government spending. On the monetary front, there was a
small increase in the growth rate of monetary aggregates; money targets were missed in eight countries
for which there are data; and nominal interest rates
stayed constant—all of which is broadly consistent
with an accommodation of first-round effects.

Box 3.2. Food price Swings and monetary policy in open economies
This box examines the trade-offs facing monetary
policymakers in small open economies following swings in world food inflation. The discussion
focuses on emerging and developing economies
where the share of food in the consumption basket
is not only sizable in absolute terms but also is
larger than that of the country’s main trading partners. This implies that rises in global food inflation
tend to increase domestic inflation as well as appreciate the real exchange rate. As monetary policymakers formulate their response to these developments,
they need to keep in mind the important trade-offs
between stabilizing inflation, consumption, and
output.1
This box argues that these trade-offs depend on
three main factors: first, whether the country is a
net food exporter or importer; second, whether the
country is more or less financially integrated with
the rest of the world; and third, whether the country has some market power in its export markets.
The conclusion is that monetary policy trade-offs
are particularly acute for net food importers, but
much less so if they are highly integrated with world
capital markets or have some market power in their
export markets.

Food Exporters
Net food exporters, facing a rise in world food
prices, will also experience a terms-of-trade improvement. This tends to raise output and consumption.
Given the high food consumption share, consumer
price index (CPI) inflation will also rise and by
more than in trading partners, thus inducing a real
exchange rate appreciation. Therefore, the terms of
trade and the real effective exchange rate will tend
to move in the same direction (Figure 3.2.1). In this
case, the central bank can help stabilize both inflation and the output gap by tightening monetary
policy. This is because monetary policy tightening
This box was prepared by Luis Catão and is based largely
on Catão and Chang (2010).
1The analysis assumes that monetary policy can influence
real economic activity and the real exchange rate due to price
and wage rigidities. Theoretically, if prices and wages were
fully flexible, goods and factor markets integrated and fully
competitive, and capital markets frictionless, monetary policy
intervention would have no real effects.

induces nominal exchange rate appreciation, helping
stabilize both food prices in domestic currency and
domestic food output.2 If, however, there are significant real wage rigidities, wage costs may rise in tandem with (or even overreact to) food price inflation,
putting pressure on costs, and trade-offs between
output and inflation stabilization will arise.3

Food Importers
By contrast, for net food importers facing a
rise in world food prices, stabilizing the domestic
inflation rate poses a starker trade-off. Take, for
example, the case of a country that exports tourism
services and imports most of its food—the latter
being an important input for the production of its
2Such a circumstance, in which the inflation and output
stabilization objectives do not conflict with each other, has
been labeled “divine coincidence” by Blanchard and Galí
(2007).
3It has been argued, however, that such real wage rigidities
are less prevalent in emerging and developing economies than
in advanced economies.

chapter 3

Box 3.2 (continued)
services. Here, a rise in world food prices entails a
worsening of the terms of trade and pushes up costs,
thereby reducing disposable income and adversely
affecting domestic output and consumption. At
the same time, given the high food consumption
share, the world food price rise implies higher CPI
inflation. Unlike in the case of net food exporters,
the terms of trade and the real exchange rate will
tend to move in opposite directions, as illustrated
in Figure 3.2.2. Monetary tightening aimed at
stabilizing inflation will tend to appreciate the
nominal exchange rate. Although this may help
reduce domestic cost pressures, it will also tend to
further appreciate the real exchange rate, decreasing competitiveness and dampening output beyond
the deterioration in the country’s terms of trade.
Overall, in these economies, there is no divine coincidence, and policymakers must face the trade-off
between stabilizing inflation and economic activity.4
At the same time, for net food importers, the
negative effects on economic activity from monetary
policy tightening in response to food price increases
can be mitigated by three factors: the positive effect
of the ensuing currency appreciation on output by
dampening imported input costs, a “terms-of-trade
externality” effect resulting from the same nominal
appreciation, and international financial integration.
The first cost-reducing effect is straightforward.
The second is more subtle: a rise in interest rates
and the ensuing currency appreciation can improve
an economy’s terms of trade if it has strong market
power in its export markets. An example of this
would be an economy that produces a relatively
unique service, such as tourism, for which foreign
demand is relatively insensitive to the price. Here, as
a consequence of the nominal appreciation induced
by monetary policy tightening, the foreign currency
price of the economy’s exports rises, implying a
positive effect on the terms of trade (terms-of-trade
externality), which will cushion the initial fall in
output and consumption.
4These

economies also correspond to the “worst sufferer”
case modeled in Catão and Chang (2010).

The third factor is the degree of capital market
integration: the more able the economy is to borrow abroad to smooth the shock, the less the fall in
domestic consumption, and so the smaller the effect
of monetary policy tightening on consumption and,
ultimately, on domestic demand. Conversely, the
greater the international capital market imperfections facing this economy, and the smaller its market
power over what it produces and exports, the stronger
the case for some accommodation of the food price
shock. This prevents an overly tight monetary policy
from exacerbating the adverse effects of the food price
shock on the terms of trade and hence on output.5
One way to achieve this in practice is to place a
higher weight on the output gap in the monetary
policy reaction function in these types of economies.

Frankel (2011) for a discussion of alternative monetary
policy rules for small open economies with incomplete capital
markets.

Separated at Birth? the twin Budget and trade BalanceS

How do changes in taxes and government spending affect
an economy’s external balance? Based on a historical analysis of documented fiscal policy changes and on model simulations, this chapter finds that the current account responds
substantially to fiscal policy—a fiscal consolidation of 1
percent of GDP typically improves an economy’s current
account balance by over a half percent of GDP. This comes
about not only through lower imports due to a decline in
domestic demand but also from a rise in exports due to
a weakening currency. When the nominal exchange rate
is fixed or the scope for monetary stimulus is limited, the
current account adjusts by as much, but the adjustment
is more painful: economic activity contracts more and the
real exchange rate depreciates through domestic wage and
price compression. When economies tighten fiscal policies simultaneously, what matters for the current account
is how much an economy consolidates relative to others.
Looking ahead, the differing magnitudes of fiscal adjustment plans across the world will help lower imbalances
within the euro area and reduce emerging Asia’s external
surpluses. The relative lack of permanent consolidation
measures in the United States suggests that fiscal policy
will contribute little to lessening the U.S. external deficit.

Fiscal adjustment will be one of the primary
forces shaping the contours of the postcrisis global
economy. Large deficits and weak output growth in
the aftermath of the Great Recession have substantially increased public debt levels in many of the
advanced economies, highlighting their underlying debt sustainability problems. In response to
this challenge, fiscal consolidation plans in the G7
advanced economies are large—averaging close to
4 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2016—and
are quite varied, ranging from about 2½ percent
of GDP in Germany to over 7 percent of GDP in
the United Kingdom. In emerging and developing
economies, which were not as adversely affected by

the crisis and are recovering faster, governments are
planning to consolidate over the coming years in
order to rebuild fiscal room and, in some cases, to
head off overheating pressures.
Chapter 3 of the October 2010 World Economic
Outlook looked at the implications of fiscal consolidation for output and came to some sobering
conclusions. It found that fiscal consolidation typically reduces output and raises unemployment in
the short term. In addition, consolidation is likely
to be more painful if it occurs simultaneously across
many economies and if monetary policy is not in a
position to offset the negative effects on economic
activity.
This chapter continues this research agenda, this
time focusing on a different question: What implications will fiscal adjustment in various economies
have for their external balances? In economies with
twin fiscal and external deficits, such as the United
States and some economies in the euro area, policymakers may be hoping that fiscal consolidation
that addresses public debt sustainability concerns
will also help bring down large external deficits.
On the other hand, economies with large external
surpluses, such as China, Germany, and Japan, may
be concerned that fiscal consolidation will exacerbate
their surpluses.
We attempt to shed light on this issue by addressing the following questions:
• How much does public sector adjustment affect
external adjustment? This is closely related to
the famous twin deficits hypothesis—the notion
that a change in an economy’s fiscal balance leads
to a change in the same direction in its current
account balance.1
• In what ways does fiscal adjustment influence
the process of external adjustment? Is it simply a

twin deficits hypothesis was invoked to help interpret the
coincident large fiscal and current account deficits that characterized the United States during the 1980s. Henceforth, the term is
used to refer to the potential link between fiscal and external balances, even though the analysis is not limited to deficit episodes.

matter of reduced public sector demand resulting
in lower imports, or is there more to it? What
happens to exports, the real exchange rate, and
private saving and investment?
•• How does the global environment—including
characteristics that are particularly relevant at present, such as low global interest rates and synchronized fiscal adjustment across economies—shape
the link between fiscal and external adjustment?
How much will the fiscal adjustment currently
planned and under way in various economies
affect the constellation of current accounts around
the world, and within regions such as the euro
area?
A standard prediction of many textbook models is
that fiscal consolidation leads to greater national saving and thus improves the current account. A number of empirical studies, however, find only a small
effect from fiscal policy on the current account. In
the literature survey by Abbas and others (2011),
a majority of studies find that a 1 percent of GDP
fiscal consolidation improves the current account
balance by 0.1 to 0.4 percent of GDP.2
Because fiscal and current account balances move
for many reasons, the key challenge for any empirical analysis is to identify the causal effect of fiscal
policy on the current account. Two main problems
complicate this task. First, both the fiscal balance
and the current account balance respond to common
factors, such as business cycle fluctuations. Second,
governments may adjust fiscal policy in response to
economic developments that affect the external balance, raising concerns about reverse causality. To deal
with these pitfalls, one needs to isolate movements
in the fiscal balance that are not responses to current
account changes or to common factors. Then, any
relationship between such fiscal changes and the
external balance will represent the causal effect of
fiscal policy on the current account. A conventional
approach to isolating such fiscal policy changes is to
identify them using a statistical concept, such as the
change in the cyclically adjusted budget balance. As

this chapter explains, this is an imperfect measure
of actual policy actions. Furthermore, such methods
can bias the results against finding evidence of a
twin deficits link.
We use an alternative approach to address
these problems. Specifically, we examine historical documents to identify fiscal policy changes that
are explicitly not a response either to business cycle
fluctuations or to the current account. Our starting
point is the data set of action-based fiscal consolidations in advanced economies over the past 30 years,
developed for Chapter 3 of the October 2010 World
Economic Outlook, which we update to include fiscal
expansions. We then use this data set for a statistical
analysis of the short- and medium-term effects of
fiscal policy on the current account. This is complemented by simulations using the IMF’s Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) that
allow us to explore issues that rarely arose in the
past, such as the effect of the globally synchronized
fiscal consolidation in progress today.
The main findings of the chapter are the following:
•• Fiscal policy has a substantial and long-lasting
effect on external balances. A fiscal consolidation
of 1 percent of GDP results in an improvement
in the current account of over a half percent of
GDP within two years—an effect larger than
found in most other studies using conventional
approaches—and this persists into the medium
term.
•• The improvement in the current account following a fiscal consolidation comes not only through
lower import volumes resulting from a decline
in domestic demand but also from an increase in
export volumes as a result of a weaker domestic
currency.
•• The current account adjustment is just as large
when the nominal exchange rate is fixed or when
monetary policy is constrained, but it is more
painful—there is a sharper contraction in economic activity, and real exchange rate depreciation
over the medium term occurs through a compression of domestic wages and prices, a process
sometimes referred to as “internal devaluation.”
•• Fiscal consolidations synchronized across a
number of economies shrink any improvements
in the current accounts because everyone’s cur-

chapter 4

rent account cannot rise at the same time. What
matters is how much consolidation an economy
undertakes relative to other economies.
• Looking ahead, the differing magnitudes of fiscal
adjustment plans will help lower imbalances within
the euro area and reduce emerging Asia’s external
surplus. The relative lack of more permanent consolidation measures in the United States suggests
that fiscal policy as currently planned will contribute little to bringing down the U.S. external deficit.
The first section of this chapter provides an
empirical assessment of the link between fiscal and
external adjustment using a historical database of
fiscal policy changes. The second section conducts
model-based simulations to address additional issues,
such as the effect of fiscal policy when monetary
policy is constrained and the impact when many
economies simultaneously undertake fiscal consolidation. It also quantifies the contributions of planned
fiscal adjustments in various economies to current
account adjustment around the world. The last section draws some policy implications.

estimating the Strength of the twin Deficits
Link
This section estimates the effect of fiscal policy on
the current account. We start by explaining how we
identify changes in fiscal policy from the historical
record and how this approach differs from conventional approaches. We then report the estimated
effects on the current account and compare the
results with those based on a more conventional
approach. Finally, we explore the channels through
which fiscal adjustment affects external balances.

Identifying Fiscal policy changes
At the heart of virtually all empirical studies that
estimate the effect of fiscal policy on the current
account balance lies a key challenge: identifying
deliberate fiscal policy changes. Fluctuations in
economic activity would improve the budget balance
without any change in policy and would also affect
the current account. Therefore, using the change in
the overall fiscal balance to measure changes in fiscal policy, as some studies do, would lead to biased

Separated at Birth? the twin Budget and trade BalanceS

estimates of the effect of fiscal policy on the current
account.3
A common approach to this challenge is to use
the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB)
as a measure of the fiscal stance.4 Cyclical adjustment offers an intuitive way of dealing with the fact
that tax revenue and government spending move
automatically with the business cycle. The hope is
that cyclically adjusted changes in fiscal variables
reflect policymakers’ decisions to change taxes and
spending. However, as discussed in Chapter 3 of the
October 2010 World Economic Outlook, the conventional approach of using cyclically adjusted fiscal
data is far from perfect. Three issues with cyclical
adjustment arise that complicate tests of the twin
deficits hypothesis:
• Even after cyclical adjustment, the CAPB typically includes nonpolicy factors, which may be
correlated with other developments affecting
economic activity and the current account.5 For
example, an asset price boom improves the CAPB
by increasing capital gains and cyclically adjusted
tax revenues. Such was the case in Ireland before
the recent crisis. Because these booms raise
domestic demand and imports, worsening the
current account balance, they tend to generate a
negative correlation between the CAPB and the
current account, biasing the estimated effect of
fiscal policy downward. Other nonpolicy factors
can move the CAPB and current account balance
in the same direction. For example, a positive
terms-of-trade shock could raise cyclically adjusted
revenues while improving the current account balance, leading to an upward bias.
• Even if the CAPB contained only discretionary
fiscal policy changes, some of these could still be
responses to cyclical developments. To the extent
3Of

the 21 studies surveyed in Abbas and others (2011), 13 use
the overall fiscal balance as the explanatory variable.
4The CAPB is calculated by taking the actual primary balance––noninterest revenue minus noninterest spending––and
subtracting the estimated effect of business cycle fluctuations on
the fiscal accounts.
5For a discussion of how cyclically adjusted fiscal data contain
nonpolicy factors correlated with economic activity, see, for
example, Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori (2011); Romer and
Romer (2010); Milesi-Ferretti (2009); Morris and Schuknecht
(2007); and Wolswijk (2007).

that domestic booms in economic activity tend
to coincide with a worsening current account
balance, countercyclical fiscal policies would be
associated with a falling current account balance, biasing the estimated effect downward. An
example is Denmark in 1986, where the government cut spending and raised taxes to reduce the
risk of the economy overheating.
• The CAPB may contain fiscal policy changes
that respond directly to external developments.
In an economy with rapid import growth and
a rising current account deficit, the government
might raise taxes or cut government spending
in order to restrain domestic demand and help
unwind the current account imbalance. Such a
discretionary fiscal policy response to developments affecting the current account would be a
case of reverse causality and would again tend to
generate a negative correlation between the CAPB
and the current account, biasing the estimated
effect downward. France in 1983 provides such an
example, where fiscal policy tightening was motivated by a desire to reduce the current account
deficit.
Other approaches also have been used to reduce
the endogeneity of the fiscal measure. For example,
some studies focus exclusively on government spending to avoid the strong influence of the economic
cycle on government revenues. However, to the
extent that at least some discretionary changes
in government purchases may be motivated by a
response to the business cycle, the problem persists.6

the historical approach to Identifying Fiscal policy
changes
To address the hazards highlighted above, this
chapter uses an alternative approach based on
identifying changes in fiscal policy directly from the
historical record. This historical approach is similar
to that of Romer and Romer (2010) but has been
6Furthermore, taking this approach means neglecting the
impact of policy changes on the revenue side, which is also of
interest to policymakers. Moreover, changes in government spending are often accompanied by changes in taxes and thus cannot
be used in isolation to estimate the impact on the current account
balance.

138

expanded to include multiple economies and to go
beyond the tax changes they examine. The starting
point is the data set of action-based fiscal consolidations compiled for the October 2010 World Economic Outlook and subsequently revised in Devries
and others (2011). Based on an analysis of contemporaneous historical records, this data set identifies
fiscal consolidations that were not motivated by
cyclical or external considerations. The documents
used to produce the data set include IMF Staff
Reports and Recent Economic Developments, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
Economic Surveys, central bank reports, and budget
documents, among others. Because there is no
reason to expect the link between fiscal and external
balances to be limited to consolidations, we have
enlarged the data set to include fiscal expansions as
well.
Based on this approach, we identify tax and
spending changes motivated either by a desire to
reduce the budget deficit or by some other noncyclical objective, such as higher potential output
growth, increased social fairness, limiting the size
of government, or external military actions. These
types of policy changes are less likely to be systematically correlated with other developments affecting
the current account in the short term and are thus
valid for estimating the effects of fiscal policy on
the current account. Austria in 1996 provides an
example of a fiscal policy tightening motivated by
budget deficit reduction. Specifically, the authorities
cut government spending and raised taxes to meet
the budget deficit criteria for European Monetary Union (EMU) accession, based on the 1992
Maastricht Treaty, and not because there was a risk
of economic overheating or a desire to improve the
current account balance.7 Canada in 1998 provides
an example of fiscal policy easing motivated by longterm considerations rather than cyclical concerns. In
particular, tax cuts were part of comprehensive tax
reform designed to reduce marginal income tax rates
to improve long-term growth, and the additional

the 1997 IMF Staff Report explains (p. 4), “With firstround participation in EMU the top economic priority since EU
membership in 1995, the federal government agreed with the
social partners and the lower levels of government on a phased
two-year consolidation package to reduce the structural deficit.”

government spending was motivated primarily by a
desire to enhance education and health care.
Although the historical approach addresses the
aforementioned problems associated with the conventional approach, both the conventional approach
and our approach remain subject to some additional
criticisms. In particular, if policymakers postpone
fiscal consolidation until the economy recovers, then
fiscal consolidations will be associated with favorable
economic developments using both the conventional
approach and our approach. On the other hand,
if fiscal consolidation accelerates in downturns to
stay on a desired deficit-reduction track, then the
identified fiscal consolidations will be associated
with unfavorable economic outcomes using both the
conventional approach and our approach. Thus, the
overall direction of these potential biases is unclear.
Furthermore, to the extent that cyclical motivations behind the timing of policy are reflected in
the record, the historical approach will identify and
exclude them, minimizing any bias.8
For the 17 economies covered over the 1978–
2009 period (a total of 544 country-year observations), we identify 291 fiscal policy changes that
were not motivated by cyclical or external considerations.9 Almost two-thirds of the actions are fiscal
consolidations. Figure 4.1 shows the incidence of
our action-based fiscal consolidations and expansions
by year across the economies in the sample. The
average fiscal policy change is a fiscal consolidation
of 0.4 percent of GDP, and the range of actions runs
from a fiscal consolidation of 4.7 percent of GDP to
a fiscal expansion of 3.5 percent of GDP.

8Both conventional approaches and our historical approach
record changes in fiscal policy when they are implemented
rather than when they are announced, which ignores the role of
anticipation effects highlighted by Ramey (2011). However, as
Beetsma, Giuliodori and Klaassen (2008) point out, the role of
anticipation effects is likely to be smaller at the annual frequency
used here than at the quarterly frequency used by Ramey (2011)
and Romer and Romer (2010).

estimated effects of Fiscal policy on the current
account
With these action-based fiscal policy changes in
hand, we use straightforward statistical techniques
to estimate the effect of fiscal policy on the current
account. The methodology is similar to that of Cerra
and Saxena (2008) and Romer and Romer (2010),
among others. Specifically, we regress changes in the
current-account-to-GDP ratio on its lagged values
(to capture the normal dynamics of the current
account) as well as on contemporaneous and lagged
values of our action-based fiscal policy measure, also
measured relative to GDP.10 Including lags allows for
fiscal policy changes to work on the current account
with a delay. The specification also includes a full set
of time fixed effects to account for common shocks,
such as shifts in oil prices, and economy-specific
fixed effects to account for differences in economies’
normal external positions.
Because we want to estimate the overall effect of
fiscal policy changes on the current account, we do
not include possible transmission channels for fiscal
policy, such as the exchange rate or the monetary
policy rate, as additional explanatory variables in the
model. As a general rule, we rely on the exogeneity
of the fiscal policy changes identified through the
historical approach to deliver unbiased estimates
of the causal effect of fiscal policy. This exogeneity
allows us to have a minimal specification.11
The regression results suggest that fiscal policy
changes have effects on the current account that are
both large and long-lasting. Figure 4.2 shows that a
1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises the current-account-to-GDP ratio by 0.6 percentage point
within two years. After five years, the increase in the
current account balance remains over a half percent

of GDP.12 The finding of a large and long-lasting
twin deficits link also survives a variety of robustness tests, including different estimation approaches,
alternative specifications, dropping outliers, and
distinguishing between types of fiscal policy changes,
as reported in Appendix 4.2.
By contrast, using the conventional CAPB-based
approach suggests that fiscal consolidation has a
much smaller effect.13 In this case, a fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP raises the current-accountto-GDP ratio by only 0.1 percentage point within
two years, with the effect fading over time. This
result is broadly consistent with estimates in the
literature for advanced economies, suggesting that
the bias associated with the conventional approach
may be substantial.

channels for external adjustment
Having established a strong link between fiscal
and external current account balances, this section looks at the ways in which fiscal policy affects
the current account. Is it simply a matter of fiscal consolidation reducing domestic demand and
imports, or is there more to it? We start by reviewing
the effect of fiscal policy on economic activity, thus
updating the results presented in Chapter 3 of the
October 2010 World Economic Outlook using our
expanded data set. We then look at the responses
of saving and investment, imports and exports, and
exchange rates and interest rates. To explore these
channels, we use the same statistical model used for
the current account, but with these other variables
of interest as the dependent variable. We also repeat
the analysis for some of the variables using the more
conventional CAPB-based approach to shed light on
why the estimated effect on the current account is
larger using our approach.

10See

Appendix 4.1 for a description of the data sources and
construction, and Appendix 4.2 for further details on the estimation methodology and additional robustness tests.
11The estimated responses are cumulated to recover the
response of the level of the current-account-to-GDP ratio to a
permanent 1 percent of GDP fiscal policy change. The figures
that follow illustrate the effects of a fiscal consolidation; the effects
of a fiscal expansion would be the reverse. In a robustness check
in Appendix 4.2, we show that fiscal consolidations and expansions have roughly symmetric effects on the current account. We
cannot reject that their magnitudes are identical.

140

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

12The magnitude of this effect is close to that found by Kumhof and Laxton (2009) in simulations using a calibrated nonRicardian open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model featuring finitely lived households.

(2010). We are grateful to the authors for sharing their data.

Economic activity
Fiscal consolidation typically has a contractionary effect on economic activity (Figure 4.3, blue
lines).14 In particular, a fiscal consolidation equal to
1 percent of GDP reduces real output by 0.6 percent
of GDP within two years, with a partial recovery
over the next few years. Domestic demand contracts by more than 1 percent within two years; this
contraction in domestic demand is likely to improve
the current account balance through lower import
demand and domestic investment.
By contrast, using the conventional CAPB-based
approach suggests that fiscal consolidation is typically painless, with output and domestic demand
expanding in the short term (Figure 4.3, red lines).
In particular, a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises output by 0.3 percent within two years,
while domestic demand expands by 0.5 percent.
However, this result likely reflects the endogenous
nature of the CAPB-based measure of the fiscal
policy stance, as discussed above.15 For example, a
boom in the stock market improves the CAPB by
increasing capital gains and cyclically adjusted tax
revenues. Such developments are also likely to be
reflected in higher consumption and investment.
It is therefore not surprising that the conventional
approach finds little evidence of contractionary
effects on economic activity.

Figure 4.2. Effects on the Current Account of a 1 Percent
of GDP Fiscal Consolidation
(Percent of GDP)

When fiscal policy changes are identified directly from historical records, the
estimated effect on the current account is large and long-lasting. By contrast,
estimates obtained using a conventional approach suggest fiscal policy has little
effect on the current account.

Saving and investment
Fiscal consolidation improves the current account
balance by both lowering investment and raising

saving by 0.35 percent of GDP within three years.
Meanwhile, the investment-to-GDP ratio drops by
0.3 percentage point within two years, with a slight
rebound thereafter.

reverse of the response to a consolidation.

the overall fiscal balance is used instead. The effect of a fiscal expansion would be the
reverse of the response to a consolidation.

As seen in the bottom panel of Figure 4.4, under
the CAPB-based approach, investment actually
increases in the short term, largely offsetting the
increase in national saving associated with fiscal
consolidation. Specifically, a 1 percent of GDP
fiscal consolidation based on the CAPB is associated with a rise in the investment-to-GDP ratio
of 0.3 percentage point within three years. In the
short term, the increase in investment is smaller
than the rise in national saving, which climbs by
0.4 percentage point within two years—explaining the small improvement in the current account
balance. However, this surge in investment likely
reflects the endogenous nature of the CAPB-based
measure of the fiscal policy stance, as discussed
above. It is therefore not surprising that the CAPBbased approach finds little evidence of a twin deficits
link.16
The stark difference between the estimated effects
on investment across the action-based versus the
CAPB-based fiscal changes highlights the importance
of the fiscal policy identification choice. Henceforth,
we focus only on the results using the action-based
approach to fiscal policy identification.
Separating the public and private components of
saving and investment, we find that public saving
rises by 0.6 percent of GDP, whereas public investment declines by about 0.2 percent of GDP (Figure
4.5, top panel). Thus, fiscal policy changes enacted
to deliver 1 percent of GDP in fiscal consolidation
improve the overall balance by about 0.8 percent of
GDP. The improvement in the fiscal balance is not
one-for-one for a number of reasons. First, the fiscal
consolidation has a detrimental effect on economic
activity, with automatic stabilizers offsetting at least
part of the budgetary savings. Second, discretionary
countercyclical stimulus is sometimes implemented,
again offsetting part of the potential gains.17
16The large difference between the responses to the action-based
and CAPB-based fiscal changes also applies to the response of the
real exchange rate, which appreciates in response to a CAPB-based
fiscal consolidation but depreciates in response to an action-based
fiscal consolidation, as discussed below.
17An example is Germany in 1982, where the government
embarked on consolidation, but economic developments over the
course of the year led to the introduction of some countercyclical
expansionary measures, reducing the saving achieved from the
consolidation package.

chapter 4

The response of private saving and investment to
fiscal policy changes is relatively muted. There is a small
decline in private saving (Figure 4.5, bottom panel)
that only partially offsets the rise in public saving. As
a result, national saving rises significantly.18 Turning to
investment, private investment falls in the short term,
possibly in response to the weaker economic activity
that results from fiscal consolidation. However, this
decline in private investment is temporary. By the second year after consolidation, the private-investment-toGDP ratio rebounds to its level prior to consolidation.
Thus, it is the improvement in the public saving-investment gap that drives the improvement in the current
account.

Figure 4.4. Effects on Saving and Investment of a
1 Percent of GDP Fiscal Consolidation
(Percent of GDP)

The current account adjustment in response to fiscal consolidation occurs
through both an increase in saving and a fall in investment. Conventional
approaches to measuring fiscal policy changes find a rise in investment following
a consolidation, which offsets the rise in saving and reduces the effect on the
current account.
Saving

Exports, imports, and relative prices
Although the current account improves in
response to fiscal consolidation, it might not be
viewed favorably if it is simply due to a decline in
imports coming from the domestic demand contraction. To see whether this is the case, we examine
the behavior of exports and imports of goods and
services in response to changes in fiscal policy. As it
turns out, the improvement in the current account
comes about through both higher exports and lower
imports. In response to a fiscal consolidation of
1 percent of GDP, export volumes rise by just under
1 percent in the short term, while import volumes
fall just over 1 percent (Figure 4.6).19 Over the
medium term, the effect on exports attenuates until
it is about a half percent, while that on imports
remains above 1 percent.
What is behind this rise in exports and fall in
imports? As Figure 4.7 illustrates, an important
factor is a shift in the real exchange rate (topleft panel). The real exchange rate depreciates by
1 percent within one year and remains depreciated
over the next few years. In the short term, the real
depreciation is driven entirely by nominal depreciation (top-right panel). Over the medium term, the
real value of the currency stays low because domestic

provides evidence against Ricardian equivalence, which
posits that an increase in government saving is fully offset by a fall
in private saving in response to lower anticipated future taxes.
19When expressed in percent of GDP, the improvement in the
current account is driven primarily by the rise in exports.

relative prices decline (middle-left panel).20 This is
evident in the decline of the domestic price vis-à-vis
trading partners and especially in the decline of unit
labor costs (middle-right panel). This shift in relative
prices likely supports the rise in export volumes following a fiscal consolidation. Interestingly, the estimated responses of exports and imports are broadly
consistent with those implied by the estimated shift
in the real exchange rate and standard trade elasticities.21 One factor that might contribute to a weaker
currency is the fall in interest rates (bottom panels).
Both the short-term policy rate and the long-term
rate (measured here by 10-year government bond
yields) decline by about 10 basis points. This is similar to the interest rate responses seen in a standard
dynamic general equilibrium model (Clinton and
others, 2010).

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

What happens When Monetary policy and exchange
rates are constrained?
The evidence presented above suggests that a key
mechanism underlying the twin deficits link is a
real depreciation of the exchange rate. Usually, this
occurs mainly through a fall in the nominal value
of the currency. But how does the current account
respond to fiscal policy changes if the nominal
exchange rate cannot respond and monetary policy
is constrained? Is the result a smaller current account
response?
To shed light on how the twin deficits link changes
when the nominal exchange rate and monetary policy
are constrained, we compare the behavior of the current account under pegged and nonpegged exchange
rate regimes.22 For pegged exchange rate regimes,
20The relative price is defined as the ratio between the consumer price index (CPI)-based real effective exchange rate and the
nominal effective exchange rate. It captures the difference between
domestic prices and trade-weighted average prices in trading
partners.
21For example, Bayoumi and Faruqee (1998, p. 32) report
that, within two years, a 1 percent real depreciation should raise
exports by 0.7 percent and reduce imports by 0.9 percent, all else
equal. In our sample, the estimated impact of fiscal consolidation
is a real depreciation of 1 percent. The conventional elasticities
would thus imply an impact on exports and imports of 0.7 percent and –0.9 percent, respectively, close to our estimated effects.
22See Appendix 4.1 for a description of the exchange rate
regime indicator.

chapter 4

without exiting the peg, neither changes in monetary
policy in response to economy-specific developments
nor nominal exchange rate depreciation is possible. The
results suggest that the effect of fiscal consolidation on
the current account remains large even for economies
with pegged exchange rate regimes (Figure 4.8, top
panel). The estimated effect of a 1 percent of GDP
fiscal consolidation on the current account within two
years is a half percent of GDP for the pegged exchange
rate sample, which levels off to slightly less than a half
percent of GDP in subsequent years.
If monetary policy is constrained and the nominal
exchange rate cannot adjust, how is the external adjustment accomplished? The remaining panels in Figure
4.8 show that in the pegged exchange rate subsample,
fiscal consolidation results in a more pronounced and
persistent compression of domestic prices. This leads to
a depreciation of the real exchange rate, even without
any nominal depreciation. Such cost compression,
sometimes referred to as “internal devaluation,” is also
visible in the larger decline in unit labor costs. The
compression of domestic prices vis-à-vis trading partners helps support the current account improvement
over the medium term.

Insights from Model-Based Simulations
The previous section analyzed historical episodes
of fiscal consolidation to assess the effects of fiscal
policy on external balances. However, historical
analysis can draw only on patterns that have been
seen before; it cannot fully address issues that are
relevant today but that rarely arose in the past, such
as the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
Therefore, to complement the empirical analysis, this
section examines the twin deficits link in the controlled “laboratory” setting of the Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF), a dynamic
general equilibrium model designed to simulate the
effects of fiscal and monetary policy changes.23

effect of fiscal policy on the current account that are in line with
those reported in the previous section of this chapter.

In particular, we explore the following questions:
• How do the effects of fiscal consolidation change
when nominal interest rates are near zero and can
fall no further?
• How do the effects change when many economies
simultaneously undertake fiscal consolidations of
comparable magnitudes?
• How much will the varied fiscal adjustments being
undertaken and planned in various economies
affect the constellation of current accounts around
the world and within regions such as the euro area?

external adjustment When Monetary policy Is
constrained
Since the onset of the Great Recession, short-term
interest rates in the largest advanced economies have
been near zero. Yet, of the historical episodes considered above, only those of Japan since the 1990s
occurred in an environment of near-zero interest rates.
In the other episodes, interest rate cuts were possible
and typically followed fiscal consolidation.
Therefore, to illustrate the effects of fiscal consolidation on external balances when interest rates
are near zero and can fall no further, we use model
simulations. In particular, we examine what happens
when a small open economy, which we calibrate to
fit the main features of Canada, implements fiscal
consolidation with and without constrained monetary policy. The consolidation considered here is a
reduction in the deficit equivalent to 1 percent of
GDP, composed entirely of spending cuts.24
The results suggest the following:
• When the interest rate is free to move, the
improvement of the current account in response
to consolidation is about a half percent of GDP
after two years (Figure 4.9, top panel, blue line).25
This response is similar to the estimates from the
empirical analysis in the previous section. Furthermore, the mechanisms at work in the model are
24Specifically,

three-quarters of the spending cuts fall on
government consumption, with the rest falling on government
investment. As seen in Appendix 4.3, the effects on the current
account are similar when the adjustment is implemented using
different fiscal instruments.
25In the model, when monetary policy is unconstrained, it follows a Taylor rule to set interest rates.

chapter 4

consistent with what was shown in the preceding
section. Fiscal consolidation reduces economic
activity, which improves the current account
through lower imports. Monetary policy easing
in response to this negative demand shock spurs
depreciation of the exchange rate. This boosts
exports, further improving the current account.
• When interest rates cannot move, the response of
the current account to a fiscal consolidation is still
of the same magnitude, just slightly higher than
a half percent of GDP (Figure 4.9, top panel, red
line). Here, the simulation assumes that interest
rates are fixed for two years.26 The inability of the
central bank during this period to offset the slump
induced by the cut in government spending results
in a sharper fall in aggregate demand and inflation
than when monetary policy is unconstrained. The
resulting fall in economic activity and domestic relative prices results in an “internal devaluation” that
boosts net exports and the current account.27 Thus,
the model simulation corroborates the finding of the
empirical analysis that external balances adjust just as
much even when monetary policy is constrained.

Figure 4.8. Effects of a 1 Percent of GDP Fiscal
Consolidation under Pegged and Nonpegged Exchange
Rate Regimes
Under a pegged exchange rate, the current account adjustment is just as large, but it
is accompanied by a greater reduction of relative prices and unit labor costs.

How do the effects of fiscal consolidation on
the current account change when many economies
consolidate at the same time? This question is relevant today, because many economies have set fiscal
consolidation in motion.
To address this issue, the simulations compare a
situation in which only Canada cuts its fiscal deficit

0

the option of cutting interest rates is removed for a
long time—in the GIMF, three or more years––the model generates unstable macroeconomic dynamics, which complicates the
computation of simulation results. For simplicity, the analysis
ignores the possibility of the central bank responding to the
consolidation by using unconventional monetary tools, such as
quantitative or qualitative easing. To the extent that such policies
would be used to support output in response to the consolidation,
the simulations reported here may overstate the impact of the zero
interest rate lower bound.
27Similarly, as additional simulations suggest, when the nominal exchange rate is fixed and the response of monetary policy to
domestic developments is thus constrained, aggregate demand and
domestic relative prices fall more than when the exchange rate is
flexible. However, the current account adjustment is of the same
size.

with one in which the entire world does so simultaneously (global fiscal consolidation) by the same
amount. We again use Canada to illustrate the case of
an economy small enough to have only minimal spillover effects on the rest of the world but open enough
that fiscal contraction in the rest of the world has
significant effects on its external balance and output.28
As before, the adjustment involves reducing the
deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1 percentage point across all
economies, with the adjustment composed entirely
of spending cuts. Three-quarters of the spending cuts
fall on government consumption, and the rest falls
on government investment. We assume that monetary policy cannot respond in both Canada and
the rest of the world for two years, to more closely
resemble current conditions in which interest rates
in many advanced economies are near the zero lower
bound.29
In stark contrast to the situation where only Canada consolidates, a synchronized global consolidation
equal in size does not improve Canada’s external
balance (Figure 4.10, top panel, red line). Canada’s
exports decline as global demand falls because of
the synchronized fiscal consolidation, and unlike
in the case of unilateral consolidation, there is no
boost from the exchange rate.30 This finding of no
improvement in the external balance should not be
surprising. Because the sum of all current accounts
in the world must be zero according to the balanceof-payments identity, it is impossible for all economies’ current account balances to improve at the
same time. Fiscal consolidation does not automatically result in an improved current account—what
matters is how much consolidation an economy
undertakes relative to other economies.
28In 2009, Canada’s GDP was 1.9 percent of global GDP on
a purchasing-power-parity basis, and the sum of its exports and
imports represented 71 percent of domestic GDP.
29Eighty percent of Canada’s trade is with the United States
and Europe, and so the assumption of constrained monetary
policy for the rest of the world is more reasonable than allowing
interest rates to move freely.
30Canada’s real exchange rate appreciates because there are
fewer liquidity-constrained households in Canada compared with
the rest of the world. Liquidity-constrained households cannot
borrow, and so fiscal consolidation results in a larger fall in
consumption and domestic prices—and hence a real depreciation—in the rest of the world or, equivalently, a real appreciation
in Canada.

chapter 4

current Fiscal adjustment plans and their
Implications for external Balances
The fiscal adjustments currently planned by various economies over the coming years are, of course,
not uniform in size or timing. The United Kingdom
has embarked on an ambitious fiscal consolidation
path, with policies aimed at improving the structural
primary balance by more than 7 percent of GDP over
the next six years. By contrast, some emerging and
developing economies envision much smaller or even
negative changes in their structural primary balance
over the same period, as exit from stimulus is offset by
increased fiscal spending on infrastructure investment
or on strengthening social safety nets. What are the
implications of these fiscal adjustments for the global
constellation of current accounts?
To examine this question, we utilize a six-region
version of the GIMF. The six regions are the United
States, Japan, Germany, the euro area excluding
Germany, emerging Asia, and the rest of the world.31
Across these regions, the size of the planned fiscal
adjustment between 2010 and 2016 ranges from
a high of 4.6 percent of GDP in the United States
to a low of 1.6 percent of GDP in emerging Asia
(Figure 4.11, top-left panel). One important difference across the regions, however, is how much of
the improvement in the structural primary balance
in the coming years is the result of new permanent consolidation measures and how much is due
to the expiration of temporary stimulus measures
implemented in the wake of the crisis. For example,
almost two-thirds of the projected improvement in
the U.S. fiscal position is from letting temporary
stimulus measures expire; about 1.7 percent of GDP
of the improvement is due to new, permanent fiscal consolidation measures.32 In contrast, most of
31The

emerging Asia region includes China, Hong Kong SAR,
India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Thailand. The rest of the world region includes both advanced economies, such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and
emerging and developing economies, excluding emerging Asia.
32Fiscal consolidation plans for the United States are based on
the president’s budget proposal of February 2011. The budget
plan passed August 2 outlines measures that generate a deficit
reduction of roughly the same order of magnitude. But because
the second stage of the plan still needs to be decided by a bipartisan commission in Congress, there is much uncertainty regarding
the exact size and timing of the new plan.

Figure 4.10. Effects of a Synchronized Global 1 Percent
of GDP Fiscal Consolidation: GIMF Simulations
If all economies engage in synchronized fiscal consolidations of the same size, then
there is little effect on the current account, and the short-term output contraction is
larger. This is because it is not possible to have simultaneous real depreciation and
current account improvement in all economies.

Note: The current account impacts are model simulations from the IMF’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal Model, using the planned fiscal adjustment for each region, which show
the long-term effect of the planned fiscal adjustment on the current account relative to 2010.
When the long-term effects are weighted by their region’s share of world GDP, they sum to
zero, as required by the global balance-of-payments identity. The shares of each region in
world GDP are Germany (6%); emerging Asia (13%); euro area (16%); Japan (8%); rest of
the World (32%); United States (25%). The stylized compositions of the fiscal instruments
used within each region are United States (30% government consumption, 40% labor taxes,
20% targeted transfers, 10% general transfers); euro area (40% government consumption,
30% labor taxes, 20% targeted transfers, 10% general transfers); all other regions (35%
government consumption, 35% labor taxes, 20% targeted transfers, 10% general transfers).

the improvement in the fiscal position of the euro
area excluding Germany is due to permanent fiscal
measures. It is these more permanent fiscal policy
measures that have a substantial long-term effect on
external balances (Clinton and others, 2010).33
We perform two experiments—unilateral consolidation and global consolidation.34 First, we determine the long-term effect of fiscal adjustment on
current accounts if each region undertakes its fiscal
adjustment from now until 2016 as planned, but
other regions do not.35 As shown by the light blue
bars in the top-right panel of Figure 4.11, unilateral
consolidation by any region would improve its external balance as compared with its 2010 level, in line
with the analysis above. The relative magnitudes of
the improvement in the current account are roughly
proportional to the height of the red bars—representing the size of permanent fiscal measures—in
the top-left panel. This is because, as stated above,
the permanent measures have a long-term effect on
the external balance, whereas exit from temporary
stimulus has a much smaller, short-term effect on
the current account.
If all economies consolidate simultaneously, the
relative amount of permanent fiscal measures determines how a region’s current account responds. As
shown by the yellow bars in the top-right panel of
Figure 4.11, the relatively large scale of permanent
fiscal consolidation being undertaken by the euro
33The reason for this is that permanent fiscal consolidation
significantly reduces the stock of domestic public debt over time.
A temporary stimulus, however, has little impact on the stock of
domestic public debt, and thus only a very small effect on portfolio rebalancing and on the current account.
34Note that these simulations are not a prediction of where
current accounts are headed in the coming years—they focus
only on the impact of fiscal adjustment on the current account.
Many other factors that affect the behavior of private saving and
investment over the coming years—including growth differentials,
inflation and interest rate developments, structural reforms, and
so on—will also affect the current account. As a result, the projected change in the current account will differ from what these
simulations suggest.
35More specifically, six simulations are run (one for each
region) in which the region of interest undertakes its planned permanent fiscal measures and exit from stimulus (the red and blue
bars in the top-left panel of Figure 4.11), while none of the other
regions undertake any fiscal measures. All fiscal plans are assumed
to be expected and fully credible.

chapter 4

area excluding Germany would improve that region’s
current account by about 0.7 percent of GDP; the
smaller scale of fiscal adjustment by Germany would
reduce its current account surplus by 1.4 percent of
GDP. Thus, the varying size of planned fiscal adjustments contributes to a lowering of external imbalances within the euro area as a whole. In emerging
Asia, not only is the improvement in the structural
balance smaller than in other regions, but much of it
results from letting stimulus measures expire. Consequently, planned fiscal adjustment would contribute
to reducing that region’s large external surplus. Finally,
because the bulk of the large fiscal adjustment in the
United States is due to the expiration of temporary
fiscal stimulus and not because of new, permanent
fiscal measures, the planned fiscal adjustment around
the world is not likely to help narrow the U.S. current
account deficit. In fact, it may widen.

Summary and Implications for the Outlook
We conclude this chapter with a brief summary of
the results and a discussion of possible policy implications. First, as policymakers formulate their fiscal
plans to achieve various goals—which at present are
focused on securing fiscal sustainability, rebuilding
fiscal room, or containing overheating pressures—the
fact that fiscal adjustments have large effects on external balances is something they will need to keep in
mind. For some economies, such as the United States
and some euro area economies, the results suggest
that fiscal consolidation of the right magnitude can
help reduce twin fiscal and external deficits. For other
economies, such as Germany, Japan, and China, there
could be a trade-off between budget deficit reduction
and a desire to reduce external surpluses.
Second, external adjustment is not driven solely
by the fall in domestic demand from fiscal consolidation. The contractionary effect of fiscal consolidation

Separated at Birth? the twin Budget and trade BalanceS

is now well established, with consequent effects on
import demand, and this is something policymakers
cannot ignore—fiscal consolidation hurts. But the
current account also improves because exports get a
boost from the real exchange rate depreciation that
tends to accompany fiscal consolidation.
Third, the painful aspects of external adjustment
are amplified if an economy’s monetary policy or
exchange rate is constrained. When policy rates
cannot decline—because they are already at or close
to zero or because they are outside the domestic
monetary authority’s realm of control—policymakers
should expect a long and rough road ahead. In such
cases, external adjustment still occurs, but it takes
place through a sharper contraction in economic
activity because monetary policy cannot soften the
blow. This results in a greater decline in imports.
The real exchange rate still depreciates, but it occurs
through greater compression of domestic wages and
prices. This is the kind of adjustment awaiting some
of the euro area economies.
When many economies consolidate at the same
time, what matters for the current account is how
much consolidation an economy undertakes relative
to others. Taking current fiscal plans as an example,
some economies—including the United Kingdom,
some members of the euro area, and other advanced
economies such as Canada and Australia—are
expected to have much larger fiscal adjustments
based on permanent measures. As a result, fiscal
adjustment in these economies is expected to contribute positively to their external balances. Germany
and emerging Asia are also consolidating, but by a
lesser amount. This should contribute to a lowering
of their external surpluses. However, the relatively
small size of permanent fiscal measures currently
envisioned for the United States suggests that fiscal
consolidation there will do little to reduce the U.S.
external deficit.

appendix 4.1. Data construction and Sources
The data sources used in the analysis are listed in
Table 4.1. We draw primarily on the databases of the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
Economic Outlook (OECD-EO).
The current account, exports, imports, public saving,
investment, and public investment are all taken relative to GDP for the analysis, using the corresponding
source database’s measure of GDP. For example, this
means that the current-account-to-GDP ratio is calculated by taking the ratio of the WEO current account
measure (which is in U.S. dollars) to the WEO GDP
measure in U.S. dollars. In the case of variables from
the OECD-EO, such as public saving, we divide by the
appropriate OECD-EO GDP measure. Real variables

(export volumes, import volumes, real GDP) are taken
as natural logarithms. Price, cost, and exchange rate
indices are also taken as natural logarithms. Interest
rates are in percentage points.
To ensure that the national accounting identity
holds, we calculate overall national saving, private
saving, and private investment, all relative to GDP,
as residuals using the following identities:
CA = S – I
S = SPUB + SPRIV
I = IPUB + IPRIV ,

(4.1)

where CA denotes current account to GDP, S
denotes saving to GDP, and I denotes investment to
GDP. Both saving and investment are then broken
down into their public and private components. We

the difference between overall saving and public saving, and private investment as the difference between
investment and public investment.
There are some gaps in the OECD-EO data for
some of the economies in the 1970s and 1980s. To
address this, we splice the relevant series relative to
GDP with the corresponding series relative to GDP,
taken from an earlier vintage of the OECD-EO
data.36 This affects only two economies: Germany
and Ireland. For Germany, we splice it with data
from the former Federal Republic of Germany during
1978–90, taken from the former economies section of
OECD-EO number 89. For Ireland, we splice it with
data from 1978–89, taken from OECD-EO number
60 (December 1996, Public Version).
The short-term policy rate series for the
economies in the sample come from Datastream:
AUPRATE (Australia), OEPRATE (Austria),
BGPRATE (Belgium), CNPRATE (Canada),
DKPRATE (Denmark), FNPRATE (Finland),
FRPRATE (France), BDPRATE (Germany),
IRPRATE (Ireland), ITPRATE (Italy), JPPRATE
(Japan), NLPRATE (Netherlands), PTPRATE
(Portugal), ESPRATE (Spain), SDPRATE (Sweden),
UKPRATE (United Kingdom), and USPRATE
(United States).
The long-term government bond yield series are
from Datastream and Haver Analytics. These are the
Datastream series: CNGBOND (Canada), JPGBOND (Japan), and NLGBOND (Netherlands).
These are the Haver Analytics series: N193G10E@
G10 (Australia), C122IB@IFS (Austria), C124IB@
IFS (Belgium), N172RG10@G10 (Finland),
C132IB@IFS (France), N134RG10@G10 (Germany), C178IB@IFS (Ireland), C136IB@IFS (Italy),
C182IB@IFS (Portugal), N184RG10@G10 (Spain),
C144IB@IFS (Sweden), N112RG10@G10 (United
Kingdom), and N111RG10@G10 (United States).
For Denmark, we splice two series from Haver Analytics to achieve greater time coverage (N128G10E@
G10 and C128IB@IFS). For their period of overlap,
the two series are very similar.
36We do this only after confirming that there is no break introduced into the series by this procedure.

Separated at Birth? the twin Budget and trade BalanceS

The nominal and real effective exchange rate series
are from the IMF Information Notice System (IMFINS) database, which starts in the early 1980s. We
extend these series back to 1978 for each economy,
applying the methodology used to construct the
IMF-INS effective exchange rates (see Lee and others, 2008, for full details).
The exchange rate regime indicator is constructed
from the database in Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff
(2008), which is an update of Reinhart and Rogoff (2004). We use their coarse classification at the
annual frequency to construct a binary exchange rate
regime indicator, distinguishing between pegged and
nonpegged regimes. The pegged regime corresponds
to their classification of “peg”; the nonpegged regime
(the complement of the pegged regime) is the union
of their crawling peg, managed float, and freely
floating categories. We extend the indicator over
2008–09 by carrying the 2007 value forward.
See the main text for a description of how the
action-based fiscal policy changes are identified.

appendix 4.2. Statistical Methodology,
robustness checks, and Selected additional
results on export and Import responses
This appendix provides further details about
the statistical methods used and the robustness of
the regression results. It first describes the baseline
regression model and estimation strategy. It then
continues with a discussion and summary of a
variety of robustness checks for the core results. The
appendix concludes with a set of selected additional
results on the export and import responses.

Model Specification and estimation
The baseline specification is a cross-section and
time fixed effects panel data model:
2

2

s=1

s=0

DYi,t = mi + lt + ∑ bs DYi,t–s + ∑ gs DFi,t–s + ei,t (4.2)
where subscript i indexes economies, subscript t
indexes years, and DY is the change in the dependent
variable of interest. The term DF is the estimated size
of our action-based fiscal consolidation or expansion
International Monetary Fund | September 2011

153

world economic outlook: Slowing growth, riSing riSkS

in percent of GDP. The term mi denotes an economy
fixed effect, lt denotes a year fixed effect, and ei,t is a
mean-zero error term. b and g denote the coefficients
on the lagged dependent variable and the fiscal
policy change, respectively, with s indexing the lag of
the corresponding variable. The baseline regression’s
lag order of 2 is selected based on a review of the
information criteria and serial correlation properties
associated with various lag lengths.
Because we want an estimate of the overall effect
of fiscal policy changes on the dependent variable of
interest, we do not include any mediating variables
or possible transmission channels for fiscal policy as
additional explanatory variables. The inclusion of
mediating variables would net out any effect of fiscal
policy that works through the mediating variables,
leading to a distorted picture of the overall effect.
Moreover, if the additional explanatory variables are
endogenous, their presence in the model would further contaminate the estimated effect of fiscal policy.
These considerations lead us to adopt a conservative
and simple specification, relying on the research
design underlying our identified fiscal policy changes
to ensure their exogeneity. This allows us to recover
an unbiased estimate of the effect of fiscal policy
with a minimal specification.
The equation is estimated in changes because
nonstationarity tests indicate that a unit root in
the level of the current-account-to-GDP ratio (the
key variable of interest) over 1978–2009 cannot be
rejected for 16 of the 17 economies in the sample.
In order to ensure comparability of the estimation
method and to address nonstationarity issues, the
same specification in changes is also used for the
other dependent variables of interest. The estimated
responses of the changes are then cumulated to
recover the response of the level of the dependent
variable to a permanent 1 percent of GDP fiscal
consolidation. The standard errors of the impulse
responses are calculated using the delta method.

robustness checks
The baseline results of the effect of a fiscal policy
change on the current-account-to-GDP ratio were
subjected to a variety of robustness checks, including
the following:
154

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

1. Estimation by two-stage least squares (TSLS): We
also estimated the model under the assumption
that the action-based fiscal policy change can
act as an instrument for the fiscal policy change
based on the CAPB.
2. Transformation of the fiscal policy change measure into deviations from the in-sample tradeweighted partner average fiscal policy change: To
confirm that the relative size and sign of the fiscal
policy change is what matters for the current
account rather than the absolute size and sign, we
constructed for each economy the trade-weighted
average of its in-sample trading partners’ fiscal
policy changes, which was then subtracted from
each economy’s fiscal policy change to derive its
relative change.
3. A static panel model: The lagged dependent
variables were dropped from the set of explanatory variables, and five years of lags of the
action-based fiscal policy changes were added to
the model. The cumulated impulse response at a
given horizon is then simply the sum of the coefficients on the fiscal policy change and its lags up
to the given horizon.
4. Estimation by difference generalized method
of moments (GMM): Because the time dimension relative to the cross-section dimension of
the sample is large (32 versus 17), any dynamic
panel bias arising from the correlation of the
cross-section fixed effect and the lagged dependent variables should be comparatively small. To
ensure that this was the case, we also estimated
the model using Arellano and Bond’s (1991) difference GMM procedure.37
5. A larger set of lags: The lags of the dependent
variable and the fiscal policy changes in the
dynamic model were increased to four (the baseline is two).

37To avoid the weak instruments problem associated with
instrument proliferation in dynamic models, the instrument set
was restricted to the second through fourth lags of the lagged
dependent variables (in addition to the exogenous variables). The
estimated model passes both the Sargan overidentification and
difference-in-Sargan tests, with p-values over 10 percent. The
model also passes the Arellano-Bond test for no serial correlation
in the first differences of order 2.

chapter 4

6. Dropping outliers: Cook’s distance statistic
was calculated for all observations in the baseline model for the current account. Observations whose Cook’s distance statistic exceeded
the threshold of N–4 , where N is the number of
observations underlying the regression, were then
dropped and the model reestimated. This procedure flagged 27 of the 493 observations appearing in the baseline model as outliers.
7. Trimming extreme values of the action-based fiscal policy changes: The top and bottom 5 percent
of the fiscal policy changes were set to zero and
the model was reestimated.
8. Comparison of the effects of fiscal expansions
versus consolidations.
9. Comparison of the effects of primarily tax-based
versus spending-based fiscal policy changes.
The responses of the current account to a 1
percent of GDP action-based fiscal consolidation
under the first seven robustness checks are shown in
Figure 4.12. At the five-year horizon, the responses
range from about 0.45 (when policy changes are
expressed as deviations from trade-weighted partner
averages) to about 0.7 (when extreme values of the
fiscal policy changes are set to zero). Apart from the
TSLS estimates, the overall shapes of the responses
are remarkably similar across robustness checks.
The TSLS estimates show a much stronger initial
response of about 0.7 on impact and 0.8 in the year
after a fiscal consolidation. This then settles down
at the lower level of about 0.7 in the second year.
Confidence bands around the estimates (not shown)
indicate a roughly similar pattern of statistical significance as seen in the baseline.38
Figure 4.13 shows the responses to fiscal policy
changes when different types of fiscal policy changes
are allowed to have different effects. As noted, we
considered two cases: fiscal expansions versus consolidations, and primarily tax-based versus spendingbased fiscal policy changes. The top panel shows the
responses to fiscal policy changes that are allowed to
differ according to whether they are expansions or
consolidations. Not surprisingly, the response to fis-

38As a further robustness check, we also estimated the model
over the set of samples where we drop one economy at a time. All
the estimated responses looked similar to the baseline, indicating
that no single economy is driving the results.

cal expansions is of opposite sign to that for consolidations. The effects of expansions and consolidations
are roughly symmetric. At the five-year horizon, it is
0.5 for consolidations and the same magnitude but
of opposite sign for expansions. Both responses are
statistically significant.
The bottom panel shows the responses to a fiscal
consolidation that is either primarily tax-based or
spending-based. A tax-based consolidation has a
larger effect on the current account (about 0.7 at
the five-year horizon) than does a spending-based
consolidation (about 0.4 at the five-year horizon).
Although both responses are significantly different
from zero from the time the consolidation is implemented onward, a test of the difference between the
tax-based versus spending-based fiscal change fails to
reject equality.
Overall, the baseline results appear to be
extremely robust.

appendix 4.3. Global Integrated Monetary
and Fiscal Model (GIMF)
This appendix gives an overview of the structure
of the model that underlies the chapter’s simulation
results, followed by a simulation of the effects of different fiscal instruments on the current account. For
more details on the model’s structure, see Kumhof
and others (2010). For further analysis of the twin
deficits link using the GIMF, see Kumhof and Laxton (2009) and Clinton and others (2010).

Main Features of the GIMF
The GIMF is a multiregion dynamic structural
general equilibrium (DSGE) model with optimizing behavior by households and firms and full
intertemporal stock-flow accounting. Friction in
the form of sticky prices and wages, real adjustment
costs, liquidity-constrained households, along with
finite planning horizons of households, gives the
model certain key properties—notably, an important role for monetary and fiscal policy in economic
stabilization.
The assumption of finite horizons separates the
GIMF from standard monetary DSGE models and
allows it to have well-defined steady states in which

chapter 4

economies can be long-term debtors and creditors. This allows users to study the transition from
one steady state to another where fiscal policy and
private saving behavior play a critical role in both
the dynamic adjustment to and characteristics of the
new steady state.
Asset markets are incomplete in the model. Government debt is only held domestically, as noncontingent
one-period nominal bonds denominated in domestic
currency. The only assets traded internationally are
noncontingent one-period nominal bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, which can be issued by the U.S.
government and by private agents in any region. Firms
are also only owned domestically. Equity is not traded
in domestic financial markets; instead, households
receive lump-sum dividend payments.
Firms employ capital and labor to produce tradable and nontradable goods. There is a financial
sector as found in Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist
(1999), which incorporates a procyclical financial
accelerator, with the cost of external finance facing
firms rising with their indebtedness.
The GIMF encompasses the entire world economy, explicitly modeling all the bilateral trade flows
and their relative prices for each region, including
exchange rates. The standard production version
comprises six regions. The international linkages in
the model allow the analysis of policy spillovers at
the regional and global levels.
Household sector
There are two types of households, both of which
consume goods and supply labor. First, there are
overlapping-generation households that optimize
their borrowing and saving decisions over a 20-year
planning horizon. Second, there are liquidity-constrained households, which do not save and have no
access to credit. Both types of households pay direct
taxes on labor income, indirect taxes on consumption spending, and a lump-sum tax.
Production sector
Firms that produce tradable and nontradable goods
are managed in accordance with the preferences of their
owners, who are finitely lived households. Therefore,
firms also have finite planning horizons. The main substantive implication of this assumption is the presence

Separated at Birth? the twin Budget and trade BalanceS

of a substantial equity premium driven by impatience.
Firms are subject to nominal rigidities in price setting
as well as real adjustment costs in labor hiring and
investment. They pay capital income taxes to governments and wages and dividends to households.
Financial sector
The current version of the GIMF contains a
limited menu of financial assets. Government debt
consists of one-period nominal bonds denominated
in domestic currency. Banks offer households oneperiod fixed-term deposits, which is their source of
funds for loans to firms. These financial assets, as
well as ownership of firms, are not tradable across
borders. Optimizing households may, however,
issue or purchase tradable U.S.-dollar-denominated
obligations.
Uncovered interest parity does not hold, due to
the presence of country risk premiums. The premiums create deviations, both in the short and the long
term, between interest rates in different regions, even
after adjustment for expected exchange rate changes.
International dimensions and spillovers
All bilateral trade flows are explicitly modeled, as are
the relative prices for each region, including exchange
rates. These flows include exports and imports of
intermediate and final goods. They are calibrated in the
steady state to match flows observed in the recent data.
International linkages are driven by the global saving and
investment decision, a by-product of consumers’ finite
horizons. This leads to uniquely defined current account
balances and net foreign asset positions for each region.
Because asset markets are incomplete, net foreign asset
positions are represented by noncontingent one-period
nominal bonds denominated in U.S. dollars.
Along with uncovered interest parity, and longterm movements in the world real interest rate, the
magnitude of the international trade linkages is the
main determinant of spillover effects from shocks in
one region onto other regions in the world.
Fiscal and monetary policy
Fiscal policy is conducted using a variety of fiscal
instruments related to spending and taxation. Government spending may take the form of consumption or
investment expenditure or lump-sum transfers, either

The response of the current account is similar for most fiscal instruments, ranging
between 0.4 and 0.6 percent of GDP in year t = 1, and between 0.7 and 0.8
percent in the medium term. The current account response is somewhat smaller,
both in the short and medium term, when fiscal consolidation is based on labor
income taxes, and somewhat larger in the medium term, when fiscal consolidation is

bank uses an inflation-forecast-based interest rate
rule. The central bank varies the gap between the
actual policy rate and the long-term equilibrium rate
to achieve a stable target rate of inflation over time.

Fiscal Instruments and their effects on the current
account
Does the impact of fiscal policy on the current
account differ depending on which fiscal instrument
is used? To answer this question we examine what
happens when a small open economy with unconstrained monetary policy, which we calibrate to fit
the main features of Canada, implements fiscal consolidation using different instruments. In particular,
we examine the effects of a 1 percent of GDP fiscal
consolidation on the current account when this consolidation is implemented using each of the following fiscal instruments, one at a time: labor income
taxes, capital income taxes, consumption taxes,
government consumption, government investment,
general transfers, and targeted transfers.39
As shown in Figure 4.14, the response of the current account balance to a fiscal consolidation of 1
percent of GDP is large regardless of the instrument.
For most of these instruments, the current account
improvement ranges between 0.4 and 0.6 percent
of GDP during the first year, with the exception of
labor income taxes, for which the improvement in the
current account is about 0.3 percent of GDP. Over
the medium term, the improvement in the current
account balances ranges between 0.7 and 0.8 percent
of GDP for most instruments, with the exception
of labor income taxes, with an improvement in the
current account balance of 0.5 percent of GDP, and
capital income taxes, with an improvement in the current account balance of 0.9 percent of GDP.
39These transfers are targeted to the liquidity-constrained
households.

IMF executIve BoArd dIscussIon oF the outlook, August 2011

The following remarks by the Acting Chair were made at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
World Economic Outlook on August 31, 2011

E

xecutive Directors observed that global economic activity has weakened and become
more uneven across countries, financial
volatility has risen, and downside risks have
increased sharply. These developments are largely
symptomatic of limited progress by key advanced
economies in eliminating sovereign and financial
sector imbalances to facilitate a shift from public
to private demand. Meanwhile, rebalancing from
external to domestic demand in key emerging market
economies still has a long way to go. The global
recovery has been further impeded by unexpected
shocks, including supply disruptions from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the surge in oil prices,
and political unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa region. While the impact of these shocks will
gradually fade, the fundamental real and financial
weaknesses will remain in the absence of decisive and
increasingly urgent policy responses.
Directors noted that, in most advanced economies with crisis legacies—such as overleveraged
household and financial sectors and overstretched
public balances—real GDP growth and employment are anemic, and ongoing fiscal withdrawal will
continue to weigh on demand. In others, activity is
more robust. In emerging market and developing
economies, growth remains strong but will likely
moderate from last year given lackluster activity in
the major advanced economies and greater financial
tensions. Overheating pressures have been building
until recently, amid strong growth in credit and
asset prices, widening current account imbalances,
and resilient capital flows. Meanwhile, many developing and low-income countries remain vulnerable
to high and volatile levels of food and fuel prices.
Directors stressed that the foremost priority for
key advanced economies is to address sovereign and

banking sector fragilities, which pose significant
downside risks to the global outlook. In the euro
area, it is imperative to repair and reform financial
markets and institutions, further boost bank capital
where needed, and implement the commitments
made at the July 2011 EU Summit. Over the
medium term, stronger euro area governance and
progress toward a more integrated economic union
remain important priorities. In the United States
and Japan, political commitment to a well-paced,
credible fiscal consolidation plan is an urgent priority, and renewed action to revive the U.S. housing
market is also crucial. In general, fiscal policies
need to strike the right balance between restoring
medium-term public debt sustainability and limiting short-term deleterious effects on growth, taking
care to maintain the credibility of fiscal policies.
The policy response will vary by country but will
likely require consolidation through entitlement and
tax reforms and accelerated structural reforms to
boost jobs, competitiveness, and potential output.
Fiscal plans that credibly achieve medium-term
fiscal sustainability could provide the needed policy
room to support the near-term recovery, reducing
reliance on monetary policy and its spillover effects.
Directors generally agreed that, given the tepid
recovery in key advanced economies and growing
downside risks, monetary policy should continue
to be highly accommodative for the foreseeable
future. A number of Directors saw limited scope
for additional monetary support, including through
unconventional measures, noting risks of distorting incentives and resource allocation. Directors
stressed the need for continued progress in financial
sector supervision and macroprudential policies to
contain risks of excessive leverage emanating from a
prolonged period of low interest rates.

world economic outlook: Slowing Growth, Rising Risks

Directors stressed that emerging market
and developing economies should continue to
strengthen fiscal positions to address fiscal risks and
rebuild policy room, fend off excessive reliance on
capital inflows, and alleviate the burden on monetary policy. At the same time, fiscal consolidation
should protect infrastructure and social spending,
thereby sustaining medium-term growth prospects and protecting the poor. Economies with
strong public sector balance sheets could postpone
adjustment if external downside risks threaten to
materialize.
Directors noted that the monetary policy needs
differ across emerging market and developing
economies. The monetary tightening phase should
continue in countries with increasing signs of overheating risks. In other economies, given the unusual
uncertainty in the global environment, policymakers could consider a cautious approach to slowing the pace of monetary tightening while being
watchful of financial stability risks, including from a
potential reversal in capital flows.
Directors underscored the importance of maintaining vigilance against potential financial risks in

162

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

light of past or continued capital flows and strong
credit growth in some emerging market economies.
Further efforts are necessary to enhance financial
sector regulation, including by widening the peri­
meter of supervision to include nonbank intermediation and use of macroprudential measures to
limit risk taking. In economies with persistently
large current account surpluses, greater exchange
rate flexibility—complemented with structural
reforms—is key to dampening inflation pressures,
fostering a balanced expansion, and facilitating
global rebalancing over the medium term.
Directors emphasized that the escalation of global
uncertainty even after three years since the onset of
the global crisis is a reminder that the fundamental
problems that caused the crisis remain largely unaddressed, while new risks have built up. The policy
room to respond to potential exigencies has further
narrowed. A renewed spirit of international policy
cooperation is needed to advance internal and
global demand rebalancing in a more meaningful
way, as well as to resist trade protectionism. Without this, strong global growth and financial stability
will remain elusive for years to come.

StatiStical appendix

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical data as well as projections. It comprises five sections: Assumptions, What’s
New, Data and Conventions, Classification of Countries, and Statistical Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2011–12 and the medium-term
scenario for 2013–16 are summarized in the first
section. The second section presents a brief description of changes to the database and statistical tables.
The third section provides a general description of
the data and of the conventions used for calculating country group composites. The classification
of countries in the various groups presented in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) is summarized in
the fourth section.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here;
Statistical Appendix B is available online.) Data
in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through early September
2011. The figures for 2011 and beyond are shown
with the same degree of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are
projections, the same degree of accuracy is not to be
inferred.

assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at their
average levels during the period July 18–August 15,
2011. For 2011 and 2012, these assumptions imply
average U.S. dollar/SDR conversion rates of 1.589
and 1.593, U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of 1.413
and 1.412, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates of
80.2 and 78.0, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$103.20 a barrel in 2011 and $100.00 a barrel in
2012.
Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy

assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on sixmonth U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent
in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012, that three-month
euro deposits will average 1.3 percent in 2011 and
1.2 percent in 2012, and that six-month yen deposits
will average 0.5 percent in 2011 and 0.3 percent in
2012.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on
December 31, 1998, the Council of the European
Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the
irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro
and currencies of the member countries adopting
the euro are as follows. (See Box 5.4 of the October
1998 World Economic Outlook for details on the
conversion rates.)

World Economic outlook: SloWing groWth, riSing riSkS

What’s new
• Data for Estonia are now included in the euro area
aggregates and for advanced economies.
• As in the April 2011 World Economic Outlook, WEO
aggregated data exclude Libya for the projection
years due to the uncertain political situation.
• Starting with the September 2011 World Economic
Outlook, Guyana and Suriname are classified as
members of the South America region and Belize as
a member of the Central America region. Previously,
they were members of the Caribbean region.
• For Sudan, the projections for 2011 and later
exclude South Sudan.

data and conventions
Data and projections for 184 economies form the
statistical basis for the World Economic Outlook (the
WEO database). The data are maintained jointly by
the IMF’s Research Department and regional departments, with the latter regularly updating country
projections based on consistent global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented
in the World Economic Outlook conform broadly to
the 1993 version of the System of National Accounts
(SNA). The IMF’s sector statistical standards—the
Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5),
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM
2000), and the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 (GFSM 2001)—have all been aligned with the
1993 SNA. These standards reflect the IMF’s special
interest in countries’ external positions, financial
sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when the manuals are released.
However, full concordance with the manuals is

164

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the
World Economic Outlook estimates are only partially
adapted to these manuals. Nonetheless, for many
countries the impact of conversion to the updated
standards will be small on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partially adopted
the latest standards and will continue implementation
over a period of years.
Consistent with the recommendations of the 1993
SNA, several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-base-year method of calculating real macroeconomic variable levels and growth by switching
to a chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth. The chain-weighted method frequently
updates the weights of price and volume indicators. It
allows countries to measure GDP growth more accurately by reducing or eliminating the downward biases
in volume series built on index numbers that average
volume components using weights from a year in the
moderately distant past.
Composite data for country groups in the World
Economic Outlook are either sums or weighted averages
of data for individual countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages of growth rates are expressed
as compound annual rates of change.7 Arithmetically
weighted averages are used for all data for the emerging and developing economies group except inflation
and money growth, for which geometric averages are
used. The following conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange rates,
interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to U.S.
dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the
preceding three years) as a share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a share of total world or group GDP.8
7Averages for real GDP and its components, employment, per
capita GDP, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commodity prices, are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the
simple arithmetic average.
8See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook for a
summary of the revised PPP-based weights and Annex IV of the
May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See also Anne-Marie Gulde

StatiStical appEndix

• Composites for data relating to the domestic
economy for the euro area (17 member countries
throughout the entire period unless noted otherwise) are aggregates of national source data using
GDP weights. Annual data are not adjusted for
calendar-day effects. For data prior to 1999, data
aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit
exchange rates.
• Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to U.S. dollars at
the average market exchange rates in the years
indicated.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of
group labor force.
• Composites relating to the external economy are
sums of individual country data after conversion
to U.S. dollars at the average market exchange
rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data and at end-of-year market exchange
rates for debt denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars. Composites of changes in
foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are
arithmetic averages of percent changes for individual countries weighted by the U.S. dollar value
of exports or imports as a share of total world or
group exports or imports (in the preceding year).
• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of
group weights is represented.

classification of countries
Summary of the country classification
The country classification in the World Economic
Outlook divides the world into two major groups:
advanced economies, and emerging and developing
economies.9 This classification is not based on strict
and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based
Weights for the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the
World Economic Outlook (International Monetary Fund, December 1993), pp. 106–23.
9As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not
always refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by
international law and practice. Some territorial entities included
here are not states, although their statistical data are maintained
on a separate and independent basis.

criteria, economic or otherwise, and it has evolved
over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method for organizing
data. Table A provides an overview of the country
classification, showing the number of countries in
each group by region and summarizing some key
indicators of their relative size (GDP valued by PPP,
total exports of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis.
Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, Montserrat, and South Sudan are examples
of countries that are not IMF members, and their
economies therefore are not monitored by the IMF.
San Marino is omitted from the group of advanced
economies for lack of a fully developed database.
Likewise, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of
Micronesia, Palau, and Somalia are omitted from the
emerging and developing economies group composites because of data limitations.

General Features and composition of Groups
in the World Economic Outlook classification
advanced economies
The 34 advanced economies are listed in Table
B. The seven largest in terms of GDP—the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United
Kingdom, and Canada—constitute the subgroup of
major advanced economies, often referred to as the
Group of Seven (G7). The members of the euro area
and the newly industrialized Asian economies are also
distinguished as subgroups. Composite data shown
in the tables for the euro area cover the current
members for all years, even though the membership
has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the
European Union, not all of which are classified as
advanced economies in the World Economic Outlook.

emerging and developing economies
The group of emerging and developing economies
(150) includes all those that are not classified as
advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging and developing economies are central and eastern Europe (CEE),

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

165

World Economic outlook: SloWing groWth, riSing riSkS

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), developing
Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Middle
East and North Africa (MENA), and sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA).
Emerging and developing economies are also classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical
criteria reflect the composition of export earnings and
other income from abroad; a distinction between net
creditor and net debtor economies; and, for the net
debtors, financial criteria based on external financing
sources and experience with external debt servicing.
The detailed composition of emerging and developing economies in the regional and analytical groups is
shown in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion by source of export earnings distinguishes between categories: fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification—SITC 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups when their main source of
export earnings exceeds 50 percent of total exports on
average between 2005 and 2009.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies, net debtor economies, and heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPCs). Economies are categorized as net

166

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

debtors when their current account balance accumulations from 1972 (or earliest data available) to
2009 are negative. Net debtor economies are further
differentiated on the basis of two additional financial
criteria: official external financing and experience with
debt servicing.10 Net debtors are placed in the official
external financing category when 65 percent or more
of their total debt, on average between 2005 and
2009, is financed by official creditors.
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known
as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the
external debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to
a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of
time.11 Many of these countries have already benefited from debt relief and have graduated from the
initiative.
10During 2005–09, 44 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears
and/or rescheduling during 2005–09.

and Sukwinder Singh, Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative, IMF Pamphlet Series No. 51 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

World Economic outlook: SloWing groWth, riSing riSkS

Box a1. economic policy assumptions Underlying the projections for Selected economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based on
officially announced budgets, adjusted for differences between the national authorities and the IMF
staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal
projections incorporate policy measures that are
judged likely to be implemented. In cases in which
the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess
the authorities’ budget intentions and prospects for
policy implementation, an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise.
Specific assumptions used in some of the advanced
economies follow. (See also Tables B5, B6, B7, and
B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appendix
for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: The 2011 forecasts are based on the
2010 outturn and IMF staff assumptions. For
the outer years, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based IMF staff
projections and the 2011–12 budget.
Austria: Projections assume compliance with the
expenditure ceilings of the federal financial framework law for 2012–15.
Belgium: IMF staff projections for 2011 and
beyond are based on unchanged policies. The 2011
projections, however, include some of the measures
1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percent of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percent of potential output. The structural balance is
the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential output, corrected for one-time
and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and
output composition effects. Changes in the structural balance
consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the
impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs,
and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing.
The computations of structural balances are based on IMF
staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure
elasticities. (See the October 1993 World Economic Outlook,
Annex I.) Net debt is defined as gross debt minus financial
assets of the general government, which include assets held by
the social security insurance system. Estimates of the output
gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

172

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

included in the 2011 federal budget. For local
governments, unchanged policies imply the continuation of their electoral cycle.
Brazil: The 2011 forecast is based on the budget
law, the spending reduction package announced
by the authorities earlier this year, and IMF staff
assumptions. For 2012 and outer years, the IMF
staff assumes adherence to the announced primary
target and further increase in public investment in
line with the authorities’ intentions.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in
the latest Budget 2011—A Low-Tax Plan for Jobs
and Growth, tabled on June 6, 2011. The IMF
staff makes some adjustments to this forecast for
differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF
staff forecast also incorporates the most recent data
releases from Finance Canada (Update of Economic
and Fiscal Projections, October 2010) and Statistics
Canada, including federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns through the end of the first
quarter of 2011.
China: For 2010, the government is assumed
to continue and complete the stimulus program
it announced in late 2008, and so there is no significant fiscal impulse. The withdrawal of the stimulus
is assumed to start in 2011, resulting in a negative
fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of GDP (reflecting
both higher revenue and lower spending).
Denmark: Projections for 2010–11 are aligned
with the latest official budget estimates and the
underlying economic projections, adjusted where
appropriate for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions. For 2012–16, the projections incorporate key features of the medium-term fiscal plan
as embodied in the authorities’ 2009 Convergence
Program submitted to the European Union.
France: Estimates for the general government in
2010 reflect the actual outturn. Projections for 2011
and beyond reflect the authorities’ 2011–14 multiyear budget, adjusted for differences in assumptions on macro and financial variables, and revenue
projections.
Germany: The estimates for 2010 are preliminary estimates from the Federal Statistical Office of
Germany. The IMF staff’s projections for 2011 and
beyond reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal

StatiStical appEndix

Box a1 (continued)
government budget plan adjusted for the differences
in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and
staff assumptions about fiscal developments in state
and local governments, the social insurance system,
and special funds. The estimate of gross debt as of
December 31, 2010, includes portfolios of impaired
assets and noncore business transferred to institutions that are winding up.
Greece: Macroeconomic and fiscal projections for
2011 and the medium term are consistent with the
policies agreed between IMF staff and the authorities in the context of the Stand-By Arrangement.
Fiscal projections assume a strong front-loaded fiscal adjustment, which already started in 2010, but
will be followed by further measures during 2011–
15 in line with the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy.
Growth is expected to bottom out in late 2010
and gradually rebound after that, coming into
positive territory in 2012. Outflows of deposits
are expected to continue through 2012, and credit
to contract as banks deleverage. The data include
fiscal data revisions for 2006–09. These revisions
rectify a number of shortfalls with earlier statistics.
First, government-controlled enterprises whose
sales cover less than 50 percent of production costs
have been reclassified into the general government
sector, in line with Eurostat guidelines. A total
of 17 such enterprises or entities were identified
and included, including a number of large lossmaking entities. The inclusion implies that the
debt of these entities (7¼ percent of GDP) is now
included in headline general government debt data
and that their annual losses increase the annual
deficit (to the extent their called guarantees were
not already reflected). Second, the revisions reflect
better information on arrears (including tax refund
arrears, arrears on lump sum payments to retiring civil servant pensioners, and arrears to health
sector suppliers), as well as corrections of social
security balances on account of corrected imputed
interest payments, double counting of revenues,
and other inaccuracies. Finally, new information
on swaps also became available and further helps
explain the upward revision in debt data.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections.

Hungary: Fiscal projections include IMF staff projections of the macro framework and of the impact
of existing legislated measures, as well as fiscal policy
plans as announced by end of the first week of
September 2011.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary
execution data. Projections are based on available
information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with
adjustments for IMF staff assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to two years;
general government data are thus finalized well after
central government data. IMF presentation differs
from Indian national accounts data, particularly
regarding divestment and license auction proceeds,
net versus gross recording of revenues in certain
minor categories, and some public sector lending.
Indonesia: The 2010 central government deficit
was lower than expected (0.6 percent of GDP),
reflecting underspending, particularly for public
investment. The 2011 central government deficit
is estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP, lower than the
revised budget estimate of 2.1 percent of GDP.
Higher oil prices will have a negative budgetary
impact in the absence of fuel subsidy reform, but
this effect is likely to be offset by underspending,
in particular on public investment, given significant
budgeted increases. Fiscal projections for 2012–16
are built around key policy reforms needed to support economic growth—namely, enhancing budget
implementation to ensure fiscal policy effectiveness,
reducing energy subsidies through gradual administrative price increases, and continuous revenue
mobilization efforts to create room for infrastructure
development.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the 2011
budget and the medium-term adjustment envisaged
in the December 2010 EU/IMF–supported program, as modified by the May 2011 Jobs Initiative,
which include a total of €15 billion in consolidation
measures during 2011–14. The fiscal projections are
adjusted for differences between the macroeconomic
projections of the IMF staff and those of the Irish
authorities. A preliminary adjustment is also made
for the reduction in interest rates on EU financing agreed July 21 by the European Council. (See
the Alternative Scenario in Annex I of the IMF

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

173

World Economic outlook: SloWing groWth, riSing riSkS

Box a1 (continued)
staff report for Ireland’s Third Review under the
Extended Arrangement.)
Italy: Fiscal projections incorporate the impact
of the July 2010 fiscal adjustment measures for
2011–13 and the July–August 2011 fiscal adjustment package for 2011–14. (The August package is
based on the government’s decree approved August
13, 2011.) The estimates for 2010 are the preliminary outturn data from the Italian National Institute
of Statistics (Istat). The IMF staff projections are
based on the authorities’ estimates of the policy
scenario (as derived, in part, by the IMF staff),
including the above-mentioned medium-term fiscal
consolidation packages and adjusted mainly for
differences in macroeconomic assumptions and for
less optimistic assumptions concerning the impact
of revenue administration measures. After 2014, a
constant cyclically adjusted primary balance net of
one-time items is assumed, with the primary surplus
remaining below 5 percent of GDP.
Japan: The projections assume fiscal measures
already announced by the government and gross
reconstruction spending of about 1 percent of
GDP each in 2011 and 2012 (total of 2 percent of
GDP). The medium-term projections assume that
expenditure and revenue of the general government are adjusted in line with current underlying
demographic and economic trends (excluding fiscal
stimulus and reconstruction spending).
Korea: Fiscal projections assume that fiscal policies
will be implemented in 2011 as announced by the
government. Projections of expenditure for 2011
are about 3 percent lower than the budget, taking
into account the authorities’ historically conservative
budget assumptions. Revenue projections reflect the
IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, adjusted
for discretionary revenue-raising measures included
in the 2009 and 2010 tax revision plans. The
medium-term projections assume that the government will continue with its consolidation plans and
balance the budget (excluding social security funds)
by 2013; the government’s medium-term goal is to
achieve balance by 2013–14.
Mexico: Fiscal projections are based on (1) the
IMF staff’s macroeconomic projections; (2) the
modified balanced budget rule under the Fis-

174

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

cal Responsibility Legislation, including the use
of the exceptional clause; and (3) the authorities’
projections for spending, including for pensions
and health care, and for wage restraint. For 2012,
projections assume compliance with the balanced
budget rule.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period
2011–16 are based on the Bureau for Economic
Policy Analysis budget projections, after adjusting
for differences in macroeconomic assumptions. For
2016, the projection assumes that fiscal consolidation continues at the same pace as for 2015.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2010 budget and IMF staff estimates.
The New Zealand fiscal accounts switched to generally accepted accounting principles beginning in
fiscal year 2006/07, with no comparable historical
data.
Portugal: 2011 and medium-term fiscal projections reflect the authorities’ commitments under the
EU/IMF–supported program.
Russia: Projections for 2011–13 are based on the
non-oil deficit in percent of GDP implied by the
approved 2011–13 medium-term budget, the 2011
supplemental budget, an assumed second supplemental budget for 2011, and IMF staff revenue
projections. The IMF staff assumes an unchanged
non-oil federal government balance in percent of
GDP during 2013–16.
Saudi Arabia: The authorities base their budget on
a conservative assumption for oil prices—the 2011
budget is based on a price of $54 a barrel—with
adjustments to expenditure allocations considered in
the event that revenues exceed budgeted amounts.
IMF staff projections of oil revenues are based on
WEO baseline oil prices discounted by 5 percent,
reflecting the higher sulfur content in Saudi crude
oil. Regarding non-oil revenues, customs receipts are
assumed to grow in line with imports, investment
income in line with the London interbank offered
rate (LIBOR), and fees and charges as a function
of non-oil GDP. On the expenditure side, wages
are assumed to rise at a natural rate of increase in
the medium term, with adjustments for recently
announced changes in the wage structure. In 2013
and 2016, 13th-month pay is awarded based on the

StatiStical appEndix

Box a1 (continued)
lunar calendar. Transfers are projected to increase in
2011 primarily due to a one-time transfer to specialized credit institutions and a two-month salary
bonus. Interest payments are projected to decline
in line with the authorities’ policy of reducing the
outstanding stock of public debt. Capital spending
in 2011 is projected to be about 25 percent higher
than in the budget approved in December 2010 and
in line with the priorities established in the authorities’ Ninth Development Plan. Recently announced
capital spending on housing is assumed to start in
2012 and continue over the medium term.
Singapore: For fiscal year 2011/12, projections are
based on budget numbers. For the remainder of the
projection period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2011 budget and policy intentions
stated in the Budget Review, published February 23,
2011.
Spain: The 2010 numbers are the authorities’
estimated outturns for the general government for
the year. For 2011 and beyond, the projections are
based on the 2011 budget, new measures implemented during the course of 2011, and the authorities’ medium-term plan, adjusted for the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic projections.
Sweden: Fiscal projections for 2011 are in line
with the authorities’ projections. The impact of
cyclical developments on the fiscal accounts is calculated using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s latest semi-elasticity.
Switzerland: Projections for 2010–16 are based on
IMF staff calculations, which incorporate measures to restore balance in the federal accounts and
strengthen social security finances.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume that the authorities’ 2011–13 Medium-Term Program (MTP)
budget balance targets will be exceeded by saving
amnesty-related revenue and saving the portion
of revenue overperformance that exceeds MTP
projections.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ 2011 budget announced in March
2011 and the Economic and Fiscal Outlook by the
Office for Budget Responsibility published along

with the budget. These projections incorporate the
announced medium-term consolidation plans from
2011 onward. The projections are adjusted for differences in forecasts of macroeconomic and financial
variables.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on
the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal
adjusted for final fiscal year 2011 appropriations
and the IMF staff’s assessment of likely future
policies adopted by Congress. Compared with the
president’s budget, the IMF staff assumes more
front-loaded discretionary spending cuts, a further
extension of emergency unemployment benefits
and the payroll tax cut, and delayed action on the
proposed revenue-raising measures. No explicit
adjustment has been made for the provisions
contained in the August Budget Control Act to the
extent that the president’s budget proposal already
contained significant deficit-reduction measures.
The fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff’s forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial
variables and different accounting treatment of the
financial sector support, and are converted to the
general government basis.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that
inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range;
they will decrease when indicators suggest that prospective inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate
or range, that prospective output growth is below its
potential rate, and that the margin of slack in the
economy is significant. On this basis, the LIBOR on
six-month U.S. dollar deposits is assumed to average
0.4 percent in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012 (see
Table 1.1). The rate on three-month euro deposits is assumed to average 1.3 percent in 2011 and
1.2 percent in 2012. The rate on six-month Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average 0.5 percent
in 2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012.
Australia: A monetary tightening of 25 to 50
basis points is built into the baseline. This is in line

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

175

World Economic outlook: SloWing groWth, riSing riSkS

Box a1 (concluded)
with surveys, but not with market expectations as
reflected in overnight indexed swap rates.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are broadly
in line with market expectations and consistent with
inflation gradually converging to the middle of the
target range by December 31, 2012.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
China: Monetary tightening built into the baseline is consistent with the authorities’ forecast of 16
percent year-over-year growth for M2 in 2011.
Denmark: The monetary policy is to maintain the
peg to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are in line with market
expectations.
India: The policy (interest) rate assumption is
based on the average of market forecasts.
Indonesia: Monetary policy is expected to be
tightened in 2012, through a combination of
reserve requirement increases and policy rate hikes.
Medium-term monetary policy is assumed to be
consistent with the central bank’s inflation target.
Japan: The current monetary policy conditions
are held for the projection period, and no further
tightening or loosening is assumed.
Korea: Monetary policy assumptions incorporate
further monetary tightening of 25 basis points for
the remainder of 2011. This is in line with market
expectations derived from interest rate forwards
and swaps. For 2012, the policy rate is forecast to
converge to 4 percent, the neutral rate for Korea
estimated from a structural model, by the end of

176

International Monetary Fund | September 2011

the year. This will require two rate hikes of 25 basis
points each during the year.
Mexico: Monetary assumptions are consistent with
reaching the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume unchanged
policies, as indicated in recent statements by the
Central Bank of Russia. Specifically, policy rates are
assumed to remain at the current levels, with limited
interventions in the foreign exchange markets.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections assume
the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar.
South Africa: Monetary projections are based
on the assumption that the authorities follow an
estimated policy reaction function.
Switzerland: Monetary policy variables reflect
historical data from the national authorities and the
market.
Turkey: Monetary projections assume no further
tightening of the policy rate over the near term.
United Kingdom: Monetary projections assume
unchanged policy rates through December 31,
2012. This assumption is consistent with current
market expectations.
United States: Given the outlook for sluggish
growth and inflation, the IMF staff expects the
federal funds target to remain at near-zero levels
until early 2014. This assumption is broadly
consistent with the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s statement in early August that
economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least
through mid-2013.

1For

many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. The figures should be interpreted only as
indicative of broad orders of magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully reflected in
the recent figures.
3Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
4Figures are based on the official GDP data. The authorities have committed to improve the quality of Argentina’s official GDP, so as to bring it into compliance with their obligations under the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. Until the quality of data reporting has improved, IMF staff will also use alternative measures of GDP growth for macroeconomic surveillance, including estimates by private analysts, which have been,
on average, significantly lower than official GDP growth from 2008 onward.
5Libya’s projections are excluded due to the uncertain political situation.
6Projections for 2011 and later exclude South Sudan.
7The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
8The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar values may differ from
authorities’ estimates. Real GDP is in constant 2009 prices.

1In accordance with standard practice in the World Economic Outlook, movements in consumer prices are indicated as annual averages rather than as December–December changes during the year, as is the
practice in some countries. For many countries, figures for recent years are IMF staff estimates. Data for some countries are for fiscal years.
2December–December changes. Several countries report Q4–Q4 changes.
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-to-date coverage are typically used for
more recent years.
4Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
5Figures are based on the official CPI data. The authorities have committed to improve the quality of Argentina’s official CPI, so as to bring it into compliance with their obligations under the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. Until the quality of data reporting has improved, IMF staff will also use alternative measures of inflation for macroeconomic surveillance, including estimates by provincial statistical offices and private
analysts, which have shown inflation considerably higher than the official inflation rate from 2007 onward.
6Libya’s projections are excluded due to the uncertain political situation.
7Projections for 2011 and later exclude South Sudan.
8The percent changes in 2002 are calculated over a period of 18 months, reflecting a change in the fiscal year cycle (from July–June to January–December).
9The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of U.S. dollar values may differ from
authorities’ estimates.

2Percent of potential GDP.
3Beginning in 1995, the debt and debt-services obligations of the Treuhandanstalt (and of various other agencies) were taken over by the general government. This debt is equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, and
the associated debt service to 1/2 to 1 percent of GDP.
4Excludes sizable one-time receipts from the sale of assets, including licenses.
5Excludes one-time measures based on the authorities’ data and, in the absence of the latter, receipts from the sale of assets.
6Includes equity shares.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the U.S. dollar values for the
relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, where the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities
as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are built up from national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign
investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data sources, which is dictated
by availability, implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in balance of payments statistics affect the
estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Despite these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those
presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing developments in savings and investment, both over time and across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual Euro Area countries.
2Georgia and Mongolia, which are not members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, are included in this group for reasons of geography and similarities in economic structure.
