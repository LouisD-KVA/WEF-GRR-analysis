BIS 83rd Annual Report

83rd Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 23 June 2013

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 83rd Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2013.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 898.2 million, compared with
SDR 758.9 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial year
2012/13 may be found on pages 120–3 of this Report under “Net profit and its
distribution”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 175.8 million in
payment of a dividend of SDR 315 per share, payable in any constituent currency of
the SDR, or in Swiss francs.
The Board further recommends that SDR 36.1 million be transferred to the
general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund and the
remainder – amounting to SDR 680.3 million – to the free reserve fund.
With effect from 1 April 2013, the Bank has changed its accounting policy for
post-employment benefit obligations to reflect developments in global financial
standards. The change, which will be applied in the 2013/14 financial statements,
requires statutory reserves to be reduced by SDR 89.7 million, representing
the cumulative change in profit recognition as a result of applying the revised
accounting policy. To this end, the Board proposes to deduct the aforementioned
amount from the free reserve fund. Further details on the revised accounting policy
can be found in note 3 to the financial statements.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2012/13 will be payable to shareholders on 28 June 2013.

Overview of the economic chapters

I. Making the most of borrowed time
Originally forged to describe central banks’ actions to prevent financial collapse,
“whatever it takes” has become a rallying cry for them to continue their
extraordinary policies. But we are past the height of the crisis, and the goal of policy
today is to return to strong and sustainable growth. Authorities need to hasten
structural reforms so that economic resources can more easily be used in the most
productive manner. Households and firms have to complete the repair of their
balance sheets. Governments must redouble their efforts to ensure the sustainability
of their finances. And regulators have to adapt the rules to an increasingly
interconnected and complex financial system and ensure that banks set aside
sufficient capital to match the associated risks. Only forceful efforts at such repair
and reform can return economies to strong and sustainable real growth.

II. The year in retrospect
During the past year, the global economic recovery continued to lose momentum.
The moderation in growth reflected three broad trends: overall weaker but still
solid output growth in emerging market economies; a continued tepid expansion
of the US economy; and recession in the euro area. Central banks injected additional
stimulus into the economy by cutting interest rates and by introducing policy
innovations to further ease monetary conditions. These actions reduced downside
risks and boosted financial markets. However, bank credit conditions continued to
vary across countries, with strong credit growth in emerging market economies,
easing credit conditions in the United States and tightening lending standards in
the euro area. Although some economies have made progress in reducing private
non-financial sector debt, incomplete balance sheet repair continues to slow
growth and make economies vulnerable.

III. Removing the roadblocks to growth
Productivity gains and employment in the major advanced economies have sagged
in recent years, especially where pre-crisis growth was severely unbalanced. Before
they can return to sustainable growth, these countries will need to reallocate labour
and capital across sectors. Structural rigidities that hamper this process are likely to
hold back the economy’s productive potential. Both productivity and employment
tend to be weaker in economies with rigid product markets than in ones with more
flexible ones. Similarly, employment rates tend to be lower where labour markets
are more rigid. Conversely, countries with flexible labour markets recover more
quickly from severely imbalanced downturns. They also create more jobs. Reforms
that enhance the flexibility of labour and product markets could be swiftly rewarded
with improved growth and employment.

IV. Fiscal sustainability: where do we stand?
Despite progress in reducing deficits, public finances in many advanced economies
remain unsustainable. Beyond the burden created by age-related expenditure, a
potential rise in long-term interest rates from their ultra-low levels poses a risk to
public finances in several countries. Many advanced economies therefore still need
to increase their primary balances significantly to put debt on a safer, downward
trajectory. Measures to curb future increases in pension and health care spending
are key to the success of these efforts. Public finances in emerging market economies
are in a relatively better position, but securing them for the future will require
prudence.

V. The road to a more resilient banking sector
Banks are making gradual progress in recovering from the crisis. Further solidifying
the resilience of financial institutions requires that they maintain ample, highquality capital buffers to absorb losses plus well managed liquidity buffers that
will protect them against sudden collapses in market confidence. And it requires
improvements in resolution regimes that will allow systemically important
institutions to fail in an orderly way.
However, measuring and managing the risks of the increasingly international
and intricate financial system continues to challenge the prudential framework.
Here, the use of risk-sensitive metrics together with simple balance sheet gauges
can play a key role in controlling financial system risk. In combination, these two
types of measures are mutually reinforcing and thus generate more information on
the riskiness of a bank than does either of them alone. Policies to structurally
separate bank functions may also help reduce complexity at the level of the firm,
but their impact on systemic stability and efficiency is an open question.

VI. Monetary policy at the crossroads
With monetary policies remaining very accommodative globally, central banks
continue to borrow time for others to act. But the cost-benefit balance is inexorably
becoming less and less favourable. Furthermore, the postponement of the
inevitable exit from these policies poses increasing challenges for central banks.
They must re-emphasise their stability-oriented framework for monetary policy,
although in a way that takes greater account of both financial stability concerns
and global policy spillovers.

I. Making the most of borrowed time

Six years ago, in mid-2007, cracks started to appear in the financial system. Little
more than a year later, Lehman Brothers failed, bringing advanced economies to
the verge of collapse. Throughout the ensuing half-decade of recession and slow
recovery, central banks in these economies have been forced to look for ways to
increase their degree of accommodation. First they lowered the policy rate to
essentially zero, where it has been ever since in the United States, United Kingdom
and euro area. (And where it has stood in Japan since the mid-1990s!) Next, these
central banks began expanding their balance sheets, which are now collectively at
roughly three times their pre-crisis level – and rising.
Originally forged as a description of central bank actions to prevent financial
collapse, the phrase “whatever it takes” has become a rallying cry for central banks
to continue their extraordinary actions. But we are past the height of the crisis, and
the goal of policy has changed – to return still-sluggish economies to strong and
sustainable growth. Can central banks now really do “whatever it takes” to achieve that
goal? As each day goes by, it seems less and less likely. Central banks cannot repair
the balance sheets of households and financial institutions. Central banks cannot
ensure the sustainability of fiscal finances. And, most of all, central banks cannot
enact the structural economic and financial reforms needed to return economies to
the real growth paths authorities and their publics both want and expect.
What central bank accommodation has done during the recovery is to borrow
time – time for balance sheet repair, time for fiscal consolidation, and time for
reforms to restore productivity growth. But the time has not been well used, as
continued low interest rates and unconventional policies have made it easy for the
private sector to postpone deleveraging, easy for the government to finance
deficits, and easy for the authorities to delay needed reforms in the real economy
and in the financial system. After all, cheap money makes it easier to borrow than
to save, easier to spend than to tax, easier to remain the same than to change.
Yes, in some countries the household sector has made headway with the
gruelling task of deleveraging. Some financial institutions are better capitalised.
Some fiscal authorities have begun painful but essential consolidation. And yes,
much of the difficult work of financial reform has been completed. But overall,
progress has been slow, halting and uneven across countries. Households and firms
continue to hope that if they wait, asset values and revenues will rise and their
balance sheets improve. Governments hope that if they wait, the economy will
grow, driving down the ratio of debt to GDP. And politicians hope that if they wait,
incomes and profits will start to grow again, making the reform of labour and
product markets less urgent. But waiting will not make things any easier, particularly
as public support and patience erode.
Alas, central banks cannot do more without compounding the risks they have
already created. Instead, they must re-emphasise their traditional focus – albeit
expanded to include financial stability – and thereby encourage needed adjustments
rather than retard them with near-zero interest rates and purchases of ever larger
quantities of government securities. And they must urge authorities to speed up reforms
in labour and product markets, reforms that will enhance productivity and encourage
employment growth rather than provide the false comfort that it will be easier later.
After a review of the past year in Chapter II, this Report discusses these issues in
Chapters III to VI, which are summarised here. Our message is simple: authorities

need to hasten labour and product market reforms to boost productivity and unlock
growth; the private sector must deleverage and the public sector needs to ensure
fiscal sustainability; risks in the financial system need to be managed; and the
expectation that monetary policy can solve these problems is a recipe for failure.

Enhancing flexibility: a key to growth
Sustained and balanced growth remains elusive in the global economy. In many
advanced economies, growth rates have only partially recovered, and unemployment
remains stubbornly high (Graph I.1). As discussed in Chapter III, rigidities in labour
and product markets are among the most important obstacles standing in the way
of long-term economic health. The financial crisis and its aftermath showed that
such structural problems are exacerbated when the cycle turns and the boom
becomes a bust. As a result, the recovery has been disappointing in many economies.
When a housing sector boom turns into a bust, as it did in a number of
countries, rigidities limit the mobility of people across sectors. As Chapter III argues,
tight employment protections slow the recovery and the growth of employment in
economies that go into recessions with significant sectoral imbalances. The
implication is obvious: countries stand to reap substantial benefits from moving
towards less regulated and more growth-friendly labour and product markets.
Measures that make labour and product markets more flexible allow resources to
flow more easily from low- to high-productivity sectors, with obvious gains for growth.
In parallel, such reforms help foster entrepreneurship, paving the way for firms to
boost productivity, grow and hire more workers. This means that simplifying regulations
and reducing the power of special interests that are impeding productivity
enhancements are essential for raising sustainable growth. To be sure, basic worker

must be preserved, and the extent of desirable regulation
will vary from country to country. But the costs of overly regulated labour and product
markets are clear: they reduce flexibility to the point where long-run growth will suffer.

Some research finds that, after a financial crisis, private sector deleveraging during the downturn is
positively and significantly correlated with the strength of the subsequent recovery. See M Bech,
L Gambacorta and E Kharroubi, “Monetary policy, leverage and the business cycle”, BIS Working
Papers, no 388, September 2012.
		
Households in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Spain and the United Kingdom, have
made inroads on their debt. But as a share of GDP, the decline has been far less than the
approximately 40 percentage point drop for private non-financial sector debt that, on average, has
followed past financial crises. See G Tang and C Upper, “Debt reduction after crises”, BIS Quarterly
Review, September 2010, pp 25–38.

In a majority of the countries shown in Graph I.2, public debt is principally
responsible for the increase. Although countercyclical fiscal policy was needed to
combat the threat of depression at the height of the financial crisis, the situation is
different today. As Chapter IV notes, studies have repeatedly shown that as
government debt surpasses about 80% of GDP, it starts to become a drag on
growth.2 With public debt now above 100% of GDP in most advanced economies,
and the prospect of large increases in age-related spending, finding the way to
medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability remains a key challenge.
Ultimately, outsize public debt reduces sovereign creditworthiness and erodes
confidence. By putting their fiscal house in order, governments can help restore the
virtuous cycle between the financial system and the real economy. And, with low
levels of debt, governments will again have the capacity to respond when the next
financial or economic crisis inevitably hits.
Although the need for fiscal consolidation has become more and more
pressing, as Chapter IV shows, tangible results have been meagre. In a number of
countries, the cheap financing made available by low short- and long-term interest
rates has taken the pressure off governments to make fiscal adjustments.3 But the
relief is temporary and not without risks. To see why, recall that in the two decades
preceding the crisis, long-term interest rates in many advanced economies
averaged about 6% (Graph I.3, left-hand panel). Today, long-term bond yields in
major advanced economies are around 2% – in Japan, they are well below. When
interest rates and bond yields start to rise, investors holding government bonds
stand to lose huge amounts of money.
Consider what would happen to holders of US Treasury securities (excluding
the Federal Reserve) if yields were to rise by 3 percentage points across the maturity
spectrum: they would lose more than $1 trillion, or almost 8% of US GDP (Graph I.3,
right-hand panel). The losses for holders of debt issued by France, Italy, Japan and
the United Kingdom would range from about 15 to 35% of GDP of the respective
countries. Yields are not likely to jump by 300 basis points overnight; but the
experience from 1994, when long-term bond yields in a number of advanced
economies rose by around 200 basis points in the course of a year, shows that a big
upward move can happen relatively fast.
And while sophisticated hedging strategies can protect individual investors,
someone must ultimately hold the interest rate risk. Indeed, the potential loss in
relation to GDP is at a record high in most advanced economies. As foreign and
domestic banks would be among those experiencing the losses, interest rate
increases pose risks to the stability of the financial system if not executed with great
care. Clear central bank communication well in advance of any moves to tighten
will be critical in this regard.
Governments must redouble their efforts to ensure that their fiscal trajectories
are sustainable. Growth will simply not be high enough for fiscal consolidation to
happen on its own; that is, the denominator of the debt-to-GDP ratio will not grow
faster than the numerator. Postponing the pain carries the risk of forcing

2

Other types of debt have similar effects: corporate debt beyond 90% of GDP and household debt
above about 85% have been found to become a drag on growth; see S Cecchetti, M Mohanty and
F Zampolli, “The real effects of debt”, in Achieving maximum long-run growth, proceedings of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Jackson Hole symposium, August 2011, pp 145–96.

Extraordinarily low yields reflect a combination of factors, including a continued weak economic
outlook, safe haven flows from other economies, regulation-driven demand for safe and liquid
assets, and large-scale central bank interventions.

The financial system: increasing resilience
The complexity of the financial system presents a continuing challenge for the
prudential framework. Ensuring systemic stability requires adequate capital,

liquidity and resolution regimes. All financial institutions must have ample,
high-quality capital buffers to protect against losses and sufficient liquidity buffers
to protect them from sudden collapses in market confidence. And we need
resolution regimes to make it possible for large, complex institutions to fail in an
orderly way.
Still, finding the best way to manage the risks arising from an increasingly
global and intricate financial system remains a challenge for the world’s policymakers.
Chapter V argues that focusing on the measurement and management of these
risks is central to creating a safer prudential framework.
An important example of the benefits of a prudential framework that
embraces the evolving intricacies of the financial system is detailed in Chapter V.
A simple rule, such as a leverage ratio, and a more complex risk-weighted metric
each have their advantages and limitations as a barometer of bank strength. But
they are complementary. Used in combination, the two reinforce each other,
generating more information on the riskiness of a bank than does either of them
alone. On top of that, manipulating these measures is much more difficult when
they are used simultaneously. The policy response to the recent debate on the
complexity of regulation should therefore rest on the mutually reinforcing ability
of risk-sensitive metrics and simple balance sheet rules to monitor and mitigate
financial system risk.
Limiting the permissible range of banking activities may help reduce systemic
risk, but that is not likely to be a silver bullet. The limits will do little to reduce the
complexity of banks, and even if they simplify the firm-level organisation of banks,
their impact on system-wide risk is ambiguous.
The evolving standards governing the global financial system must be based
on simple principles: internalise systemic risks; require enough capital and liquidity
to align private incentives with the public interest; set risk sensitivity to reduce
shifts into high-risk assets; extend prudential reach to keep risks within view of
supervisors (and managers); and allow the regulatory system to evolve along with
the financial system. But what is simple in principle will usually be complicated in
fact. This means that the success of financial reforms hinges on long and complex
definitions and processes. And the reason for that is a simple, practical one: details
are enforceable, principles are not.

Monetary policy: borrowing time
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, central banks have found themselves
pushing deeper into unconventional territory. Having hit the lower bound for
interest rates, central banks in major advanced economies turned to amassing
assets, which now stand at 25% of their countries’ collective GDP. Meanwhile,
central banks in emerging market economies have also expanded their balance
sheets, and now hold assets worth more than 40% of GDP. Combined, central bank
assets across advanced and emerging market economies have risen from
$10.4 trillion in 2007 to more than $20.5 trillion today, and central banks remain
pressured to do even more (Graph I.4).
But despite all the monetary accommodation, economic growth remains
lacklustre, and job creation has yet to gain firm traction. Moreover, the low
interest rates in advanced economies create international spillovers. These include
capital flows to fast-growing emerging market economies and to some small
advanced economies. The resulting upward pressure on the value of the currencies
in those economies has hampered the domestic stabilisation efforts of their
central banks.

Delivering further extraordinary monetary stimulus is becoming increasingly
perilous, as the balance between its benefits and costs is shifting. Chapter VI argues
that policy frameworks anchored to price stability remain the foundation for
growth. Without price stability, you have nothing. But, as the crisis has taught us,
narrow near-term price stability is not enough: financial stability is also essential for
long-term macroeconomic stability. The challenge is to modify traditional monetary
policy frameworks to include financial stability considerations effectively and
symmetrically.
All of this puts monetary policymakers in the largest advanced economies in a
delicate position. How can central banks encourage those responsible for structural
adjustment to implement reforms? How can they avoid making the economy too
dependent on monetary stimulus? When is the right time for them to pull back
from their expansionary policies? And in pulling back, how can they avoid sparking
a sharp rise in bond yields? It is time for monetary policy to begin answering these
questions.

Summing up
Six years have passed since the eruption of the global financial crisis, yet robust,
self-sustaining, well balanced growth still eludes the global economy. If there were
an easy path to that goal, we would have found it by now. Monetary stimulus alone
cannot provide the answer because the roots of the problem are not monetary.
Hence, central banks must manage a return to their stabilisation role, allowing
others to do the hard but essential work of adjustment.
Authorities need to hasten labour and product market reforms so that
economic resources can shift more easily to high-productivity sectors. Households
and firms have to complete the difficult job of repairing their balance sheets, and
governments must intensify their efforts to ensure the sustainability of their

BIS 83rd Annual Report

finances. Regulators have to adapt the rules to a financial system that is becoming
increasingly interconnected and complex and ensure that banks have sufficient
capital and liquidity buffers to match the associated risks. Each country needs to
tailor the reform agenda to maximise its chances of success without endangering
the ongoing economic recovery. But, in the end, only a forceful programme of
repair and reform will return economies to strong and sustainable real growth.

12

BIS 83rd Annual Report

II. The year in retrospect

During the past year, growth in the major advanced economies faltered. Concerns
about sovereign risk, bank soundness and business prospects resurfaced and
pushed the euro area into recession. Investment was weak in Japan and the United
Kingdom, while uncertainty about short-term fiscal policy in the United States
weighed on economic activity. Output growth in emerging market economies
(EMEs) decreased against the backdrop of a deteriorating external environment,
but in some countries robust domestic demand helped offset the reduction in
exports.
Globally, central banks responded by cutting policy rates where they still
had the scope to do so, while those that could not introduced further innovations
to ease monetary policy: changing targets, modifying communication strategies,
increasing and altering the structure of asset purchases, and targeting specific
channels of the monetary transmission mechanism. The resulting fall in perceived
downside risk and expectations of an extended period of low policy rates buoyed
financial markets and encouraged flows into EMEs with higher-yielding assets,
putting upward pressure on their currencies.
At the time of writing, the signs point to an uneven recovery. Credit growth has
been strong in EMEs, and credit conditions have eased in the United States, Japan
and the United Kingdom. However, lending standards remain tight in the euro area,
and private credit demand to finance investment and consumption has fallen
drastically. High-frequency indicators of business activity corroborate the picture of
an uneven recovery. Data in 2013 so far indicate that the recovery is likely to be
slow and bumpy, with financial markets going through both calm and volatile
periods as they price in sometimes conflicting news.
Both as a legacy of the pre-crisis financial boom and as a result of
accommodative monetary policies in response to the crisis, the level of private
non-financial sector debt remains high globally. Despite some progress in reducing
debt, especially in those advanced economies that experienced a significant
accumulation during the boom, balance sheet repair remains incomplete and is
acting as a drag on growth. At the same time, increased leverage in other advanced
economies and in EMEs suggests the potential build-up of vulnerabilities in some
regions.

Weak global growth persisted in 2012–13
During the past year, the economic recovery lost momentum. Global growth
declined to 3.2%, more than 2 percentage points below the peak reached in 2010.
As shown in the top left-hand panel of Graph II.1, this global moderation of growth
reflects three broad trends: output growth that is lower overall but still solid in EMEs;
a continued expansion of the US economy; and recession in the euro area. Growth
in Japan has been volatile, following the temporary boost from reconstruction after
the 2011 earthquake and more recent changes in economic policy.
The global economy faced major headwinds from the euro area crisis and
growing uncertainty about fiscal policy in advanced economies more broadly. The
euro area crisis intensified again in the first half of 2012 as concerns about the link
between sovereign and banking sector risk resurfaced. These concerns were

reflected in a sharp increase in Spanish and Italian government bond yields. In Spain,
the yield on 10-year government bonds increased to 7.6% in July 2012 following the
government’s request for financing to recapitalise the banking system, while in Italy
government bond yields rose to 6.6%. The intensification of the euro area crisis in
2012 also contributed to higher risk premia in global financial markets. At the same
time, yields on safe haven bonds decreased, with yields on German and US 10-year
bonds falling by around 50 basis points.
In 2012, the deepening euro area crisis also had an impact on global activity
through trade linkages. The top right-hand panel of Graph II.1 shows that EME
exports to the euro area contracted significantly more than those to the United
States. In contrast, the relative strength of emerging market economies saw intra-EME

exports grow by around 10%. The net effect of these different patterns was a
stagnation in world trade.
Domestic demand in advanced economies remained lacklustre, with uncertainty
about fiscal policy weighing on sentiment. In Europe, the recession complicated the
task of meeting budget deficit targets. In the United States, the combination of
expiring tax cuts and across-the-board government spending cuts (the fiscal cliff)
was avoided, but at the time of writing uncertainty persists about the impact of
other automatic budget cuts. Although consumption and investment grew relatively
strongly, they were not sufficient to make a significant dent in the unemployment
rate, which decreased only gradually to around 7.5%. Unemployment continued to
rise in the euro zone, reaching a new high of 12%, and remained broadly unchanged
elsewhere (Graph II.1, bottom left-hand panel).
In connection with the weakness of global economic activity, commodity prices
have decreased since last November, contributing to a reduction in global
inflationary pressures (Graph II.1, bottom right-hand panel). Average inflation in
advanced and emerging economies decreased to below 2% and 4%, respectively.
The reduction in inflationary pressures provided central banks with some space to
increase the degree of monetary stimulus.
In emerging economies, GDP growth decreased to 5% in 2012 (Graph II.1, top
left-hand panel). Nevertheless, economic performance varied across countries. In
some, including Indonesia, Peru and the Philippines, GDP growth remained solid,
driven by strong fixed investment and consumption, while in others domestic
demand was constrained by the delayed impact of monetary policy tightening in
2011 to cool both inflationary pressures and domestic real estate market conditions.
In China, GDP growth decreased to 7.8% from 9.3% in 2011 as investment in the
manufacturing sector slowed. In Brazil, output grew by less than 1%, with gross
fixed capital formation particularly weak in 2012. In India, growth was affected by a
significant slowdown in consumption and fixed investment.
High-frequency indicators of business activity point to an uneven recovery in
the first part of 2013. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) in the United States
improved from mid-2012 into February 2013 (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). In Japan,
the PMI increased in early 2013. There are also limited signs of improvement in
business activity in EMEs (Graph II.2, right-hand panel). The PMI in China has
improved slightly since the middle of 2012. In the euro area, the worsening slump
in business activity appears to have been mitigated by policy action, and there are
some encouraging signs, especially in Germany (Graph II.2, left-hand panel).
However, the index for the euro area as a whole has still not risen back above 50,
which would indicate improving business conditions.
Euro area banking sector stresses resurfaced in March 2013 in Cyprus. This
resulted in the restructuring of the largest Cypriot bank and resolution of the
second largest (causing significant losses for uninsured depositors), the imposition
of temporary capital controls and the provision of €10 billion in official financial
assistance. Broader contagion from the Cypriot bank bail-in was limited, however,
and liquidity conditions remained stable across markets. Several factors may have
contributed to this somewhat muted market reaction. The first was a perception
among market participants that the crisis in Cyprus, and the nature of its bank
bail-in, were unique and small in scale. At the same time, tail risk was contained
by continued monetary accommodation and backstop measures adopted by
the ECB.1

Central bank actions boosted financial markets
Against the backdrop of weaker growth and receding inflationary pressures in 2012,
central banks in both advanced and emerging economies injected further stimulus
into the economy. A number of central banks cut policy rates to counteract the
impact from the fall in aggregate demand (Graph II.3). The ECB lowered its main
refinancing rate to 0.50% and reduced the deposit facility rate to zero (Graph II.3,
left-hand panel). Policy rates were also lowered in other advanced economies
(including Australia and Sweden).
In emerging economies, the monetary policy tightening that had started with
the global recovery in 2010 came to an end. The Reserve Bank of India eased its
monetary policy stance, cutting both the repo rate and the cash reserve ratio by
125 and 200 basis points, respectively, from the beginning of 2012. The People’s
Bank of China lowered its benchmark deposit and lending rates by 50 basis
points while differentiating credit policies applied to the real estate sector. The
Central Bank of Brazil reduced rates by 500 basis points starting in August 2011,
although domestic inflationary pressures have more recently forced a partial reversal.
Policy rates were also cut in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico and Poland,
among others.
Other central banks with policy rates already at the effective zero lower bound
used an increasing variety of policy innovations to further ease monetary policy. In
the United States, the Federal Reserve changed its communication policy of forward
guidance in December 2012, committing to keep the federal funds rate below
0.25% for at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5%, provided inflation
expectations stay well anchored. In January 2013, the Bank of Japan introduced a
2% inflation target.
There have also been a number of changes to large-scale government bond
purchase policies over the past year. In contrast to previous rounds of asset
purchases, the Federal Reserve made its asset purchase programmes open-ended,
purchasing initially $45 billion of US Treasuries a month, and stating that it would
continue purchases until the labour market outlook had substantially improved. The

Bank of Japan’s Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing aims to double the
monetary base, increasing the amount of Japanese government bond holdings at
an annual rate of ¥50 trillion, and to extend the average maturity of its government
bond purchases to around seven years.
The ECB introduced facilities to conduct Outright Monetary Transactions
(OMTs), a backstop that allows unlimited sovereign bond purchases when a member
country submits to a macroeconomic adjustment programme. OMTs are designed
to address severe distortions in the pricing of sovereign debt in some euro area
countries. At the time of writing, they had remained unused.
The Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England also used policy
instruments to target specific parts of the monetary transmission mechanism. The
Federal Reserve resumed its purchases of mortgage-backed securities, while the
Bank of Japan announced plans to purchase exchange-traded funds and Japanese
real estate investment trusts. The Bank of England and Bank of Japan introduced the
Funding for Lending Scheme and the Loan Support Program, respectively. These
schemes provide incentives to increase the supply of loans by linking cheaper bank
funding to lending activity.

nominal 10-year government bond yields below 2% in the United States, Germany
and the United Kingdom (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). More recently, however,
yields started to increase. In the United States, this may have been related to
improvements in labour market conditions and concerns about the path of future
asset purchases. In Japan, nominal government bond yields initially fell below 1%

but later displayed increased volatility. Real long-term yields remained in negative
territory in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom (Graph II.4, centre
panel). In Japan, following the announcement of the inflation target, real long-term
yields became negative in early 2013. An important factor behind the drop in bond
yields was a significant reduction in term premia, which compensate investors for
the risks of inflation and movements in real rates. For example, the term premium
on US Treasuries turned negative in 2011 and continued to decrease in 2012,
reaching its lowest level for at least 25 years (Graph II.4, left-hand panel); in the
euro area, the premium turned negative in mid-2012.
The extensive policy support during the second half of 2012 reduced downside
risk and infused financial market participants with renewed optimism. The difference
between the interest rate paid on bonds by firms rated BBB and AAA, a proxy for
the spread on risky relative to less risky borrowers, decreased by around 100 and
200 basis points in the United States and euro area, respectively, from the peak
reached in 2012 and recently stood around levels that had prevailed prior to the
Lehman Brothers bankruptcy (Graph II.5, left-hand panel).
Equity risk reversals, an option-based measure of downside risk, declined
substantially in response to central bank actions in the United States, euro area and
United Kingdom. The centre panel of Graph II.5 compares their level across an event
window of several days before and after the key announcement date (normalised
to zero).2 While more sluggish, the reaction to the ECB’s three-year longer-term
refinancing operation (LTRO) and OMT announcements had a very strong impact
in reducing the perceived risk of a large equity market fall. In the second half of
2012, the introduction of OMT facilities also led to a sizeable decrease in bank

credit default swap (CDS) premia not only in the euro area but also more globally
(Graph II.5, right-hand panel). As with the ECB announcements, the reaction of
equity risk reversals to the Bank of Japan’s new price stability target and Quantitative
and Qualitative Monetary Easing programme also had a sizeable impact. Benefiting
from both the further easing of monetary policy and the reduction in perceived
risks, equity markets in advanced and emerging economies gained around 25%
and 10%, respectively, from their trough in 2012 (Graph II.4, right-hand panel).
However, recent equity market volatility highlights the fragility of market sentiment
while the recovery of the real economy is still in doubt.

Credit conditions remained different across countries
Credit conditions varied greatly across countries. Graph II.6 (left-hand panel) shows
that, in the context of lower interest rates and stronger domestic demand, total
credit (bank loans and bonds) to the private non-financial sector grew in 2012 at a
rate above 15% in EMEs. Among major advanced economies, credit grew at a
moderate pace in the United States and United Kingdom, while it slackened further
in the euro area and declined slightly in Japan.
In the United States, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending

Practices indicated a net easing of banks’ standards on commercial and industrial
loans to firms (Graph II.6, centre panel) and a reduction in the spread of loan rates
over bank funding costs. In the United Kingdom, following a period of tightening,

banks started to ease credit supply conditions for firms after the introduction of the
Funding for Lending Scheme in the second half of 2012. However, the increased
availability of credit to the UK corporate sector came mainly from non-bank
financing. Net non-financial corporate bond issuance almost doubled in 2012
relative to the average of the previous five years (Graph II.6, right-hand panel).
The reduction of credit growth in the euro area reflected not only the weakness
of demand, but also relatively tight bank supply conditions. The responses to the
euro area bank lending survey indicated a tightening of lending standards on loans
to firms (Graph II.6, centre panel). In the second half of 2012, the tightening was
mostly attributed to pessimism regarding the economic outlook, which particularly
affected banks in the euro area periphery. In contrast to the continued tightening of
bank credit conditions, the easing of the tensions in sovereign debt markets and the
reduction of perceived risk had a positive impact on the net issuance of corporate
bonds (Graph II.6, right-hand panel).
In Japan, although credit supply conditions remained accommodative, total
credit to the private non-financial sector declined slightly in 2012 (and stagnated in
real terms). However, figures for the first quarter of 2013 indicate an increase in
bank credit, mainly related to stronger demand from firms for working capital and
financing for mergers and acquisitions.

countries.3 The substantial fall in government bond yields in many advanced
economies is likely to have encouraged capital flows to fast-growing EMEs and
smaller advanced economies and put upward pressure on their currencies. Since
the beginning of 2013, net capital inflows have increased sharply, especially in
emerging Asia (Graph II.7, first panel), equalling the previous peak of late 2010.
With increasing demand for emerging market bonds, their spread over US Treasuries
decreased by more than 1 percentage point during the past year (Graph II.7, second
panel).
With highly accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies, a weak
external demand environment and the return of significant capital flows, the past
months have seen increased concern about movements in exchange rates. Between
September 2012 and May 2013, the Japanese real effective exchange rate
depreciated by more than 20%, returning to its 2007 level. Evaluated over the last
decade, the depreciation of the Japanese real effective exchange rate is similar to
that experienced by the United States (Graph II.7, third panel). In contrast, the real
effective exchange rates of China and commodity-producing countries such as
Australia and Canada appreciated by around 25% compared with the pre-crisis

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The euro area real effective exchange rate is around its pre-crisis average.
Within the single currency area, real exchange rates based on unit labour costs
indicate that Germany still shows a large gain in competitiveness compared with
the pre-crisis average, although Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain have substantially
narrowed the gap vis-à-vis Germany since 2008 (Graph II.7, last panel). In contrast,
France and Italy have not experienced any improvement in competitiveness relative
to Germany since the financial crisis.
For some countries, official intervention in currency markets can be an
important instrument to lean against upward exchange rate pressures and to offset
the impact of capital flows. In 2012, global foreign reserves amounted to more than
$10 trillion, an all-time high (Table II.1). Economies with fixed exchange rate regimes
(eg Hong Kong SAR and Middle East oil-exporting economies) continued to
accumulate reserves at a rapid pace. Other countries – including Korea, Mexico
and, in particular, Switzerland – also added significantly to their reserves.
In addition to direct intervention, countries have used indirect measures to
manage spillovers from low interest rates in advanced economies.5 In particular, over
the past few years some EMEs have taken actions which can be considered as both
macroprudential (ie addressing systemic risk in the financial sector) and capital flow
management measures (ie affecting capital inflows and thereby the exchange rate).

Private non-financial sector debt is still high
Both as a legacy of the pre-crisis financial boom and as a result of low global
interest rates since, the debt of the private non-financial sector (households and

non-financial firms) remains at a high level.6 Some advanced economies experienced
a significant accumulation of debt and misallocation of resources in the boom. In
these countries, private non-financial sector debt-to-GDP ratios remain close to
historically high levels (Graph II.8, left-hand panel), as weak growth has impeded
the repair of private sector balance sheets.7 In other advanced economies less
affected by the crisis, low global interest rates following the crisis have encouraged
a significant build-up in private debt-to-GDP ratios (Graph II.8, centre panel). In
emerging Asia, on average, private debt in relation to GDP remains below the levels
in advanced economies, but it is trending towards the peak reached before the
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s (Graph II.8, right-hand panel).
The differences across countries can also be seen in the left-hand panel of
Graph II.9, which plots the growth of GDP against that of debt in real terms over
the period 2007–12 for 33 advanced and emerging market economies. The 45° line
divides the countries into two groups: the vast majority (27) are located above the
line and have experienced an increase in their private debt-to-GDP ratio since the
global financial crisis. Within this group, a significant number of countries –
predominantly in the euro area – are located towards the left of the vertical axis
and are characterised by an increase in their private debt-to-GDP ratio that is at

least partly due to a drop in economic activity. At the other end of the spectrum are
countries – mostly emerging market economies, but also some smaller advanced
economies – that were not affected so significantly by the crisis and have
accumulated debt at a faster pace than the increase in GDP.
Studies have shown that a deviation of the debt-to-GDP ratio from its trend can
create vulnerabilities, especially if combined with large increases in asset prices.8 The
right-hand panel of Graph II.9 plots the change in real residential property prices
against the change in household real debt across countries in the period 2007–12.
Most of the countries lie above the 45° line: household debt has increased at a
faster rate than property prices, and in some countries, such as Indonesia, Poland
and Turkey, property prices have decreased alongside strong household debt
growth.
While a large change in the debt-to-GDP ratio can indicate either a debt
overhang or a build-up of financial risks, this does not take monetary policy
conditions into account to evaluate debt sustainability. Therefore, it is helpful to
analyse the debt service ratio, defined as interest payments and amortisations
divided by GDP. The deviation of the debt service ratio from its historical average
has been found to perform well as a predictor of the severity of recessions and as
an early warning signal for banking crises.9
The grey bars in Graph II.10 plot the private debt service ratio at the end of
2012. For the majority of the economies shown (17 out of 20), debt service ratios
are above their 1995–2007 averages (brown bars). Sweden has the highest debt

service ratio among advanced economies, which is 6 percentage points above its
long-run average. Euro area periphery countries have also experienced large
increases in debt service ratios. For example, the estimates suggest that – given
current interest rates – debt service ratios in Greece and Portugal are roughly
8 percentage points above their historical averages. At the other extreme, the debt
service ratio in Japan is around 3 percentage points below its long-run average. In
the United States, partly due to the significant reduction in household debt (see
Graph II.9, right-hand panel), the ratio is close to its historical average.
The deviations of debt service ratios in 2012 from their 1995–2007 averages – as
depicted by the difference between the grey and the brown bars – are conditional
on current interest rate levels. However, these are well below their historical levels in
most countries. This may mask an additional need to reduce debt and suggest that
many countries have a long way to go before their deleveraging journey is complete.

Summing up
Despite the further easing of monetary policy during the past year and improving
financial market conditions, at the time of writing the signs of recovery are still
uneven. In the presence of weak growth and insufficient structural reforms, there
remain risks of a sudden deterioration in market sentiment. More generally, the
need for balance sheet repair continues to slow growth and render many advanced
economies vulnerable. With persistent low interest rates in advanced economies,
there are also risks that financial imbalances will build in emerging economies over
the medium term. In this environment, there are likely to be limits to how far
monetary policy can further stimulate demand. Chapter III analyses the role of
structural reform in restarting economic growth.

III. Removing the roadblocks to growth

The pace of recovery in the large advanced economies has been, at best,
disappointing. Emerging economies have generally performed better, but recently
they too have lost their vigour. What can be done to restore sustainable growth?
The sluggishness of the advanced economies continues to reflect pre-crisis
excesses, at least in part. Formerly bloated construction and financial sectors have
shrunk significantly, undermining both growth and employment. This economic
fallout highlights the extent to which resources were misallocated during the
boom.
Returning to strong and sustainable growth will be difficult unless this
misallocation is corrected. Structural rigidities slow growth, both current and
future, by blocking innovation and creative destruction. Countries should therefore
use the time provided by expansionary macroeconomic policy to remove the
product and labour market barriers on the road to growth.

Productivity and employment after the Great Recession
Economic growth in almost all the major advanced economies has slowed
significantly compared with the pre-crisis years. Between 2010 and 2012, real GDP
in the advanced economies expanded by an annual average of only 1.3%, compared
with 2.3% between 2001 and 2007 (Graph III.1) and 2.7% between 1979 and 2007.
The only major exception is Germany, which bounced back from a period of
stagnation in the early 2000s. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), GDP
growth slowed to an annual average of 5.6% in 2010–12, down from 7.5% between
2001 and 2007, and 6.3% between 1979 and 2007.
This lacklustre growth reflects sagging employment combined with lower
productivity growth, relative to the pre-crisis period. The ratio of employment to
total working-age population1 has fallen significantly in most advanced economies,
the main exceptions being Germany and Switzerland (Graph III.2, left-hand panel).
Employment retreated particularly sharply in Greece, Ireland and Spain. In Greece,
just over half of the working-age population was employed at the end of 2012. The
corresponding figure for Spain is 55%. In the United States, the employment rate
fell by 5 percentage points, and now stands at 67% of the working-age population.
Meanwhile, from 1.8% per year between 1980 and 2000,2 output per hour
growth in the advanced economies declined to 1.3% per annum between 2001 and
2007, and just 0.7% between 2010 and 2012. In emerging market economies, the
growth in output per worker fell from 6.1% between 2001 and 2007 to 3.9% between
2010 and 2012.3 The small group of countries experiencing higher productivity

In the case of Spain, labour productivity actually fell in the pre-crisis period. See J Mora-Sanguinetti
and A Fuentes, “An analysis of productivity performance in Spain before and during the crisis:
exploring the role of institutions”, OECD, Economics Department Working Papers, no 973, July 2012,
who show that the low productivity growth was not primarily driven by the shift of workers to the
construction sector. They attribute the poor productivity growth across sectors to rigidities in the
labour market and in regulations affecting business.

growth during the first half of the 2000s.6 The US employment rate likewise peaked
around the turn of the century and has since been steadily falling, for reasons still
being debated.7 Structural factors have also been blamed for the energy sector’s
declining productivity growth.8
But technological and similar structural factors are not the whole story. In many
economies, slowing growth proceeds directly from the pre-crisis boom in the
construction, finance and real estate sectors. When boom turned to bust, it was
these bloated sectors that shrank most sharply.9 Such sectoral imbalances may be
hard to spot as they build up, but they tend to make themselves known when times
turn bad. Indeed, a good measure for such distortions is the concentration of job
losses in specific industries during the bust.10 For instance, post-crisis job losses in
Ireland and Spain were much more concentrated in specific sectors than were those
in Germany or Japan – countries that did not experience housing and construction

We measure the degree of sectoral imbalances as the average absolute change in sectoral
employment share between the beginning and the end of the Great Recession, ie between 2007
and 2009. We consider nine industries to compute this index: agriculture; mining; manufacturing;
construction; electricity; trade; transport; finance, insurance and real estate services; and other
services. See BIS, 82nd Annual Report, June 2012, Chapter III.

To revive growth, workers and capital will need to shift from industries that
over-expanded during the boom to more productive sectors. This transfer of
resources is facilitated by reforms that increase the incentives for firms to invest,
enter new markets and hire new staff.
But overcoming the legacy of the boom-bust cycle will not be enough,
especially in countries such as Italy that did not see a housing or credit boom of
their own but are still experiencing lower productivity and employment growth.
These countries too need a genuine increase in productivity growth. So far, across
OECD economies, half of the productivity gain in manufacturing, the only sector
where productivity grew faster after the crisis than before, is due to lower
employment. But in the longer run, growth tends to come from new goods and
services as well as innovative ways of producing and delivering them. Regulations
that obstruct innovation and change will therefore slow growth.

Structural rigidities and growth
By hindering the reallocation of capital and workers across sectors, structural
rigidities put the brakes on the economic engine of creative destruction. This
nexus is illustrated by the scatter plots in Graph III.5. These show how rigidities
in product and labour markets go hand in hand with lower labour productivity
and employment.
Rigid product markets, for instance, are frequently accompanied by lower
labour productivity and employment rates (Graph III.5, left-hand and centre
panels). Such rigidities can arise from a wide range of policies, such as price

The OECD indicator of product market regulation (PMR) measures how far policies promote or inhibit competition in areas of the product
market where competition is viable. The scale ranges from 0 (least stringent) to 6 (most restricted). The PMR for each country covers formal
regulations in the following areas: state control of business enterprises; legal and administrative barriers to entrepreneurship; and barriers
to international trade and investment. The most recent observation is for 2008. 2 Defined as GDP per employee in thousands of
US dollars, current PPPs, in 2012. 3 In the population aged 15–64, in 2012. 4 The OECD indicator of employment protection reflects the
strictness of regulation of dismissals and the use of temporary contracts. It is calculated as a weighted average of protection of permanent

controls, exemptions from competition law for public enterprises, barriers to entry
in services such as retail trade and professional services, or restrictions on
acquisitions by foreign entities.13 While most advanced economies have
undertaken significant reforms to remove such rigidities, pockets of high
regulation remain. This is particularly true for parts of the service sector.14 Taken at
face value, the correlation between employment rates and the OECD product
market indicators in a large sample of advanced and emerging market economies
suggests that further liberalisation of product markets would allow countries in
continental Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy) to raise their
employment rates by about 3 percentage points.15 In EMEs, the scope for reducing
product market rigidities is even greater. Reforms in this area could thus give a
further boost to growth and help EMEs to catch up with the advanced economies
at a faster pace.

13

The OECD indicator of product market regulation (PMR) for each country covers formal regulations
in the following areas: state control of business enterprises; legal and administrative barriers to
entrepreneurship; and barriers to international trade and investment.

All these correlations are robust to outliers and continue to hold in multivariate regressions. The
bivariate relationships are weaker for a sample of advanced economies only, especially if Greece is
ignored, owing to the limited variation in the two rigidity indicators.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Reforms in labour markets could yield even greater benefits than liberalising
product markets. High employment protection is associated with lower employment
(Graph III.5, right-hand panel). The estimated correlation suggests that, in countries
with rigid labour markets such as France, Greece and Spain, a reduction in the index
to the sample mean could boost employment rates by roughly 4 percentage points.
The correlations in Graph III.5 are confirmed by studies that control for other factors
affecting growth and for the direction of causality.16 At the firm level, higher
employment protection lowers productivity growth by holding back firms that
operate in an environment of technological change. Similarly, there is evidence that
tight regulation which reduces competition in the service sector can slow growth in
sectors that rely heavily on service inputs. These include the information and
communications technology sector, which grows more sluggishly in countries with
less market-friendly regulation.17
That said, one should not expect reforms to product and labour markets to
produce miracles. First, while different methodologies point towards a statistically
significant negative relationship between structural rigidities and growth and
employment, the size of this relationship varies across studies. Second, it is unclear
whether reforms will permanently lift growth rates or merely generate a one-time
upward shift in the level of GDP. Finally, the benefits of removing structural rigidities
will not materialise overnight, as it can take many years for some reforms to gain
traction. The transfer of workers and capital across sectors tends to be difficult,
costly and time-consuming. The skills required in the growth sectors may be very
different from those offered by workers laid off during the downturn. By the same
token, some of the machinery used to build homes and shopping centres will be
difficult to deploy elsewhere. This will be a particular challenge for economies with
an overextended building sector which used to attract significant investment and
employ large numbers of semi-skilled labourers.

Structural rigidities and the recovery
Economies with large sectoral imbalances recovering from a downturn have a
particularly acute need to reallocate resources from one sector to another. By
hindering this adjustment, rigid product or labour markets slow the pace of
recovery.
This intuition is supported by econometric evidence. Graph III.6 shows that,
when an economy is coming out of a recession that featured large sectoral
imbalances, lower output growth and larger increases in unemployment are often
associated with high readings of the employment protection index (red dots and

16

A number of studies using the OECD PMR indicators and similar measures find that higher rigidities
tend to be associated with lower productivity growth, especially because they inhibit competition.

regression line).18, 19 By contrast, in countries that emerge from recessions without
sizeable sectoral imbalances (blue dots), there is no statistically significant
relationship between the pace of recovery or the change in unemployment on the
one hand, and the degree of employment protection on the other. The inference is
that labour market rigidities do the most damage when the need for labour
reallocation across sectors is greatest. Roadblocks to the reallocation process
reinforce the misuse of resources and are especially damaging for potential growth.
A similar conclusion comes from looking at employment growth. That is, in
countries with higher employment protection, employment usually grows more
slowly during recoveries from a recession with severe imbalances. Conversely, no
significant relationship emerges in the full sample.

18

The analysis is based on a sample of 24 advanced OECD economies starting in 1970. We define
recessions as periods of negative GDP growth and recoveries as the two-year windows after GDP
fell to its trough. We then ask to what extent output and employment growth developments
during recoveries vary according to the degree of labour market regulation and the extent of
sectoral imbalances in an economy. Our evidence is in line with that in J Haltiwanger, S Scarpetta
and H Schweiger, “Assessing job flows across countries: the role of industry, firm size and
regulations”, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Discussion Paper, no 2450, November 2006, who
find that strict labour protection raises labour adjustment costs and thus slows down the reallocation
process. Moreover, the results are robust to controlling for monetary and fiscal policies.

19

Note that the evidence presented for changes in unemployment is actually obtained after controlling
for the effect of GDP growth. Higher employment protection therefore raises unemployment for a
given growth in GDP.

34

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Overall, these results suggest that flexible labour markets allow economies with
large sectoral imbalances to recover more quickly from downturns. To get a sense
of how large these benefits can be, consider the following experiment: what would
be the effect of cutting the index for laying off workers with regular contracts to
the lowest level observed in the OECD? Our estimates suggest that, in a country
with large sectoral imbalances, cutting dismissal costs for workers on regular
contracts to the minimum could raise GDP growth by 0.25 percentage points
annually. This figure compares with an average annual growth rate in GDP of just 3%.
And the unemployment rate two years after the trough would be 0.4 percentage
points lower than without the reform. Importantly, such benefits appear to accrue
quite quickly once the reforms are in place.

The current state of structural rigidities
Removing structural rigidities that hinder the reallocation of capital and workers
across sectors can boost growth. But the nature of these rigidities varies from
country to country. Further, the various types of regulation may interact in complex
ways. This means that the measures that need to be taken also differ from country
to country. For instance, product markets in the most advanced economies tend
to be much less regulated than those in many emerging market economies
(Graph III.7, top panels).
The degree of employment protection also varies greatly across countries
(Graph III.7, bottom panels). Labour markets in the English-speaking advanced
economies tend to be much less regulated than those in most euro area countries,
where the need for reform is greater. Similarly, some countries tend to regulate
permanent contracts relatively strictly, but temporary contracts less so, resulting in
a two-track labour market. Here a relaxation of the regulations covering openended contracts could help workers on temporary contracts to find permanent
positions.
Moreover, labour and product market reforms are only one part of a larger set
of structural measures that need to be taken. To return to a path of strong and
sustainable growth, countries should also address flaws in their education systems
and make their tax systems more growth-friendly, to mention just a few of the
challenges. While all these measures are important, the benefits of some will take
longer to materialise than those of others. Although the effects of product and
labour market reforms are generally not immediate, they tend to feed through
more quickly than the dividends of, say, improving the education system.20

Conclusions
Given the evident benefits of liberalising product and labour markets, why are such
rigidities still in place? One answer is that reforms produce losers as well as winners.
Indeed, members of a small group may have more to lose than those of a larger
one stand to gain from, say, lower prices. Another objection is that reforms
could make things worse in the short run, particularly if undertaken in bad times.
Ideally, the argument goes, reforms should be carried out in good times. Relaxing

R Bouis, O Causa, L Demmou, R Duval and A Zdzienicka, “The short-term effects of structural reforms:
an empirical analysis”, OECD, Economics Department Working Papers, no 949, March 2012, find that
some structural reforms can raise the level of GDP or employment in a matter of a few years.

employment regulations when growth is slow, for instance, could lead to further
job losses in the short term. Yet there are reasons to believe that such an argument
does not always hold. First, when an economy faces the need for adjustment,
maintaining labour market protection may not prevent massive layoffs.21 Second,
this argument does not apply to product market reform. Product market
liberalisation can be a useful tool in propelling growth, especially in bad times.
Liberalising entry into regulated sectors, for instance, can be a significant source of
investment and job creation. All this suggests that it is critical to implement labour
and product market reforms without delay.
21

36

A similar analysis to that presented above suggests that, when sectoral imbalances are large, any
relationship between employment protection and the increase in unemployment during a
downturn is dissolved. This may sound surprising, but the intuition is clear: when firms go bankrupt,
regulations that protect jobs become moot.

But such arguments rarely get much of a hearing. Rather, it seems, policymakers
act only when their hand is forced. Taking as a rough gauge for reforms the number
of measures implemented in response to the two latest OECD Going for Growth
assessments, it was the countries that faced the most intense market pressures that
pushed through the most reforms.22 For instance, countries that benefited less from
the decline in yields (or where yields went up) in recent years have usually
implemented more reforms than countries facing less pressure (Graph III.8, left-hand
panel).23 Similarly, countries experiencing a sharper slowdown in economic activity
reformed more than those where growth held up better (right-hand panel),
although here the correlation is weaker.
That countries tend to start liberalising only when compelled to is unfortunate.
Although some reforms may take effect relatively quickly, others require time and
additional measures to smooth their path. Reforms are therefore best undertaken
sooner rather than later. For instance, as our analysis indicates, the countries that
went through a housing and credit boom would surely have been better off today
if they had taken a bolder, swifter approach to labour and product market reforms.

22

In its assessments, the OECD uses a combination of quantitative indicators and judgment to
identify the five areas with the greatest need for action.

23

The correlation remains statistically significant if we exclude the main outlier (Greece).

IV. Fiscal sustainability: where do we stand?

Six years after the onset of the global financial crisis, public debt in most advanced
economies has reached levels unprecedented in peacetime. And, worryingly, it
continues to rise. But the crisis has only made an already bad situation worse. In
2007, public debt was already at historical highs in many advanced economies,
having trended upwards more or less continuously since the mid-1970s. Even
worse, official debt statistics understate the true scale of the fiscal problems faced
by many economies, as governments have made promises that imply major
increases in pension and health care spending over the coming decades.
Since 2010, there has been uneven progress in consolidating public finances. In
economies facing heavy market pressure, fiscal consolidation efforts have been
substantial and have helped to stabilise financial conditions. In others, especially
those that have continued to enjoy very low interest rates, progress in closing
current deficits as well as in tackling unfunded liabilities has been slower. In these
economies, the needed fiscal adjustment remains large and could swell further if
long-term interest rates rise from their current ultra-low levels.
Most emerging market economies (EMEs) are in better shape than advanced
economies. A stronger recovery has helped them to reduce their deficits. Yet their fiscal
situations may appear rosier than they actually are. In several cases, budget positions
may have benefited from strong credit growth as well as surging asset and commodity
prices. Furthermore, public spending on pensions and health care is expected to rise
substantially in some economies. Governments in emerging market economies therefore
need to remain fiscally prudent and ensure the funding of future age-related liabilities.
In this chapter, we take stock of the progress that advanced and emerging
market economies have made in consolidating their public finances. After reviewing
the changes in deficits and debt that have occurred since 2009, we discuss how
much consolidation is still needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. Then we assess the
potential impact that a rise in interest rates could have on public debt trajectories
in several economies that are currently experiencing low long-term interest rates.
Following this, we discuss whether calls for slower or more back-loaded fiscal
adjustment are justified. Finally, we stress the crucial importance of the quality, or
composition, of fiscal adjustment in enhancing long-term growth.

Progress to date
In 2010, advanced economies began to shrink their deficits, which had risen sharply
soon after the onset of the financial crisis. For most countries, headline deficits
peaked in 2009 at between 5 and 16% of GDP. They have narrowed since, and by the
end of 2013 are expected to be roughly 2 to 12 percentage points below their peaks.
The underlying primary balance (the cyclically adjusted balance net of interest
expenses and one-offs) may provide a more accurate picture of fiscal progress than
do headline deficits.1 In the short term, fiscal tightening lessens output growth. At
1

38

The underlying primary balance is still an imperfect measure, as it is based on an estimate of
the output gap, which is inevitably unreliable. While the short-run negative impact of fiscal
consolidation on growth will fade out over time, part of what is judged to be cyclical may turn out
to be more persistent or structural. If the belief is that the size of negative output gaps is
overestimated, then true fiscal progress would be overestimated too.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

the same time, the level of interest payments may not immediately reflect
improvements brought about by fiscal consolidation. Based on the underlying
primary balance as a measure and using 2009 as a baseline, advanced economies
are expected to have improved their balances by an average of almost 4 percentage
points (1 point per year) by end-2013.
But progress has not been uniform across advanced economies. The largest
adjustment has taken place in economies facing financial market pressures. Among
the countries under EU-IMF financial support programmes, Greece is expected
to have improved its underlying primary balance by almost 17 percentage points
of potential GDP by the end of 2013, while Ireland and Portugal are expected
to have improved theirs by 7.3 and 6.8 points, respectively. As for countries
whose governments still enjoy financial market access, Spain’s underlying primary
balance will have improved by 8.3 percentage points and Italy’s by 5.1 points
(Table IV.1). By contrast, the pace of adjustment has been slower in those countries
where market pressures have been less intense. Within the euro area, France
will have raised its underlying primary balance by 4.9 percentage points, while
the figures for the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium are 3.5, 2.4 and 2.3 points,
respectively.
Progress has also been slower in countries where interest rates are currently
below historical averages – due in large part to central bank bond purchases and
safe haven capital inflows. By end-2013, the United Kingdom and the United States
will have improved their underlying primary balances by 3.3 and 4.8 percentage
points of potential GDP, respectively, since 2009. Only Japan has experienced a
deterioration of its underlying primary balance, partly due to post-earthquake
rebuilding efforts. In view of a projected 2013 headline deficit that exceeds 10% of
GDP, restoring Japan’s fiscal health remains a huge challenge (Table IV.1).
In most advanced economies, the current episode resembles previous periods
of large fiscal adjustment in terms of the pace of consolidation. In these past
episodes, the median improvement in the underlying primary balance was roughly
1 percentage point per year.2 Nevertheless, current efforts fall short in many
countries considering the size of deficits and the scale of adjustment needed.
General government gross debt is expected to continue increasing in numerous
advanced economies. In 2013, it is projected to be close to 230% of GDP in Japan;
over 180% in Greece; over 140% in Italy and Portugal; close to 130% in Ireland;
around 110% in the United States, the United Kingdom and France; and near 100%
in Belgium and Spain. By contrast, it is projected to be below 90% and close to
stabilising in Canada and Germany (Table IV.1).
Adjusting debt figures to account for government assets changes the picture in
a few cases. Net government debt is much lower than gross government debt in
Japan, but remains at 145% of GDP, while in Canada it is almost 50 percentage
points lower. However, the difference is significantly smaller in most other
economies. Moreover, due to the difficulty involved in determining the value of
some financial assets held by the public sector (eg shares in government-controlled
companies), net debt is a more uncertain measure than gross debt.
Current fiscal balances and government debt levels suggest that emerging
market economies are in better fiscal shape than advanced economies. Many EMEs
entered the most recent global recession with lower deficit and debt levels than in
previous episodes. And thanks to a sharp rebound in output growth and favourable

financing conditions, they saw their headline deficits shrink rapidly in the first two
years of the recovery. Debt levels have already fallen in several economies, including
India, Indonesia and Mexico (Table IV.1).
However, the adjustments in the fiscal deficits of some EMEs, including
India, South Africa and Thailand, have slowed in response to weakening global
demand. Debt is now forecast to rise in the next few years in South Africa and
Thailand, and is expected to remain at over 66% of GDP in India – an already high
level that leaves little margin for manoeuvre in case of unexpected adverse
conditions.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Recent favourable developments in the public finances of most EMEs should
not breed complacency. Headline budget balances have improved, but remain
below pre-crisis levels in several EMEs. Furthermore, fiscal revenues in some EMEs
may have benefited so far from an unsustainable boom in credit and asset prices.
And some countries may face sizeable hidden liabilities – potential extra debt that
would materialise if financial institutions, local governments or other state entities
needed to be rescued. Finally, some economies face large increases in pension and
health care expenditures over the coming decades.

What is still needed to ensure fiscal sustainability?
Despite recent fiscal consolidation efforts, substantial further improvements in
underlying primary balances are needed to ensure sustainability in most advanced
economies as well as in several EMEs.
To assess these needs, it is important to determine what level of debt is in fact
sustainable. Simply stabilising debt is unlikely to be enough to ensure long-term
solvency. With debt having already hit peacetime records in several advanced
economies, any unanticipated major event (eg another financial crisis) could lead to
a further sharp increase, quickly turning apparently sustainable fiscal positions into
unsustainable ones.
Even in the absence of such developments, persistently elevated debt levels
may be costly for a number of reasons. First, the higher probability of default or
inflationary finance that could follow another large negative shock is likely to
increase the risk premia that lenders demand from both sovereigns and the private
sector. Second, high debt levels reduce the room for countercyclical policy,
rendering the economy more volatile. Furthermore, they raise uncertainty about
future taxes and public expenditure, which may make firms and households more
reluctant to spend. Finally, persistently higher debt means larger interest payments
that might have to be financed by raising distortionary taxes. All of these factors
can be a drag on growth.
A number of empirical studies support this conclusion, showing that
average growth tends to be lower when gross public debt exceeds about 80% of
GDP (see box). Going over this threshold does not automatically reduce growth,
but when debt persists above this level it brings an increasing risk of slower trend
growth. Given that a buffer is needed to accommodate major shocks, debt targets
should be well below that threshold. Although there is no hard and fast rule for
selecting debt targets, the calculations that follow assume a safe debt target of
60% of GDP for advanced economies and 40% for EMEs.3
Existing commitments to future spending on pensions and health care that
are not reflected in current measures of public debt add to fiscal adjustment
needs. Graph IV.1 shows that age-related liabilities as a share of GDP are projected
to rise considerably between 2013 and 2040 in a number of countries.4 Among
advanced economies, the greatest increase is anticipated in the United States
(over 9 percentage points), with the bulk of that coming from rising health care
expenditures. Austria, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the
United Kingdom are also set to see large rises (approximately 5–8 percentage

Japan’s gross debt target is set at 200% of GDP.

These projections do not take into account reforms enacted after December 2011, and are thus
likely to overestimate the expected increases in age-related spending for countries which have
legislated reforms since then.

Korea (over 12 percentage points), Brazil (about 7 points) and China (about
6 points) – owing mostly to pension expenditure.5
Table IV.2 presents estimates of the change in the underlying primary balance
that would be needed to bring debt levels down to the above-mentioned targets
by 2040. The calculation is based on the following assumptions. First, debt and
deficits are projected from the values forecast for the end of 2013. Second, the
underlying primary balance improves by 1 percentage point a year until debt is
put on a steadily declining path. The required adjustment is then the difference
between the 2013 primary balance and the highest required underlying primary
surplus during 2014–40. Third, the calculation assumes that the output gap closes
over the next five years so that the primary balance converges gradually towards
the underlying primary balance over the same period of time. Finally, it is assumed
that the debt level itself has no impact on either interest rates or economic growth.
The first column in Table IV.2 reports the required adjustment in the underlying
primary balance assuming that age-related spending remains constant as a share of
GDP. The second shows how much the underlying primary balance net of agerelated spending would have to improve under the assumption that no measures
are taken to stem the rise in age-related spending. The third and fourth columns
report the same information assuming that the growth-adjusted interest rate
gradually converges from current levels to 1% over a five-year period. The estimates
presented in these two columns provide a more1/3conservative assessment of the

Fiscal sustainability also depends on liabilities that may materialise if a government needs to rescue
private financial institutions or state entities. Unfortunately, scarcity of information makes assessing
such liabilities subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our calculations do not allow for them
explicitly, but using conservative debt targets is a way of accounting for them.

Adjustment in the underlying primary balance (defined as the difference between the peak in the underlying primary balance during
2014–40 and its projected 2013 level) needed to bring the gross debt-to-GDP ratio to 60% for advanced economies (200% for Japan) and
40% for emerging market economies by 2040. The dots signify that the target debt-to-GDP ratio can be achieved without improvements

fiscal adjustment needs of countries that currently have low interest rates, and
possibly a more realistic one for those that are currently experiencing very high
interest rates and low output growth. If the countries in the latter group make
progress in their consolidation, their borrowing costs can be expected to diminish
somewhat and their growth may pick up over time.
The advanced economies require sizeable fiscal adjustments, especially when
projected increases in age-related spending are taken into account. And some of
the countries that have so far enjoyed very low long-term interest rates face the
largest adjustment needs. In Japan, even under the most benign scenario of current

BIS 83rd Annual Report

43

low growth-adjusted interest rates, and despite a high debt target, the required
adjustment in the underlying primary balance is over 13 percentage points of
potential GDP.
The United Kingdom needs to improve its underlying primary balance by
7.4 points, and the United States by nearly 5 points (column 1). If no measures are
adopted to curb age-related spending (column 2), the United Kingdom and the
United States will have to make massive adjustments to the non-age-related
portion of their underlying primary budgets (13 and 14 percentage points of GDP,
respectively). Given their huge size, it is unlikely that such adjustments will be made,
as governments will probably focus on redesigning entitlements.
These adjustment needs are based on current growth-adjusted interest rates. If
one assumes that current levels gradually converge to 1%, then the result is more
conservative. The necessary adjustment increases by around 2.1 percentage points
to 6.9 for the United States, and by over 1 point to 8.5 for the United Kingdom
(column 3). If no measures to curtail age-related spending are adopted, the
required adjustment would rise to 14.0 and 16.1 percentage points, respectively
(column 4).
Significant adjustments are also required in Spain (7.8 percentage points),
Canada (4.3 points), Italy (4.2 points) and France (3.6 points) (column 1). In the
absence of entitlement reforms, adjustment needs would be a few percentage
points higher in all of those countries except for Italy (column 2).6 The required
adjustment in Spain and Italy would be lower (column 3) if their high growthadjusted interest rates of over 4% (column 5) were to decline.
Other advanced economies (Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands) have
generally low adjustment needs if age-related spending is not taken into account.
However, without measures to curb projected rises in age-related spending, much
larger adjustments (8–9 points) would be necessary.
For many EMEs, low current fiscal deficits imply that a relatively small degree of
adjustment is needed when age-related spending is not taken into account
(column 1). One notable exception is India, which requires an improvement of over
3 percentage points of GDP. Besides low deficits, fiscal sustainability in many EMEs
is facilitated by the fact that their effective interest rates are lower than GDP growth,
due in part to less developed financial markets. However, this is unlikely to persist
as financial markets develop and become more integrated internationally. Another
factor in EMEs’ low borrowing costs is the very low interest rates in advanced
economies. That said, even under the more conservative assumption of gradual
convergence towards a 1% growth-adjusted interest rate, fiscal consolidation
requirements remain relatively small in most countries (column 3).
This benign assessment of fiscal conditions in EMEs changes when projected
increases in age-related spending are factored in. In this case, Korea will have to
improve its underlying primary balance by 12 percentage points, while the
challenge for Brazil, China, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand will be between
4 and 7 points (column 4). To ensure fiscal sustainability, these countries will need
to either limit future age-related spending or make room for it by cutting other
expenses or raising tax revenues.

44

Italy’s consolidation needs are slightly lower when the projected changes in age-related spending
are included, because such spending (as a share of GDP) is forecast to decline at the start of the
simulation period before edging upwards.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Is high public debt a drag on growth?
One would expect public debt to be a drag on long-term average GDP growth, for at least three reasons.
First, as debt rises, so do interest payments. And higher debt service means higher taxes and lower productive
government expenditure. When a significant share of debt is held by foreigners, fewer resources are available for
investment and domestic consumption. More damagingly, the higher tax rates needed to service the higher debt
are distortionary, depressing economic activity, and possibly growth, even further.
Second, as debt rises, so do sovereign risk premia. Economics and politics both put limits on how high tax
rates can go. When rates beyond this maximum are required for debt sustainability, a country will be forced
to default, either explicitly or through inflation. The probability of hitting such limits increases with the level of
debt. And with higher sovereign risk premia come higher borrowing costs, lower private investment and lower
long-term growth.
Third, as debt rises, authorities lose the flexibility to employ countercyclical policies. This results in higher
volatility, greater uncertainty and, again, lower growth.
Empirical research confirms this negative link between public debt and trend growth, starting with a
contribution by Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). The studies fall into two groups: one that investigates the simple,
bivariate correlation between debt and growth, and another that considers a more complex relationship taking
into account differences in population growth, ageing, education, trade openness, financial depth and so on.
To reduce the impact of cyclical fluctuations and focus on the determinants of long-term trends, most of these
studies start with multi-year averages of per capita growth rates. The results, summarised in Table IV.A, are consistent
and unambiguous: a 10 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a 13–17 basis point
decline in trend per capita GDP growth for debt levels above about 80%. The last study, by Baum et al (2012),
covering only euro area countries and including the recent financial crisis, obtains much larger estimates, albeit for a
somewhat higher threshold.

Furthermore, as documented by Reinhart et al (2012), public debt overhangs tend to last for many years.
Over long stretches of time, rising debt levels cannot be regarded as the outcome of an unpredicted adverse effect
such as a recession or a financial crisis. Rather, they must be the outcome of deliberate policy decisions. The question
is therefore whether policies that allow debt to rise are sensible. Even if slow growth caused higher debt, this would
not make higher debt less dangerous. If slow growth persists and its root causes (which critics would ascribe to
factors other than debt itself) are not tackled, then increasing debt further can only be a temporary fix, and at a
certain point it will push the economy close to its fiscal limits.
To sum up, there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that high public debt reduces future
trend real growth. And the evidence shows that the impact is sizeable and begins to take hold at about 80% of GDP.

This means that to support strong, sustainable growth, advanced economies must aim for levels well below this
threshold. In a number of cases, this means doing more than simply stabilising debt – it means reducing it.

 The effects of taxes on growth are probably non-linear, being larger when taxes are already high. See eg N Jaimovich and S Rebelo,
“Non-linear effects of taxation on growth”, NBER Working Papers, no 18473, October 2012.      See H Bi and E Leeper, “Analyzing fiscal

Economic Review, vol 100, no 2, May 2010, pp 573–78. The original version of this study contains a computation error and excludes data
that were not available when the paper was written. However, these problems do not overturn the conclusion that growth is negatively
related to debt. Before the problems became known, the paper had already been superseded by C Reinhart, V Reinhart and K Rogoff,
“Public debt overhangs: advanced-economy episodes since 1800”, Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol 26, no 3, June 2012.      See eg

which acknowledges the negative relationship but asserts that it might be the result of reverse causation arising from the current high debt
levels’ being a consequence of expected low future growth.

Interest rates and sustainability
Governments in several major economies currently benefit from historically low
funding costs. At the same time, rising debt levels have increased their exposure to
higher interest rates. A rise in interest rates without an equal increase in the output
growth rate will further undermine fiscal sustainability.7
Although predicting when and how a correction in long-term rates will unfold
is difficult, it is possible to examine the potential impact on the sustainability of
public finances. As the previous section has already shown, the consolidation needs
of countries experiencing low interest rates would be greater if their growthadjusted interest rates were to rise. To further illustrate the risks posed by a
normalisation of long-term rates, Graph IV.2 shows the results of a number of
simulations of debt-to-GDP ratios in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United
States.
The simulations start with the current forecasts for 2013 debt and budget
balance levels, and then make projections on the basis of the following main
assumptions. First, the primary balance evolves in conformity with the latest
projections by national authorities up to the last full calendar year for which they
are available.8 For subsequent years, the primary balance net of age-related
spending remains constant as a share of GDP, so that the evolution of the overall
primary balance depends on the projected changes in age-related spending.
Second, any increase in interest rates occurs at the beginning of the period covered
in the simulation and leads to a gradual increase in the effective interest rate paid
on debt. This is because in any given year governments usually refinance only a
fraction of their outstanding debt (in addition to any current deficit). For the sake
7

There is some evidence that countries facing public debt in excess of 80% of GDP and persistent
current account deficits are vulnerable to adverse interest rate dynamics. See D Greenlaw,

paper prepared for the US Monetary Policy Forum, New York, February 2013.

Projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) up to 2022 for the United States, the Cabinet
Office up to 2022 for Japan and the Office for Budget Responsibility up to 2017 for the United

balances used in the projections refer to general government. The latter are assumed to change by
the same amount as the former in each year in which they are available.

Primary balances are based on OECD projections (for 2013 and 2014) and national source projections (from 2015 to 2022 for the US and
Japan and from 2015 to 2017 for the UK). For 2023–50 (for the US and Japan) and 2018–50 (for the UK), revenues and non-age-related
spending are kept constant as a share of GDP, while age-related spending is based on projections from the sources cited in Graph IV.1 or
held constant at 2022 levels (US and Japan) or 2017 levels (UK). Nominal GDP growth is based on projections from national sources up to
2022 (US and Japan) or 2017 (UK) and is assumed to remain at 2022 values (US and Japan) or 2017 values (UK) until 2050. Nominal effective
interest rates from the OECD as defined in Table IV.2 are assumed to remain at their projected 2013 level between 2014 and 2050 or to
increase gradually by 1 or 2 percentage points (at an annual rate equal to the inverse of the average remaining maturity of government
debt).

of simplicity, we make the crude assumption that the rise in the effective interest
rate occurs over a number of years equal to the average maturity of debt
outstanding at the start of the simulation period.9
The scenarios considered vary based on the size of the effective interest rate
increase and on whether age-related spending keeps rising or remains constant (as a
share of GDP). Graph IV.2 shows that for the United States a rise in the effective
interest rate could have a significant impact on debt trajectories. Two points stand
out. First, age-related spending will eventually put debt on an upward path regardless
of the interest rate. However, a higher interest rate causes debt to go up much
sooner. Second, even if age-related spending stays constant as a share of GDP, current
adjustment plans will not stabilise debt under the higher interest rate scenarios.
The simulations show that, under current plans, Japan’s debt ratio will also
continue to rise. This is despite the fact that the increase in age-related spending is
expected to be modest in Japan. Unsurprisingly, the higher the interest rate, the
faster debt will increase.
Debt ratios for the United Kingdom are expected to peak in the middle of the
decade. Since the outstanding debt has a very long average maturity of approximately
14 years, the three interest rate scenarios yield similar trajectories until the end of
the decade. This factor effectively provides some insurance against sharp interest
rate rises. That said, if left unchecked, age-related spending will put additional
pressure on debt ratios further down the road.10

Costs and benefits of fiscal consolidation
Fiscal consolidation has undoubtedly been a drag on growth in the last few years.
Moreover, the fact that growth has proved to be weaker than expected in many
advanced economies has recently led to calls for a more gradual or back-loaded
fiscal adjustment. Critics believe that policymakers have misjudged the adverse
effects of consolidation on growth by underestimating the impact of credit
constraints on households and firms, overestimating the effectiveness of monetary
policy when policy rates are near zero, and failing to account for the synchronous
nature of consolidation across countries. Critics also argue that less fiscal
consolidation now would leave more time for economies to heal and adjust, and
that consolidation will be less costly once growth is strong and self-sustaining.
There are reasons to be sceptical about all these arguments. First, even if the
short-term adverse effects of fiscal policy on output (or fiscal multipliers) are
somewhat greater than in the pre-crisis period, there is considerable uncertainty
about their magnitude and no compelling evidence that they are large enough to
render fiscal consolidation more difficult (or actually self-defeating). Instead, the
size of the multipliers depends on the credibility and quality of fiscal adjustment
(see next section), as well as on accompanying structural policies, including
measures to repair the financial system.
9

The simulations do not account for any feedback effects from debt to growth and interest rates, or
for the possible different short- and long-term effects that different paces of consolidation could
have on growth and interest rates.

10

The hypothetical trajectories shown in Graph IV.2 are based on the average maturity of the
(unconsolidated) outstanding general government debt. In reality, the average maturity of the
consolidated government balance sheet (including both the liabilities issued by the fiscal authority
and those issued by the central bank) is shorter on account of the very short maturities of central
bank liabilities. Accounting for such shorter maturities would worsen debt trajectories somewhat
for a given increase in interest rates.

48

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Second, other factors almost surely contributed to unexpectedly weak growth.
Especially in the euro area, investors’ worries about fiscal sustainability and liquidity
drove up sovereign bond yields, putting a strain on bank and sovereign balance
sheets and leading to more restrictive credit conditions. Some countries lost market
access and had to borrow from official sources. In these cases, large, front-loaded
fiscal consolidation was a necessary remedy without which the loss of output would
have been even greater.
Third, larger multipliers do not necessarily undermine the case for an early or
relatively fast adjustment. The argument for back-loading or slowing the pace of
fiscal consolidation relies on the expectation that fiscal multipliers will decrease in
the future or that economic growth will rebound significantly. However, if these
expectations do not materialise, shifting the bulk of fiscal consolidation to the
future would mean greater debt and higher debt servicing costs, making future
adjustment even more costly and prolonged.
The case for back-loading fiscal adjustment also relies on the credibility of fiscal
plans. Current governments will have to make commitments on behalf of future
ones. Yet some existing institutional setups and fiscal rules may not be strong
enough to effectively tie the hands of future elected policymakers. Furthermore,
slower progress in reforming public finances could lead to reform fatigue – the
belief that reforms are not delivering the expected results and should therefore be
abandoned. Tackling problems early on might be more costly in the short run, but
could help ensure that essential reforms are carried out.
Finally, the impact of fiscal consolidation on growth extends beyond the short
run. By restoring sound financial conditions, eliminating the risks associated with
high debt and reducing the resources needed to service the debt, consolidation
will lead to higher sustainable economic growth. As a result, its long-term benefits
will more than offset its short-term costs.
For countries that have implemented the largest adjustments, fiscal
consolidation has already begun to pay off in the form of improved financial
conditions. Within the euro area, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain have seen their
sovereign bond yields (Graph IV.3, left-hand panel) and credit defaultRestricted

spreads decline substantially over the past year. In Ireland, yields fell from a peak of
roughly 14% in mid-2011 to less than 4% at end-May 2013, and the government
has been able to return to the market by issuing bonds of various maturities.
Portugal has also regained market access recently.
The private sector has also benefited. The CDS spreads of banks and other
financial intermediaries have fallen substantially over the past year, leading to
sizeable declines in banks’ borrowing costs (Graph IV.3, centre panel). Likewise,
non-financial corporate bond yields in Italy and Spain have come down considerably
from their peaks (right-hand panel).
Certainly, the improvement in broad financial conditions reflects not only the
reduction of fiscal deficits but also euro area-wide measures such as the ECB’s threeyear longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and the announcement of the
Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) facility. Nevertheless, the long-run viability of
these programmes ultimately hinges on countries’ carrying out the necessary fiscal
adjustment. They do not substitute for fiscal consolidation, but complement it.

The quality of fiscal adjustment
The composition of fiscal adjustment is critical for reducing its adverse short-term
effects on growth, for enhancing economies’ growth potential and for ensuring the
ultimate success of large adjustments.
Existing evidence suggests that successful large consolidations generally focus
on spending cuts, especially in government consumption and transfers, rather than
on tax increases. Expenditures tend to have larger fiscal multipliers than taxes, but
lowering them frees resources so that taxes can be cut over time. They also tend to
be more difficult to reverse – so reducing them early on strengthens the credibility
of overall fiscal plans. By contrast, revenue-based consolidations generally cost less
in the short run, but lead to higher distortions and hence lower potential output in
the future, unless tax increases start from a low base. Thus, in high-tax countries,
tax-based stabilisations are less likely to lead to a lasting reduction of debt ratios.11
Levels of taxation and expenditure vary significantly across economies. Over
the period 2008–12, the United States had one of the lowest tax burdens (the sum
of direct and indirect taxes and social contributions) among the major advanced
economies: at 25% of GDP on average, it was about the same as in the early 1960s.
The country’s latest public consumption figure is also little changed since that time
– remaining at around 17%. Transfers, however, have tripled to 15%. Japan also has
relatively low taxes, at 29% of GDP. But public consumption has risen from 12% to
21%, while transfers have climbed from 2% to 15%.
Elsewhere, especially in Europe, the tax burden has increased, hand in hand
with public debt, government consumption and transfers. It currently stands at 33%
in Spain, 36% in Portugal and 37% in the United Kingdom, and has reached roughly
40–46% in France, Germany and Italy. The countries in this last group have less
room for further tax increases. While the level and composition of public spending
depends on society’s preferences, the narrower scope for raising taxes means that
several economies would have to focus on cutting spending.12
11

See eg IMF, “From stimulus to consolidation: revenue and expenditure policies in advanced and
emerging economies”, April 2010; and OECD, “Fiscal consolidation: how much, how fast, and by
what means?”, OECD Economic Policy Papers, no 1, April 2012.

12

An attempt to estimate the maximum achievable tax rates suggests that some of these countries
have little scope to raise taxes further. See M Trabandt and H Uhlig, “How do Laffer curves differ
across countries?”, NBER Working Papers, no 17862, February 2012.

50

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Different items included within aggregate expenditure and revenue may be
chosen to minimise the short-term costs of fiscal consolidation and to boost output
potential. Property and indirect sales taxes tend to be less distortionary than taxes
on labour and capital. Similarly, cuts to social transfers may hurt growth in the short
run less than do reductions in public consumption.
Governments can also improve growth prospects through early and more
incisive entitlement reform. These measures are meant to yield benefits over many
years; but by immediately strengthening fiscal sustainability and market confidence,
they may have a welcome effect on the rates of interest paid on debt.

Summing up
Public debt has reached record peacetime levels in many advanced economies. And
it continues to rise. Greater debt represents a clear vulnerability for these countries.
It leads to higher interest payments and hence higher taxes, and implies less room
for countercyclical policy. It also makes investors fret about future inflation or
default and hence demand higher risk premia. Fear of default leads to higher
borrowing costs for financial institutions that hold government securities and less
credit to firms and households.
While progress has been made towards reducing fiscal deficits, many
economies still need to increase their primary balances significantly to put their
debt on safer, downward trajectories. The success of these efforts relies crucially on
measures to curb future increases in pension and health care spending.
Unlike those of advanced economies, debt levels in most emerging markets are
stable or falling. Fiscal prudence and efforts to tackle rising age-related spending
will ensure that public finances in EMEs remain sound.

V. The road to a more resilient banking sector

The financial system is gradually recovering from the crisis, and banks are moving
forward in strengthening their balance sheets, albeit at an uneven pace across
countries. The future stability of the system depends on banks’ completing this
process. It also depends on policymakers’ completing the regulatory reform agenda
and ensuring its consistent implementation across jurisdictions.
Although bank profits have generally recovered from the low levels of the
crisis, earnings capacity is still weak and unreliable in a number of countries. In
adapting their business models to the post-crisis environment, successful banks will
be those that purge crisis-weakened assets, convincingly repair their balance sheets
and establish a reliable earnings base.
The progress to date in regulatory reform is providing the foundations for a
more resilient financial system. New standards address gaps identified in the crisis
and more general weaknesses in the financial system. Success hinges on rapid
implementation, however, and so international standard setters are paying increased
attention to progress in individual jurisdictions.
In ensuring systemic stability, the prudential framework must address the
increasingly intricate organisation of financial firms, and it must stay abreast of the
growing complexities of financial transactions and risk assessment. Policies that
simplify the organisational structure of institutions can deal with only one aspect of
the problem. A more general and effective approach sets prudential capital and
liquidity requirements that are aligned with bank risk.
Given the uncertainties of risk measurement, simple gauges of bank solvency
risk used in combination with more elaborate risk-sensitive metrics can improve risk
capture. Regulation can also improve risk assessment by setting higher standards
of quality for banks’ internal risk models. Finally, the supervisory framework
can strengthen market discipline by requiring more specific disclosures of the
characteristics and performance of those internal models.

Capital, profitability and balance sheet repair
The need to repair balance sheets has dominated banking sector developments in
recent years. Banks’ financial strength deteriorated abruptly after the prolonged
financial boom turned to a bust and the economy entered a balance sheet
recession. The disruption to financial intermediation highlighted the need to restore
bank solvency and profitability. The repair of banks’ balance sheets involves the
recognition of legacy losses, the disposal of impaired assets, and the build-up of
robust capital buffers supported by a reliable earnings capacity.
Banks have made progress in charging off bad loans, with US banks generally
leading their European peers. Uncertainty about asset quality remains a greater
concern in Europe. The forthcoming asset quality review and stress tests of
European banks will be critical in ensuring completion of the loss recognition and
balance sheet repair process, which will also require that appropriate backstops be
put in place.
At the same time, banks worldwide have improved their capital ratios at a
faster pace than set out in the Basel III phase-in arrangements. In the 12 months to
mid-2012, the average Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital of large, internationally

lending conditions continued to squeeze net interest margins. The profits of banks
in China and India increased substantially, owing to higher net interest margins and
strong loan growth. In Australia, Canada and Sweden, banks consolidated the gains
made in previous years. Profitability in Russia improved mainly because of a sharp
drop in loan loss provisions.
Profits in other jurisdictions remained lacklustre. In the euro area, sovereign
debt strains compromised asset quality, while a stagnating economy lowered
revenues. Non-performing loans increased, especially in Italy and Spain, leading to

a sharp rise in loan loss provisions. Profits in Brazil continued to slide, in line with
larger loan loss provisions and despite lower costs.
Since the onset of the crisis, banks have also been improving their regulatory
capital ratios by reducing risk-weighted assets (Graph V.2, left-hand panel) through
a combination of divestments and portfolio reallocations. The process broadly
stabilised in 2012 for most major banks. Global banks have reportedly sold about
$720 billion in assets since the start of 2007, with European banks accounting for
more than half that amount.1 The crisis in the euro area has weighed heavily:
European banks have been net sellers of assets, while banks from the United States
and other advanced economies have been net buyers. At the same time, banks
have increased their holdings of low risk-weight assets, including governmentguaranteed debt. By so doing, however, they have become more sensitive to
changes in the valuation of government debt.
Moreover, the continued reduction in risk-weighted assets through the postcrisis period suggests that impaired assets have still not been fully recognised.
Market commentary has suggested that much of this trend reflects banks’
optimisation of risk-weighted assets – the redesign of transactions in order to lower

capital requirements – rather than a genuine increase in loss absorption capacity.
Such window-dressing raises questions about the use of internal risk assessments
for the determination of regulatory capital requirements, as discussed below.
The progress in balance sheet repair has also resulted in a steady decline
in leverage, especially for those banks that have made considerable progress in
the resolution of legacy assets (Graph V.2, right-hand panel). The pressure from
regulators and investors has been a key factor in driving leverage down.
Balance sheet restructuring is necessary to improve banks’ willingness and
ability to provide new lending. By the same token, it lays the basis for a stronger
economic recovery. In fact, the cost and availability of credit are more favourable in
those jurisdictions where banks have been most successful in rebuilding capital.

Progress with global regulatory financial reform
In 2009, policymakers set an ambitious regulatory reform agenda to address
weaknesses highlighted by the financial crisis. They aimed to set the financial
sector on more robust foundations and to support sustainable economic growth
by reducing the risk of future crises.2 The agenda includes tightening the
requirements for capital and liquidity buffers for banks, improving the resolvability
of financial firms, enhancing the transparency and resilience of the infrastructure
of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, and addressing the risks posed
by shadow banking, broadly understood as credit intermediation involving entities
outside the regular banking system. With many elements of the new standards
already in place, emphasis is gradually shifting to monitoring the pace of
implementation.

mission, activities, governance and financial results”.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

55

The Basel III framework, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, is a central element of the reform agenda. It sets significantly higher
requirements for loss absorption, puts greater emphasis on a higher quality of
capital, and better captures the full scope of bank risk. Innovative aspects of the
framework include a leverage ratio, a capital overlay for systemically important
banks, a countercyclical capital buffer and standards for a liquidity coverage ratio
(LCR). The final version of the LCR was published in January 2013.
The LCR promotes the resilience of banks by ensuring that they maintain an
adequate stock of high-quality liquid assets to withstand reversals in funding
conditions. The LCR requirements are being phased in, like the new capital
adequacy requirements, to support the gradual strengthening of the banking
system and the supply of finance for economic activity. Work is progressing on
other elements, including a net stable funding ratio, the review of trading book
rules, the treatment of securitisation, and large exposures.
A globalised banking system will reap the benefits of the framework only
through its full, timely and consistent implementation across all jurisdictions. Basel
Committee members have agreed to assess both the alignment of national
regulations with the Basel III standards and the consistency of the framework’s
outcomes on banks. The Committee’s implementation monitoring programme
assesses the timeliness of adoption of Basel III; domestic regulatory consistency;
and the consistency of outcomes, including banks’ calculations of risk-weighted
assets.
Weaknesses in the resolution procedures for banks at the point of failure,
especially for those with more complex business models and international
operations, significantly increased the costs of the global crisis. Resolution schemes
that enable authorities to quickly deal with failing financial institutions would
reduce spillovers to the financial system and the exposure of taxpayers to losses.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) provided guidance with its November 2011
publication Key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions.
The implementation of the FSB guidance is at an early stage. Many countries still
need to adopt legislation to enable the efficient resolution of global systemically
important banks and other internationally active banks.
Another major area of regulatory reform focuses on financial market
infrastructure. The crisis revealed major shortcomings in the post-trade processing
of OTC derivatives, notably the inadequate reporting of transactions and an
insufficient collateralisation of bilateral counterparty exposures. Commitments to
improve standards in OTC derivatives markets have covered three principal areas.
First, the centralised clearing of standardised contracts: robust legal and regulatory
frameworks that place a central counterparty (CCP) between transacting parties will
reduce interconnectedness across the financial system. Second, mandatory reporting
of customised transactions: reporting to trade repositories of transactions not
channelled through a CCP will improve transparency in OTC markets. Third, noncentrally cleared contracts: these will be singled out and subjected to more exacting
prudential capital requirements.
In 2009, the G20 agreed to implement central clearing and electronic trading
of standardised derivatives instruments by the end of 2012. Few jurisdictions have
met this deadline, but legislative frameworks are in place in key jurisdictions, and
some progress has been made in implementing the necessary standards. Market
regulators are developing detailed rules and addressing issues of cross-border
consistency and applicability.
The reform agenda is also advancing with regard to applying oversight and
regulation to the shadow banking system, which provides financial services that
complement those of regulated banks. Reforms focused on banks may spur the

56

BIS 83rd Annual Report

migration of certain financial activities to the shadow banking sector, producing a
build-up of systemic vulnerabilities in the form of leverage and liquidity mismatches.
The FSB has provided policy recommendations and guidance for further regulatory
steps aimed at mitigating this risk. Specific areas include money market funds;
banks’ exposures to shadow banks; and measures to address risks in repurchase
agreements and securities lending.

National initiatives on bank structure regulation
Acting parallel to the international regulatory reform process, a number of
individual jurisdictions are implementing or considering initiatives on the regulation
of bank structure.
The various initiatives involve different ways of separating commercial banking
activities – deposit-taking and credit intermediation in the real economy – from the
risks inherent in investment banking (see Box V.A). The initiatives have implications
not only for the business models of universal banks but also for the effectiveness
of the global prudential framework as they interact with international regulatory
standards.
The proposals would protect commercial banking directly by shielding it from
losses incurred elsewhere. The structural separation that achieves this shielding
can itself provide an indirect form of protection for commercial banks by reducing
their complexity and, arguably, also their size. Separation also makes them easier to
manage, supervise and resolve, as well as more transparent to outside stakeholders.
In addition, structural separation may prevent the aggressive risk-taking culture of
investment bankers from infecting the more utility-like business of commercial
banking. And it can reduce moral hazard because it prevents public sector support
of protected activities (deposit guarantees and central bank lending) from indirectly
subsidising other business activities.
Structural reform initiatives are not without challenges. Defining and enforcing
the lines that separate commercial and investment banking activities is a notoriously
difficult task, and it is rendered more so by an increasingly complex financial
marketplace. Another challenge is to avoid an unintended shift of intermediation
activities outside the perimeter of consolidated supervision. An open question is how
structural reform initiatives would interact with each other. In particular, will national
differences in structural regulation complicate the supervision and resolution of
internationally active banks? Avoiding that outcome puts a premium on international
coordination in order to ensure a level playing field.
Structural banking reforms proposed at the national level differ from
international regulation, notably Basel III. The former impose constraints on specific
activities, while the latter takes banks’ business models and structure as given and
sets capital and liquidity requirements that depend on the riskiness of the
consolidated group. From this perspective, the two approaches can be seen as
complementary. Indeed, certain aspects of structural regulation – restrictions on
leverage for ring-fenced institutions – may reinforce elements of Basel III.
However, structural regulation could lead to different capital and liquidity
requirements for the core banking and trading entities within a single banking group.
Although this may be intended, it complicates regulation at the consolidated level.
Hence, there are limits to the substitutability between structural reform regulation on
the one hand, and capital and liquidity regulation on the other. Restrictions in bank
structure may support the stability of individual firms, but their benefits are less clear
for the system as a whole. Buffers that are robust to uncertainty and reflect the
complexities in risk assessment can help at the level of both the firm and the system.

Box V.A: Recent proposals for the structural reform of banking
Proposals for changing the structure of banking activities are in varying stages of implementation across jurisdictions.
They include the Volcker rule (United States); the proposals of the Vickers Report (United Kingdom); and the Liikanen
Report (European Union). The common rationale of these initiatives is to protect financial stability by shielding
core functions of commercial banks from losses related to investment banking and securities markets activities. The
initiatives vary, however, in their diagnoses and prescriptions.

The Volcker rule considers that certain trading operations are non-core activities and therefore should be kept
outside the financial sector safety net. It prohibits proprietary trading by commercial banks and prevents them from
investing in or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds, even within the same business group. A holding
company with a commercial bank subsidiary would not be permitted to also have a trading subsidiary.
The proposals in the Liikanen Report are mainly designed to address the too-big-to-fail problem. The report
sees the growing investment banking and wholesale funding activities of universal banks as the root cause of
banking system distress. It strives to prevent contagion and cross-subsidisation within banking groups by
compartmentalising risk. It recommends placing riskier trading activities in specific subsidiaries within the same
holding company, thus improving the resolvability of banking firms.
Like the Volcker rule, the Vickers Report considers core banking activity to be like a public utility – an essential but
low-return business that should be shielded from excessive risk. In contrast, however, it proposes ring-fencing of core
banking activities and moving trading and underwriting activities to separate entities within the same holding company.
 Draft legislation with similar objectives has been proposed in France and Germany.

Complexity in risk measurement and prudential rules
Policymakers are working to improve consistency in the application of the new,
more stringent capital standards. The monitoring of how the regulatory framework
is performing in practice has revealed a higher than expected range of variation in
risk weights across banks. Observers have suggested that these differences are both
systematic and persistent. The range of variation indicates that the interaction of
risk-sensitive rules with the complexity of risk modelling has created a wide scope
for inconsistency, which can seriously weaken both the credibility and the
effectiveness of the framework.
The relevance of the concern and possible remedies depend on the factors
that drive this variation in internal risk measurement outcomes. Some factors are
inherent in statistical risk modelling; others largely reflect the practicalities of risk
measurement and the specifics of implementing the prudential framework. Both
types of factors can hinder the ability of outsiders to interpret the predictions of
risk models and to understand differences between banks. The response of policy,
including the calibration of the balance between risk-based and risk-insensitive
elements of the prudential framework, should reflect the relative importance of
these factors.

Sources of variability in internal risk models: observability and bias
The calculation of regulatory capital largely depends on banks’ internal risk models.
However, the outcomes of these models can differ across banks at a given time and
within a bank across time for reasons other than changes in underlying risk. The
sources of these differences can be classified into five broad categories, which differ
in their transparency (their observability by an outsider) and in the extent to which
they distort risk measurement in ways detrimental to financial stability.
The first category consists of differences in what risk models actually measure
– that is, the risk parameter of interest. For example, in calculating the probability
of default, some banks may measure the ability of the borrower to repay in the
prevailing macroeconomic environment; others may assess the average ability to
repay over the course of the cycle. Likewise, the tail risk in trading portfolios could
be estimated under either prevailing or stressed market conditions, and the
probability of tail losses can be set at more or less stringent levels. If not clearly
flagged, such differences can produce spurious variation in the calculated size of
safety buffers across banks and reduce comparability.
The second category consists of more fundamental differences in the structure
of the risk models. Models are stylised descriptions of the real world that rely on
assumptions and statistical estimation. While some models may be inferior to
others, no single model is unambiguously better than the rest. Models based on
different assumptions can provide different risk assessments even when applied to
the same data. This does not invalidate their outcomes. On the contrary, two models
both fully supported by existing evidence can produce two different assessments of
risk, and the difference will simply reflect a legitimate diversity in views.
In the absence of a single objective gauge of risk, such diversity is desirable:
the ability of market participants to form independent judgments on risk and to
base business decisions on those judgments is a key source of market liquidity and
systemic resilience. From a financial stability perspective, imposing a single view on
risk can be counterproductive, as the market provides a mechanism to balance the
views of bulls and bears.
A third category is estimation noise. Statistical noise in the data used to
estimate risk models can produce different outcomes even for models that are

Box V.B: Statistical noise in risk estimates
Risk measurement is subject to estimation noise, which can be quite significant when estimation focuses on rare
events such as extreme losses in a securities portfolio or the default of a highly rated borrower. The exercise in this
box illustrates the potential size of estimation noise in the context of credit exposures. It shows that in some cases
noise can be comparable to the size of the underlying risk and that, while it cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced
by calibrating the model with data drawn from a longer historical period.
The exercise is deliberately stylised to ensure that statistical noise is the only source of deviation of estimated
risk from the true underlying risk. It is akin to the exercise a bank would perform to assess the default risk in a
portfolio of similar loans; it does not examine the range of risk variation across the entire credit portfolio of the
bank. It also cannot address the issue of how estimates differ across banks without further assumptions about the
data that each bank uses to form the estimate of risk.
The bank is assumed to hold a portfolio of 200 loans for a period of one year. The bank knows that the loans
are drawn from a distinct larger population, or class, of borrowers with identical characteristics, and in particular
with the same probability of default (PD).
Default risk for each loan is driven by two factors, one systematic and the other idiosyncratic, as in Vasicek
(2002). Random variations in the systematic factor affect all loans similarly and cannot be diversified away; by
contrast, the impact of the idiosyncratic factor is loan-specific and diversifiable in large portfolios. The relative
strength with which the two factors drive risk depends on the correlation of loan performance with the systematic
factor: the higher the correlation, the closer the similarities in borrower performance across loans.
There is no model uncertainty: the bank is assumed to know the underlying model of risk. But there is statistical
uncertainty because the model is estimated on the basis of the historical performance of loans of this type. The
bank observes the default rate in similar portfolios in previous years. On that basis, it estimates the one-year PD and
assigns a risk weight to the exposure according to the Basel framework’s internal ratings-based approach for credit
risk. The exercise is illustrated across the three panels of Graph V.B, in which the horizontal axis measures the sample
size, namely the length of the historical period of loan performance over which the model is calibrated.
In the left-hand panel, the shaded area shows the range of estimates of risk weights for this class of loans for
different sample sizes. The plotted estimation range excludes the most severe risk weight estimates (top 5%) and the

most benign (bottom 5%). The dashed line depicts the true underlying risk weight for the class of borrowers that has
a PD of 1% and from which the 200 loans were drawn. The blue line is the size of estimation noise relative to true risk,
calculated as the ratio of the range of the estimated risk weight to the true risk weight, expressed in per cent.
Estimation precision increases with the length of the calibration period (ie the sample size). For the shortest
sampling period, the width of the range of risk weight estimates in the left-hand panel is about four fifths of the
true risk weight of 92% for a PD = 1%. Lengthening the sample period to about 15 years produces sizeable gains in
precision; gains from further increases in sample size are smaller. The remaining two panels show noise curves for
similar exercises performed on draws of 200 loans from populations with different characteristics.
The centre panel shows the relative noise measures for separate sets of 200 loans that differ only in terms of
the PD of the populations from which they were drawn. At a given sample size, the range of estimates (and hence
the statistical noise) increases as the riskiness of the loans declines. This is because the historical performance of
higher-quality loans includes more periods with no defaults – periods that are thus not very informative. For
instance, with 20 years of historical data, the noise on loans with 1% PD (matching the riskiness of the loans in the
left-hand panel and indicated by the blue line) is about one third of the true value of the risk weight for these loans.
For the loan portfolio drawn from a population with the lower PD of 0.50% (the uppermost curve in the panel), the
noise jumps to 50% of the risk weight. These differences in noise across variations in PD narrow (again, to a
progressively lesser extent) as the estimation sample increases.
The right-hand panel shows the effect of drawing loans from populations with varying degrees of cyclical
persistence, ie the year-on-year serial correlation of the systematic factor, denoted by r (and with PD = 1%, as in the
left-hand panel). If historical samples are not fully random but are strongly influenced by the most recent cyclical
experience, they will tend to underestimate risk in good times and overestimate it in bad times; this increases
estimation noise with respect to underlying risk. At a given sample size, estimation noise rises with the correlation.
And as in the other panels, the level of noise declines with increasing sample length, but to a progressively lesser
extent. Taking again the estimates based on a 20-year history, the noise in the most persistent cycle (r = 0.90) is
almost three times higher than the noise in the absence of a cyclical effect (the blue line). This suggests that
minimum required sample sizes should be much longer in the presence of persistent cycles in credit defaults.

quite similar in structure. Depending on the underlying risk characteristics and the
size of the sample used to estimate the model, the magnitude of the range of
estimates can match the underlying risk being measured.
Variation due to estimation noise is unavoidable. While the noise can be
reduced, for instance through the use of larger samples of historical data, it cannot
be eliminated (see Box V.B). This means that the prudential framework must
account for this source of variability. Fortunately from the perspective of systemic
stability, the noise in statistical estimation is by nature unbiased: deviations across
banks and over time tend to cancel out, thus mitigating the impact on systemwide behaviour.
A fourth source of variation in outcomes stems from bankers’ incentives, which
favour optimistic views on risk and low regulatory capital. The natural entrepreneurial
proclivity for risk-taking can inject an optimistic bias in model calibration, as the
views of the risk management units may take a back seat to those of the front
office. More importantly, banks want to economise on their funding costs. While in
theory the mix between debt and equity should not affect the overall cost of
funding, in reality a number of distortions make debt cheaper. The tax deductibility
of debt costs and the funding advantages from the presence of the safety net are
cases in point. In addition, banks have specific incentives to economise on
regulatory capital. For any given level of bank capital, the lower the regulatory
capital requirement, the less likely it is that the supervisory judgment will constrain
business decisions. Moreover, a capital level higher than the regulatory minimum
projects an image of a safe and sound bank.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

61

Differences due to strategic choices by banks are unwelcome because they
undermine regulatory efforts. Unlike the effect of purely statistical factors such as
estimation noise, the effects of which cancel out across banks, management
interventions in the models skew risk assessments downwards by understating
potential loss. They arguably account, at least in part, for the secular decline in the
industry-wide ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets (Graph V.2).
Finally, variations in model outcomes can reflect supervisors’ scope for
intervention in setting specific model attributes. For instance, the supervisordetermined multiplier for estimates of market risk can range from 3 to 5.5 times the
model outcome and is not always disclosed. Similarly, weaknesses in a bank’s process
of risk measurement and management, or peculiarities in the local economic
environment, can lead supervisors to make compensatory changes in model
outcomes. Like definitional differences in models, supervisory interventions that are
not transparent can frustrate analysts’ ability to compare outcomes across banks
and over time.
The discussion above suggests that, in theory, if the contribution of each
source of variation could be identified, it should be treated separately according to
its effect on financial stability. But detecting a bias in risk measurement is quite
difficult in practice. Real-time estimates of future risks always have a strong element
of judgment, and there are limits to model validation based on the model’s
historical track record. True, the requirement that banks use the same model for
internal and regulatory purposes aims at limiting the scope for misrepresentation,
but it cannot fully address the problem of incentives. And given the absence of
objective benchmarks, peer comparison may be of limited help: market participants
tend to form similarly optimistic views of the future during a boom, only to be
collectively disappointed by the bust.

The risk sensitivity of the prudential framework
The difficulties of risk measurement raise the question of whether the prudential
framework puts too much emphasis on internal measures of risk. Many
commentators have argued that minimum prudential requirements should have a
less easily manipulated basis, namely the simple ratio of regulatory capital to total
assets – the leverage ratio – instead of the ratio of regulatory capital to riskweighted assets. Indeed, simplicity and transparency are important advantages of
the leverage ratio. Nevertheless, the issue hinges on its ability to capture the
solvency risk of banks and on how it interacts with incentives.
Risk capture is a key consideration if the prudential framework is to achieve its
objective of ensuring a minimum level of solvency for banks. In an ideal world in
which risk can be measured objectively and accurately, the minimum ratio of capital
to assets will vary across banks depending on their risk profile. In an alternative
hypothetical world in which risk measurement is impossible, the prudential
requirements will be based on a risk-insensitive metric of solvency such as the
leverage ratio. The real world is somewhere between these two ends of the
spectrum.
Common equity measured against both risk-weighted and unweighted assets,
which are proxies of the corresponding regulatory ratios, can give advance signals
of bank weakness (Graph V.3). A low ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets
(CE/RWA) is strongly associated with the likelihood that the bank’s operations, net
of any external support, will receive a credit rating equivalent to distress or default
within one year (left-hand panel). A drop in CE/RWA from 8% to 6% would increase
the likelihood of distress from less than 8% to almost 11%; a further drop of the
ratio to 4% would boost the distress likelihood to 14%. Since rating agencies’

receive a credit rating equivalent to distress or default. 2 Risk-weighted capital is the ratio of common equity to risk-weighted

assessments of distress and the capitalisation ratios differ from supervisory
definitions, these numbers can only be interpreted as being indicative.
The link between the proxy of the leverage ratio – common equity to total
(unweighted) assets (CE/TA) – and the likelihood of bank distress shows a similar
pattern (Graph V.3, centre panel). A drop in CE/TA (an increase in leverage) from 4%
to 2% raises the likelihood of distress from below 8% to almost 12%. In addition,
predictions based on the proxy leverage ratio appear more precise than those based
on the risk-weighted measure, as evidenced by their narrower confidence band.
Importantly, the two ratios provide signals that are complementary to each
other, so when used jointly they improve risk capture, as shown in the right-hand
panel of Graph V.3. In particular, the combination of low values for each ratio (a low
level of risk-weighted capital and high leverage) shows a much higher likelihood of
future distress than does the same low value for each ratio considered separately.
For instance, 14% of the banks with common equity equal to 6% of its risk-weighted
assets and 4% of its total assets would be in distress within a year’s time. This is
a higher likelihood than that signalled by either capitalisation ratio in isolation,
and it jumps to 30% for the banks with respective proxy capitalisation ratios of 4%
and 2%.
Each ratio interacts differently with bank incentives and market discipline. In
the ideal world of objective, accurate risk measures, prudential rules based on riskweighted metrics of solvency deal effectively with bankers’ incentives. In the real
world, measurement relies on judgment and is subject to estimation noise and
model error. Complexity gives rise to uncertainty and distorts the final outcome by
providing more room for regulatory arbitrage and optimistic assessments of risk. In

63

turn, this puts a premium on the ability of supervisors to detect such bias in
validating a model, and it strengthens the case for the use of risk-insensitive metrics.
That said, the leverage ratio does not address the problem of incentives
because it lumps together positions of very different risk profiles. For a given ratio,
banks seeking to minimise regulatory capital can simply reallocate their portfolios
towards riskier activities, or shrink their balance sheet without necessarily reducing
their potential losses. In order to ensure a minimum level of solvency for all banks,
risk-insensitive rules must require higher capital at all banks. Put differently, the
simplicity of the leverage ratio improves comparability in the application of
prudential rules, but at the cost of not providing information to the market about
the underlying risk profile of the bank. Simplicity in this case weakens market
discipline.

Policy responses to uncertainty in risk measurement
The policy response to the challenges posed by variability in risk model outcomes
must be multifaceted. The overarching objective is to strengthen financial stability
by supporting an adequate and credible solvency standard for banks. To fulfil that
objective, the policy response needs to seek a balance between several specific but
somewhat conflicting goals: enhance the quality of risk measurement in banks by
preserving the legitimate diversity of individual firm perspectives; narrow the scope
for regulatory arbitrage; and empower market discipline by supporting the ability
of outside stakeholders to compare the performance of banks.
The first element of a multifaceted policy response is to strengthen the risk
sensitivity of the prudential framework. Somewhat paradoxically, the incorporation
of a leverage ratio as an additional element of the framework strengthens its risk
capture. As discussed above, harnessing the complementary strengths of the two
ratios provides an effective response to the practical and theoretical shortcomings
in risk measurement. The argument for a framework that combines the two metrics
is also supported by the fact that it is difficult to manipulate one without affecting
the other, typically in the opposite direction. For example, an upward shift in
portfolio risk might leave the leverage ratio unaffected, but it should increase riskweighted assets. Conversely, investments in assets with underestimated risk, such as
highly rated tranches of collateralised debt obligations prior to the crisis, would
increase the denominator of a leverage ratio that incorporates derivatives
exposures.
A second facet of the response would be to improve the reliability of internal
risk measurement in banks through more stringent requirements for model
approval. Tighter requirements can mitigate some of the variability that arises from
statistical factors. An obvious example is a minimum length of time over which the
model must be estimated, possibly conditioned on whether the sample covers a full
credit cycle. Other standards could address the quality of the data and performance
when the model is applied to stylised portfolios supplied by the supervisor. More
demanding standards of approval also strengthen the confidence of outsiders in
model estimates.
A third facet of the policy response is to enhance market discipline by
improving outsiders’ understanding of risk weight calculations. Doing so requires
greater transparency regarding the characteristics of internal models. Greater
comparability in the disclosures that banks make about the structure and
performance of their internal models will help analysts and outside stakeholders
assess the relative strength of banks. Such comparability can be improved with
more specific information about the risk measurement technology used by the
bank, including its calibration. More importantly, greater standardisation of

64

BIS 83rd Annual Report

information allows outsiders to better compare model performance. This
information could include more detailed results of historical performance
(comparing model assessments with eventual portfolio performance) and the
assessment of the model as applied to standardised portfolios supplied by the
supervisor. Greater transparency by supervisors concerning the application of addons and multipliers to individual bank outcomes would also work in this direction.

Summing up
Ensuring the stability of an evolving financial system requires continual adaptation
by the prudential framework. In response to the crisis, the authorities have
tightened prudential rules, and banks are working to meet higher solvency
standards. The combined effect of these efforts can make banks more resilient.
Banks need to rebuild their franchise on business lines that play to their individual
strengths and deliver a steady stream of earnings. Repairing their balance sheets
through loss recognition and the build-up of capital are key to future success.
Policy responses to complexity are also important for the overall outcome.
Rules that simplify the organisational structure of banks may reduce the complexity
at the level of the firm, but their impact on system-wide risk can be ambiguous.
This is especially true if national rules take different approaches and result in
conflicting requirements for global banks.
Prudential standards that strengthen the capacity of banks to deal with risks
represent the most reliable defence against financial instability. Rules requiring
ample capital and liquidity buffers that are linked to the underlying risks are key
elements of these standards. These rules need to address the complexities of risk
measurement in a way that improves transparency and comparability in the
financial system. A key step towards that goal is harnessing the mutually reinforcing
nature of risk-sensitive and risk-insensitive metrics of solvency. Buffers that are
robust to uncertainty and reflect the complexities in risk assessment will enhance
the resilience of individual banks and of the financial system as a whole.

VI. Monetary policy at the crossroads

Monetary policy continues to be extraordinarily accommodative as central banks
have kept policy rates very low and further expanded their balance sheets. Even
though these measures have played an important role in successfully navigating
the crisis and its immediate aftermath, concerns are being raised about the
declining effectiveness of additional monetary policy actions and the negative side
effects of prolonged monetary accommodation. Central banks face several
significant challenges as they consider the merits of further accommodation,
contemplate the eventual exit and look to the nature of policy frameworks in a
more normal environment.
This chapter first reviews recent central bank actions against the backdrop of
the trend towards monetary policy activism since the start of the crisis and considers
the near-term policy challenges. It then turns to issues associated with the eventual
exit from the current policy stance and discusses the longer-term implications of
the crisis experience for monetary policy frameworks. The chapter concludes that
flexible strategies for a smooth exit and challenging adjustments – albeit not major
reforms – to pre-crisis monetary policy frameworks will be important priorities for
central banks.

Monetary policy and the crisis
Two major interrelated trends have characterised the conduct of monetary policy
over the past five years. First, policy rates in all economic areas have been cut and
kept low (Graph VI.1). Most major advanced economy central banks had by early
2009 reduced interest rates all the way to their effective lower bound, where they
still are four years later. The Federal Reserve underpinned its low interest rate policy
by adopting forward guidance linking the duration of its policy stance to
unemployment and inflation objectives. The ECB has kept rates low since early
2009. After raising rates twice in 2011, it subsequently reduced rates, most recently
to new lows. In real terms, policy rates in the major advanced economies have not
been so persistently negative since the 1970s.
In the other advanced economies and the emerging market economies, policy
rates have also trended down (Graph VI.1). While nominal rates have generally
been well above their lower bounds, real rates have also been very low, in particular
against the background of stronger economic performance and more buoyant
asset and credit markets than in the major advanced economies.
The second key monetary policy trend is the massive growth of central bank
balance sheets, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP (Graph VI.2).
Since late 2007, central bank total assets worldwide have roughly doubled to about
$20 trillion, or just over 30% of global GDP. In the emerging Asian economies,
central bank assets correspond to more than 50% of GDP, unchanged since the end
of 2007 as GDP in this region also expanded strongly over the period. And in
Switzerland, the ratio recently reached 85% of GDP as the Swiss National Bank
sharply increased its foreign reserves – to roughly $470 billion by the end of 2012
– in defence of its exchange rate floor against the euro.
Along with the expansion of balance sheets, the maturity of central bank assets
in the major advanced economies has lengthened markedly, driven by the changing

The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) aims at boosting
credit availability to the real economy. It does this, in part, by subsidising the funding

signs of success in stimulating lending but also concerns about continued
impairment in the monetary transmission mechanism. The extended scheme seeks
to increase banks’ incentives to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises.

The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) address redenomination risk
in the euro area. By providing a liquidity backstop for sovereign debt markets,
OMTs aim at ensuring the integrity of the area-wide monetary policy. The activation
of OMTs is conditional on the fulfilment of strict criteria under an appropriate
European Financial Stability Facility / European Stability Mechanism programme.
OMTs have yet to be formally activated, but their mere establishment has contained
downside tail risks in the euro area (see Chapter II).
The Bank of Japan has launched its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary
Easing programme aiming to double the size of its monetary base and the
outstanding amounts of Japanese government bonds and exchange-traded funds
and more than double the average maturity of its government bond purchases. The
programme is part of a broader effort by the Japanese government and the Bank
of Japan to overcome deflation and support sustainable growth. The plan includes
an increase in the Bank of Japan’s price stability target to 2% annual inflation, from
its goal of 1% previously; and a shift in the main operating target for money market
operations from the uncollateralised call rate to the monetary base. At the time of
this Report, according to both market- and survey-based measures, inflation
expectations in Japan have drifted upwards, but it is too early to assess the lasting
impact of the programme.
Outside the major advanced economies, the increase of central bank assets has
been mainly driven by a large-scale accumulation of foreign exchange reserves.
Many emerging Asian economies added to their foreign exchange holdings in the
wake of the crisis as they leaned against appreciation pressures on their currencies.
While the rate of accumulation has slowed down in recent years, the stock of
foreign reserve holdings in these economies is large, amounting to more than
$5 trillion at the end of 2012, or about half of the world’s total stock of foreign
reserves (Table II.1). Moreover, these economies now hold reserves in excess of
conventional metrics of reserve adequacy.

Taken together, central bank actions since the start of the crisis have played a
critical stabilising role, by first offsetting the forces of the financial collapse and
then supporting a recovery in the real economy. However, economic activity has
remained well below its pre-crisis trends in the United States, the euro area and the
United Kingdom (Graph VI.4), and unemployment rates have remained stubbornly
high, especially when compared with previous cyclical recoveries. This observation
in part explains why central banks have taken further actions over the past year,
and why even more radical ideas have been entertained, such as the adoption of
nominal GDP targeting and monetisation of fiscal deficits.
Despite having succeeded in containing the crisis, monetary policy has fallen
short of original expectations for various reasons. In this regard, it may have been
inappropriate to regard the previous trajectory of GDP as a benchmark. At least in
the countries at the centre of the financial bust, the sustainable path of GDP
has arguably been overestimated. Financial booms tend to conceal structural
misallocations of resources; these imbalances are only fully revealed in the
subsequent busts and the balance sheet recessions that accompany them (see
Chapter III). There is also ample evidence that, in the aftermath of financial crises,
the path of potential output shifts downwards. In addition, under these conditions
monetary policy is likely to be less effective than usual. In balance sheet recessions,
private sector retrenching and an impaired financial sector clog the transmission of
monetary policy measures to the real economy. In order to lift growth in a
sustainable way, appropriate repair and reform measures are necessary.

Exit strategies
In the years ahead, exiting from the extraordinarily accommodative policy stance
will raise significant challenges for central banks. They will need to strike the right
balance between the risks of exiting prematurely and the risks associated with
delaying exit further. While the former are well understood, it is important not to
be complacent about the latter just because they have not yet materialised. And
central banks will need to ensure that exit proceeds as smoothly as possible.
The timing and pace of exiting will naturally depend on the individual
circumstances in each of the major advanced economies. Evidence of some
strengthening of the recoveries earlier this year led markets to expect a somewhat

period. The immediate response was a sharp increase in yield curves not just in the
United States but around the world.3
To be sure, much has changed since 1994. But considerations cut both ways.
On the one hand, central banks are now much more transparent about their policy
intentions and have gained considerable experience in managing expectations. On
the other hand, the context is much more complex. Exit now requires a sequencing
of both interest rate increases and the unwinding of balance sheet policies.
In addition, each exit will have to be engineered in an environment of high
levels of debt, much of which has been issued at record low interest rates. Open
questions remain about how well markets will react to a change in course of
monetary policy, not least as central banks have taken on such a large role in key
markets. In some cases, for instance, central banks are in effect perceived as the
marginal buyer of longer-term bonds; in others, they have provided an ample
liquidity backstop and in effect become core intermediaries in interbank markets.
These considerations highlight the possibility that disruptive market dynamics
could even materialise as soon as central banks signal that an exit is imminent. The
risk that exit will be delayed to avoid such disruptions is likely to rise over time, as
the situation becomes more entrenched.
This also puts a premium on financial institutions having the capacity to bear
interest rate risk. Financial market innovations over time have improved the ability
of investors to hedge against interest rate risks. In addition, current efforts in stresstesting balance sheets to a sharp rise in yield curves are important to strengthen
readiness. That said, there may be limits to investors’ ability to hedge effectively if
the transition to higher rates turns out to be particularly abrupt and bumpy. In this
situation, counterparty risks are also likely to emerge, as aggregate exposures to
interest rate risk cannot be eliminated by such private sector practices. And, with
banks holding significant portfolios of long-dated fixed income assets, a sharp rise
in interest rates could also raise the risk of financial system stress.
The initiation and subsequent pace of exiting by central banks in the major
advanced economies will also have consequences for small advanced as well as
emerging market economies. To the extent that the exit in each economy is well
timed and smooth, against the backdrop of solid recovery that puts the global
economy on a path to balanced and sustainable growth, the outcome would be
positive for all. In contrast, an outsize increase in interest rates could lead to volatile
capital flows and exchange rates, with corresponding adverse implications for
global macroeconomic and financial stability. This suggests that those economies
likely to be affected would benefit from strengthening their capital buffers, reducing
financial imbalances and increasing the capacity of their policy frameworks to
absorb volatility.
Central banks also face various political economy challenges as they consider
exiting. History has shown that monetary policy decisions are best when insulated
from short-term political expediency considerations; hence the importance of
operational autonomy. This applies with particular force in extreme conditions such
as those prevailing today. On balance, political economy pressures could make exit
harder and work towards delaying it.
There are several reasons for this. First, indebted sectors, be they households,
non-financial firms or, indeed, governments, will not welcome an increase in interest
rates. To be sure, there is nothing new in this. But with interest rates having been
extraordinarily low for so long, the high levels of debt together with the special
lending schemes in place are likely to strengthen indebted sectors’ reaction,

3

BIS 83rd Annual Report

especially if their expectations and patterns of behaviour have become accustomed
to this unusual environment. For instance, it is easy to imagine tensions arising
between central banks trying to exit and debt management offices seeking to keep
servicing costs low.
Second, central banks’ finances could easily come under strain, raising
questions about their use of public money, reducing government revenues and
possibly even undermining the institutions’ financial independence. The public’s
tolerance for central bank losses may be quite low.
Finally, there may be broader reputational considerations at play. For example,
where central banks pay interest on reserves, unless exit is accompanied by a rise in
unremunerated reserve requirements, the associated higher transfers to the banks
may raise eyebrows among the public and take on a political dimension, particularly
if they occur at a time of fiscal consolidation.
All this puts a premium on careful preparation and advance communication
and requires that central banks’ anti-inflation credentials remain intact. Retaining
the flexibility and wherewithal to exit is critical to avoid being overtaken by markets.

The road ahead
While central banks face daunting challenges in the near term and in the eventual
exit, they also have to keep an eye on the road ahead. What lessons should be
drawn from the crisis for central banks’ monetary policy frameworks? Some of these
lessons pertain to policy instruments and market operations; others to the more
strategic aspects of the frameworks.
In response to the crisis, central banks have widened the range of tools and
altered their market operations in order to address sometimes extreme conditions.
Should these tools and practices become a permanent feature of the new
frameworks?
Some of the issues are rather technical, although they may have significant
implications for market functioning. One example is the payment of interest on
reserves. This common practice was not available to the Federal Reserve before the
crisis and is likely to be retained, as it improves the ability of the central bank to
control short-term interest rates. A second, more delicate, point concerns the range
of acceptable collateral. This was considerably broadened in crisis-hit countries and
is unlikely to be narrowed considerably going forward. That said, central bank
choices in this domain will need to balance various considerations, including the
availability of high-quality collateral, regulatory reforms and views concerning the
appropriate role of central bank liquidity in normal and turbulent times. A third
point is what short-term policy rate to target, for example a collateralised or
uncollateralised interest rate. This, again, is likely to depend on country-specific
circumstances, as it has in the past.
A more general issue is whether central banks should resume operating in the
markets so as to influence only a short-term rate. This would mean shelving
attempts to influence broader financial conditions more directly through, for
instance, large-scale asset purchases or special lending schemes. If so, the shortterm policy rate and expectations about its future path would again become the
mechanism to steer monetary conditions.
While it might be tempting to opt for a broader set of tools, there are good
reasons to return to a narrower one. First, while central banks have direct control
over the short-term rate, their ability to influence other asset prices, such as longterm government bond yields, can only be assessed within the context of the
consolidated government sector balance sheet: what the debt management office

BIS 83rd Annual Report

73

does, for example, matters too. Second, central bank balance sheet measures can
easily blur the distinction between monetary and fiscal policies. Third, these
measures can also put the central bank’s financial strength at risk. All this raises
tricky issues concerning coordination with the government and operational
autonomy. For these reasons, such tools are best considered suitable for exceptional
circumstances only.
Turning to the more strategic aspects of monetary policy, the crisis has not
discredited the core elements of pre-crisis frameworks: price stability orientation
and independence in central bank decision-making. These features have been
essential to achieving low and stable inflation in advanced and emerging market
economies alike over past decades and have proved instrumental in anchoring
inflation expectations.
However, pre-crisis monetary policy frameworks did not ensure lasting financial
and economic stability. In an environment of low and stable inflation, financial
imbalances ushered in the most severe crisis since the Great Depression. This
experience suggests that there are gains from integrating financial stability
considerations more systematically into the conduct of monetary policy, particularly
in view of the tendency of economies to generate long-lasting financial booms
followed by busts.
Regulatory reform will surely play an important role in mitigating such risks,
but it is not sufficient. Significant progress has already been made in the regulatory
area (see Chapter V), especially with respect to macroprudential frameworks and
tools. These measures will undoubtedly make the financial system more resilient
and better able to withstand financial busts. That said, their effectiveness in
restraining financial booms is less clear. And regulatory measures can only go so
far: some parts of the financial system are difficult to regulate, and over time these
measures may lose some of their effectiveness owing to regulatory arbitrage. In the
light of these considerations, monetary policy has an important complementary
role to play, as the policy rate represents the universal price of leverage in a given
currency that cannot be bypassed so easily.
Integrating such financial stability considerations into monetary policy
frameworks raises serious analytical challenges. The pre-crisis workhorse
macroeconomic models ignored the possibility of financial booms and busts and
assigned no meaningful role to the financial sector. Moreover, financial stability
analysis at central banks hardly informed monetary policy decisions. Since the crisis,
central banks have redoubled efforts to address these deficiencies. Progress has
been made with respect to model design, the range of available tools and ways of
incorporating their insights into policymaking. The Central Bank of Norway, for
example, has recently amended its benchmark policy model to capture the notion
that interest rates that are too low for too long can create distortions over time.
Even so, the road ahead is still a long one.
These efforts should help inform the adoption of a more symmetrical approach
to financial booms and busts than in the past. Over the past 10 to 15 years, central
banks appear to have responded asymmetrically to financial stability concerns. In
advanced economies, for example, policy rates were slashed aggressively in
response to financial headwinds (the LTCM crisis, the bursting of the dotcom bubble
and the recent international credit and sovereign financial crisis) but subsequently
raised only hesitantly and gradually; this is sometimes referred to as “financial
dominance”.4

See H Hannoun, “Monetary policy in the crisis: testing the limits of monetary policy”, speech at the
47th SEACEN Governors’ Conference, Seoul, Korea, 13–14 February 2012.
BIS 83rd Annual Report

A more symmetrical approach would mean tightening more strongly in booms
and easing less aggressively, and less persistently, in busts. Such an approach could
help mitigate the risk of a renewed build-up of financial imbalances. In practice,
this includes paying more attention to financial stability concerns and extending
policy horizons to take account of the fact that the build-up of financial imbalances
takes a long time to unfold, often spanning more than one business cycle upswing,
as traditionally measured.
The historical interpretation of the past 10 to 15 years is consistent with
evidence from a simple Taylor rule that links policy rates in a mechanical way to
inflation and the output gap. Estimates suggest that monetary policy in advanced
economies has been systematically too accommodative for most of the period
since the early 2000s (Graph VI.6, left-hand panel). To be sure, there is considerable
uncertainty about a number of inputs in this simple benchmark, not least the
longer-term equilibrium level of interest rates. Even so, the benchmark ignores the
influence of forward guidance or balance sheet policies, which would make the
policy at the current juncture considerably more accommodative. And this
evaluation is further supported by signs of rapid credit and property price increases
in several economies less affected by the crisis, as highlighted in central banks’ own
assessments of macroeconomic conditions and confirmed by the activation of
macroprudential measures.
These uneven developments across countries shine the spotlight on yet
another aspect of policy frameworks: the need for a better appreciation of global
monetary policy spillovers in the increasingly globalised world. The recent crisis has
underscored their importance. Accommodative monetary conditions played a role
in boosting vulnerabilities globally. Unusually low policy rates in the major advanced
economies were transmitted to the rest of the world in part by the resistance of
emerging market economies to exchange rate appreciation and capital flow
pressures. Graph VI.6 (right-hand panel) shows that many emerging market

economies kept interest rates lower than would have been suggested by domestic
macroeconomic conditions (ie as implied by a simple Taylor rule). These economies
also intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets. Taken together, this policy
response amplified the global credit and asset price boom prior to the crisis.
The recent build-up of financial imbalances in a number of emerging market
and small advanced economies indicates that this mechanism may be at work
again. This does not necessarily mean that central banks need to coordinate their
policies more closely than in the past. Rather, it suggests that central banks, at a
minimum, may benefit from putting more weight on the global side effects and
feedbacks that arise from their individual monetary policy decisions. This is in each
central bank’s own interest, especially if the spillovers have the potential to foster
financial instability that ends in crisis, with significant global repercussions that
swing back to the originating countries.

Summing up
Central banks have become increasingly overburdened, as they have been relied on
heavily for years to stimulate economies through very accommodative monetary
policies. There are growing concerns at this juncture about the effectiveness of
these policies and their negative side effects. Monetary accommodation can only
be as effective as the balance sheet, fiscal and structural policies that accompany it.
The eventual exit from current policies also presents first-order challenges,
some purely technical and others of a more political economy nature. Tools to
manage the exit are in place and have been tested to some extent. But central banks
are mindful of the fact that the size and scope of the exit will be unprecedented.
This magnifies the uncertainties involved and the risk that it will not be smooth.
Moreover, the longer the current accommodative conditions persist, the bigger
the exit challenges become. This puts central banks in a very uncomfortable
position and highlights the need to address the economies’ underlying balance
sheet and structural problems without delay.
The crisis has also reinforced the view that price stability is not enough. That
said, efforts to integrate financial stability concerns into monetary policy
frameworks are still a challenging work in progress. And at the same time, in a
more globalised world, central banks will increasingly need to factor in global policy
spillovers.

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The mission of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is to serve central banks
in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster international
cooperation in those areas and to act as a bank for central banks.
In the light of the Bank’s mission, this chapter reviews the activities of the BIS,
and of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2012/13; describes the institutional
framework that supports the work of those groups; and presents the year’s financial
results.
In broad outline, the BIS pursues its mission by:
•
promoting discussion and facilitating collaboration among central banks;
•
supporting dialogue with other authorities that are responsible for promoting
financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial
supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The BIS promotes international cooperation among monetary authorities and
financial supervisory officials through its meetings programmes and through the
Basel Process – hosting international committees and standard-setting bodies and
facilitating their interaction in an efficient and cost-effective way.
In particular, the BIS hosts the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The BIS supports
the FSB’s objectives, which are to coordinate at the international level the work of
national authorities and international standard setters to strengthen the financial
sector; and to work with international institutions to address threats to global
financial stability.
The BIS research and statistics function helps meet the needs of monetary and
supervisory authorities for data and policy insight.
The BIS banking function provides prime counterparty, agent and trustee
services appropriate to the BIS mission.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international cooperation among financial and monetary officials
in two major ways:
•
through hosting bimonthly and other meetings of central bank officials; and
•
through the Basel Process, which facilitates cooperation among the committees
and standard-setting bodies hosted by the BIS in Basel.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
At bimonthly meetings, normally held in Basel, Governors and other senior officials
of BIS member central banks discuss current developments and the outlook for the
world economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of special and topical interest to central banks. In addition to the
bimonthly meetings, the Bank regularly hosts gatherings that variously include
public and private sector representatives and the academic community.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

83

The two principal bimonthly meetings are the Global Economy Meeting and
the All Governors’ Meeting.

Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors of 30 BIS member
central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies that account
for about four fifths of global GDP. The Governors of another 19 central banks
attend the GEM as observers.1 The GEM has two main roles: (i) monitoring
and assessing developments, risks and opportunities in the world economy and
the global financial system; and (ii) providing guidance to three Basel-based
central bank committees – the Committee on the Global Financial System,
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Markets Committee.
The GEM also receives reports from the chairs of those committees and decides
on publication.
As the Global Economy Meeting is quite large, it is supported by an informal
group called the Economic Consultative Committee (ECC). Limited to 18 participants,
the ECC includes all BIS Board member Governors, the central bank Governors from
India and Brazil, and the BIS General Manager. The ECC assembles proposals for
consideration by the GEM. In addition, the ECC Chairman initiates recommendations
to the GEM on the appointment of chairs of the three central bank committees
mentioned above and on the composition and organisation of those committees.

All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the BIS’s 60 member central
banks and is chaired by the BIS Chairman. It convenes to discuss selected topics of
general interest to its members. In 2012/13, the topics discussed were:
•
Reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets: progress and open issues
•
Collateral scarcity: assessment and implications
•
How big and how global should the financial system be?
Making the European monetary union (presentation by guest speaker Harold James)
•
•
Structural bank regulation initiatives: approaches and implications
Two other groups – the Central Bank Governance Group, which also meets
during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank
Statistics – have a broader membership than the GEM, and hence, by agreement
with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’ Meeting is responsible for
overseeing their work.

Other regular consultations
During the bimonthly meetings, Governors of central banks in (i) major emerging
market economies and (ii) small open economies gather to discuss themes of
special relevance to their economies.

84

The members of the GEM are the central bank Governors of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the President of
the European Central Bank and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The
Governors attending as observers are from Algeria, Austria, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the
Philippines, Portugal, Romania and the United Arab Emirates.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The Bank hosts regular meetings of the Group of Central Bank Governors and
Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the work of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision. In its January 2013 meeting, the GHOS unanimously endorsed
the Basel Committee’s proposed revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), a
key element of the Basel regulatory framework; and it reaffirmed its support of the
other component of the global liquidity regime, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR),
while directing the Committee to review it over the next two years. The GHOS
endorsed the Committee’s medium-term work agenda – assessing the comparability
of model-based internal risk weightings; and considering the appropriate balance
to be struck among simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity in reforming the
regulatory framework. It also endorsed a new charter for the Committee to improve
understanding of the Committee’s activities and decision-making processes.
The Bank regularly arranges informal discussions among public and private
sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting a sound
and well functioning international financial system. In addition, for senior central
bank officials, the Bank organises various meetings to which other financial
authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community are invited to
contribute. These meetings include:
•
the annual meetings of the working parties on monetary policy, held in Basel
but also hosted at a regional level by a number of central banks in Asia, central
and eastern Europe, and Latin America;
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in various
regions of the world for Governors and Deputy Governors and heads of
supervisory authorities.
In January 2013, the BIS hosted a seminar on sovereign risk, inviting Governors
from shareholding banks to hear presentations from policymakers, practitioners
and academics. Also scheduled for 2013 are meetings of Governors and senior
officials from Africa and other regions and of Governors from Latin America and
the Caribbean.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the facilitative role of the BIS in hosting and supporting
the work of the international secretariats engaged in standard setting and the
pursuit of financial stability. A key example of the Basel Process is the support the
BIS provides to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates the work of
national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and whose
work programme has been endorsed by the G20 heads of state and government.
Another aspect of the Basel Process is the mandate given by the BIS to its own
Financial Stability Institute (FSI) to assist financial sector supervisory authorities
worldwide in strengthening oversight of their financial systems.

Features of the Basel Process
The Basel Process is based on four key features: (i) the synergies of co-location;
(ii) flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; (iii) support from the
economic research expertise and banking experience of the BIS; and (iv) the
dissemination of work.
Synergies. The BIS hosts the secretariats of nine groups, including the FSB, that
contribute to the pursuit of financial stability. These groups have their own
governance arrangements and reporting lines.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

85

Various groupings of central banks and supervisory authorities set the agendas
of the following six groups:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global
regulatory standards for banks and addresses supervision at the level of
individual institutions and as it relates to macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and analyses
the broad issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS): analyses and sets
standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: examines the functioning of financial markets;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the design and
operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses statistical
issues of concern to central banks, including those relating to economic,
monetary and financial stability.
The remaining three groups hosted at the BIS are:
•
the FSB;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI); and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).
The physical proximity of these nine groups at the BIS creates synergies that,
regardless of the variation in governance arrangements, produce a broad and fruitful
exchange of ideas. In addition, by reducing each group’s costs of operation through
economies of scale, the Basel Process supports a more efficient use of public funds.
Flexibility. The limited size of these groups leads to flexibility and openness in the
exchange of information, thereby enhancing the coordination of their work on
financial stability issues and preventing overlaps and gaps in their work
programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger than their limited size
would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of the international
community of central bankers, financial regulators and supervisors, and other
international and national public authorities.
Supportive BIS expertise and experience. The work of the Basel-based committees is
informed by the BIS’s economic research and by its banking experience. The latter
is derived from the BIS Banking Department’s working relationships with market
participants and its implementation of regulatory standards and financial controls
for the conduct of its banking operations.
Dissemination. The FSI facilitates the dissemination of the standard-setting bodies’
work to central banks and financial sector supervisory and regulatory agencies.

Activities of BIS-hosted groups in 2012/13
The following pages review the year’s principal activities of the nine groups hosted
at the BIS.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates the work of national financial
authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops policies to
enhance global financial stability. It closely monitors whether these policies are
implemented fully and consistently.

86

BIS 83rd Annual Report

More specifically, under its mandate from the G20, the FSB:
•
assesses vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and identifies and
reviews the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to address
them, including the outcomes of those actions;
•
promotes coordination and information exchange among authorities
responsible for financial stability;
•
monitors and advises on market developments and their implications for
regulatory policy;
•
monitors and advises on best practice in meeting regulatory standards;
•
undertakes joint strategic reviews of the international standard-setting bodies’
policy development work to ensure that it is timely, coordinated and focused
on priorities and that it addresses gaps;
•
supports the establishment of supervisory colleges and sets guidelines for them;
•
supports contingency planning for cross-border crisis management, particularly
with respect to systemically important firms;
•
collaborates with the IMF to conduct early warning exercises; and
•
promotes member jurisdictions’ implementation of internationally agreed
commitments, standards and policy recommendations through monitoring,
peer review and disclosure.
The membership of the FSB consists of senior officials from finance ministries,
central banks, and financial regulators and supervisors of 24 countries and
territories;2 senior officials from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European
Commission; and high-level representatives of international financial institutions
and international standard-setting bodies and central bank groups.3
The FSB, chaired by Mark Carney,4 operates through Plenary meetings of its
membership; the Plenary names the Chair of the FSB and appoints a Steering
Committee. The FSB also has four Standing Committees on the following subjects:
•
Assessment of Vulnerabilities – chaired by Agustín Carstens, Governor of the
Bank of Mexico, who succeeded Jaime Caruana, General Manager of the BIS, as
Chair on 31 March 2013;
•
Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation – chaired by Daniel Tarullo, member of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, who succeeded Adair Turner,
Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority, as Chair on 31 March 2013;
•
Standards Implementation – chaired by Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, who succeeded Tiff Macklem, Senior Deputy
Governor of the Bank of Canada, as Chair on 31 March 2013; and
•
Budget and Resources – established in November 2012 and chaired by Jens
Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
The Plenary has also established various working groups, which cover a number
of technical areas. The work of the FSB is supported by a Secretariat, located at the
BIS, comprising a staff of 26.
Plenary meetings were held in May and October 2012 and in January 2013. As
detailed below, the FSB was active in a wide range of areas during the year, and

several policy initiatives approved at the May Plenary meeting were endorsed at
the June 2012 Los Cabos Summit of the G20 Leaders.

Early warning exercises
As part of its regular activities, the FSB conducted two early warning exercises, in
April and October, in collaboration with the IMF. The IMF’s International Monetary
and Financial Committee and the G20 finance ministers and central bank Governors
received a confidential presentation of results and recommended actions; the FSB
focused on vulnerabilities and regulatory challenges in the financial sector, and the
IMF covered macroeconomic and macrofinancial vulnerabilities.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs)
During 2012, national authorities and international organisations made further
progress in implementing the FSB’s framework to address the systemic and moral
hazard risks associated with SIFIs, which was endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their
2010 Seoul Summit. The framework contains three key elements:
•
a resolution framework to ensure that all financial institutions can be quickly
resolved without destabilising the financial system and exposing the taxpayer
to risk of loss;
•
higher loss absorbency capacity to reflect the greater risks to the global
financial system; and
•
more intensive supervisory oversight for financial institutions that may pose
systemic risks.
Resolution of SIFIs. Since the FSB published the Key attributes of effective resolution
regimes for financial institutions in November 2011 as a new international
standard, many jurisdictions have begun reforms to align their resolution regimes
with it. The Key attributes standard is designed to apply to all types of financial
institutions that may be systemically significant if they fail, including not only
banks but also insurers, financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and investment
firms. The FSB is working with sectoral standard setters to develop guidance on
how to apply the Key attributes standard to these other types of financial
institutions.
During 2012, the FSB began to develop an assessment methodology for the
Key attributes standard to assist jurisdictions with their implementation and for use
both in FSB peer reviews and in IMF and World Bank assessments of national
resolution regimes.
The FSB is also preparing guidance on three key aspects of recovery
and resolution planning: (i) developing the stress scenarios and triggers for
recovery actions that should be used in recovery plans for global SIFIs (G-SIFIs);
(ii) developing resolution strategies and associated operational resolution plans
tailored to different group structures; and (iii) identifying the critical functions that
would need to remain in operation during resolution to maintain systemic stability.
Draft guidance was published for consultation in October 2012 and will be finalised
in the first half of 2013.
Higher loss absorbency. In November 2012, the FSB published the first annual
update to its list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), using end-2011
data. The update added two banks and removed three from the initial list of
29 G-SIBs, published in November 2011, thus reducing the total number to 28.

88

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The FSB will continue annual November updates of the list, which is based on a
methodology developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).
Beginning with the 2012 update, the list assigns each bank to one of the five
levels of required additional loss absorbency (additional common equity) for
G-SIBs. The levels range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted assets, according to the
level of systemic risk posed by the bank. Starting from 2016, the additional loss
absorbency will be phased in over three years, initially for those banks in the
November 2014 list.5
More intensive supervisory oversight. In November 2012, the FSB released its third
progress report on intensifying supervisory oversight. It concluded that, to make
supervision more proactive and effective, further steps are needed, including
commitments by governments to strengthen the official mandates, resources and
independence of supervisors in line with standard setters’ stated core principles.
Extending the framework. The FSB and standard-setting bodies continue to
extend the SIFI framework to additional types of systemically important financial
institutions. In 2012, the FSB and the BCBS finalised a principles-based framework
for addressing domestic SIBs (D-SIBs), and national authorities will begin to
apply requirements to these institutions starting from 2016. The IAIS has issued
for public consultation its proposed assessment methodology for identifying
global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), as well as policy measures to be
applied to identified G-SIIs. An initial designation of G-SIIs is expected in the
first half of 2013. The FSB, in consultation with the International Organization
of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), has also been working on the assessment
methodology for non-bank, non-insurance G-SIFIs, and a consultation paper is
expected in 2013.

Improving the OTC and commodity derivatives markets
The G20 has made commitments to improve the functioning, transparency and
oversight of the OTC derivatives market by means of increased standardisation,
central clearing, organised platform trading and reporting of all trades to trade
repositories. The FSB published progress reports on member jurisdictions’
implementation of these agreed reforms in June and October 2012 and April 2013;
and it continues to press member jurisdictions to complete the reforms, which were
due by end-2012, and to ensure the consistency of implementation across
jurisdictions. The FSB’s OTC Derivatives Coordination Group, composed of the chairs
of the BCBS, CGFS, CPSS, FSB and IOSCO, works to improve the coordination and
consistency of these bodies’ workstreams that have a bearing on OTC derivatives
markets.

Strengthening the oversight and regulation of shadow banking
The shadow banking system – credit intermediation involving entities and activities
outside the regulated banking system – can be a source of systemic risk both
directly and through its interconnectedness with the regular banking system.
Shadow banking can also create opportunities for arbitrage that might undermine
stricter bank regulation and lead to a build-up of additional leverage and risks in
the financial system as a whole.

In November 2012, the FSB published for consultation an initial set of detailed
policy recommendations to mitigate the potential systemic risks associated with
shadow banking. The recommendations covered the following objectives:
•
mitigate spillovers between the regular banking system and the shadow
banking system;
•
reduce the susceptibility of money market funds to runs;
•
assess and mitigate systemic risks posed by other shadow banking entities;
•
assess and align the incentives associated with securitisation; and
•
dampen risks and procyclical incentives associated with securities lending
and repurchase agreements that may exacerbate funding strains in times of
runs.
The FSB will deliver a refined set of recommendations to the September 2013
G20 Summit.
In November 2012, the FSB published its second annual monitoring report on
the global shadow banking system, expanding its coverage to include all FSB
member jurisdictions. The report assesses risks from the shadow banking system,
including innovations and changes that could lead to growing systemic risks and
regulatory arbitrage.

Credit ratings
In November 2012, the FSB published a roadmap for work by standard setters and
national authorities to accelerate progress in implementing its Principles for
reducing reliance on credit rating agency ratings, published in October 2010. The
goal is twofold: to eliminate mechanistic market reliance on ratings, which is a
cause of herding and cliff effects that can amplify procyclicality and cause systemic
disruption; and to create incentives for market participants to improve their
independent credit risk assessment and due diligence. As part of the roadmap, the
FSB has launched a peer review, to be completed in early 2014, of national
authorities’ actions to achieve these goals.

Addressing data gaps
The global financial crisis highlighted major gaps in information on the large,
globally active financial institutions that play a key role in the financial system. The
FSB is continuing its project to develop a common data template for G-SIBs that
will detail their exposures and funding dependencies by counterparty as well as by
market, sector and instrument. Such data would strengthen the information
available to authorities on linkages among G-SIBs. Phase 1 of the project, which
began in March 2013, will provide national supervisory authorities for G-SIBs
and other large banks with common access to improved data on bilateral and
aggregate credit exposures through a central hub located at the BIS (see also the
discussion of international statistical initiatives in the “Research and statistics”
section below). Consideration will be given to progressively expanding the framework
with improved data on bilateral funding dependencies (Phase 2) and consolidated
balance sheets (Phase 3).

Advancing transparency through the legal entity identifier
At their November 2011 Cannes Summit, the G20 Leaders asked the FSB to
recommend a system for uniquely identifying parties to financial transactions
worldwide. The FSB recommendations for such a global “legal entity identifier” (LEI)
take a global federated approach drawing on local infrastructure and expertise

90

BIS 83rd Annual Report

and were endorsed by the G20 Leaders at their Los Cabos Summit in June 2012.
The FSB developed the charter for a Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) to
oversee the global LEI system. In January 2013, the ROC, comprising approximately
50 regulatory authorities from around the globe, took over leadership of the
initiative. The FSB provides a secretariat and administrative support for the ROC.
In cooperation with private sector experts, the ROC is preparing for the
establishment of a Central Operating Unit along with Local Operating Units; the
latter will act as the primary interface with registrants in the federated global LEI
system.

Strengthening accounting standards
The G20 and FSB support the development of a single set of high-quality global
accounting standards. To that end, the FSB continues to encourage the International
Accounting Standards Board and the United States’ Financial Accounting Standards
Board to complete their convergence project, and it is monitoring their progress in
implementing specific G20 and FSB accounting recommendations. The two
accounting boards made further progress in 2012, but work remains ongoing in
some key areas of convergence, notably on accounting for financial instruments
and insurance contracts, on which the two standard setters will undertake further
consultation in 2013.

Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF)
In May 2012, the FSB encouraged the formation of the EDTF, a private sector
initiative to enhance risk disclosure practices by major banks. The EDTF published
its principles and recommendations for such disclosures in October 2012, together
with examples of good practice. The FSB views the EDTF report as a valuable step
towards improving the quality of risk disclosures.

Monitoring implementation and strengthening adherence to
international standards
The FSB’s Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring (CFIM),
endorsed by G20 Leaders at their 2011 Cannes Summit, highlights areas in which
implementation of reforms is particularly important for global financial stability and
ensures that these are subject to more intensive monitoring and detailed reporting.
Current priority areas are the Basel II/2.5/III framework; the OTC derivatives market;
compensation practices; policy measures for G-SIFIs; resolution frameworks; and
shadow banking. Detailed reporting of progress in implementation has already
begun in several of these areas, and the FSB will extend and deepen monitoring in
2013. In the area of compensation, the FSB has launched a dedicated Bilateral
Complaint Handling Process, a mechanism by which national supervisors from the
FSB member jurisdictions can work together to address firms’ level playing field
concerns.
The FSB’s most intensive monitoring mechanism is the peer review programme,
undertaken through its Standing Committee on Standards Implementation, to
evaluate member jurisdictions’ adoption of international financial standards and
FSB policies. In 2012/13, the FSB completed thematic peer reviews of resolution
regimes and financial institutions’ risk governance as well as a country peer review
of South Africa.
In November 2012, the FSB published a status update on its initiative to
promote jurisdictions’ adherence to standards for international supervisory and

BIS 83rd Annual Report

91

regulatory cooperation and information exchange. The update covers all
jurisdictions evaluated under the initiative, including those identified as noncooperative.

Mortgage underwriting principles
In April 2012, the FSB published Principles for sound residential mortgage
underwriting practices. The principles provide a framework within which jurisdictions
should define minimum acceptable underwriting standards. The goal is to limit the
risks that mortgage markets pose to financial stability and to better safeguard
borrowers and investors. Following up on this work, the FSB has planned a
workshop for June 2013 regarding commercial real estate underwriting and its
regulation and supervision across the FSB membership.

Impact of regulatory reforms on emerging market and
developing economies (EMDEs)
In June 2012, the FSB published a study identifying potential unintended consequences
for EMDEs stemming from internationally agreed regulatory reforms. As requested
by the G20, and in consultation with standard-setting bodies and international
financial institutions, the FSB has established a follow-up process for continued
monitoring, analysis and reporting of material unintended consequences and
measures taken to address them. The FSB also continues to monitor progress made
in implementing the recommendations of the October 2011 FSB-IMF-World Bank
report on financial stability issues of particular interest to EMDEs.

Financial regulatory factors affecting the availability of long-term finance
In February 2013, the FSB published an assessment of the effect of the G20 financial
reform programme on the availability of long-term investment finance. The
assessment is part of a broader study of long-term finance by international
organisations for the G20. The FSB assessment concluded that, while there may be
short-term adjustment effects, the most important contribution of the financial
reform programme to long-term investment finance is to rebuild confidence and
resilience in the global financial system. Nevertheless, the FSB will continue to
monitor the possible effects of regulatory reforms on the supply of long-term
financing.

Regional consultative groups
To facilitate its interaction with a wider group of countries, the FSB has established
six regional consultative groups that bring together FSB members with 65 other
jurisdictions in the Americas, Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. The regional
groups, which typically meet twice a year, discuss vulnerabilities affecting regional
and global financial systems and the financial stability initiatives of the FSB and
member jurisdictions. Several of the regional bodies have established working
groups to study issues relevant to their region and to provide input to the FSB.

FSB capacity, resources and governance
The FSB is taking steps to strengthen its capacity, resources and governance in line
with recommendations of a high-level working group endorsed by G20 Leaders at

92

BIS 83rd Annual Report

their 2012 Los Cabos Summit. G20 Leaders also endorsed a revised FSB Charter to
reinforce certain elements of the FSB mandate. The FSB was established as an
association under Swiss law in January 2013 in order to place it on an enduring
organisational footing that includes legal personality and greater financial
autonomy while still maintaining strong links with the BIS. The FSB will continue to
be hosted by the BIS in Basel, and the two organisations have entered into an
agreement that formalises the provision of financial and other resources for the FSB
secretariat.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seeks to enhance supervisory
cooperation and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It supports
supervisors by providing a forum for exchanging information on national
supervisory arrangements, improving the effectiveness of techniques for supervising
international banks and setting minimum supervisory standards.
The Committee, which generally meets four times a year, consists of senior
representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks responsible for
banking supervision or financial stability issues in the Committee’s member
countries. The Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is the Basel
Committee’s governing body and consists of central bank Governors and noncentral bank heads of supervision from member countries.

Key initiatives
The Basel III framework, a set of global regulatory standards on bank capital
adequacy and liquidity that promote a more resilient banking sector, began to
come into effect in many jurisdictions at the start of 2013. All Basel Committee
member countries have introduced, or are in the process of introducing, the capital
adequacy requirements; and the Committee has finalised the liquidity coverage
ratio, the first ever global liquidity standard for banks. The Committee continues to
develop global regulatory and supervisory standards and to monitor its members’
implementation of the Basel framework.

Liquidity
The Committee published its revised liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) after the GHOS
endorsed the revisions in January 2013. The LCR ensures that a bank has an adequate
stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its cash needs under a
liquidity stress scenario covering 30 calendar days. The LCR was first published in
December 2010. At that time, the Basel Committee put in place a rigorous process to
review the standard and its implications for financial markets, credit extension and
economic growth. It committed to address unintended consequences as necessary.
The revised LCR will take effect on 1 January 2015 as originally intended, but to
ensure that it will not disrupt the ongoing process of strengthening banking systems
or the financing of economic activity, the minimum requirement will begin at 60% of
the intended ratio and rise by 10 percentage points per year to reach 100% on
1 January 2019.
As a complement to the short-term focus of the LCR, the net stable funding
ratio (NSFR) addresses the longer-term structure of bank debt. Due to be introduced
in 2018 as a minimum standard, it is intended to limit banks’ overreliance on shortterm wholesale funding and to promote a sustainable maturity structure for assets

BIS 83rd Annual Report

93

and liabilities. Reviewing the NSFR will be a priority for the Committee over the
next two years.
In July 2012, the Committee published the consultative paper Monitoring
indicators for intraday liquidity management, which reinforces its call for banks to
actively manage their intraday liquidity positions and risks so that they can meet
their payment and settlement obligations under both normal and stressed
conditions. The Committee finalised the guidance in March 2013. The indicators
are intended to allow banking supervisors to monitor a bank’s management of
its intraday liquidity risk; over time, they will also help supervisors better
understand banks’ management of this risk as well as their payment and settlement
behaviour.

Derivatives
The crisis that began in 2007 showed that improved regulation, together with
enhanced market transparency, would be necessary to limit excessive and opaque
risk-taking through OTC derivatives and to reduce systemic risk posed by OTC
derivatives transactions, markets and practices. To that end, the Basel Committee
has agreed on reforms to ensure that banks adequately capitalise exposures to
counterparty credit risk, whether arising from other banks or from exposures to
central counterparties (CCPs). It is also working with other global regulatory bodies
to set margining requirements for non-centrally cleared contracts. Completing these
reforms in the near term is essential to promote system-wide stability and mitigate
the potential for spillover effects on the real economy.
Exposures to central counterparties. In July, the Committee issued an interim
standard for the capitalisation of bank exposures to CCPs. The interim standard
allows for full implementation of Basel III while recognising that additional work is
needed to develop an improved capital framework.
The Committee’s framework for capitalising exposures to CCPs builds on
Principles for financial market infrastructures, released in April 2012 by the CPSS
and IOSCO. Those principles are designed to enhance the robustness of the
essential infrastructures – including CCPs – supporting global financial markets. The
Committee is currently working with the CPSS and IOSCO to develop a final
standard that appropriately recognises the enhanced regulatory framework for
CCPs while ensuring that risks faced by banks are appropriately capitalised.
Margining requirements on non-centrally cleared derivatives. Margining requirements
can help mitigate systemic risk in the derivatives markets. They can also encourage
standardisation and promote central clearing by reflecting the generally higher risk
of non-centrally cleared derivatives. In July, the Committee in collaboration with
IOSCO published a consultative paper setting out high-level principles for
margining practices and treatment of collateral and proposing margin requirements
for non-centrally cleared derivatives. These principles will apply to all transactions
that involve either financial firms or systemically important non-financial entities. A
near-final proposal was issued for consultation in February 2013; the Committee
and IOSCO expect to finalise the margin requirements later in the year.
To reduce the liquidity impact of the original margin proposal, which included
a zero initial margin threshold, the February proposal provides for a universal initial
margin threshold of €50 million. The near-final proposals also envisage a gradual
phase-in. The requirement to collect and post initial margin on non-centrally
cleared trades, to be phased in between 2015 and 2019, will begin with the largest,
most active and most systemically risky derivatives market participants.

Core principles for effective banking supervision
The Committee completed its review of its Core principles for effective banking
supervision and the associated Core principles methodology in September, and the
resulting revisions were endorsed by banking supervisors at the 2012 International
Conference of Banking Supervisors.
The core principles are the de facto standard for sound prudential regulation
and supervision of banks and banking systems. Originally issued by the Committee
in 1997, they are used by countries as a benchmark for assessing and improving the
quality of their supervisory systems. In addition, the IMF and the World Bank use
the core principles in their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to assess
the effectiveness of countries’ banking supervisory systems and practices.
The revised core principles highlight the distinction between what supervisors
do and what they expect banks to do and contain important enhancements to
strengthen supervisory practices and risk management in light of the global
financial crisis and the past few years of market turmoil. For example, they
emphasise the need for greater supervisory intensity combined with adequate
resources to deal with systemically important banks; the importance of applying a
macroprudential perspective to the supervision of individual banks; and the need
for effective measures (in crisis management, and recovery and resolution) to
reduce both the probability and impact of a bank failure.

Domestic systemically important banks
In November 2011, the Basel Committee issued final rules for global systemically
important banks (G-SIBs). In endorsing those rules, the G20 Leaders asked the
Committee and the FSB to extend the framework to domestic SIBs (D-SIBs).
In October 2012, the Basel Committee released A framework for dealing with
domestic systemically important banks, which contains a set of principles on the
assessment methodology and the higher loss absorbency required for D-SIBs. The
framework’s perspective complements that of the G-SIB rules by focusing on the
domestic economic effect of bank distress or failure. Given that complementarity,
the Committee believes it would be appropriate for national authorities to require
banks that they identify as D-SIBs to comply with the principles in line with the
phase-in arrangements for the G-SIB framework (ie from January 2016).

Settlement of foreign exchange transactions
In February, the Committee released Supervisory guidance for managing risks
associated with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions. Since publication
of the original guidance in September 2000, the foreign exchange market has
made significant strides in reducing the risks associated with the settlement of
transactions, but substantial settlement-related risks remain, not least because of
the rapid growth in foreign exchange trading.
The updated guidance provides a more comprehensive and detailed view of
the governance and management of settlement-related risks. In addition, to reduce
principal risk, it promotes the use of payment-versus-payment arrangements where
they are practicable.

Trading book review
In recognition of the substantial losses incurred by banks during the financial crisis
that began in 2007, the Committee in 2009 introduced a package of substantially

BIS 83rd Annual Report

95

increased capital requirements for trading activities, particularly for securitisations
and structured credit products. These revisions became known as Basel 2.5.
At the time it published Basel 2.5, the Committee also commenced a
fundamental review of trading book capital requirements. It aimed to evaluate the
design of the market risk regulatory regime as well as weaknesses in risk
measurement under the framework’s internal models-based and standardised
approaches. In May 2012, the Committee issued proposals for a regulatory
framework that can be implemented consistently by supervisors and that achieves
comparable levels of capital across jurisdictions. Key elements of the proposals
include (i) setting a more objective boundary between the trading book and the
banking book that materially reduces the scope for regulatory arbitrage; (ii) moving
from value-at-risk to expected shortfall, a risk measure that better captures lowprobability but high-impact crises (tail risks); (iii) calibrating the revised framework
in both the standardised and internal models-based approaches to a period of
significant financial stress; (iv) comprehensively incorporating the risk of market
illiquidity; (v) reducing model risk in the internal models-based approach, including
through a more granular process for models approval and constraints on
diversification; and (vi) revising the standardised approach to be more risk-sensitive
and act as a credible fallback to internal models.
The Committee also proposed to strengthen the relationship between the
models-based and standardised approaches by establishing a closer link between
the calibration of the two approaches; to require mandatory calculation of the
standardised approach by all banks; and to consider the merits of introducing the
standardised approach as a floor or surcharge to the models-based approach.
Furthermore, the treatment of hedging and diversification in the two approaches
will be more closely aligned.

Securitisation
In December, the Committee released a consultative paper setting out proposed
revisions to the capital adequacy standards for securitisation exposures. Given the
role of securitisation exposures in the global financial crisis, the Committee’s
objectives are to make capital requirements more prudent and risk-sensitive; to
mitigate mechanistic reliance on external credit ratings; and to reduce current cliff
effects in capital requirements. The revisions incorporate additional risk drivers, such
as maturity; and new regulatory approaches, such as a simplified supervisory formula
approach and different applications of the concentration ratio approach in Basel 2.5.

High-cost credit protection
The Committee has been concerned about potential arbitraging of regulatory capital
through certain credit protection transactions. It has monitored developments in
that regard and, after further consideration, published a consultative proposal in
March that would strengthen capital requirements when banks engage in certain
high-cost credit protection transactions.

Audit
The financial crisis has highlighted the need to improve the quality of internal and
external bank audits. In June, the Committee issued The internal audit function in
banks, replacing a 2001 document with revised supervisory guidance for assessing
audit effectiveness. The guidance builds on the Committee’s Principles for enhancing
corporate governance, which requires banks to have an internal audit function with

96

BIS 83rd Annual Report

authority, stature, independence, adequate resources and access to the board of
directors. The new guidance addresses the supervisory authority’s expectations of
and relationship to the internal audit function as well as supervisory assessments. It
encourages internal bank auditors to comply with, and contribute to, national and
international professional standards and promotes consideration of prudential
issues in the development of standards and practices. The new document also
details responsibilities of a bank’s audit committee.
In March, the Committee also issued for consultation External audits of banks,
providing supervisory guidance that will enhance and supersede existing guidance.
The new document reflects the evolution of bank practices and the introduction of
new standards and regulations over the past 10 years. It sets out the Committee’s
greater supervisory expectations of (i) more robust audit of banks and (ii) enhanced
engagement between the audit committee and auditors and between auditors and
supervisors.

Disclosure and reporting
Timely disclosure of financial information promotes market discipline by providing
meaningful information to bank investors and other interested parties. The
Committee is working to ensure consistency, relevance and coherence in the area
of prudential disclosures through its publication of required disclosures and its
establishment of a dedicated working group on the topic. The group’s objective is
to (i) propose adjustments to the Committee’s disclosure requirements to maintain
their relevance; (ii) ensure that disclosures are consistent with the Committee’s
other policy initiatives; and (iii) review and consider new disclosure requirements
and proposals emanating from external sources.
Composition of capital. During the financial crisis, market participants and
supervisors could not thoroughly assess banks’ capital positions or draw adequate
cross-jurisdictional comparisons. The problem was a lack of detail in capital
disclosures and a lack of domestic and international consistency in reporting. In
June 2012, the Committee published a set of disclosure requirements on the
composition of banks’ capital that aim to improve both transparency and
comparability.
Data aggregation and risk reporting. The financial crisis revealed that many banks,
including G-SIBs, were unable to aggregate risk exposures and identify concentrations
fully, quickly and accurately. The lack of data hampered decision-making, with
wide-ranging consequences for the banks themselves and for the stability of the
financial system as a whole. The Basel Committee’s Principles for effective risk data
aggregation, published in January, will strengthen the aggregation of risk data,
internal risk reporting and, hence, risk management at banks – especially G-SIBs.

Implementation and monitoring of Basel III
Full, timely and consistent implementation of the Basel III framework is fundamental
to raising the resilience of the global banking system, maintaining market
confidence in regulatory ratios and providing a level playing field internationally.
The benefits of the recent round of regulatory reforms will not be realised without
sound implementation, which is essential for securing a stable global banking
system.
In April 2012, the Basel Committee introduced its Regulatory Consistency
Assessment Programme (RCAP), which seeks to ensure the timely adoption of

BIS 83rd Annual Report

97

Basel III; domestic regulatory consistency with Basel III; and the consistency of
outcomes, with an initial focus on banks’ calculations of risk-weighted assets. The
RCAP, primarily a peer review process, assesses any inconsistencies and reports on
their impact on financial stability and on the maintenance of an international level
playing field. In doing so, it promotes full and consistent implementation of
Basel III, facilitates effective dialogue among members, and provides peer pressure
where needed.
A key element of the process is transparency, including periodic reporting to
the G20; reports were submitted to the G20 Leaders in June 2012 and to the G20
finance ministers and central bank Governors in October 2012 and April 2013. The
Committee also assesses Basel III’s quantitative impact on financial markets and
reports the results of its monitoring exercises twice a year.
Timely adoption of Basel III. The first element of the Committee’s RCAP focuses
on the status of domestic rule-making processes to ensure that the Committee’s
capital standards are incorporated in national law or regulation according to the
internationally agreed time frames. These progress reports, which were published
in April and October 2012 and April 2013, provide a high-level view of Committee
members’ progress in adopting the Basel standards (Basel II, 2.5 and III). The
Committee believes that disclosure will provide an additional incentive for members
to fully comply with the international agreements.
Regulatory consistency. Assessments of domestic regulations in relation to the Basel
standards, conducted by independent teams of technical experts from a wide range
of countries, began with the European Union, Japan and the United States and were
published in October. The rules reviewed in Japan were already in effect; those of
the European Union and the United States were in draft form and will be the subject
of follow-up reviews once they are finalised. The results of an assessment of
Singapore’s Basel III rules were published in March.
Consistency of outcomes. To assess the regulatory consistency of results produced
by the Basel standards, the Committee studied banks’ calculation of risk-weighted
assets for the trading book. A similar exercise for the banking book is being
conducted, and results will be published in 2013. The report of the trading book
review, published in January, contained two analyses. The first examined publicly
available data for a selection of large banks. The second involved 15 internationally
active banks in an exercise using a hypothetical portfolio. The report estimates the
variation in risk weights for market risk across banks and highlights aspects of the
Basel standards that contribute to that variation. An exercise planned for 2013 will
include more complex hypothetical portfolios to help the Committee deepen its
analysis of the variation in risk measurement of trading books across banks.
These preliminary findings will feed into the policy work already initiated by
the Committee regarding the enhancement of bank disclosures and the fundamental
review of the trading book. Moreover, the data used to compile the report provide
national supervisors with a clearer picture of the risk models of their banks in
relation to those of international peers and will help the supervisors take action
where needed.

Simplicity and comparability
In parallel with the analysis of the consistency in outcomes, the Committee
undertook a review of the Basel framework’s simplicity and comparability. The
Committee is considering ways in which the Basel framework can be simplified

98

BIS 83rd Annual Report

without materially altering its underlying objective, or weakening it, or reducing
the comparability of the results. It will publish a consultative paper on these topics
in 2013.

Peer review of stress testing
Stress testing is an important tool used by banks to identify the potential for
unexpected adverse outcomes across a range of risks and scenarios. In 2009, in the
wake of the financial crisis, the Committee published Principles for sound stress
testing practices and supervision.
The Committee’s Standards Implementation Group conducted a peer review
of supervisory authorities’ implementation of the 2009 principles and published
the results in April 2012. The review found that stress testing has become a key
component of the supervisory assessment process as well as a tool for contingency
planning and communication. Overall, the review found the 2009 stress testing
principles to be generally effective. In many countries, however, the principles
are not fully implemented. The Committee will continue to monitor the
implementation of the principles and determine whether additional guidance
might be necessary.

Outreach and the global supervisory community
The Committee organised the 17th biennial International Conference of Banking
Supervisors, hosted in Istanbul on 13–14 September by the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey and the Turkish Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. At
the conference, which brought together banking supervisors and central bankers
from more than 100 countries, delegates endorsed the Committee’s revised core
principles, discussed lessons learned from the financial crisis, particularly from the
perspective of emerging market and developing economies, and considered the
latest developments in supervision, risk management and financial stability.
The Committee also strengthened its collaboration with the global supervisory
community through its participation in a series of annual high-level meetings
organised jointly by the Committee and the Financial Stability Institute and
attended by Deputy Governors of central banks and heads of supervisory authorities
from various regions of the world. In addition, the Committee expanded its
outreach to jurisdictions that are not members of the Committee through its Basel
Consultative Group (BCG). The BCG facilitates broad supervisory dialogue with nonmember countries on Committee initiatives, and it provides input to the
Committee’s regulatory reform agenda to ensure that the needs of the international
banking community are appropriately addressed.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments for the Governors of the BIS Global Economy Meeting and analyses
the implications of these developments for financial stability and central bank
policy. The CGFS is chaired by William C Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Committee members are Deputy Governors and other senior
officials from 23 central banks of major advanced and emerging market economies
and the Economic Adviser of the BIS.
Among the focal points of the Committee’s discussions during the past year
were sovereign debt problems and associated banking sector challenges in the

BIS 83rd Annual Report

99

euro area as well as policy initiatives that could stop contagion among sovereigns
and break the link between sovereign risk and bank funding problems. Measures
addressing currency denomination risk and related risk premia in euro area
sovereign debt markets were a key aspect in this context. Committee members also
examined unconventional monetary policies regarding their potential consequences
for market functioning, risk-taking and financial stability. This examination included,
in particular, possible risks from international spillovers of the current accommodative
policies and challenges posed by a future exit from those policies. Interest rate risk
exposures and factors increasing the sensitivity of bond yields to a change in the
monetary policy stance were another key aspect. Additional topics addressed by
the Committee were the international economic and financial implications of the
so-called fiscal cliff in the United States and risks related to a possible abrupt
growth slowdown in China.
The Committee also commissioned a number of in-depth analyses and longerterm projects carried out by groups of central bank experts. Two of the resulting
reports were released in late 2012:
•
The first, published in November, formally ended a multi-year project to
enhance the BIS international banking statistics – a key international data set
for which the CGFS serves as the governing body. The enhanced statistics,
which will be implemented in two stages beginning in 2013, help close some
key gaps in the currently reported data. Over time, this will significantly
increase the analytical value of the statistics in areas such as banks’ sources and
uses of foreign currency funding, the transmission of possible funding shocks
across banking systems, banks’ country credit risk exposures, and credit supply
and funding trends among different types of banks.
•
The second report, published in December, builds on earlier work by the
Committee to help policymakers put macroprudential policies into action.
Taking a practical perspective, the report provides guidance on how to assess
three broad criteria that are key in determining the selection and application of
macroprudential instruments: timing, effectiveness and efficiency. It also sets
out, for the first time, seven broad principles for the design and operation of
the macroprudential policies formulated by the CGFS in 2011.
A third report, to be released in 2013, explores the implications for
markets and policy of the increasing demand for collateral assets arising from
regulatory reform and other developments. It finds that supply will be less of a
concern than the adverse market effects of endogenous adjustments that are likely
to prevent any lasting scarcity of collateral assets at the system level. Those effects
include an increase in interconnectedness, procyclicality and financial system
opacity as well as higher operational, funding and rollover risks. The report argues
that policy responses therefore need to focus primarily on those adverse
developments (eg in the context of shadow banking activities or balance sheet
encumbrance), rather than on supply-demand conditions in the markets for
collateral assets.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) contributes to the
strengthening of financial market infrastructures by promoting safe and efficient
payment, clearing and settlement arrangements. Comprising senior officials from
25 central banks, the CPSS is a recognised international standard setter in this area.
The Committee chair is Paul Tucker, the Bank of England’s Deputy Governor,
Financial Stability.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

New standards for financial market infrastructures
The CPSS, together with IOSCO, published Principles for financial market infrastructures
in April 2012. The document sets out new international standards intended to govern
systemically important financial market infrastructures (FMIs) – payment systems,
central securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties
and trade repositories. The new standards replace the three previous sets of CPSS
and CPSS-IOSCO standards – those for systemically important payment systems
(2001), for securities settlement systems (2001) and for central counterparties (2004).
The revised set of 24 principles reflects lessons learned from the recent financial crisis
as well as the experience gained from applying the previous standards during the
past decade. The document also contains a set of five responsibilities for the
authorities that oversee or regulate the FMIs. These responsibilities include effective
cooperation between authorities where more than one is involved.
In December, the CPSS and IOSCO jointly published Principles for financial
market infrastructures: disclosure framework and assessment methodology. The
disclosure framework prescribes the form and content of the information that FMIs
are expected to publicly disclose in compliance with the 24 principles; the disclosures
are intended to help show how FMIs work and to facilitate more robust comparisons
between them. The assessment methodology promotes thorough and consistent
assessments. It is intended primarily for external assessors at the international level,
in particular the IMF and the World Bank, but it also provides a baseline for national
authorities to assess observance of the principles by FMIs and to self-assess the way
they discharge their own responsibilities as regulators, supervisors and overseers.
The CPSS and IOSCO have begun regularly gathering information from a number
of jurisdictions to monitor their progress in implementing the standards; status
reports will be published starting in the second half of 2013. The initial goal of the
monitoring is to determine whether jurisdictions have made the changes to their
legal and regulatory framework that are necessary to enable them to implement the
standards. Subsequently, more detailed assessments will be carried out.

Recovery and resolution of financial market infrastructures
In July 2012, the CPSS and IOSCO released a consultative document, Recovery and
resolution of financial market infrastructures, that outlines the issues involved in
designing effective recovery plans and resolution regimes for FMIs. The CPSS and
IOSCO will assist the FSB in elaborating how the FSB’s Key attributes of effective
resolution regimes apply to FMIs. The CPSS and IOSCO will also articulate what
jurisdictions need to do to ensure that FMIs of different types have good recovery
capabilities and plans.

Authorities’ access to trade repository data
A consultative report issued by the CPSS and IOSCO in April 2013 outlines the
framework to guide authorities’ access to data held in trade repositories, both regular
and ad hoc. The guidance expands on issues of access addressed in the January 2012
CPSS-IOSCO publication on aggregation and reporting of data on OTC derivatives.

Guidance on foreign exchange settlement risk
The CPSS worked with the BCBS on the revision of its supervisory guidance on
how banks should manage the risks of settling foreign exchange transactions. As
reported above, the BCBS published the updated guidance in February.

Innovations in retail payments
In the May 2012 report Innovations in retail payments, the CPSS provides an
overview of innovative retail payment activities and identifies a number of factors
that could hinder or help such innovations. The study also raises issues for central
banks concerning their various responsibilities and tasks as catalysts, overseers and
operators of payment systems.

The new Red Book and the annual statistical update
In November, the Committee published the second and final volume of its new
edition of Payment, clearing and settlement systems in the CPSS countries, a
reference work known as the Red Book, describing FMIs in member countries (the
new volume 1 was released in September 2011). In January, the Committee
published the annual update of Statistics on payment, clearing and settlement
systems in the CPSS countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Deputy Governor of the Bank
of Japan, is a forum for senior central bank officials to jointly monitor developments
in financial markets and assess their implications for the liquidity management
operations of central banks. Currently, 21 central banks are represented on the
Committee.
Recurring concerns over euro area sovereign debt and the ultra-low interest
rate environment in the major currency areas shaped the Committee’s discussions
during the year. The Committee closely monitored government bond market and
bank funding conditions in the euro area and their effects on the integrity of the
single market. A bout of market stress in mid-2012 prompted Committee members
to hold ad hoc conference calls to exchange information on the latest developments.
And as major central banks announced further rounds of unconventional measures
and adopted new approaches to forward policy guidance, the Committee examined
their effects on financial markets both at home and abroad.
The Committee also discussed selected longer-term and structural issues such
as the efforts in different jurisdictions to review existing practices in reference
interest rates and the responses to that in the private sector. Moreover, the
Committee Chair and several members participated in a working group
established by the ECC to examine reference interest rate practices from a central
banking perspective, focusing on the implications for monetary transmission and
financial stability. Committee members also kept abreast of several ongoing
financial sector reforms and assessed their potential impact on the functioning of
financial markets.
The Committee published a study on how central bank frameworks and
practices regarding collateral evolved in the five years from mid-2007. In addition,
as part of the preparation for the 2013 BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign
Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, a group established by the Committee
completed its task of refining the survey’s categories for counterparty and execution
method and its currency-pair coverage. The 53 central banks participating in the
survey then began technical preparations.

Central Bank Governance Group
The Central Bank Governance Group, comprising representatives from nine central
banks and chaired by Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, serves as a
venue for information exchange and research on the design and operation of
central banks as public policy institutions. In addition, the Group suggests priorities
for BIS work on these topics that is carried out through the almost 50 central banks
that make up the Central Bank Governance Network. The research work and results
of the numerous Network-based surveys on governance topics are available to
central bank officials, and selected material is published.
During the past year, the Governance Group gathered at the BIS bimonthly
meetings to address the evolving circumstances of central banks. With the support
of research commissioned from its BIS secretariat and survey information generated
by the Network, the Group assessed the financial strength that central banks
need in order to be effective in the post-crisis world; discussed the challenges
arising from changing mandates and arrangements relating to financial stability;
and deliberated on the efforts made by central banks to improve the public’s
understanding of their increasingly complex activities.
Central Bank Governance Group: www.bis.org/about/cbgov.htm

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC), chaired by Muhammad
Ibrahim, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, is a forum for economists
and statisticians from 80 central banks to address statistical topics related to
monetary and financial stability. Among its activities during the year was a webcast
in which Roberto Rigobon of the MIT Sloan School of Management presented his
work on the Billion Prices Project; the project compiles a daily price index and
inflation rate based on price and product descriptions collected every day from
online retailers in more than 70 countries.
At the Committee’s sixth biennial conference, held in Basel, the topics included
the measurement of shadow banking, residential and commercial property prices,
commodity markets, market expectations, effective exchange rates, and private and
public sector indebtedness.
The IFC sponsored a workshop on financial inclusion indicators in cooperation
with the Central Bank of Malaysia at Sasana Kijang, Kuala Lumpur. The event aimed
to advance the data-gathering efforts needed to support greater financial inclusion
worldwide (inclusion refers to the availability of appropriate financial services to
underserved populations; the concept can extend to expanding financial literacy
and consumer protection).6
The IFC’s annual membership survey focused on data sharing between central
banks and supervisory authorities. In its annual report to the BIS All Governors’
Meeting in January 2013, the Committee proposed a task force on data sharing to
analyse existing practices regarding the sharing of data, in particular with respect
to banks’ balance sheets and activities.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
Founded in 2002, the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) strengthens
safety-net regimes around the world by providing guidance for effective deposit
insurance systems, conducting research and promoting collaboration among
the key players in the global financial safety net. The number of organisations
affiliated with IADI now stands at 88, including 67 deposit insurers as Members,
nine Associates and 12 Partners. The 2012 IADI Annual General Meeting elected
Jerzy Pruski, President of the Management Board of the Bank Guarantee Fund
of Poland, as IADI’s President and Chair of its Executive Council; he succeeded
Martin J Gruenberg, Chairman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
IADI adopted strategic priorities in 2012 that, in line with the global efforts to
strengthen the financial stability framework, (i) promote strong deposit insurance
and resolution systems; (ii) strengthen and deepen relationships with other
international financial organisations and standard-setting bodies on safety netrelated matters; and (iii) support research and the development of guidance to
further promote effective deposit insurance systems.
Core principles for effective deposit insurance systems, part of the FSB’s key
standards for sound financial systems, is used in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) conducted by the IMF and World Bank. IADI experts who meet the
IMF and World Bank Assessor qualifications will now participate in FSAP missions
evaluating deposit insurance systems. IADI has begun to revise and update the core
principles and is participating in the drafting of the assessment methodology
for the FSB’s Key attributes of effective resolution regimes for financial institutions.
IADI is also contributing to the work of the FSB Cross-Border Crisis Management
Committee in the development of G-SIFI resolution guidance.
In response to FSB recommendations in its thematic review of deposit
insurance, IADI is developing additional guidance on matters stemming from the
global financial crisis. Three papers – addressing deposit reimbursement, public
awareness and deposit insurance coverage – were submitted to the FSB this year.
Three other papers, scheduled for completion in 2013, focus on moral hazard,
ex ante funding and the impact of multiple deposit insurance systems within one
jurisdiction.
The 2012 annual joint IADI-FSI seminar “Bank Resolution: Current Developments,
Challenges and Opportunities” reviewed insights and experiences on issues involving
SIFIs and G-SIFIs. IADI continued its collaboration with the FSI to produce online
tutorials on deposit insurance issues.
IADI maintains a global deposit insurance system database and updates it with
results from its annual survey and targeted research. IADI posted on its public
website a selection of results from its second annual survey of deposit insurers; full
results are available to IADI Members, the FSB and the BIS.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the international
standard-setting body for prudential supervision of the insurance industry. Its
purpose is to promote effective and globally consistent supervision and contribute
to global financial stability so that policyholders may benefit from fair, safe and
stable insurance markets.

104

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Financial stability
The IAIS initiated public consultations on an assessment methodology for systemically
important insurers in May 2012 and on proposed policy measures in October. It
expects to deliver conclusions on both topics to the FSB in 2013.
The IAIS is developing a framework for monitoring the insurance sector’s
macroeconomic and financial market environment. Under the framework,
macroprudential surveillance of the insurance sector differentiates the scope for
supervisory action from the powers of central banks. The IAIS is also exploring
macro stress testing in the insurance sector.
In a July 2012 paper on reinsurance and financial stability, the IAIS concluded
that surveillance of non-reinsurance activities of reinsurers is warranted. A joint
working paper by economists from the IAIS, BIS and IMF studied the impact of
natural catastrophes on the reinsurance sector.

Insurance core principles
At its October general meeting, the IAIS revised Insurance Core Principle (ICP) 9, which
covers supervisory review and reporting, and adopted guidance on how best to apply
the ICPs to improve access to insurance products for those currently underserved.

Internationally active insurance groups
In July, the IAIS issued the first comprehensive draft of the Common Framework for
the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame) for public
consultation, and a revised draft is scheduled for 2013. In a field testing phase
scheduled for 2014, ComFrame will be evaluated in practice so that it can be
modified as necessary before its formal adoption, planned for 2018.

New global insurance market report
In October 2012, the IAIS released its first Global insurance market report, the
successor publication to its reinsurance market reports. It covers the performance
of primary insurers as well as reinsurers and reports on key developments in the
global insurance market.
The new report contains both publicly available and confidential data submitted
by global reinsurers for the period 2007–11. It shows that, while global primary
insurers and reinsurers have been affected by the financial crisis and subsequent
recession in many economies around the world, they have also been resilient in the
face of the devastating series of natural disasters in 2005 and again in 2011. The
data reveal that the reinsurance sector absorbed record-high losses in 2011 with a
smaller impact on equity capital than in 2005, the former record-setting year.

Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
Insurance supervisors that are signatories to the IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of
Understanding (MMoU) participate in a global framework for cooperation and
information exchange. The memorandum sets minimum standards to which
signatories must adhere, and all applicants are subject to review and approval by
an independent team of IAIS members. MMoU participants are better able to
promote the financial stability of cross-border insurance operations for the benefit
of consumers. The MMoU currently has 34 signatories representing more than 52%
of worldwide premium volume.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

105

Standards observance
The IAIS Standards Observance Subcommittee, created in 2010, is conducting
assessments and peer reviews on the implementation of the ICPs as revised in 2011. The
resulting confidential individual reports inform the participating supervisory authorities,
and an aggregate report gives the standard-setting committees critical feedback on any
challenges in interpretation or scope experienced in IAIS member jurisdictions.
More broadly, the IAIS organises regional seminars and workshops on
implementing IAIS principles, standards and guidance in collaboration with the FSI,
national supervisory authorities and other bodies. The Financial Inclusion Subcommittee
extends this focus on implementation to supervisory authorities in emerging market
and developing economies; the subcommittee also manages the IAIS relationship with
its partnering Access to Insurance Initiative and the Islamic Financial Services Board.
IAIS: www.iaisweb.org

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists supervisory authorities worldwide in
their oversight of financial systems by fostering a solid understanding of prudential
standards and good supervisory practice.
In the current context in particular, the FSI is assisting supervisors with
implementation of reforms developed by international standard-setting bodies in
response to the financial crisis. It is doing this through a range of channels,
including conferences, high-level meetings, seminars and the internet. Its online
information resource and learning tool, FSI Connect, is used by financial sector
supervisors at all levels of experience and expertise.
In addition, the FSI conducts surveys of selected countries’ implementation of
the Basel framework. Surveys are now undertaken annually, and the results are
published on the BIS website. The 2012 survey showed that 91 countries had
implemented or were in the process of implementing Basel II, and 51 countries
were in the process of implementing Basel III.

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The FSI’s extensive programme of seminars, conferences and high-level meetings is
targeted at banking and insurance sector supervisors and central bank financial
stability experts. Over the past year, approximately 1,800 representatives of central
banks and banking and insurance supervisory authorities participated in 42 banking
seminars, nine insurance seminars and the FSI’s sixth biennial conference.
For some of the insurance seminars, the FSI worked with the IAIS and its
regional network. For regional banking seminars, the FSI collaborated with the
following supervisory groups:
•
Africa – Committee of Bank Supervisors of West and Central Africa (BSWCA);
Southern African Development Community (SADC);
•
Americas – Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas (ASBA); Center
for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA); Caribbean Group of Banking
Supervisors (CGBS);
•
Asia and the Pacific – Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks
(EMEAP) Working Group on Banking Supervision; South East Asian Central
Banks (SEACEN); Central Banks of South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia
(SEANZA) Forum of Banking Supervisors;
•
Europe – European Banking Authority (EBA); Group of Banking Supervisors
from Central and Eastern Europe (BSCEE);

•

Middle East – Arab Monetary Fund (AMF); Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
Committee of Banking Supervisors; and
•
Other – Group of French-Speaking Banking Supervisors (GSBF); Group of
International Finance Centre Supervisors (GIFCS).
The biennial FSI conference, held in Basel in November, brought together more
than 100 central bankers and banking supervisors to discuss leading-edge risk
management practices and the banking implications of current supervisory reforms.
In October, the FSI hosted the first annual conference of the Global Partnership for
Financial Inclusion, during which participants discussed the challenges faced by
standard-setting bodies in their efforts to broaden financial inclusion.
The annual high-level meetings for Deputy Governors of central banks and
heads of supervisory authorities, organised jointly with the BCBS, took place in
Africa, Asia, central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The
meeting topics included financial stability, macroprudential tools and policies,
regulatory priorities and other key supervisory issues. The FSI seminars focused on
improving supervisors’ understanding of financial regulatory reforms, particularly
those relating to Basel III capital and liquidity.

FSI Connect
FSI Connect is used by more than 9,500 subscribers from 245 central banks and
banking and insurance supervisory authorities. It offers more than 230 tutorials
covering a wide range of regulatory policy and supervisory topics. Recently released
tutorials include capital conservation and countercyclical buffers, regulatory capital
adjustments under Basel III, and assessment and guidance relating to the insurance
core principles.

Research and statistics
Through its research function, the BIS addresses economic and financial issues
important to central banks and financial supervisory authorities. Most of the resulting
research and analysis is published through the Bank’s principal outlets – the Annual
Report, the BIS Quarterly Review, BIS Papers, BIS Working Papers and the Bank’s
website (www.bis.org) – as well as in external professional publications. In addition,
the research function collects, analyses and disseminates statistical information for
central banks and the general public on key elements of the international financial
system. The research function also supports the BIS mission by developing
background material for meetings of senior central bankers, and it provides
secretariat and analytical services to the various groups hosted by the BIS in Basel.

Research focus
In line with the Bank’s mission, the focus of BIS research is on monetary and
financial stability. As in previous years, the principal themes of the work were the
immediate challenges of the global financial crisis and its longer-term implications
for policy.
A first strand of research continued to examine the link between the
macroeconomy and public and private balance sheets against the backdrop of
rising debt. The topics of the investigation included the link between the size of the
financial system and growth; the financial cycle and its relationship to the business
cycle; the interplay between the financial health of the sovereign and that of
the banking sector; and the risks to financial stability in this new environment.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

107

The sustainability and implications of extraordinarily low interest rates figured
prominently in the analyses.
A second strand of work focused on prudential and structural policies designed
to make the financial system more resilient. The analysis examined strengths and
weaknesses of macroprudential policy instruments and their relationship to
monetary policy tools. The research paid special attention to the interaction
between the emerging regulation of bank liquidity and the implementation of
monetary policy.
A third strand studied the evolution of monetary policy in the wake of the
global financial crisis. It analysed the effectiveness of policy in addressing balance
sheet recessions and the pros and cons of central banks’ balance sheet policies,
such as large-scale asset purchases and the accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves. The work also assessed changes in the transmission mechanism of policy
and explored the threat of fiscal dominance.
A fourth strand explored the nexus between the international monetary and
financial system and the performance of the global economy. At issue was global
liquidity – the concept as well as measurement and policy implications – and its
relationship to developments in international banking. Making extensive use of the
BIS’s unique international financial statistics, the research included detailed studies
on transnational banking activity and on segments of the foreign exchange market.
The BIS research function annually organises conferences and workshops for
participants from the worlds of policy, research and business. The leading event is
the BIS Annual Conference. In June 2012, the 11th BIS Annual Conference addressed
the future of financial globalisation and its implications for macroeconomic, monetary
and financial stability.

International statistical initiatives
Work to improve the collection and dissemination of data on cross-border claims
and liabilities of internationally active banks continued along the lines of the
multistage process endorsed by the CGFS. In a first stage, central banks have
enhanced the reporting of residency-based cross-border data. The second stage
enhancements will see central banks report a more detailed sectoral breakdown in
both the locational and consolidated banking statistics; the latter will be extended
to include the liability positions of banks, including capital.
On its website, the BIS has begun publicly releasing data that were developed in
cooperation with central bank members of the Data Bank: new long-series data on
total credit and improved international and domestic statistics on debt securities.7 As
one of the sponsors of the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX), the BIS
uses these standards in all its collection, processing and dissemination of statistics.
The BIS also continues its participation in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and
Financial Statistics (IAG), which follows up on the FSB and IMF recommendations to
the G20 to close data gaps revealed by the financial crisis.8

7

The Data Bank contains key economic indicators reported by almost all BIS shareholding central
banks, additional detailed macroeconomic series from major advanced and emerging market
economies, and data collected by various BIS-hosted groups. Substantial efforts have been made
to facilitate use of the Data Bank for calculating and disseminating long series of important
economic variables, such as credit.

8

The IAG comprises the BIS, ECB, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, United Nations and World Bank (www.
principalglobalindicators.org/about_iag.aspx). The same organisations also sponsor the SDMX
initiative (www.sdmx.org).

108

BIS 83rd Annual Report

As a participant in the FSB Working Group on Data Gaps and Systemic Linkages,
the BIS launched a central hub to house data covering global systemically important
banks. Over time, the data will give national supervisory authorities a better
understanding of how balance sheet interlinkages can amplify or cushion financial
shocks. In addition, the initiative will help strengthen international communication
among supervisory authorities.

Other central bank initiatives to which the BIS lends support
The BIS contributes to the activities of central banks and regional central bank
organisations. During the past year, it supported the following groups in hosting
events on the following topics:
•
CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – banking, payment and
settlement systems, fiscal policy and central bank finances;
•
FLAR (Fondo Latinoamericano de Reservas) – reserve management;
•
SEACEN (South East Asian Central Banks) Research and Training Centre –
central bank communications, financial stability and supervision, monetary
policy and payment and settlement systems;
•
MEFMI (Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa) – payment and settlement systems, and portfolio and risk
management; and
•
World Bank – portfolio diversification.
BIS experts also contributed to events organised by the International Banking
and Finance Institute of the Bank of France.

Financial services of the Bank
Through its Banking Department, the BIS offers a wide range of financial services
designed to assist central banks and other official monetary authorities in the
management of their foreign reserves and to foster international cooperation in
this area. Some 140 such institutions, as well as a number of international
organisations, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of BIS credit intermediation, which is
supported by a rigorous framework of internal risk management. Independent
control units reporting directly to the BIS Deputy General Manager monitor and
control the related risks. A compliance and operational risk unit monitors
operational risk; a risk control unit controls the Bank’s financial risks – ie credit,
liquidity and market risks – and is also responsible for the coordination required for
an integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in Basel,
at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Representative Office
for Asia and the Pacific.

Scope of services
As an institution owned and governed by central banks, the BIS possesses a distinctive
understanding of the needs of reserve managers – their primary requirement of
safety and liquidity as well as their evolving need to diversify substantial exposures
arising from the growth of foreign exchange reserves. To meet those needs, the BIS
offers investments that vary by currency denomination, maturity and liquidity. The
Bank offers tradable instruments in maturities ranging from one week to five years –

BIS 83rd Annual Report

109

Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS (FIXBIS), Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) and
products with embedded optionality (Callable MTIs); tradable instruments can be
bought or sold at any time during the Bank’s dealing hours.
Also available are money market placements, such as sight/notice accounts
and fixed-term deposits, in most convertible currencies; in addition, the Bank
provides short-term liquidity facilities and extends credit to central banks, usually
on a collateralised basis. Moreover, the Bank acts as trustee and collateral agent in
connection with international financial operations.
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
thereby providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of, for example,
regular rebalancing of reserve portfolios or major changes in reserve currency
allocations. The foreign exchange services of the Bank encompass spot transactions
in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) as well as swaps, outright
forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In addition, the Bank provides
gold services such as buying and selling, sight accounts, fixed-term deposits,
earmarked accounts, upgrading and refining and location exchanges.
The BIS also provides asset management products. These products, which
consist of sovereign securities and high-grade fixed income instruments, are
available in two forms: dedicated portfolio mandates tailored by the BIS to each
customer’s preferences; and open-end fund structures – BIS Investment Pools
(BISIPs) – that allow customers to invest in a common pool of assets similar to
mutual funds or unit funds. Both forms are offered as either single currency or
multicurrency mandates in major reserve currencies. The investor in multicurrency
mandates can choose whether to hedge back into the base currency.
In addition, the BISIP structure is used for the Asian Bond Fund (ABF) initiative
sponsored by EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks). The
BIS, in cooperation with a group of advising central banks, has chosen the same
structure for a US inflation-protected government securities fund managed by
external investment firms.
The BIS Banking Department hosts global and regional meetings, seminars and
workshops on reserve management issues. These gatherings facilitate the exchange
of knowledge and experience among reserve managers and promote the
development of investment and risk management capabilities in central banks and
international organisations.

Financial operations in 2012/13
In 2012/13, financial markets continued to be driven largely by the evolution of the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. Despite periods of high volatility, however,
funding conditions in credit markets improved overall. The Bank’s balance sheet total
fluctuated between SDR 255 billion and SDR 201 billion. For the year, it decreased by
SDR 43.7 billion, following a marginal decrease of SDR 5.4 billion in the previous year.
As a result, the balance sheet total at 31 March 2013 was SDR 212.0 billion.

Liabilities
Customer placements, about 90% of which are denominated in currencies and the
remainder in gold, constitute the largest share of total liabilities (see graph). On
31 March 2013, customer placements (excluding repurchase agreements) amounted
to SDR 183.7 billion, compared with SDR 215.4 billion at the end of 2011/12; the
decrease occurred in both currency and gold.
Currency deposits decreased from SDR 195.8 billion a year ago to
SDR 166.2 billion at end-March 2013. That balance represents some 2.0% of the

world’s total foreign exchange reserves – which totalled nearly SDR 7.4 trillion at
end-March 2013, up from SDR 7.0 trillion at end-March 2012.9 The share of currency
placements denominated in US dollars was 76%, while euro- and sterlingdenominated funds accounted for 8% and 7%, respectively.
Gold deposits amounted to SDR 17.6 billion at end-March 2013, a decrease of
SDR 2.0 billion for the financial year.

Assets
As in the previous financial year, most of the assets held by the BIS consist of
government and quasi-government securities plus investments (including reverse
repurchase agreements) with highly rated commercial banks of international
standing. In addition, the Bank held 115 tonnes of fine gold in its investment
portfolio at 31 March 2013. The Bank’s credit exposure is managed in a conservative
manner, with almost all of it rated no lower than A– at 31 March 2013 (see note 3,
“Credit risk”, in the “Risk management” section of the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency assets totalled SDR 157.1 billion on
31 March 2013, compared with SDR 200.2 billion at the end of the previous financial
year (see note 6, “Currency assets”, in “Notes to the financial statements”). The Bank
uses various derivative instruments to manage its assets and liabilities efficiently
(see note 8, “Derivative financial instruments”, in “Notes to the financial statements”).

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
China; and a Representative Office for the Americas (the Americas Office), located
in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote cooperation and the BIS mission

within each region by organising meetings, supporting regional institutions and
Basel-based committees, conducting policy research and fostering the exchange of
information and data. The Asian Office also provides banking services to the
region’s monetary authorities.

The Asian Office
The activities of the Asian Office are guided by the Asian Consultative Council
(ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS shareholding central banks in the
Asia-Pacific region.10 The Office undertakes economic research, organises high-level
regional meetings and, through its Regional Treasury, offers specialised banking
services. The economics team in Hong Kong focuses its research on the region’s
policy issues.

The Asian Consultative Council
At its June 2012 semiannual meeting in Basel, the Council nominated Choongsoo
Kim, Governor of the Bank of Korea, to succeed Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of
the Bank of Japan, as chair of the ACC beginning in October. At its February 2013
meeting, the Council endorsed a new research theme, “Cross-border financial
linkages in Asia and the Pacific”, which will be the focus of Asian Office research on
financial stability issues for the next two years.

Research
Economists in the Asian Office produced research on the two themes previously
endorsed by the ACC. On the monetary stability side, the theme was inflation
dynamics and globalisation in Asia and the Pacific; the specific policy issues under
this theme were identified at a June research workshop in Hong Kong. On the
financial stability side, the theme was property markets and financial stability; in
August, a conference co-hosted with the Reserve Bank of Australia in Sydney
showcased the results of that research.
In carrying out their research, Asian Office economists collaborated with
selected academics from around the world and economists at BIS shareholding
central banks in the region. The resulting papers have informed policy discussions
in various central bank meetings and have appeared in refereed journals as well as
the BIS Quarterly Review.

The Special Governors’ Meeting and other high-level meetings
The Asian Office organised 11 high-level BIS policy meetings. Each was held jointly
with a central bank in the region or with a regional body of central banks, including
the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) and the South
East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre.
The annual Special Governors’ Meeting gathers the Governors of the major
central banks in the region together with other Governors from around the world
to address issues of common concern. This year’s meeting was organised jointly
with the Bank of Korea and held in Seoul in February. For the third year in a row,
the event included a meeting with the chief executive officers of large financial

The 12 central banks are those of Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

institutions active in the region. The discussion centred on issues of bank
profitability and regional expansion.
Other high-level events were the Eighth Meeting on Monetary Policy Operating
Procedures, in Hong Kong in April; a meeting of the Working Party on Monetary
Policy in Asia, co-hosted by the Bank of Japan in Tokyo in June; the SEACEN-BIS
Exco Seminar, co-hosted by the Bank of Korea in Busan in September; and the
Eighth Roundtable on Financial Markets, co-hosted by the Bank of Korea in
Hong Kong in December.

Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
The dealing room of the Asian Office continued to work closely with the BIS Risk
Control unit to explore new investment outlets and expand its involvement in
regional financial markets while maintaining a conservative risk profile. Central
banks in the region also maintained a conservative stance in their reserve portfolio
operations with the BIS, demanding mainly short-term liquid instruments. On
balance, placements by central banks in the region in the 2012/13 financial year
were down slightly from those in 2011/12.
The BIS continued to support the second Asian Bond Fund (ABF2), an EMEAP
initiative to foster the development of local currency bond markets. At the end of
March 2013, the combined size of all ABF funds was just under $5.8 billion, an
increase of slightly more than 19% from the end of March 2012. The total return on
the region-wide fund, the Pan-Asia Bond Index Fund (PAIF), from its inception on
7 July 2005 to end-March 2013 was 69.8%, which compared favourably with the
44.0% return on a US Treasury index of similar duration.

The Americas Office
In its research and outreach, the Americas Office takes guidance from the
Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA), comprising the Governors of the eight
BIS shareholding central banks in the region.11 The chair of the CCA is Agustín
Carstens, Governor of the Bank of Mexico.
The Office organised the third annual CCA research conference, hosted in
April 2012 by the Central Bank of Brazil, which covered financial stability, financial
regulation and monetary policy. The Office has also implemented two research
network projects to aid cooperative investigation among CCA members on topics
of regional concern. The first project, on the effects of foreign exchange market
operations in Latin America, held a plenary session in April 2012; its closing
conference, in November, was hosted by the Bank of the Republic, the central bank
of Colombia. In March 2013, the Office organised a meeting of authors to finalise
the papers for publication. A second research network project was launched in
January, on financial stability considerations in central bank policy models.
Economists in the Americas Office have conducted additional research, including
studies of foreign exchange intervention, hedging in foreign exchange markets, oil
prices and food prices, and the regionalisation of banking in Latin America, that has
been used internally or published on the BIS website or in academic journals.
The Office’s outreach activities included support for several meetings: the
16th BIS Working Party for Monetary Policy in Latin America, hosted in September
by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru; a roundtable on fiscal policy, public debt
management and government bond markets organised jointly by the BIS and the

host, the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA), in Mexico City; and
a BIS-CEMLA workshop on central bank finances, hosted by the Central Bank of
Chile. The Office also organised two BIS panels at the November meetings of the
Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association in Lima. As part of their
outreach activities, economists of the Americas Office have made numerous
presentations, including those at several FSB regional consultative group meetings
and at an FSI-CEMLA seminar on Basel III and stress testing.

Governance and management of the BIS
The governance and management of the Bank are conducted at three principal
levels:
•
the General Meeting of BIS member central banks;
•
the BIS Board of Directors; and
•
BIS Management.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland. At the end of the 2012/13
financial year, the BIS employed 647 staff members from 54 countries.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Sixty central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS and
have rights of voting and representation at General Meetings. The Annual General
Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four months after 31 March, the end of the BIS
financial year. The AGM decides the distribution of the dividend and profit of the
BIS, approves the annual report and the accounts of the Bank, makes adjustments
in the allowances paid to Board members and selects the Bank’s independent
auditor.

The BIS Board of Directors
Consisting of 18 members at present, the Board of Directors is assisted by
four committees of Board members: the Administrative Committee, the Audit
Committee, the Banking and Risk Management Committee, and the Nomination
Committee. The main responsibilities of the Board are determining the strategic
and policy direction of the BIS and supervising the Bank’s Management.
At its meeting in June 2012, the BIS Board re-elected the following members
for a further period of three years: Agustín Carstens, Governor of the Bank of
Mexico; Mario Draghi, President of the ECB; Klaas Knot, President of the Netherlands
Bank; and Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China. In September
2012, the Board re-elected two other members, also for a further period of three
years: Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada; and Masaaki Shirakawa,
Governor of the Bank of Japan.
With effect from 13 September 2012, Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, reappointed William C Dudley as a
member of the Board for three years.
Anne Le Lorier, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, stepped down as
a member of the Board at the end of December 2012.
Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, appointed Paul Tucker to the
Board for a three-year term with effect from 1 January 2013. Ignazio Visco,
Governor of the Bank of Italy, reappointed Fabrizio Saccomanni as a member of the
Board for one year from 1 January 2013. Mr Saccomanni stepped down as a
member of the Board on 28 April 2013. With effect from 29 April, Ignazio Visco

114

BIS 83rd Annual Report

appointed Fabio Panetta, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, as a member
of the Board for the unexpired portion of Mr Saccomanni’s term, ending
31 December 2013.
In January 2013, the Board re-elected Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of
France, as Chairman of the Board of Directors for a further period of three years
beginning on 7 March 2013.
In March 2013, the Board re-elected Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the
Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, for a further period of three years.
On 19 March 2013, Masaaki Shirakawa stepped down as Governor of the Bank
of Japan and therefore left the Board. At its meeting in May 2013, the Board elected
Haruhiko Kuroda, Mr Shirakawa’s successor as Governor of the Bank of Japan, as a
member of the Board for the unexpired period of Mr Shirakawa’s term of office,
ending on 12 September 2015.
Mark Carney stepped down as Governor of the Bank of Canada and thus also
as a BIS Board Member on 1 June 2013. The Board appointed Luc Coene, Governor
of the National Bank of Belgium, as successor to Mr Carney as Chairman of the
Audit Committee.

In memoriam
The Bank was saddened to learn of the death of Sir Andrew Crockett on
3 September 2012 at the age of 69. Sir Andrew was the General Manager of the BIS
from 1 January 1994 to 31 March 2003. Among his many achievements was his
work to expand the membership of the BIS and its Board beyond the Bank’s
traditional, mostly European base. The Bank’s opening of representative offices in
Asia and the Americas was a part of this global outreach. Another milestone
reached under Sir Andrew’s leadership was the creation of the Financial Stability
Forum (FSF – later the Financial Stability Board), of which he was the first Chairman.
The Basel Process was greatly strengthened by locating the FSF Secretariat at
the BIS. Sir Andrew also initiated significant changes to modernise the Bank’s
management culture. In its continuing efforts to further strengthen the institution,
the Bank is building on Sir Andrew’s legacy.

Bank budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s annual expenditure budget starts about six
months in advance with the setting by Management of a broad business orientation
and financial framework. Within this context, business areas specify their plans and
corresponding resource requirements. The process of reconciling detailed business
plans, objectives and overall resource availability culminates in a draft budget,
which must be approved by the Board before the start of the financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital expenditures. As
with organisations similar to the BIS, Management and staff expenditure – including
remuneration, pensions, and health and accident insurance – amounts to around
70% of administrative expenditure. The other major categories, each accounting for
about 10% of administrative spending, are information technology (IT), buildings
and equipment, and general operational costs. Capital spending, relating mainly to

118

BIS 83rd Annual Report

buildings and IT investment, can vary significantly from year to year depending on
the projects in progress.
Administrative and capital expenditure for 2012/13 reflected the Bank’s priority
of responding to the global financial crisis. Additional staff positions devoted to the
Basel Process were allocated to the FSB, which became an independent association
at the end of January 2013; to the BCBS; and, to strengthen research capacities,
to the statistical sections of the Monetary and Economic Department. At the
same time, IT projects were undertaken to enhance statistical and research systems,
and to upgrade IT infrastructure related to the provision of banking and asset
management services to central bank customers.
For 2012/13, overall administrative expense on the Bank’s budget basis of
accounting amounted to CHF 271.2 million, or CHF 6.8 million (2.4%) lower than
the budget.12 It was CHF 16.2 million (6.4%) above actual administrative expense in
2011/12.
Capital expenditure was CHF 20.7 million, or CHF 2.0 million (8.8%) below the
budget. It was CHF 5.5 million (21%) below actual capital expenditure in 2011/12.
Total expenditure was CHF 291.9 million, or CHF 8.8 million (2.9%) below
budget. It was CHF 10.7 million (3.8%) above the actual expenditure in 2011/12.
In March 2013, the Board approved a 1.9% increase in the administrative
budget for the financial year 2013/14, to CHF 283.2 million. It also approved a
capital budget of CHF 30.5 million (including CHF 14.0 million for the purchase of
the building at Centralbahnstrasse 21 in Basel). The total budget of CHF 313.7 million
is CHF 13 million (4.3%) higher than in 2012/13. The 2013/14 budget is based on a
business plan which continues to focus on enhancing financial stability activities.
This includes monitoring of the initial implementation of supervisory and financial
standards, and strengthening of the Bank’s data collection and statistical systems.
Resources have also been added to bolster the Internal Audit and IT Security control
functions, and to improve the diversification of the Bank’s investments.

Bank remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of a number of
objective criteria – including qualifications, experience and responsibilities – and
classified into distinct job grades. The job grades are associated with a structure of
salary ranges. Salaries of individual staff members move within the ranges of the
salary structure on the basis of performance. Every three years, a comprehensive
survey benchmarks BIS salaries (in Swiss francs) against compensation in comparable
institutions and market segments. In benchmarking, the Bank focuses on the upper
half of market compensation in order to attract highly qualified staff. The analysis
takes into account differences in the taxation of compensation at the surveyed
institutions. In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is
adjusted on the basis of the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted
average real wage development in industrial countries. As of 1 July 2012, the salary
structure was accordingly decreased by 0.1%.
Through the Bank, BIS staff members have access to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-locally hired,

12

The Bank’s budget excludes financial accounting adjustments relating to post-employment benefit
obligations for pensions and health and accident insurance. The expense for the next financial year
depends on the actuarial valuations as at 31 March each year, which are not finalised until April,
after the budget has been set by the Board. For similar reasons, certain extraordinary items are
also excluded from the budget. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense”
in the profit and loss account (see “Net profit and its distribution”).

BIS 83rd Annual Report

119

non-Swiss staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s headquarters,
including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation allowance. The allowance
currently amounts to 14% of annual salary for unmarried staff members and 18%
for married staff members, subject to a ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also
entitled to receive an education allowance for their children, subject to certain
conditions. In the Representative Offices, the BIS makes a distinction between
staff members on an international assignment from the Bank’s headquarters and
staff members recruited directly for a position in a Representative Office. The
employment conditions of the former are determined in accordance with the Bank’s
international assignment policy. For staff recruited directly, employment conditions
are aligned with those in the market in which the Office is located, but they include
access to the same health insurance and pension plans available to staff employed
at the Bank’s headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against compensation
in comparable institutions and market segments. As with the survey for other staff,
the most recent executive compensation survey took place in the second half of
2010. The results confirmed the appropriateness of the current practice of annually
adjusting the salaries of senior officials for the rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2012, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation
allowances, is based on the salary structure of CHF 766,220 for the General
Manager;13 CHF 648,340 for the Deputy General Manager; and CHF 589,400 for
Heads of Department.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of the
Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals. The total
fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was CHF 1,096,932 as
of 1 April 2013. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each
Board meeting in which they participate. Assuming the full Board is represented
in all Board meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to
CHF 1,017,792.

Net profit and its distribution
The Bank recorded a net profit of SDR 898.2 million for its 83rd financial year, ended
31 March 2013. This result was 18% higher than the previous year.

Principal factors behind the 2012/13 profit
The background to the Bank’s 2012/13 results was a broad stabilisation of market
valuations, but at reduced yields. In this environment, Management maintained a
cautious approach to the balance sheet, which was reduced by 17% over the year,
from SDR 256 billion to SDR 212 billion. With historically low interest rates, the
interest accrual on the investment assets was lower and the net interest margin on
the banking business was squeezed. However, this reduction in net interest income
was partially offset by a reduction in valuation losses incurred during the year. As
a result, net interest and valuation income for the financial year 2012/13 was
SDR 1,014.4 million, an increase of SDR 146.6 million from the prior financial year
amount of SDR 867.8 million. Operating expenses amounted to SDR 256.3 million,
13% above the 2011/12 figure of SDR 226.7 million. This increase was due mainly to

13

120

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance and
enhanced pension rights.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

a higher charge for post-employment benefits following a reduction in the discount
rate assumption.
After taking into account the above factors, the Bank’s operating profit
amounted to SDR 786.2 million, which was SDR 130.7 million above the
SDR 655.5 million recorded in 2011/12.
The Bank’s available for sale portfolios, one for investment securities and one
for gold, hold positions for which valuation gains are recognised in the profit and
loss account only on disposal. During 2012/13, the Bank continued to manage its
portfolio of available for sale investment securities with a benchmark duration of
three years, with disposals in this portfolio realising a net gain of SDR 82.7 million
(2011/12: net gain of SDR 24.7 million). The Bank also realised a gain of
SDR 29.3 million on the sale of 1 tonne of its gold investment assets. This compares
with a gain of SDR 78.7 million on the sale of 3 tonnes in 2011/12.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for 2012/13 amounted to
SDR 898.2 million, 18% above the previous year’s profit of SDR 758.9 million. The
profit represented a return of 4.8% on average daily equity (2011/12: 4.3%).

Movements in equity
The unrealised gains on the Bank’s available for sale portfolios, one for investment
securities and one for gold, are included in revaluation accounts in the Bank’s equity.
The securities revaluation account decreased by SDR 55.5 million (2011/12: gain
of SDR 296.5 million), reflecting the recognition in profit of gains made on disposal
of available for sale investment securities, which was partially offset by increased
valuations on those securities held in the portfolio at year-end. The gold revaluation
account decreased by SDR 67.8 million (2011/12: gain of SDR 551.8 million),
reflecting the realisation into profit following the sale of 1 tonne, along with a 1%
fall in the price of gold over the year.
After adjusting for these movements on revaluation accounts, the Bank’s total
comprehensive income for 2012/13 was SDR 774.9 million. This represented a
return of 4.1% on average daily equity of SDR 18,734 million. In 2011/12, the total
comprehensive income of SDR 1,607.2 million benefited from unrealised valuation
gains arising both from a rise in gold prices and from a decline in interest rates.
Taking into account the dividend for 2011/12 of SDR 168.4 million that was paid
during 2012/13, the Bank’s equity increased by SDR 606.5 million during the year
ended 31 March 2013.

Proposed dividend
The Board’s review of the BIS dividend policy in 2009/10 took into consideration
the Bank’s capital needs and the interests of BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair and
sustainable return on their investments in BIS shares. In framing the dividend policy,
the Board adopted a number of governing principles, which are:
•
First, the Bank should maintain a strong capital base at all times, including
during financial stress.
•
Second, the dividend should be relatively stable, set at a sustainable level and
changing in a predictable manner each year.
•
Third, while the Bank’s dividend policy should provide guidance for the
medium term, the dividend should continue to reflect the prevailing financial
circumstances of the Bank, and the Board’s proposal to the AGM should remain
an annual decision.
The policy, which is due to be reviewed again in 2014/15, ensures that earnings
are retained to augment the Bank’s capital at a rate sufficient to support its

BIS 83rd Annual Report

121

business. The final approval of the dividend coincides with the outcome of the
annual economic capital allocation process (see item 2, “Economic capital”, in the
“Capital adequacy” section of the financial statements), enabling the Board to set
an appropriate dividend while ensuring that the Bank’s capital base remains strong.
In normal circumstances, this results in a dividend which increases steadily by
SDR 10 per share per annum (the “normal dividend”), while retaining the flexibility
to vary the dividend in years of low or high profits.
Consistent with this dividend policy, the Board proposes for the financial year
2012/13 to declare a normal dividend of SDR 315 per share, SDR 10 per share
above the normal dividend for 2011/12. The dividend policy foresees the possibility
of a supplementary dividend in a year when profits are high and the Bank’s capital
strength allows. With the current low interest rate environment constraining the
Bank’s underlying profitability (and hence its capital generating capacity), no
supplementary dividend is proposed for 2012/13.
At 31 March 2013, there were 559,125 issued and fully paid shares. This includes
the 1,000 shares of the Albanian issue, which are suspended and held in treasury. The
normal dividend will be paid on 558,125 shares, with no dividend paid on the
1,000 shares held in treasury. The total cost of the proposed dividend would be
SDR 175.8 million, after which SDR 722.4 million would be available for allocation to
reserves. The dividend would be paid on 28 June 2013 in one of the component
currencies of the SDR (US dollar, euro, yen or sterling) or in Swiss francs according to the
instructions of each shareholder named in the Bank’s share register at 31 March 2013.

Reserves adjustment for revised accounting policy in 2013/14
With effect from 1 April 2013, the Bank has changed its accounting policy for postemployment benefit obligations to reflect developments in global financial
standards. The change, which will be applied in the 2013/14 financial statements,
requires statutory reserves to be reduced by SDR 89.7 million, representing the
cumulative change in profit recognition as a result of applying the revised
accounting policy. To this end, the Board proposes to deduct the aforementioned
amount from the free reserve fund. Further details on the revised accounting policy
can be found in note 3 to the financial statements.

Proposed application of net profit for 2012/13 and reserves
adjustment for revised accounting policy in 2013/14
On the basis of Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the General Meeting apply the net profit for the year of SDR 898.2 million in
the following manner:
(a) SDR 175.8 million to be paid as a normal dividend of SDR 315 per share;
(b) SDR 36.1 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund;14
(c) SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund; and
(d) SDR 680.3 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to be
transferred to the free reserve fund.
In addition, the Board recommends that, to achieve the decrease in the Bank’s
statutory reserves resulting from the change of accounting policy described in
note 3 to the financial statements, SDR 89.7 million be deducted from the free
reserve fund.
14

122

The general reserve fund exceeded five times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2013. As
such, under Article 51 of the Statutes, 5% of net profit, after accounting for the proposed dividend,
should be allocated to the general reserve fund.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Independent auditor
Election of the auditor
In accordance with Article 46 of the Bank’s Statutes, the Annual General Meeting of
the Bank is invited to elect an independent auditor for the ensuing year and to fix
the auditor’s remuneration. This election is based on a formal proposal by the
Board, which in turn is based on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. This
annual process ensures a regular assessment of the knowledge, competence and
independence of the auditor, and of the effectiveness of the audit. The 2012 Annual
General Meeting elected Ernst & Young as the Bank’s auditor for the financial year
ended 31 March 2013. The Board policy is to rotate the auditor on a regular basis,
with the new auditor chosen following a selection process involving the Bank’s
Management and the Audit Committee. The financial year ended 31 March 2013 was
the first year of Ernst & Young’s term as auditor. The previous auditor, Deloitte AG,
served a term of seven years.

Report of the auditor
In accordance with Article 50 of the Bank’s Statutes, the independent auditor has
full powers to examine all books and accounts of the Bank and to require full
information as to all its transactions. The Bank’s financial statements have been duly
audited by Ernst & Young, who have confirmed that they give a true and fair view
of the Bank’s financial position at 31 March 2013 and the results of its operations
for the year then ended. The Ernst & Young report is to be found immediately
following the financial statements.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise stated.

into SDR at an average rate. Exchange differences arising from
the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities and from the
settlement of transactions are included as net foreign exchange
gains or losses in the profit and loss account.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities that
are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the economic
benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by the
Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as well as
the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank are not
included in these financial statements. Information on offbalance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in note 32.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the nature
of the financial instrument and the purpose for which it was
entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading currencies
according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the Executive Board of
the IMF on 30 December 2010 and effective 1 January 2011. As
currently calculated, one SDR is equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.660, EUR 0.423, JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. Prior to
1 January 2011, one SDR was equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.632, EUR 0.410, JPY 18.4 and GBP 0.0903. The change in
the composition of the SDR basket was such that the values of
the SDR under the old and new baskets were equivalent at
31 December 2010 and no significant gains or losses resulted
from the change in the weights of the currencies. The
composition of the SDR currency basket is subject to review
every five years by the IMF; the next review is due to be
undertaken in December 2015.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in SDR
millions unless otherwise stated.

3. Currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other assets
and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange rates ruling
at the date of the transaction. Profits and losses are translated

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The resulting designation of each financial instrument determines
the accounting methodology that is applied, as described in
the accounting policies below. Where the financial instrument
is designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, the
Bank does not subsequently change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and related
banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold on
behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank takes limited
gold price, interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in its
banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The use
of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is described in
Section 9 below.
All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated as
loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

131

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR, which
are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of bonds.
Currency assets in investment portfolios, with the exception of
cash and sight accounts with banks and those in more actively
traded portfolios, are designated as available for sale.
The currency investment assets maintained in more actively
traded portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated
as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The Bank’s
own gold holdings are designated as available for sale.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts as a
market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities. As a
result of this activity the Bank incurs realised profits and losses
on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies, the
market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an overall
fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in its currency banking portfolios. The realised and
unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are
thus largely offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits
on the related currency banking assets and derivatives, or on
other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios as
held at fair value through profit and loss.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the balance
sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest where
applicable.

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets, including
balances at futures clearing brokers. They typically have notice
periods of three days or less and are included under the
balance sheet heading “Loans and advances”. They are
considered to be cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash
flow statement.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as loans and receivables. They are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest.
Interest is included in interest income on an accruals basis.

10. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair value
through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank maintains certain
actively traded investment portfolios. The currency investment
assets in these portfolios are trading assets and as such are
designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance sheet
on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and amortisation
of premiums paid and discounts received are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the currency
assets are revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under “Net valuation
movement”.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities
Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days or
less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included in interest expense on
an accruals basis.

132

11. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss
As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with the
exception of sight and notice deposit account liabilities, are
designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest to
be paid and amortisation of premiums received and discounts
paid are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are revalued to
fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under “Net valuation movement”.

12. Currency investment assets available for sale

15. Gold loans
Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at their
weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.
Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates as available for sale all
of the relevant assets in its currency investment portfolios,
except for those assets in the Bank’s more actively traded
investment portfolios.
These currency investment assets are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest income”
on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency investment assets are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement
in fair value is included in the statement of comprehensive
income under the heading “Unrealised gain / (loss) on securities
available for sale”. Realised profits on disposal are included in
the profit and loss account under “Net gain on sales of securities
available for sale”.

16. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.
Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a general
claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same weight and
quality as that delivered by the customer to the Bank, but do
not provide the right to specific gold bars. Unallocated gold
deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and
USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. Accrued
interest on gold deposits is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide depositors
with a claim for delivery of the specific gold bars deposited by
the customer with the Bank on a custody basis. Beneficial
ownership and risk remain with the customer. As such, allocated
gold deposit liabilities and the related gold bar assets are not
included on the Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as offbalance sheet items (see note 32).

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the balance
sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair value on a
trade date basis.

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central banks
and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on a
settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold are
treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 17 below.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets
The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios as
loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives included in
the portfolios are designated as held at fair value through profit
and loss.
Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in gold
in the banking portfolios are included under “Net foreign
exchange gain / (loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

133

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and accounted
for as available for sale assets.

Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host contract
which is not accounted for as held at fair value through profit
and loss, it is separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though it were a standalone derivative
as described above.

Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment assets
over their deemed cost are taken to the gold revaluation
account in equity, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”.

20. Valuation policy

For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when the
Bank changed its functional and presentation currency from
the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is approximately
SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of USD 208 that was
applied from 1979 to 2003 following a decision by the Bank’s
Board of Directors, translated at the 31 March 2003 exchange rate.

The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the Board
of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how financial
instruments are designated, which determines their valuation
basis and accounting treatment. This policy is supplemented
with detailed valuation procedures.

Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment assets
are included in the profit and loss account as “Net gain on sales
of gold investment assets”.

18. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the management of
currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss, they
are designated as financial instruments held at fair value
through profit and loss. Where these liabilities are associated
with currency assets available for sale, they are designated as
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade date
basis. The accrual of interest is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.
After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as held at
fair value through profit and loss are revalued to fair value, with
unrealised gains or losses included under “Net valuation
movement”.

19. Derivatives
Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market risk
or for trading purposes. They are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis. The accrual of interest and amortisation of premiums
paid and discounts received are included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate basis.

The majority of the financial instruments on the balance sheet
are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair value of a
financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in
an arm’s length transaction.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting to the
Board and shareholders reflects the way in which the banking
business is managed and is consistent with the risk management
and economic performance figures reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets
as the best evidence of fair value. Where no published price
quotations exist, the Bank determines fair values using a
valuation technique appropriate to the particular financial
instrument. Such valuation techniques may involve using
market prices of recent arm’s length market transactions in
similar instruments or may make use of financial models. Where
financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum
use of observable market inputs (eg interest rates and
volatilities) as appropriate, and relies as little as possible on its
own estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values,
the valuation models are subject to initial approval and periodic
review in line with the requirements of the Bank’s model
validation policy.
The Bank has an independent valuation control function which
periodically reviews the value of its financial instruments, taking
into account both the accuracy of the valuations and the
valuation methodologies used. Other valuation controls include
the review and analysis of daily profit and loss.
The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its liabilities
at the offer price. Derivative financial instruments are valued
on a bid-offer basis, with valuation reserves, where necessary,
included in derivative financial liabilities. Financial assets and
liabilities that are not valued at fair value are included in the
balance sheet at amortised cost.

After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with all
realised and unrealised movements in value included under
“Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities, depending
on whether the contract has a positive or a negative fair value
for the Bank.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

21. Impairment of financial assets

24. Provisions

Financial assets, other than those designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss, are assessed for indications of
impairment at each balance sheet date. A financial asset is
impaired when there is objective evidence that the estimated
future cash flows of the asset have been reduced as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the asset. Evidence of impairment could include significant
financial difficulty, default, or probable bankruptcy / financial
reorganisation of the counterparty or issuer.

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of events arising before the
balance sheet date and it is probable that economic resources
will be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Best
estimates and assumptions are used when determining the
amount to be recognised as a provision.

Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a decline in
fair value below amortised cost is considered significant or
prolonged. Impairment of currency assets is included in the
profit and loss account under “Net valuation movement”, with
impairment of gold loans included under “Interest income”. If
the amount of the impairment loss decreases in a subsequent
period, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment does not exceed that which it would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

25. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit arrangements
for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and health and accident
insurance for current and former staff members. An independent
actuarial valuation is performed annually for each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions

22. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally very
short-term amounts relating to the settlement of financial
transactions. They are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

23. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is capitalised
and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:

•
•
•
•

Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and equipment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to that
amount.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits
due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance
sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at the balance
sheet date, together with adjustments for unrecognised
actuarial gains and losses and past service costs. The defined
benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is
determined from the estimated future cash outflows. The rate
used to discount the cash flows is determined by the Bank
based on the market yield of highly rated corporate debt
securities in Swiss francs which have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the sum of the current service cost of the benefits accruing for
the year under the scheme, and interest at the discount rate on
the defined benefit obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and
losses arising from experience adjustments (where the actual
outcome is different from the actuarial assumptions previously
made), changes in actuarial assumptions and amendments to
the pension fund regulations are charged to the profit and loss
account over the service period of staff concerned in accordance
with the “corridor accounting” methodology described below.
The resulting liabilities are included under the heading “Other
liabilities” in the balance sheet.

135

B. Directors’ pensions

26. Cash flow statement

The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit arrangement
for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined benefit obligation
and amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect
of the Directors’ pension arrangement are calculated on a
similar basis to that used for the staff pension fund.

The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an indirect
method. It is based on the movements in the Bank’s balance
sheet, adjusted for changes in financial transactions awaiting
settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, which are very short-term financial assets
that typically have notice periods of three days or less.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health and
accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability, benefit
obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss account
in respect of the health and accident benefit arrangement are
calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff pension
fund.

D. Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience adjustments
(where the actual outcome is different from the actuarial
assumptions previously made), changes in actuarial assumptions
and amendments to the pension fund regulations. Where the
cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains or losses exceed the
higher of the benefit obligation or any assets used to fund the
obligation by more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess
outside the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an international financial institution which was established pursuant to the Hague
Agreements of 20 January 1930, the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2,
4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of
China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide additional
facilities for international financial operations and to act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. Sixty central banks are
currently members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the number of BIS
shares issued in the respective countries. The Board of Directors of the BIS is composed of the Governors and appointed Directors from the
Bank’s founding central banks, being those of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as
well as the Governors of the central banks of Canada, China, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland, and the President of the
European Central Bank.

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at these estimates, Management uses available information, makes assumptions
and exercises judgment.
Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities, the assessment of postemployment benefit obligations and the assessment of provisions and contingent liabilities.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the designation and valuation
of financial instruments are another key element in the preparation of these financial statements. In particular, the valuation of derivative
financial instruments involves a significant amount of judgment over the discount curve to be used and the adjustments necessary to allow
for credit risk and collateral.
Subsequent actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

A. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
There is no active secondary market for certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets and liabilities are valued
using valuation techniques which require judgment to determine appropriate valuation parameters. Changes in assumptions about these
parameters could significantly affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of a 1 basis point change in spread assumptions is shown
in the table below:

B. Impairment provision on financial assets
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2013 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2012: nil).

C. Actuarial assumptions
The valuation of the Bank’s pension fund and health care arrangements relies on actuarial assumptions which include expectations of
inflation, interest rates, medical cost inflation and retirement age and life expectancy of participants. Changes to these assumptions have
an impact on the valuation of the Bank’s pension fund liabilities and the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

3. Future change in accounting policy for post-employment benefit obligations
With effect from 1 April 2013, the Bank has changed its accounting policy for post-employment benefit obligations to reflect developments
in global financial reporting standards. As a result of the change, the Bank will no longer apply corridor accounting for actuarial gains and
losses and all changes in the net defined benefit liabilities or assets will be recognised when they occur. Service costs and the net interest
will be recognised in the profit and loss account while re-measurements, such as actuarial gains and losses, will be recognised in other
comprehensive income. In addition, the interest cost and the expected return on assets will be replaced with a net interest amount
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liabilities.
The change will be applied in the 2013/14 financial statements, and the reported numbers for the current financial year will be restated for
comparative purposes. The restatement will result in an increase in other liabilities of SDR 511.7 million and a corresponding decrease in
shareholders’ equity, reflecting the recognition of the net unrecognised actuarial loss as at 31 March 2013. Of this amount in shareholders’
equity, SDR 89.7 million will be deducted from the free reserve, representing the cumulative change in profit recognition as a result of
applying the revised accounting policies. The remaining SDR 422.0 million will be deducted from a new account in other equity, representing
the cumulative actuarial gains and losses. Further changes in the profit and loss account will result from the new net interest amount
calculation and the removal of the amortisation of actuarial gains and losses. The 2013/14 financial statements will provide full details on
this accounting policy change.

4. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks consist of cash balances with central banks and commercial banks that are available to the Bank on demand.

Included in “Gold” is SDR 13,836.1 million (404 tonnes) of gold (2012: SDR 12,262.8 million; 355 tonnes) that the Bank holds in connection
with its gold swap contracts. Under such contracts the Bank exchanges currencies for physical gold, and has an obligation to return the
gold at the end of the contract. See note 8 for more details on gold swap transactions.

B. Gold investment assets
The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed cost value is included in the gold revaluation
account, which is reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”; the movement in this value is included in the
statement of comprehensive income under the heading “Unrealised gain on gold investment assets”. Realised gains or losses on the disposal
of gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and loss account under the heading “Net gain on sales of gold investment assets”.
Note 18B provides further analysis of the gold revaluation account. Note 27 provides further analysis of the net gain on sales of gold
investment assets.

At 31 March 2013 the Bank’s gold investment assets amounted to 115 tonnes of fine gold (2012: 116 tonnes).

6. Currency assets
A. Total holdings
Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans and advances, and government and
other securities.
Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss comprise those currency banking assets that represent the reinvestment of currency
deposit liabilities along with currency investment assets that are part of more actively traded portfolios. The remaining part of the Bank’s
currency investment assets are categorised as available for sale and, together with the gold investment assets, largely represent the
investment of the Bank’s equity.
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are usually short-term transactions under which the Bank
makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the loan is fixed at the beginning
of the transaction, and there is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent securities subject to the repayment of the loan. During
the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral securities and may call for additional collateral or be required
to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with commercial banks. Also included in this category are investments made with central
banks, international institutions and other public sector organisations. This includes advances made as part of committed and uncommitted
standby facilities. These loans are recognised in the balance sheet total “Loans and advances”, which also includes notice accounts (see note 7).

BIS 83rd Annual Report

139

Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate bonds, covered bonds and
asset-backed securities.

Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed and
uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial assets, typically
having a notice period of three days or less.
Fixed-term loans and advances are designated as held at fair value through profit and loss. Notice accounts are designated as loans and
receivables and are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost. At 31 March 2013, the balance held in the futures clearing accounts
totalled SDR 34.1 million (2012: SDR 40.3 million).

(2012: SDR –1.7 million).

8. Derivative financial instruments
The Bank uses the following types of derivative instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or bond prices
on a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by cash or marketable
securities.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

141

Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to either
buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to exchange cash
flows related to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest rate swaps involve the
exchange of cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the difference
between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a currency or
interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see note 11). Where the host contract is not
accounted for as held at fair value, embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract for accounting purposes and treated as
though they are regular derivatives. As such, the gold currency options embedded in gold dual currency deposits are included within
derivatives as currency and gold options.

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10 years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between June 2013 and March
2014 (2012: September 2012 and March 2013). The balance sheet total for callable MTIs includes the fair value of the embedded interest
rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line with prevailing
market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS, typically with a maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between April 2013 and May 2013 (2012: in April 2012 and May 2012).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less. They are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these financial
instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.

A. Valuation of currency deposits
Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value. This value differs from
the amount that the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity to the holder of the deposit. The amount the Bank is contractually
obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits (including accrued interest to 31 March 2013) is SDR 165,182.2 million
(2012: SDR 194,313.6 million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques comprise discounted cash
flow models and option pricing models. The discounted cash flow models value the expected cash flows of financial instruments using
discount factors that are partly derived from quoted interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based on assumptions about spreads
at which each product is offered to and repurchased from customers.

144

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The spread assumptions are based on recent market transactions in each product. Where the product series has been closed to new
investors (and thus there are no recent market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted spread for the series as the basis for determining
the appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about volatilities that are derived from market quotes.

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated,
the value of its liabilities would decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss account.
The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its creditworthiness did
not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

12. Gold deposits
Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost.

13. Accounts payable
Accounts payable consist of financial transactions awaiting settlement, relating to short-term payables (typically payable within three days
or less) where transactions have been effected but cash has not yet been transferred. This includes assets that have been purchased and
liabilities that have been repurchased.

14. Other liabilities

During the financial year ended 31 March 2012 the Bank issued 3,000 shares each to the Bank of the Republic (Colombia), the Central Bank
of Luxembourg, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates. This increased the number of member
central banks to 60 (31 March 2011: 56). There were no new shares issued in the financial year ended 31 March 2013.
The number of shares eligible for dividend is:

16. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the proposal of the Board of
Directors to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend reserve fund; the
remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be allocated to the
general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve fund,
which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the
Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to the free
reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded, with the
remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the Bank. In
the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs of
liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

The balances in the Bank’s statutory reserves are also affected by the future implementation of the new accounting policy for postemployment benefits (see note 3). It is proposed to deal with this by deducting SDR 89.7 million from the free reserve fund. Assuming that
the Annual General Meeting approves the proposed profit allocation and the deduction from the free reserve fund following the change
in accounting policy, the balances in the Bank’s statutory reserves at the date of the Annual General Meeting would be:

19. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund without separate legal
personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of current and former members
of staff who participate in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this arrangement is based in principle
on the employee remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the completion of a minimum service period of 10 years.
All arrangements are valued annually by independent actuaries.

The assumed increases in staff salaries, Directors’ pensionable remuneration and pensions payable incorporate an inflation assumption of
1.5% at 31 March 2013 (2012: 1.5%).
The expected rate of return on fund assets is based on long-term expectations for inflation, interest rates, risk premia and asset allocations.
The estimate takes into consideration historical returns and is determined in conjunction with the fund’s independent actuaries.
The assumption for medical inflation has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the profit and loss account. A 1% change in the
assumption for medical inflation compared to that used for the 2012/13 calculation would have the following effects:

terms of this document the Bank is exempted from virtually all direct and indirect taxes at both federal and local government level in
Switzerland.
Similar agreements exist with the government of the People’s Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR and with the Mexican
government for the Americas Office.

The above table includes the nominal value of securities held under safe custody and collateral pledge arrangements, and the net asset
value of portfolio management mandates. Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs), which are collective
investment arrangements for central banks, and dedicated mandates for single central bank investors.
Gold bars held under earmark comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They are included
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2013 gold bars held under
earmark amounted to 324 tonnes of fine gold (2012: 323 tonnes).
The financial instruments listed in the above schedule are deposited with external custodians, either central banks or commercial institutions.
In addition to the off-balance sheet items listed above, the Bank also manages portfolios of BIS currency deposits on behalf of its customers.
These totalled SDR 6,532.6 million at 31 March 2013 (2012: SDR 6,253.2 million). The assets in these portfolios are included in the balance
sheet under the heading “Currency deposits”.

33. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. At 31 March 2013
the outstanding commitments to extend credit under these committed standby facilities amounted to SDR 3,053.8 million (2012:
SDR 2,570.6 million), of which SDR 200.1 million was uncollateralised (2012: SDR 193.8 million).
The Bank is also committed to supporting the operation of the Financial Stability Board, the International Association of Deposit Insurers
and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. The services provided include premises, equipment, and logistical, administrative
and staffing-related support. The BIS support is subject to an annual budgetary decision of the BIS Board, and associated costs are included
in the Bank’s operating expense as they accrue.

34. The fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in
measuring fair value. The valuation is categorised at the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – inputs other than those in level 1 are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as a price) or indirectly (ie derived
from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – inputs are not observable in financial markets.

The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets as the best evidence of fair value. The financial instruments valued using
active market quotes are categorised as level 1.
Where reliable published price quotations are not available for a financial instrument, the Bank determines fair value by using market
standard valuation techniques. These valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow models as well as other standard market
valuation methods. Where financial models are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable market inputs. The financial
instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 2.
A small percentage of the Bank’s financial instruments valuations are produced using valuation techniques that utilise significant unobservable
inputs. The financial instruments valued in this manner are categorised as level 3. The financial instruments categorised as level 3 at
31 March 2012 comprised illiquid bonds. At 31 March 2013 the Bank had no financial instruments categorised as level 3.
The accuracy of the Bank’s valuations is ensured through an independent price verification exercise performed by the valuation control
function.

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The assessment is supported by an annual capital and business planning process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital Measurement and
Capital Standards (Basel II framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2006. The implementation includes
all three pillars of the framework, and takes the particular scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into account. Since the Bank is not subject
to national banking supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited to the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy. This
assessment is based primarily on an economic capital methodology which is more comprehensive and geared to a substantially higher
solvency level than the minimum Pillar 1 capital level required by the Basel II framework.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s own assessment of its capital adequacy is performed on the basis of its economic capital frameworks for credit risk, market risk,
operational risk and other risks. These are designed to determine the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising from its exposures
to a statistical level of confidence consistent with the objective of maintaining superior credit quality. The Bank’s economic capital frameworks
measure economic capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation
for credit risk) and other risks. The amount of economic capital set aside for settlement risk and other risks, ie risks which are not, or not
fully, reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations, is based on an assessment by Management.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks:

The Basel II framework includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital requirements.
In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this approach,
the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs.
For certain exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped to exposure
types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced measurement
approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The minimum capital requirements are derived from
the VaR figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking into account the 8% minimum capital requirement.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

4. Tier 1 capital ratio
The capital ratio measures capital adequacy by comparing the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its risk-weighted assets. The table below shows the

As required by the Basel II framework, expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal ratings-based
approach. The expected loss is calculated at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision which is reflected in the
Bank’s financial statements. The Bank had no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2013 or 31 March 2012. Note 2B to the financial
statements provides details of the impairment provision. In accordance with the requirements of the Basel II framework, the expected loss
is compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering its specific characteristics.
As such, it maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the minimum requirement.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence. The BIS
engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity, each of which
may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management policies
designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the Bank’s
strategic positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is assisted
by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee.
The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the Bank’s strategic planning and
the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial management and policy issues related to the banking
business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an
advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management
throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk control
function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit.
Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to provide
reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s
Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance issues. The
Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee
to the Board of Directors.

172

BIS 83rd Annual Report

The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent valuation
control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget.
The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its valuation policy and
procedures, and that the processes and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance
unit reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.
The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal Service has
a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and industry best
practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee and is responsible to the General Manager and
the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant units.
Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are regularly provided to enable Management to adequately
assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit. The Banking and
Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives an annual report from the Risk Control unit. The
preparation of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into account
necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial instruments and
for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of its changing risk environment
and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or materially
changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk (VaR)
techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank measured to a
specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon. VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market
data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate from past events. VaR models may underestimate potential losses if changes in risk factors
fail to align with the distribution assumptions. VaR figures do not provide any information on losses that may occur beyond the assumed
confidence level.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses arising from its exposures
to a statistical level of confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the highest creditworthiness.
The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of economic capital frameworks for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other
risks, supplemented by sensitivity and risk factor analyses. The Bank’s economic capital frameworks measure economic capital to a 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside based on
Management’s assessment of risks which are not, or not fully, reflected in the economic capital calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital calculations for
financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes the analysis of severe
historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements of the key
risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk.

BIS 83rd Annual Report

173

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and conditions.
A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are complemented by
more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control function,
individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18 rating grades. As
part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of credit limits covering
individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits are
reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal
repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board of Directors.
On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on the Bank’s
economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR model. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is further mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff
agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by sector,
geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in the
case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised cost net of any impairment
charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar assets held in custody, and accounts
receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by G10 governments and financial institutions rated A– or above by
at least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties in these sectors
mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2013 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (31 March 2012: nil). As at 31 March 2013 no financial assets were considered past due
(31 March 2012: nil). During the period ended 31 March 2012 the Bank recorded a credit loss of SDR 31.9 million due to a sovereign debt
restructuring. No credit loss was recognised for the financial year ended 31 March 2013.

Default risk by asset class and issuer type
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk by asset class and issuer type, without taking into account any collateral
held or other credit enhancements available to the Bank. “Public sector” includes international and other public sector institutions.

C. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The corresponding assets and
liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The Bank requires counterparties to provide collateral, under reverse repurchase agreements, some derivative financial instrument contracts
and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective policies and procedures.
During the term of the agreement, the Bank monitors the fair value of the collateral securities and may call for further collateral or be
required to return collateral based on the movement in its market value.
The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established clearing centres and by settling transactions where possible through a delivery
versus payment settlement mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on a continuous basis.
The table below shows the collateral obtained by the Bank. It excludes transactions which have yet to settle (on which neither cash nor
collateral has been exchanged).

The Bank is allowed to sell or pledge collateral obtained, but must deliver equivalent financial instruments upon expiry of the contract. The
Bank accepts sovereign securities and cash as collateral for derivatives. Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements comprises
sovereign and supranational debt as well as state agency securities. Eligible collateral for loans and advances includes currency deposits with
the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and securities in portfolios managed by the BIS.
At 31 March 2013 the total amount of undrawn facilities which could be drawn down subject to collateralisation by the counterparty was
SDR 2,853.7 million (2012: SDR 2,376.8 million).
The Bank may provide cash or securities collateral on its derivatives contracts. At 31 March 2013 the Bank had provided SDR 0.3 million of
Treasury bills and cash as collateral in connection with futures and interest rate swap contracts (31 March 2012: SDR 0.3 million).

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR model, assuming a one-year
time horizon and a 99.995% confidence interval, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk). The amount of
economic capital set aside for settlement risk reflected in the Bank’s economic capital calculations is based on an assessment by Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk
Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach that is
consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk weights derived
from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant
to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD as the
notional amount of all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivatives contracts and certain collateralised exposures. The EAD
for derivatives is calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II framework. In line
with this methodology, the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated loss-givendefault (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank is not in
a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates counterparty PD estimates through a mapping
of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are derived from
external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained giving consideration
to market price volatility, remargining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained for
derivatives contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits into
account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2013 includes SDR 303.6 million for interest rate contracts
(31 March 2012: SDR 421.4 million) and SDR 761.3 million for FX and gold contracts (31 March 2012: SDR 726.5 million).

Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given the scope of
the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II framework are determined according to the standardised approach for
securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant risk weights. External
credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets
are then derived as the product of the notional amounts of the exposures and the associated risk weights.

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital based on a VaR
methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated, subject to an exponential
weighting scheme, over a four-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence interval
assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a framework set by the
Board of Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a comprehensive
regular backtesting framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed and reported to
Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with a series of
stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 115 tonnes (2012:
116 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2013 the Bank’s
net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 3,944.9 million (2012: SDR 4,018.2 million), approximately 21% of its equity (2012: 22%). The
Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold price
risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads. The Bank
is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its investment portfolios
and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account movements in
relevant money market rates, government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and GBP. Currency risk is the
exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily
through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between central and commercial banks. The
Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular basis,
and by limiting currency exposures arising from customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold position in
these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need
to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive at the net
currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations between risk
factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the 99.995% confidence
interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes in the USD value of gold. The
foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the SDR, is included in the measurement of
foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II framework, the Bank has adopted a banking book
approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are determined for gold
price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is derived using the VaR-based
internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR methodology, assuming a 99% confidence
interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily VaR
measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three plus a
potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers observed
remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development relevant to the calculation

5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral needs
without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public institutions are the
key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit
instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank has developed a liquidity management framework based on a statistical model
underpinned by conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and the liquidity of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board of
Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires liquid assets to be at least 100% of the potential liquidity requirement.
In addition, liquidity stress tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios are performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity
requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The Bank’s liquidity has consistently been materially above its minimum liquidity ratio
and the requirements of its stress tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 95% (2012: 91%) of its total
liabilities. At 31 March 2013 currency and gold deposits originated from 168 depositors (2012: 172). Within these deposits, there are
significant individual customer concentrations, with five customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a settlement date basis
(2012: five customers).
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows
to which the Bank is committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood, implemented,
followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of operational
risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the monitoring of key risk
indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and Operational Risk
Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR approach using
a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under the Basel II framework.
In line with the assumptions of the Basel II framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take reputational risk into account.
Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank does not take potential protection it may obtain
from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital for
operational risk to the 99.995% confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s
exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years.

Independent auditor’s report
to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements, which
comprise of the balance sheet as at 31 March 2013, the related profit and loss account, statement of
comprehensive income, statement of cash flows and movements in the Bank’s equity for the year then
ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system
relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error. Management is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting
policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical responsibilities and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the
entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 give a true and fair view of
the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial
statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
