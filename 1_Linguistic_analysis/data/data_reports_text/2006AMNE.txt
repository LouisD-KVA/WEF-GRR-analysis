A YEA R I N
P E RS PECTIVE: A
G LASS HALF F U LL
BY I RENE KHAN, SECRETARY GENERAL,
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
Krishna Pahadi, a human rights activist in Nepal, has
been detained 28 times by the government. When I met
him in a police detention centre in Kathmandu in
February 2005, shortly after he had been arrested for
the 27th time, his message was surprisingly upbeat. The
more the regime locks up peaceful protesters like him,
he told me, the more it strengthens the cause of human
rights. Widespread political unrest and international
condemnation of the Nepalese government's actions
support Krishna's views. Deprived of any reading
material in prison except religious books, he had
finished reading the Bhagavad Gita and was about to
begin the Bible, to be followed by the Our'an. He has no
doubt that his struggle and that of others like him will
prevail. i t is only a matter of time, he said.
Krishna is not daunted. Nor am I, despite the abuse
and injustice, violence and violations across the globe
documented in the Amnesty International Report 2006.
The human rights landscape is littered with broken
promises and failures of leadership. Governments
profess to champion the cause of human rights but
show repressive reflexes when it comes to their own
policies and performance. Grave abuses in Afghanistan
and I raq cast a shadow over much of the human rights
debate, as torture and terror feed off each other in a
vicious cycle. The brutality and intensity of attacks by
armed groups in these and other countries grow, taking
a heavy toll on human lives.
Nevertheless, a closer look at the events of 2005
gives me reason for hope. There were some clear signs
that a turning point may be in sight after five years of
backlash against human rights in the name of counter-

Rights and Peace Society a nd

terrorism. Over the past year, some of the world's most
powerful governments have received an
uncomfortable wake-up cal l about the dangers of
undervaluing the human rights dimension of their
actions at home and abroad. Their doublespeak and
deception have been exposed by the media, challenged
by activists and rejected by the courts.
I also see other signs for optimism. The overal l
number o f conflicts worldwide continues t o fall, thanks
to international conflict management, conflict
prevention and peace-building initiatives, giving hope
to millions of people in countries like Angola, Liberia
and Sierra Leone.
Institutional reform was initiated at the United
Nations (UN) to strengthen the international human
rights machinery, despite the attempt by a number of
cynical and 'spoiler" governments to block progress.
The call for justice for some of the worst crimes under
international law gained greater force across the world,
from Latin America to the Balkans. Although corrupt,
inefficient and politically biased national judiCial
systems remain a major barrier to justice, the tide is
beginning to turn against impunity in some parts of the
world. In 2005 several countries opened investigations
or conducted trials of people suspected of war crimes
and crimes against humanity. Despite the opposition of
the USA, support for the International Criminal Court
(lCC) has grown, with Mexico becoming the looth state
party to ratify the Rome Statute of the ICe. The UN
Security Council's decision to refer the situation in
Darfur to the ICC set an important precedent,
demonstrating the link between security and justice.
Ordinary people took to the streets to demand their
rights and to seek political change. In Bolivia, the
poorest country i n South America, massive protests
by indigenous communities, peasants and miners led
to the resignation of the PreSident and election to
power of the country's first ever Indigenous Head of
State. Even repressive governments found themselves
caught out by mass protest, and were forced to make
some concessions.
There will be those who will challenge my sense of
optimism. But I take strength from these developments
and, most importantly, from the extraordinary display
of global activism and human solidarity across borders;

A YEAR I N PERS PECTIVE

from the energy and commitment of Amnesty
International (AI) members worldwide; from the huge
crowds that turned out to "make poverty history" in the
lead-up to the G8 Summit; and from the outpouring of
support from ordinary people for the victims of the
tsunami in Asia, Hurricane Katrina in the USA and the
earthquake in Kashmir.
From peasant farmers protesting against land
grabbing in China to women asserting their rights on
the loth anniversary of the UN World Conference on
Women, the events of 2005 showed that the human
rights idea- together with the worldwide movement of
people that drives it forward - is more powerful and
stronger than ever.

Torture and counter-terrorism
When SUicide bombers struck a t the heart of London
in July 2005, the UK Prime Min ister Tony Blair reacted
by announcing plans that would drastically restrict
human rights and show the world that "the rules of the
game are changing". Lord Steyn, a retired Law Lord of
the U K j udiciary, responded aptly: "The maintenance
of the rule of law IS not a game. It is about access to
justice, fundamental human rights and democratic
values".
Fortunately, some of the most outrageous
provisions of the legislation proposed by the UK
government were thrown out by Parliament. The
government was defeated twice on its counter­
terrOrism legislation in 2005 the first ever
parliamentary defeats for Prime Minister Blair in his
nine years of office.
The judiciary also took the UK government to task.
The highest court in the land, the House of Lords,
rejected the government's contention that it could
use information obtained by torture by foreign
governments as evidence in UK courts. In another
case, the Court of Appeal rejected the government's
claim that UK forces in I raq were not bound by
international and domestic human rights law. It also
-

2

ruled that the system for investigating deaths of Iraqi
prisoners at the hands of UK armed forces personnel
was seriously deficient.
In the USA there was similar questioning of the Bush
Administration's claim that in its fight against terrorism
it could exempt itself from the prohibition against
torture and ill-treatment. A legislative amendment
sought to affirm the ban on torture and cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment of all prisoners by US officials
and agents, wherever they might be. Not only did the
President threaten to veto the bill, the Vice President
sought to exempt the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
from the law. The CIA itself admitted to using "water­
boarding" (simulated drowning) as an interrogation
technique, and the Attorney-General claimed that the
USA has the power to mistreat detainees abroad, so
long as they are not US citizens.
In the end, it was President Bush who blinked first
and was forced to withdraw his opposition to the bill.
However, the bill had a serious sting in its tail, with an
amendment which stripped Guantanamo detainees of
the right to file habeas corpus appeals in a federal court
and barred them from seeking court review of their
treatment or conditions of detention. Nevertheless, the
President's public climb-down was indicative of the
pressure being put on the Administration by powerful
divisions within the USA and increasing concern among
its allies abroad.
European governments squirmed as one story after
another revealed their role as junior partners of the
USA in its "war on terror". There was public outcry
following media reports of possible collusion between
the US Administration and some European
governments on "CIA black sites" - alleged secret
detention centres on European territory. Increasing
evidence that prisoners were being illegally transferred
through European airports to countries where there
was a risk they would be tortured ("extraordinary
renditions") also provoked widespread public
condemnation.

In the I ranian
capital, Tehral
June 2005.
The demand for the closure of the detention centre in
Guantanamo Bay gained greater momentum with the UN,
various European institutions, and political and opinion
leaders, including prominent US figures, adding their
voices to the growing pressure. What was once AI's lone
voice in the wilderness has now become a crescendo of
condemnation against the most blatant symbol of US
abuse of power. That strengthens our own resolve to
continue to campaign until the US Administration closes
the Guantanamo camp, discloses the truth about secret
detention centres under its control, and acknowledges
the right of detainees to be tried in accordance with
international law standards or be released.
The shifts I have identified do not mean that support
for restrictive measures has disappeared or that attacks
on human rights in the name of counter-terrorism have

diminished. The USA has not categorically rejected the
use of certain forms of torture or i l l-treatment. It has
failed to institute an independent investigation into the
role of senior US officials in the abuses committed in
Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and elsewhere, despite
growing evidence of high-level involvement.
When the British courts declared the detention of
foreigners without charge or trial to be unlawful, the UK
government immediately introduced new legislation to
hold people under virtual house arrest. It continues to
seek "diplomatic assurances" to enable it to return
people to countries where they could face torture.
The "export value" of the "war on terror" has not
decreased either. With the tacit or explicit approval of
the USA, countries like Egypt, Jordan and Yemen
continue to detain, without charge or fair trial , people
suspected of involvement in terrorism.
What is different about 2005 compared to past years
is that the public mood is changing, thanks to the work
of human rights advocates and others, which is putting
the US and European governments on the defensive.
People are no longer willing to buy the fallaciOUS
argument that reducing our liberty will increase our
security. More and more governments are being called
to account - before legislatures, in courts and other
publiC forums. More and more there is a realization that
flouting human rights and the rule of law, far from
winning the "war on terror", only creates resentment
and isolates those communities targeted by these
measures, plays into the hands of extremists, and
undermines our collective security.
Lines, however fragile, are being drawn. Voices are
being raised. This offers hope for a turning point in the
debate and a more principled approach to human rights
and security in the future.
Contrary to the statement of the UK Prime Minister,
the rules of the game have not changed. Neither security
nor human rights are well served by governments who
play games with these fundamental rules.

A YEAR I N PERSPECTIVE

We must continue to condemn in the strongest
possible terms the cowardly and heinous attacks on
civilians by armed groups. Equally strongly, we must
also resist the foolish and dangerous strategies of
governments who seek to fight terror with torture.

Reform initiatives
Growing disil lusionment and damning critiCism of the
UN human rights machinery finally led governments to
initiate some important reforms as part of a rethink of
the UN's role in international governance.
UN member states agreed to double the budget of the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
and to focus its work to a much greater extent on
protecting human rights through presence in the field.
The member states decided to jettison the
discredited UN Commission on Human Rights, and
proposed to replace it with a Human Rights Council,
elected by and accountable to the UN General
Assembly, and able to scrutinize all states, including,
first and foremost, its own members. Although a
product of compromise, the proposal represents a
significant opportunity to improve the UN human rights
machinery. Regrettably, the future of the Council hangs
in the balance as we go to press because of the refusal
of the USA to support it, ostensibly on the basis that it
has too many "defiCiencies". One state, no matter how
powerful, should not be allowed to undermine a broad,
international consensus. I hope that other
governments will resist US pressure, rally behind the
resolution and get the Council up and running.
I am encouraged by the support that governments
have shown for changes to the UN human rights
machinery. This is all the more remarkable, given the
way in which much of the UN Secretary-General's
ambitious and forward-looking package on UN
reform - including proposals to expand Security
Council membership, strengthen weapons non­
proliferation and better equip the UN to act effectively
to halt genocide - was rejected or wrecked.
I am also heartened by some less publicized gai ns in
the past year. The UN completed drafting a n
International Convention for t h e Protection of All

AI, which first began campaigning on beha lf of the
"disappeared" some 35 years ago, welcomes this
important contribution to human rights protection.
The UN appointed a Special Representative on the
issue of human rights and transnational corporations
and other business enterprises. AI though companies
can be a force for positive social and economic
development, the impact of some business operations
on human rights are deeply damaging, as shown by the
violence generated by oil and mineral interests in
places like the Niger delta in Nigeria, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Sudan, or the readiness of
the information and technology industry to fall in line
with China's restrictive policies on freedom of
expression. Yet a powerful combination of political and
business interests has managed to resist international
efforts to advance the legal accountability of business

for human rights. Despite considerable controversy
surrounding the UN Norms on business and human
rights, the issue of corporate accountability remained
firmly on the international agenda. Building on the
experience of the Norms, the task now will be to
develop a clear set of international human rights
standards and principles for corporate actors.

Rhetoric a nd reality
Institutions are only as strong as the political will of
those who govern them. Far too often, powerful
governments manipulate the UN and regional
institutions to further their narrow national interests.
The USA is a prime example, but unfortunately it is not
alone, as is evidenced by Russia's record in the
Caucasus and Central Asia, and China's expanding
economic co-operation with some of the most
repressive governments in Africa.
Those who bear the greatest responsibi l i ty for
safeguarding global security in the UN Security
Council proved in 2005 to be among the most willing
to paralyze the Council and prevent it from taking
effective action on human rights. This was clearly

ta k part In th

Forum, Porto
Alegre, Brazil,
J nua ry 2005
Amnesty I nternational Report 2006

demonstrated by the USA and the U K in relation to
I raq, and by Russia and China in the case of Sudan.
They appear oblivious to the lessons of history that
the road to strengthening global security lies through
respect for human rights.
The hypocrisy of the G8 was particularly marked in
2005. The G8 governments claimed to put eradication of
poverty in Africa high on their agenda, while continuing
to be major suppliers of arms to African governments.
Six of the eight G8 countries are among the top 10 largest
global arms exporters, and all eight export large
amounts of conventional weapons or small arms to
developing countries. This should place a particular
responsibility on the G8 to help create an effective
system of global control on arms transfers. But, despite
pressure from the UK government, the leaders of the G8
failed to agree on the need for an Arms Trade Treaty at
the Gleneagles Summit in July 2005·
However, the call for a global treaty to control
small arms gained support from at least 50 countries
around the world. The message of the campaign,
jointly led by AI, Oxfam and the International Action
Network for Sma l l Arms (JANSA), is clear: the arms
trade is out of control, and must be restrained
urgently.
Turning to regional institutions, J am disappointed
that the European Union (EU) remains a largely muted
voice on human rights. It cannot expect to maintain
its cred ibility on human rights and occupy the moral
high ground if it buries its collective head in the sand
when confronted with abuses committed by its major
political and trading partners, or closes its eyes to the
poliCies and practices of its own member states
towards refugees and asylum-seekers and on counter­
terrorism. It must be more willing to confront Russia's
appa l ling human rights failures in Chechnya. It must
also resist pressures from business to lift its arms
embargo against China. This embargo was originally

A YEAR I N PERSPECTIVE

imposed after the brutal 1 989 crackdown in
Tiananmen Square in order to show the commitment
of the EU to promoting human rights in China. It
should not be removed until the Chinese government
has made significant human rights concessions.
The African Union (AU) has developed a progreSSive
framework on human rights, and played an important
role in resolving the crisis in Togo, but it is sadly
lacking the capacity and political will to deliver on its
promises consistently. Hampered by logistical
constraints and the refusal of the Sudanese
government and armed militias to abide by
international law, AU human rights monitors could
not make a real difference on the ground in Darfur. I t
showed n o stomach t o tackle the appa l ling human
rights situation in Zimbabwe. I t failed to convince
Nigeria or Senegal to co-operate with the efforts to
bring to justice the former Liberian and Chadian
presidents Charles Taylor and Hissene Habre. African
leaders do a disservice to themselves and the African
people when they use African solidarity to shield each
other from justice and accountability.
In the face of institutional lethargy and governments'
failures, public opinion, whether In Africa, Europe or
elsewhere, is demanding a stronger commitment by
governments to human rights at home and abroad.
Thanks to human rights advocates and others, and the
growing pressure of public opinion, the international
community is being forced to acknowledge human
rights as the framework within which security and
development should be imagined and implemented.
Without respect for human rights, neither security nor
development can be sustained.
In both international and regional contexts, human
rights are increasingly being acknowledged as a
benchmark for the credibility and authority of

institutions and individual states. That is one of the
reasons why governments contested Myanmar
becoming the chair of the Association of Southeast
ASian Nations (ASEAN). That is why the EU decided in
the end not to reverse the ban on arms sales to China.
That is why India has put human rights considerations
as a key element in its approach to Nepal.
Both on principled as well as pragmatic grounds,
human rights should be seen as a critical element of
sustainable global and regional security strategies,
not as an optional extra for good times. There is no
doubt in my mind that the events of 2005 show that
the political and moral authority of governments will
be j udged more and more by their stand on human
rights a t home and abroad. Therein lies one of the
most important achievements of the human rights
movement in recent times.
There are clear chal lenges ahead. Vicious attacks by
armed groups, the increased instability in the M iddle
East, the mounting anger and isolation of Muslim
communities around the world, the forgotten
conflicts in Africa and elsewhere, growing i nequa lities
and glaring poverty - all are evidence of a dangerous
and divided world in which human rights are being
daily threatened. But far from being discouraged, I
believe these challenges make the impetus for action
even greater.
As we set our agenda for 2006, AI and its m i l l ions of
members and supporters take encouragement from
the remarkable achievements of the human rights
movement and the faith of ordinary people in the
power of human rights. We in A I do not underestimate
that power. We will use it to fight those who peddle
fear and hate, to chal lenge the myopic vision of the
world's most powerful leaders, and to hold
governments to account.

The year 2005 posed some major chal lenges for
governments: intractable conflicts, terrorist attacks,
the relentless spread of the H IV/ A I DS pandemic, the
persistence of widespread extreme poverty and
natural disasters.
These challenges should have been met with
responses based on human rights principles. All too
often they were not. Individually and collectively,
governments continued to pursue policies that often
sacrificed human rights for political or economic
expediency.
At the same time, around the world, millions of
people lent their weight to calls for greater
accountability, more transparency and greater
recognition of our shared responsibility to tackle these
global threats collectively. From the mass mobilization
around the slogan "make poverty history" to the
lawyers and activists who took on powerful states in
groundbreaking court cases, civil society pressed
governments to deliver on their responsibilities.
The year saw a growing understanding that respect
for the rule of law is essential for human security, and
that undermining human rights principles in the "war
on terror" is not a route to security. Similarly, the

failure to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social
and cultural rights was more and more widely seen as a
grave injustice and a denial of human development.
Whether in response to the urgent needs of people
caught up in natural disasters or the plight of individual
victims of government repression, the activities of
ordinary people often shamed governments into action.
Human security requires that individuals and
communities are safe not only from war, genocide and
terrorist attack, but also from hunger, disease and
natural disaster. Throughout 2005 activists campaigned
for notorious human rights violators and powerful
multinationals to be held more accountable, and for an
end to racism, discrimination and social exclusion.
Many of the human rights abuses seen in 2005
crossed national boundaries - from torture and
"renditions" to the negative impact of trade and aid
policies. While borders were being dismantled in some
aspects of international relations - particularly in the
sphere of economic transactions - they continued to
be erected in others, notably migration.
Recognition of the need for global solutions to
address global threats, from terrorism to bird flu,
undoubtedly grew. There were also many reminders of
the necessity for UN reform. These included the
continued failure of the UN Security Council to hold
rogue states accountable, the exposure of high level
corruption at the UN in the Oil for Food scandal, the
si lence which greeted the failure to meet the first of the
UN Mil lennium Development Goals and the failure of
international financial institutions to grapple with the

inequities of trade, aid and debt. The UN's own
leadership proposed a number of far-reaching
initiatives, but the l imited outcomes of the UN World
Summit in September revealed how the politics of
narrow national self-interest continued to trump
multilateralist aspirations.
Yet there was progress, notably in the area of
consolidating an emerging international justice system
in the form of the International Criminal Court, the ad
hoc international tribunals and increased use of
extraterritorial jurisdiction. After years of calls for
additional resources for the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, its budget was
significantly increased. Proposals to replace the much
discredited UN Commission on Human Rights with a U N
Human Rights Council were under discussion.
Encouraged by these moves, and above all by the
growing strength and diversity of the world's human
rights community, AI renewed its commitment to
globalizing justice as a means of realizing rights for all
in the search for human security.

TORTU RE AND TERROR
The cha l lenges that the human rights movement faced
in the wake of the attacks in the USA on 1 1 September
2001 continued. Governments continued to promote
the rhetoric that human rights are an obstacle to,
rather than an essential precondition for, human
security. However, thanks to the efforts of human
rights activists and others, there was growing criticism
of and resistance to government efforts to subordinate
human rights to security concerns.
Despite the governmental resources and efforts
committed to combating terrorism, the year saw a rising
number of attacks by individuals and armed groups
espousing a wide range of causes in many countries.
Deliberate attacks on Civilians, breaching the most
basic human rights principles, were seen around the
8

world. For example, in India in October, during the run­
up to the annual festival season, a series of bomb blasts
in Delhi left 66 people dead and more than 220 injured.
In I raq, hundreds of civilians were killed or injured in
attacks by armed groups throughout the year. In
jordan, three bombs in hotels in Amman killed 60
people in November. In the UK, bomb attacks on the
public transport system in London in july killed 52
people and injured hundreds.
Some of the counter-terrorism tactics adopted by
governments flouted human rights. Some governments
even tried to legalize or justify abusive methods that
have long been deemed i llegal by the international
community and can never be justi fied.
Thousands of men suspected of terrorism remained in
US-run detention centres around the world without any
prospect of being charged or facing a fair trial. At the end
of 2005, some 1 4,000 people detained by the USA and its
allies during military and security operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan were still held in US military detention
centres in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and
Iraq. In Guantanamo, dozens of detainees staged hunger
strikes to protest against the conditions of their
detention and were force fed.
Terrorism suspects were held by other countries too,
some of them detained for long periods without charge
or trial, including in Egypt, jordan, the UK and Yemen.
Others languished in prison facing the threat of
deportation to countries where torture was routine.
Many detainees were subjected to torture and other
i l l-treatment.
During 2005, it became increasingly clear how far
many countries had colluded or participated in
supporting abusive US policies and practices in the
'war on terror", including torture, ill-treatment, secret
and unlimited detentions and unlawful cross-border
transfers. Many governments faced demands for
greater accountabi lity and there were key judicial

decisions in defence of basic human rights principles.
Even within the US government itself, tensions
emerged over the curtailment of fundamental liberties.
Information continued to emerge in 2005 that helped
to expose some of the secret and abUSive practices
developed by states in the name of fighting terrorism.
For example, further information came to light about
the i llegal transfer of terrorism suspects from one
country to another without any judicial process - a
practice known in the USA as "extraordinary
renditions". It was revealed that the USA had, through
this practice, transferred many detainees to countries
known to use torture and other ill-treatment in
interrogations, including Egypt, Jordan, Morocco,
Saudi Arabia and Syria. Such transfers effectively
outsourced torture.
What renditions mean in reality was highlighted in
2005 by the case of Muhammad al-Assad, a Yemeni
living in Tanzania, who was arrested at his home i n Dar­
es-Salaam on 26 December 200). He was hooded,
handcuffed and flown to an unknown destination. I t
was the beginning of a 16-month ordeal o f
unacknowledged detention a n d i nterrogation, in which
he had no contact with the outside world and no idea
where he was.
He was held for a year in a secret facility where he
was subjected to extreme sensory deprivation. His
masked guards never spoke a word to him, but
communicated their instructions in sign language.
There was a constant low-level hum of white noise.
Artificial light was kept on 24 hours a day. Muhammad
al-Assad's father was told by Tanzanian offiCials that
his son had been turned over to US custody, and that no
one knew where he was. H is family heard nothing of
him until he was flown to Yemen in May 2005, where he
was imprisoned, apparently at the request of the US
authorities. Muhammad al-Assad was still in custody in
Yemen Without charge or trial at the end of 2005.
Other testimonies from former detainees collected
during 2005 by AI were shockingly Similar to the
experience described by Muhammad al-Assad. Two
other Yemeni men were transferred to Yemen by the
USA in May 2005, where they remained i n custody
without charge or trial at the end of the year. I n
separate i nterviews with A I in J une, September and
October 2005, all three described being held in
isolation for 16 to 18 months i n secret detention centres
run by US offiCials. The interviews conducted by AI
provided strong new evidence of the US network of
secret detention centres around the world.
In December 2005, after the U K Foreign Secretary
said that he was not aware of any renditions flights
refue l l i ng or using other faCili ties i n the UK since
early 2001, AI published details of three flights that
refuelled i n the UK, hours after transferring detainees
to countries where they risked "disappearance",
torture or other i l l-treatment. I n formation
i ncreasingly came to light in 2005, partly because
eVidence was uncovered by victims themselves and
partly due to governmental inquiries, that other
European countries may have been Simi larly Involved
in secret transfers. I nq u iries were conducted in
Amnesty International Report 2006

Germany, I taly and Sweden into the role of
government offiCials in speCific rendition cases; in
Spain, an investigation was opened by the Spanish
authorities into the use of Spanish airports and
airspace by aircraft operated by the US Central
I ntel ligence Agency (CIA). In Iceland, I reland and the
Netherlands, government offiCials or activists called
for official inquiries.
I nvestigations by journalists, AI and others in 2005
left l ittle doubt that the US government was running a
system of covert prisons, known as "black sites". There
were persistent reports that the CIA had operated such
secret detention centres in Afghanistan, I raq, Jordan,
Pakistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan and other unknown
locations in Europe and elsewhere, including on the
British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. About
three dozen detainees deemed to have high
intelligence value had "disappeared" in US custody, and
were allegedly being held in black Sites, completely
outSide the protection of the law.
In November the Council of Europe launched an
investigation into reports that the network of US secret
prisons and involvement in renditions included sites i n
Europe. AI strongly endorsed calls t o European
governments to investigate such allegations by officials
of the Council of Europe, one of whom declared: "not
knowing is not good enough regardless of whether
ignorance is intentional or aCCidental".
At a conference jOintly organized by AI and the UK­
based NGO Reprieve in London in November, former
detainees and fami lies of detainees held in
Guantanamo or in UK facilities testified to the human
cost of indefinite detention without charge or trial.
Speaking of the trauma of the fami lies of those
detained, Nadja Dizdarevic, the wife of Boudelaa Hadz
of Bosnia and Herzegovina who has been held at
Guantanamo for four years, said:
"It is difficult to be a mother to my children
because I have not enough time for them and I am
everything that they have... A t night after I put my
children to sleep I start my work and while the
whole world sleeps in peace I tirelessly write
complaints, requests, letters, learn the laws and
human rights conventions so that I could continue
my struggle for the life and release ofmy husband
and the others
. •

Governments have over the years requested
"diplomatic assurances" from countries known to use
torture in order to allow them to deport people there.
In 2005 the UK government sought to rely on
diplomatic assurances and concluded Memorandums
of Understanding with Jordan, Lebanon and Libya, and
was seeking similar agreements with Algeria, Egypt and
other states i n the region. AI opposed the use of such
"diplomatic assurances" as they erode the absolute
prohibition of torture, and are inherently unreliable
and unenforceable.
Evidence that many governments had been engaging
in, conniving in or acquiescing to the outsourcing of
torture underlined the need for greater transnational
accountability in a world where human rights
responsibilities do not stop at the borders of a state.

9

G LO BAL OVE RVI EW

The outsourcing of torture meant that the USA and
some of its European a l l ies, which had for decades
unreservedly condemned torture at a l l times and in a l l
circumstances, openly defied the absolute ban against
torture. The implication was that they believed that
some torture and i l l-treatment was justifiable in the
"war on terror".
The US administration continued its attempts to
redefine and justify certain forms of torture or other
i l l-treatment in the name of "national security" and
public order. When questioned about the US position
on the treatment of prisoners, the US Attorney
General, Alberto Gonzales, made it clear that his
government would define torture in its own way.
Although the US leadership denied that the
government condoned torture, evidence emerged that
the CIA used "water boarding" (simulated drowning),
prolonged shackling or induced hypothermia on
prisoners held in secret prisons. Some people within
the US administration apparently continued to believe
that certain forms of torture and ill-treatment
practices were acceptable if used to gather intel ligence
to counter terrorism. However, growing challenges to
these policies both within the USA - where at the end of
the year the US Senate passed legislation affirming the
ban on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment - and among the USA's a llies in the "war on
terror" offered hope of a more principled approach to
human rights and security in the future.
Human rights abuses in the context of counter­
terrorism poliCies were not confined to the USA and its
European a l lies. In Uzbekistan, the authorities claimed
that people taking part in a demonstration in Andizhan
at which peaceful demonstrators were killed had been
coerced to do so by "terrorists". Subsequently, more
than 70 people were convicted of "terrorist" offences

AI I NTERVENES I N COU RT CASES
AI continued to seek the legal Implementation of
international human rights standards by intervening in
cases before national and international courts.
Preventing the erosion ofthe absolute prohibitIOn
against torture in the context of the ·war on terror" was
the objective of two Interventions in 2005.
In a case before the UK's highest court, the Appellate
Committee ofthe House of lords, AI coordinated a
coalition of 14 organizations m a Jomt intervention to
challenge the ad m lSSl bl hty as evidence in j udicial

to mtroduce into JudiCial proceed i ngs mformation
obtained from abroad allegedly as a result of torture, on
the ground that no torture had been committed or

Human Rights to another state where he or she would

In China, the authorities continued to use the global
"war on terror" to justi fy harsh repression in the
Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR), resulting
in serious human rights violations against the ethniC
Uighur community. While China's latest "strike-hard"
campaign against crime had subSided in most parts of
the country, it was offiCially renewed in the XUAR in
May 2005 to eradicate "terrorism, separatism and
religious extremism". It resulted in the closure of
unoffiCia l mosques and arrests of imams. Uighur
nationalists, including peaceful activists, continued to
be detained or imprisoned. Those charged with serious
"separatist" or "terrorist" offences were at risk of
lengthy imprisonment or execution. Those attempting
to pass information abroad about the extent of the
crackdown faced arbitrary detention and
imprisonment. The authorities continued to accuse
Uighur activists of terrorism without providing credible
evidence for such charges.
In both Malaysia and Singapore, where national
security legislation al lows prolonged detention
without charge of terrorism suspects, dozens of
individuals remained in detention under Internal
Security Acts without charge or trial.
In Kenya and certain other African countries, the
rhetoriC of counter-terrorism was employed to justify
repressive legislation which was used to silence human
rights defenders and obstruct their work.
The exposure during 2005 of the unlawful practices
of governments in the name of countering terrorism
mobilized and affirmed the growing demands for
accountability. The determined work of human rights
activists, lawyers, journalists and many others helped
to lift the blanket of secrecy to expose states that

be at risk of torture or ill·treatment IS and shou ld remain
absolute. Four states intervened to argue that this
prohibition is not absolute, but may be subject to a
"balancing" test against such interests as countering
terrorism. At the end of 2005, the decision of the Court
was stili pending.
As part of its work against the death penalty, AI
mtervened in a case concerning Guatemala before the
Inter·American Court of H u man Rights.
Guatemala, wh ich ratified the American Convention
on H u m a n Rights in 1 978, sought to extend the use of
the death penalty in 1 996 to make it mandatory for

not be extended beyond the legislation applicable

result of a law passed In 2000, Guatemala had failed
to g uarantee the nght of a convicted person to seek

transferred, detained and tortured those they
suspected of terrorism.
The year 2005 also witnessed some successes in the
struggle by civil society to stop the trend towards
states justifying, on security grounds, the use of
information extracted through torture. The year ended
with a major judicial victory when the UK government
lost its legal battle in the domestic courts to reverse the
centuries-old ban against the admissibility of
information obtained as a result of torture in judicial
proceedings. AI had intervened i n the case, arguing
that the absolute prohibition of torture and ill­
treatment under international law prevented such use.
The attempts by governments to weaken the ban on
torture and other i l l-treatment compromised both the
moral integrity and practical effectiveness of efforts to
combat terrorism. 2005 showed the absolute necessity
of holding governments accountable to the rule of law,
and reconfirmed that an independent and impartial
judiciary plays a vital role in preventing the erosion of
fundamental safeguards and securing respect for
human rights.

CONFLICT AND ITS AFTERMATH
The number of armed conflicts around the world
continued to fall, but the toll of human suffering did
not. Continuing violence fed on a steady diet of
unresolved grievances arising from years of
destructive conflict and the failure to hold perpetrators
of abuse to account. It was sustained by the easy
availability of weaponry; the marginalization and
impoverishment of entire populations; systemic and
widespread corruption; and the failure to address
impunity for gross violations of human rights and
humanitarian law.
Millions of people faced violence and hardship in
conflicts caused or prolonged by the collective fai lures
of political leaders, armed groups and to some extent the
international community. Millions more endured
insecurity, hunger and homelessness in the aftermath of
conflicts, without the necessary levels of support from
the international community to rebuild their lives.
Amnesty International Report 2006

The failure of governments and armed groups alike
to seek the political solutions needed to end conflict
and to abide by negotiated settlements took a heavy
toll on the human rights of ordinary people. Some
governments sought advantage from conflicts i n other
countries, often arming one side or the other, while
disclaiming responsibility. When the international
community mustered enough support to put pressure
on warring factions through the UN Security Council or
regional bodies, the parties often failed to deliver on
their commitments, as seen in Sudan and Cote d' lvoire.
In their quest for political or economic gain,
government forces and armed groups often showed
total disregard for the civilian population caught i n
their path a n d even specifically targeted Civilians as
part of their military strategy. The large majority of
casualties i n armed conflicts i n 2005 were civilians.
Women and girls were exposed to the violence that
accompanies any war and were also subject to
particular, often sexual, abuse. In Papua New Guinea
girls were reportedly exchanged for guns by their male
relatives. I n the Democratic Republic of the Congo
large numbers of women and girls were abducted and
raped by armed combatants. I n nearly three quarters
of the conflicts around the world, chi ldren were
recruited as soldiers.
The world's attention focused largely on Iraq, Sudan,
and Israel/Occupied Territories while prolonged
conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya/Russian
Federation, Nepal, northern Uganda and other corners
of the world were largely ignored or forgotten.
I n I raq, US-led multinational forces, armed groups
and the transitional government all failed to respect
the rights of civilians. Armed groups deliberately
attacked civilians causing great loss of life. They
targeted humanitarian organizations and tortured and
killed hostages. The killing of two defence lawyers
involved in Saddam Hussain's trial highlighted the
chronic insecurity in the country. This insecurity
drastically curtai led the ability of many Iraqi women
and girls to go about their daily lives in safety, and a
number of I raqi and non-Iraqi women politicians,

The global arms trade remained largely
unaccountable and most transfers were shrouded I n
secrecy. Accu rate and up·to-date statistics were
therefore diffICult to obtain. However, the Information
available suggested some striking trends. Most of the
world's m i l i tary eqU ipment and services were traded
by a relatively small num ber of countries. Accord  to
an authoritative report by the US Congress, 3 5
countries exported some 9 0 per cent o f the world's
arms In terms of value. By 2005, more than 6B per
cent of arms exports were gOing to countries In the
global South.
SIX of the eight GB countnes are among the top 1 0
largest global arms exporters, and all eight export
large amounts of major conventional weapons or small
arms to developing countries A senes of loopholes
and weaknesses In arms export controls, common
across most GB countries, meant that the GB's

diverted attention from I srael's continuing expansion
of Israeli settlements and its construction of a 600km
fence/wall in the occupied West Bank, where some
450,000 Israeli settlers lived in violation of
international law. The presence of Israeli settlements
throughout the West Bank was the main reason for the
stringent restrictions (military checkpoints and
blockades) imposed by the Israeli army on the
movement of some 2 million Palestinians between
towns and villages within the occupied West Bank.
These restrictions on freedom of movement paralysed
the Palestinian economy and curtailed Palestinians'
access to their land, their places of work, and to
education and health facilities. The resulting increased
poverty, unemployment, frustration and lack of
prospects for a predominantly young population
contributed to the spiral of violence, both against
Israelis and within Palestinian society, Including growing
lawlessness in the street and violence In the home.
However, the year saw a significant reduction in the
number of killings by both sides: some 190 Palestinians,
including around 50 children, were kil led by Israeli
forces, and 50 Israelis, including Six children, were killed
Amnesty International Report 2006

by Palestinian armed groups, as compared to more than
700 Palestinians and 109 Israelis kil led in 2004.
Atrocities continued in Darfur, Sudan, despite
considerable efforts throughout 2005 by the
international community to reach a political solution
to end the violence. The Sudanese government and its
allied militias (j anjawid) killed and injured civilians in
bombing raids and attacks on villages, raped women
and girls, and forced villagers from their lands. Abuses
by the opposition armed groups escalated as their
command structures broke down under increased
factionalism and in-fighting between rival leaders. The
violations in Darfur were described by the UN
Secretary-General and U N agencies as staggering i n
scale and harrowing in nature with widespread and
systematic human rights abuses, violations of
humanitarian law, forced displacement of millions of
people and looming hunger. In early 2005 the UN
negotiated a peace agreement, raising hopes of a 'peace
dividend". The African Union deployed forces, but their
mandate to protect civilians was limited and they were
further hampered by the relatively small number of
troops deployed and the lack of logistical support. The
peace did not hold. A UN Commission of Inquiry found
that the government and the Janjawld militia were
responsible for crimes under international law and the
case of Darfur was referred by the Security Council to
the International Criminal Court. Although the
International Criminal Court began investigations, by
the end of 2005, it had not been granted access to Sudan.
Similar patterns were seen in many other conflicts
that received less international attention during 2005:
targeting of civilians, sexual abuse particularly of
women and girls, the use of chi ld soldiers, and a
pattern of impunity. These conflicts were fought in

2005 saw some sign ificant developments towards
bringing to Justice those responsible for crimes u nder

humanity, war cn mes, torture, extraj udicial executions
and enforced disappearances However, there was a lso
conti nuing widespread Impunity in national cou rts I n
the states where crimes were com mitted, a s well as
only lim ited use of u n iversal JUrisdiction by courts In

While the UN Security Cou nci l's referral to the ICC

the Security Cou ncil, as part of a c.ompromlse to ensu re

both urban and rural settings, generally uSIng small
arms and light weaponry. Often diverse pockets of
violence erupted, with little chain of command or
accountabi lity. I n some cases, governments armed
cIvilians In an effort to distance themselves from
accountabi lity or CUlpability for abuses.
In Colombia, after 40 years of internal armed
conflict, serious human rights abuses by all parties
remained at cntlcal levels. A law was passed
providing a framework for dIsarmament and
demobilization of p3ramilItaries and armed groups.
However, there were fears that the legislation would
al low the most serious human rights abusers to enjoy
impunity, whIle human rights violations continued to
be commItted i n areas where paramilitaries had
supposedly demobilized. In addItIon, government
policies designed to reintegrate members of i l legal
armed groups into civilian life risked recycling them
into the conflict.
Despite claIms that the situation was normal IZing,
Russian and Chechen securIty forces conducted
targeted raids in Chechnya during which they
committed serious human rights violations. Women
were reportedly subjected to gender-based VIolence,
including rape and threats of rape, by Russian and
Chechen soldIers. Chechen armed opposition groups
committed abuses including targeted attacks on
civil ians and indiscriminate attacks. There was also
violence and unrest in other North Caucasus
republics, increasingly accompanied by reports of
human rights VIolations.
I n Nepal, the human rights situatIon deteriorated
sharply under a state of emergency imposed In
February 2005, with thousands of politically motIvated
arrests, strict media censorshIp and atrocities

committed by the security forces and Maoist groups.
FollOWing a mission to Nepal in the ImmedIate
aftermath of the emergency, AI called on the
governments of IndIa, the UK and the USA. Nepal's
main arms suppliers, to suspend all mIlItary supplies to
Nepal until the government took clear steps to halt
human rights violations. It made a Similar call to other
governments, including Belgium, Germany, South
Afnca and France (which supplIed crUCIal components
for helIcopters assembled and delIvered by IndIa).
However, although some governments responded
posItIvely to the appeal for a suspensIon of milItary
supplies, China continued to supply arms and
ammUnItion to Nepal.
The faIlure to resolve manIfest inJustIces, to address
impunIty and to control the spread of arms led to
continuing insecurity and violence in many countries
trying to emerge from conflict. Even in countries where
steps towards peace had been agreed, there was often
little political will or rigour to ensure that agreements
were respected and faIthfully Implemented.
In Afghanistan, lawlessness, Insecunty and
persecution continued to blight the lIves of millions of

REFUGEES, ASYLUM-SEEKERS AND
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE
In recent years, the n u m ber of refugees worldwide has
fa llen Sign ificantly, but the rea l ity In 2005 was more
complex a nd far bleaker than the n u m ber suggested
I n 2004, the last year for which figu res were
avai lable, the n u m ber of refugees recorded was the
lowest 1 0 a lmost 25 years The decl rne 1 0 refugee
n u m bers was largely because of the n u m bers of
refugees who retu rned to their countries of orlgrn, but
not all were able to retu rn to their homes and Vil lages
of Origin, and many retu rned In conditIOns that were
not voluntary, safe or dignified
In all, more than 5 m illIOn refugees were retu rned
not a l l volu ntarily to their countries of ongln
between 2001 and 2004. Many of the returns took
place to countnes such as Afghan istan, Angola,
Burundl, I raq and Liberia where their safety and
dig n ity could not necessarily be guaranteed Some
retu rns breached the fundamental prinCiple of non
refoulement the cornerstone of i nternational
refugee protection that no one hould be teturned
agai nst their Will to a situation where they would be at
risk of serious human rights abuse
The focus on n u mbers by both the IOternatlonal
comm u n ity a nd indiVidual governments often led to
the rights of refugees being d isregarded. I n many
cou ntries, asyl u m seekers were excluded from seeking
protection, either physically or by procedu res that
failed to prOVide a fa ir heari ng I n Greece, for example,
1 0 2004 Just 11 asylum seekers were recognized as
refugees and 3,731 were rejected The refusa l rate In

cent In South Africa some asylum seekers were
a rbitrarily deported because of corrupt practices at
refugee reception centres and borders In Ch lOa

While the n u m ber of people crOSSing i nternational

Internally d isplaced persons remai ned u ncha nged at
2 5 m i l l ion In 2004, many of whom had been d isplaced
for years States conti n ued to be reluctant to a llow
i nternational observers to mon ttor the cond itions a nd
human rights Situation of i nterna lly displaced people
In their countries. The UN Secretary-General's March
2005 report on the I mplementation of the Millen n i u m
Development Goals, I n Larger Freedom, recommended
strengthening the Inter-agency response to the
protection and assistance needs of I nternally
d isplaced people The resulting new rnter-agency
"cluster approach" promised to del iver g reater
accountabil ity, but It rem a i ned to be seen whether It
would del iver more predictable, robust and coherent
protection to the m l l "ons of i nterna l ly d isplaced
people a round the world.
For refugees liVing I n camps, conditions worsened
In 2005, partICu larly as many faced red uctions In
food rations a sign of the fa i l u re of the world's
govern ments to fulfil thei r rnternatlonal obl igations
to share the responsi bi l ity of protecting and assisting
refugees ThiS often resulted i n a n i ncrease i n Violence

Africa, easy access to small arms contributed to
violations of the agreed ceasefire, inter-ethnic
conflict in the west of the country, xenophobia and
the ongoing use of child soldiers. Despite efforts by
the African Union to restore peace and security in the
country, the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration process remained deadlocked. I n
October, A I publicized reports of s m a l l arms
proli feration, re-circulation and possible new arms
transfers to both sides of the conflict despite a UN­
imposed arms embargo.
In several post-conflict countries the dominant
culture of impunity - the failure to bring to justice
those responsible for human rights abuses - fostered
continued cycles of violence. In Sri Lanka, for example,
the security situation deteriorated in 2005 as both the
government and the armed opposition failed to make
the human rights guarantees in the ceasefire
agreement work. Tensions over scarce resources were
exacerbated by internal displacement resulting from
the conflict and the tsunami.
The struggle to overcome impunity can last for
decades, or even generations. The survivors of Japan's
system of military sexual slavery during World War l i ­
the so-called "comfort women" - have persistently
called for recognition and justice for more than half a
century, their numbers dwind ling with time. Once
again in 2005 the Japanese government refused to
accept responsibility, formally apologize, or provide
official compensation for the suffering endured by
thousands of women.
There were some exceptions to this generally grim
landscape, including elections in a number of states
emerging from conflict. Greater stability in Sierra
Leone a 1 I0wed the UN forces to leave the country. The
Amnesty International Report 2006

Polisario Front, which demands independence for
Western Sahara, released 404 Moroccan prisoners of
war who had been held for well over two decades
despite the formal cessation of hostilities 14 years ago.
Efforts to overcome impunity moved forward with the
prospect of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leaders being
brought before the I nternational Criminal Court
charged with war crimes in northern Uganda.

FUELLED BY FEAR: SUFFERING DUE TO I DENTITY
The blurring of cultural boundaries often associated
with globalization, far from overcoming deep divisions
based on identity, was accompanied by continued, and
some believe increasing, raCism, discrimination and
xenophobia. Across the world, people were attacked
and deprived of basic human rights because of their
gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and
other Similar aspects of their identity, or combinations
of these identities.
In the context of the "war on terror', 2005 saw
continued polarization a long identity lines In a n
increasingly intolerant a n d fearful world. Many
people were targeted for discrimination and violence
because of their Identity - Muslims, those identified as
Muslims, other minorities, migrants and refugees all
fell victim. Some Muslim communities i n Europe and
elsewhere said they felt under siege: they feared and
abhorred the bombings, but also experienced growing
raCism, fostered in part by some governments and
media broadly l inking the "terrorist threat" with
"foreigners" and "Muslims". On top of thiS, many
suffered the consequences of counter-terrorism
measures that were discriminatory in law and practice
as young Muslim males continued to be portrayed as
"typical terrorists".

In their efforts to assert their power or resist
challenges to their authority, repressive regimes
targeted ethnic or religious minorities. One of the most
blatant examples was the treatment of Kurdish groups
in SYria and I ran. Up to 21 people were reportedly killed,
scores injured and at least 190 more arrested in a brutal
clampdown on civil unrest in the Kurdish areas of
western Iran from July onwards. The mass arrests and
excessive use of force against protesters in the Kurdish
areas were part of a pattern of abuse of ethnic
minorities in I ran, where up to half the population is
Persian and the rest is made up of other ethnic groups
including Kurds, Arabs and Azeri Turks.
In Syria too, Kurds continued to suffer from identity­
based discrimination, including restrictions on the use
of the Kurdish language and culture. Tens of thousands
of Syrian Kurds remained effectively stateless, and
were consequently denied full access to education,
health services and employment, as wel l as the right to
a nationality. However, i n J une, at its first meeting for
10 years, the ruling Ba'th Party Congress ordered a
review of a 1962 census which could result in stateless
Kurds obtaInIng Syrian citizenship.
Challenges to mainstream religious views were
severely punished in some countries. In Egypt, despite
the (Emergency) Supreme State Security Court ruling at
least seven times in h,s favour, Mitwalli Ibrahim
MitwallI Saleh remained in administrative detention
for his scholarly views on apostasy and marriage
between Muslim women and non-Muslim men. In
Pakistan, where blasphemy laws make it a criminal
offence for members of the Ahmadiyya community to
practise their faith, police Investigations into killings of
Ahmadis were slow or did not take place at all. In just
one incident in October, eight Ahmadis were shot dead
and 22 injured in their mosque by men shooting from a
passing motorbike. Eighteen men arrested shortly
afterwards were released without charge. In China,
religious observance outside official channels
remained tightly Circumscribed. I n March, the
authorities issued a new regulation aimed at
strengthening offiCIal controls on religious activities,
and in April a crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual
movement was renewed. A Beijing official stated that
Since the group had been banned as a "heretical
organization", any activities linked to Falun Gong were
illegal. Many Falun Gong practitioners reportedly
remained in detention where they were at high rISk of
torture or Ill-treatment.
In Eritrea, where the government cracked down on
evangelical Christian churches during 2005, more than
1,750 church members and dozens of Muslims were in
detention at the end of 2005 because of their religious
beliefs. They were held in indefinite and
incommunicado detentIon without charge or trial,
some in secret locations. Many were tortured or ill­
treated, and large numbers were held in metal shipping
containers or underground cells.
A perceived lack of ethnic "purity" was used as a
basis to exclude people from employment and
education in Turkmenistan. Many members of ethnic

minorities such as Uzbeks, Russians and Kazakhs were
dismissed from their workplaces and denied access to
higher education. Members of rel,gious minority
groups risked harassment, arbitrary detention,
imprisonment after unfair trials and ill-treatment.
Latvia ratified the Council of Europe's Framework
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities
during 2005, but the government's definition of a
minority effectively excluded most members of the
Russian-speaking community from qualifying for
recognition as a minority.
In many countries, indigenous people remained an
underclass and were victims of widespread human
rights violations. Discussions on an international
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People,
deadlocked for almost a decade, made halting progress
in 2005. This dilatory response by the international
community to the urgent need to recognize and respect
the rights of indigenous people was reflected at the
national level. In Brazil, for example, the government's
demarcation and ratification of indigenous territories
fell far short of its promised goals. This contributed to
insecurity and violent attacks on indigenous
communities and forced evictions, aggravating already
severe economic and social deprivation.
The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous
people, who visited New Zealand in 2005, said that
there were significant, and in some cases widening,
disparities between Maori and the rest of the
population. He said Maori considered this the result of
a trans-generational backlog of broken promises,
economic marginalization, social exclusion and
cultural discrimination.

A labourer unloads emergency
supplies in north-western
Nlger, July 2005 Although
sev ral non-governmental
organizations had been
warning ofthe risk of famine
I n N lger since I te 2004,
international donors,
including the UN a nd the
European Union, d id not react
qUickly to ca l ls for urgent food
aid. The U N estimated that the
famine put In dangerthe lives
of 3.5 mill on of N lger s 1 2
million inhabitants.

At a time of unprecedented globalization, with
barriers to the free flow of capital and goods across
borders being dismantled, it was ironic that the
movement of people across national boundaries
became more highly regulated than ever. M igrant
workers became the focus of particular attack and ill­
treatment, notwithstanding the benefits that host
communities derived from their presence. An
estimated 200 million migrants lived and worked
outside their country of origin. From Burmese
agricultural workers in Thailand to I ndian domestic
workers in Kuwait, many migrant workers all over the
world faced exploitation and abuse. I l l-treated by
employers and often with alarmingly little legal
protection, they had scant access to justice. When
irregular migrants came to the attention of the
authorities, they risked being arbitrarily detained and
expelled in conditions that violated their human rights.
As in many parts of the world, in the Mediterranean
region there continued to be a blatant disregard for
migrants' and asylum-seekers' rights. Some of the
thousands of people attempting to enter the Spanish
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, on the north African
coast, were intercepted and forcibly taken back to
Morocco. Migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing
extreme poverty and repression in sub-Saharan Africa
were rounded up by Moroccan forces and detained.
Some were deported to Algeria or taken to remote
desert regions a long the border with Algeria and
Mauritania and left with little or no food and no means
of transport. In I taly and Greece migrants and asylum­
seekers continued to be detained, often in grossly
inadequate conditions.
Most of the world's governments declined to commit
themselves to enhancing migrants' rights - by
December 2005 only 34 countries had ratified the
Amnesty International Report 2006

International Convention on the Protection of the
Rights of All M igrant Workers and Members ofTheir
Families. Of the 20 countries committed to report to the
UN Committee on M igrant Workers, just two had done
so by the end of 2005.
Bilateral agreements between migrant-sending and
migrant-receiving countries often ignored the human
rights of migrants, treating human beings as
commodities, "service providers" or "agents of
development", regardless of the contribution of
migrants to their host societies and countries of origin.
Many states focused on border controls while turning a
blind eye to the exploitation of migrants, including
migrant workers employed i n the informal economy.
The important contributions made by migrants to their
host societies were frequently obscured in public
debates that were often overtly racist and xenophobic,
encouraging a climate in which human rights abuses
against migrants were overlooked or even condoned.
Women migrants were at particular risk of gender­
specific human rights violations. A foreign domestic
worker was sentenced by a Shari'a (Islamic law) court
in the United Arab Emirates to 150 lashes for becoming
pregnant outSide marriage. Many women migrants
were not only vulnerable to sexual exploitation by
traffickers and employers, but also faced systematic
discrimination in the country where they worked. A
woman from India working in Kuwait who was raped
and became pregnant was held in prison after giving
birth; she was not allowed to leave the country without
the permission of the child's father.
Discrimination and violence on grounds of gender
persisted in every country in the world, as documented
in several major reports released by AI during 2005 as
part of its global campaign to Stop Violence against
Women. I n Nigeria, girls and women were left blind

21

G LO BAL OVE RVI EW

from beatings, doused with kerosene and set on fire,
jai led for reporting that they had been raped or
murdered for daring to report that their husbands were
threatening to kill them. A I 's report on family violence
in Spain analyzed the obstacles women face when
trying to escape abusive relationships. In particular,
migrant women, Roma women and women with
physical or mental disabilities were rarely able to gain
access to shelters and financial aid for survivors of
gender-based violence.
DUring 2005 AI campaigned for the rights of women
disregarded by the criminal justice system. Hundreds
of cases of women abducted and murdered in
Guatemala were not adequately addressed by the
authorities and the government itself reported that 40
per cent of cases were archived and never investigated.
Such official Inaction sent the strongest signal possible
to those who perpetrated these crimes that they did so
with impunity.
Despite moves towards greater legal recognition of
their rights in certain countries, lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender (LGBT) people continued to face
widespread discrimination and violence, often
officially sanctioned. The authorities tried to ban
Latvla's first ever Gay Pride march to mark the struggle
for the rights of LGBT people. Homophobic remarks
made by the Latvian Prime Minister and other senior
figures - who, together with religious leaders, opposed
the march - were reported to have encouraged a
climate of intolerance and hatred. In Saudi Arabia, 35
men were sentenced to flogging and imprisonment for
attending what was described as a "gay wedding". Ms
findings In a major report on the USA showed that LGBT
people were targeted for human rights abuses by the
police. The discrimination against them significantly
restricted their access to equal protection under the
law and to redress for abuses. A 60-year-old gay man
arrested In St Louis, Missouri, told AI:
"I did nothing wrong... did not hurt anyone and was
targeted simply for being a gay male in a city park
. . . Nothing is more unfair than singling out a group
and making them criminal when they are not.
"

Depriving a person of their rights because of a
characteristic they cannot change or that is so central
to their being that they should not be forced to change
it, such as their race, religion, gender or sexual
orientation, attacks the central premise of human
rights - the conviction that every human being is equal
in dignity and worth.

POOR, EXCLU DED AND I NVISIBLE
DUring 2005 the international community's
commitment to "make poverty history" became more
prominent on the international agenda. However,
while government leaders pronounced their intention
to reduce poverty, particularly in Africa, most of the
targets set under the UN's '5-year Mi llennium
Development Goals showed little, if any, prospect of
being met. The first time-bound target to achieve
gender parity in primary education passed unmet with
little or no protest from the international community.
There was more rhetoric than real commitment to
22

action, and not nearly enough attention to basing
strategies on human rights principles.
Action by states to relieve poverty and deprivation
globally is not an optional extra - it is an
international obligation. It was a measure of states'
failure to fu lfil this obligation that in 2005, when the
world's economic output was at its highest level ever,
more than 800 million people around the world were
chronica lly malnourished. At least 10 mil lion children
died before the age of five. Over 100 mil lion children
(the majority girls) did not have access even to
primary education.
The disappointing outcome of the UN World
Summit, which took place in September, i llustrated
clearly the gap between political rhetoric and genuine
commitment. A small number of countries blocked
efforts to make sign i ficant progress on human rights,
security, genocide and poverty reduction. Delegates
had to work so hard to maintain commitments made
in the past that they had little time to discuss
implementation of the Outcome Document, a political
declaration where governments made pledges in the
four areas of development, peace and security,
human rights, and UN reform.
The lack of progress on the Millennium
Development Goals was particularly shocking in light
of the fact that some of the Goals set levels of
expected achievement lower than those that states
are required to meet under international human
rights law. The Goa l of halving hunger, i f met, would
hugely increase life expectancy, health and human
dignity. Yet the 152 states that have ratified the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights have, at the very minimum, an
obligation to take the necessary action to mitigate
and a l leviate hunger for the whole population, even
in times of natural or other disasters.
While global poverty climbed up the international
agenda during 2005, it was also a year that exposed
the gross economic and social inequalities within
even the wealthiest of countries. The a ftermath of
Hurricane Katrina shocked many around the world as
it revealed the underbel ly of deprivation, racia l
inequa lities and poverty within the USA. the most
powerful economy in the world.
The riots in France drew attention to decades of
social inequality and discrimination against migrants
and French nationals of African descent. The French
government responded by declaring a state of
emergency, imposing curfews and al lowing law
enforcement officials to carry out searches without
warrants, close public meeting places of any kind and
place people under "house arrest". The government
also announced plans to expel migrants convicted
during the riots, regardless of whether they had a
legal right to reside in France.
In countries of all political colours, and all levels of
development, many were still unable to access even
minimum levels of food, water, education, health care
and housing. Deprivation in the midst of plenty could
not be blamed solely on a lack of resources - it resulted
from unwillingness, systemic corruption, negligence
Amnesty International Report 2006

G LO BAL OVE RV I EW

and discrimination by governments and others, and
from their failure to respect, protect and ful fi l
economic, social a n d cultural rights.
For example, mil lions of people living with H I V/ AIDS
were unable to realize their right to health not just
because of poverty, but because of discrimination and
stigma, violence against women, and trade and patent
agreements that obstructed access to life-saving drugs.
During 2005, fewer than 15 per cent of those needing
anti-retroviral treatment in the developing world
received it, demonstrating the failure not only of
governments, but also of intergovernmental bodies
and companies, to fu lfil their shared responsibilities
for human rights.
In a globalized economy, the failure to uphold human
rights also brought to the fore the debate about the
responsibilities of companies and finanCial institutions
for human rights. The process of establishing human
rights principles applicable to companies moved
forward in 2005 with the appointment in July by the U N
Secretary-General of a Special Representative on
human rights and transnational corporations and other
business enterprises. There was debate over the UN
Human Rights Norms for Business and some further
progress was made towards the acceptance by
companies of voluntary codes of conduct. However, the
need remained for common universal standards for
corporate commitment on human rights and legal
accountability.
Countless situations across the globe highlighted
how poverty can be an aggregate violation of human
rights - civil, cultural, economiC, political and SOCial
rights -and how poverty, marglnallzation and
vulnerability to violence are often inescapably linked.
Amnesty International Report 2006

In Brazil, where millions lived In poverty in rave/as
(shanty towns), the government's continued failure to
address systemic levels of criminal violence and
human rights violations at the hands of the police
reinforced patterns of social exclusion. The state's
persistent negligence over public security in rave/as
not only resulted in some of the highest homicide
figures in the world, but effectively crimmalized whole
communities, further prejudicing access to already
meagre public services such as education and health
care as well as employment. For example, many rave/a
residents would not be able to get a job i f they gave
their true address, as they were so widely seen as
criminals. Armed violence was an Inescapable part of
daily life, either at the hands of drug gangs, police or
vigilante "death squads". A police policy of military­
style incurSions into the rave/as not only failed to curb
violence, it endangered the lives of some of the most
vulnerable people in society. In October, a referendum
on a total ban on the sale of guns in Brazil was
defeated. Many analysts attributed the result to
people's sense of despair about the security situation
and lack of faith in the police's ability to protect them.
In Haiti, high levels of violence, particularly sexual
violence, were perpetrated by armed groups and
vigilante groups against women in poor communities.
Many women were under constant threat of attack.
Given the extremely low rate of conviction in relation
to crimes of sexual violence, and the lack of offiCial,
community or family support to Identify and
investigate perpetrators, I t was not surprising that
these victims did not seek justice. Law enforcement
offiCials have consistently failed to provide adequate
protection or access to Justice for these women.

Roma communities across Europe were often denied

they were not able t o access basic social services.
Whether in response to natural disasters or
humanitarian crises, the international community
often faces criticism for fai l to provide timely and
adequate assistance to people i n urgent need of aid.
However, in some countries humanitarian efforts
were hampered by governments unable or unwil ling
to address the needs of the poor and marginalized in
their own countries. I n Zimbabwe, despite
overwhelming evidence of humanitarian need, the
government repeatedly obstructed the humanitarian
efforts of the UN and civil society groups for political
reasons. One of the major factors behind the need for
external support was the i mpact of government
policies; hundreds of thousands of people were
forcibly evicted from their homes and tens of
thousands of people lost their livelihoods and the
ability to support their fam i lies.
In 2005 there were some positive steps towards
greater recognition of economic, social and cultural
fights at national and international levels. These
included an important Inter-American Court of Human
Rights deciSion i n the case of two Haitian girls, Dilcia
Yean and Violeta Bosico, against the Dominican
Republic, which had denied them access to education
on the basis of their national i ty. Also, steps were taken
towards creating a UN mechanism for lodging

24

complaints of violations of economic, social and
cultural rights. Such a mechanism would help put
economic, social and cultural rights on an equal footing
with civil and political rights and end this arbitrary
classification of human rights. It would strike a blow
against impunity for economic, social and cultural
rights violations and open a much-needed avenue for
victims to claim redress.

CONCLUSION
For AI, genuine human security means that all rights ­
civil, cultural, economic, political and social - are
realized. These are interrelated and indivisible - no
security policy can ignore any one dimension. Human
beings can nourish and fulfil their potential only if
secure in all aspects of their lives. Human security
therefore depends on the full range of interdependent
human rights being respected, protected and fulfilled.
This report shows how human security, understood in
this way, has often been a casualty of the national
security strategies of the world's most powerful
governments, and those emboldened by their example.
Our collective human security will not be safeguarded
through such state-centred and narrowly defined
approaches to security. It requires a more
comprehensive vision of what security means, as well as
a collective sense of shared responsibility for protecting
it within and beyond the boundaries of the state.

The signing of several peace agreements in 2005
resulted in a decline in armed conflict across the
region. However, grave human rights violations,
including killings, rape and other forms of sexual
violence, characterized continuing conflicts in Burundi,
Chad, Cote d' lvoire, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) and Sudan. Many places faced political
instability and a serious risk of further conflict and
violence. Refugees and internally displaced persons
(I DPs) in camps and urban areas had inadequate access
to basic needs assistance and were exposed to serious
human rights abuses. I mpunity for human rights
violations remained widespread, despite some
international and regional efforts to bring suspected
perpetrators to account. Human rights defenders,
journalists and political opponents continued to face
harassment, assault and unlawful detention for
denouncing human rights violations or criticizing their
governments.
Millions of men, women and children remained
impoverished and deprived of clean water, adequate
housing, food, education and primary health care.
This situation was exacerbated by widespread and
systemic corruption and the apparent indifference of
governments to providing their citizens with the most
basic economic and social rights. Across the region,
hundreds of thousands of families were forcibly evicted
from their homes, further violating their fundamental
human rights.
The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and
Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa
entered into force during the year, but continuing
violations of women's human rights, including female
genital mutilation (FGM), domestic violence, rape,
trafficking and sexual violence during conflicts, made
the development nominal rather than substantive.
A series of important regional initiatives, including
the Pan-African Parliament, the African Union (AU)
Peace and Security Council and the African Peer Review
Mechanism, became fully operational, although their
overall impact on respect for human rights was difficult
to measure. The AU Assembly continued to make
efforts to address human rights problems in the region,
but its failure to respond firmly to the human rights
crisis in Zimbabwe illustrated the need for the AU to
apply its human rights principles consistently.

Armed conflict
Governments and armed opposition groups continued
to abuse human rights and international humanitarian
law in Sudan (particularly in Darfur), northern Uganda,
Chad, Cote d'lvoire and the DRC, resulting in unlawful
Amnesty International Report 2006

killings, rape and other torture, population
displacements and other grave human rights violations.
In Darfur, civilians were killed and injured by
government troops, which sometimes bombed villages
from the air, and by government-allied nomadic
militias known as the Janjawid. Women were raped and
some were abducted and held as sexual slaves. Many
had fled conflict and extreme deprivation in the south
and other parts of Darfur.
Civilians continued to be the victims of the 19-year
conflict in northern Uganda. Despite peace talks,
attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army increased
towards the end of 2005, and some diSSident militias
remained active and clashed from time to time. More
than 3 million l OPs and half a million refugees were
expected to return to the south.
In Burundi, armed conflict continued throughout
2005 between one armed group, the PALlPEHUTU-FN L,
and government forces in the provinces of Bujumbura
rural and Bubanza, despite the presence of U N
peacekeeping soldiers. More than 120,000 people, most
of them women and children, remained internally
displaced and in exile at the end of 2005.
No progress was made in demobilizing an estimated
50,000 combatants under the peace process in Cote
d'lvoire. The main obstacle to progress appeared to be
a lack of trust between the government and the
leadership of the New Forces (Forces nouvelles), a
coalition of former armed groups. Child soldiers were
used by all parties to the conflicts in Cote d' lvoire and
the DRe.
I n October, Eritrea banned UN helicopter flights and
other travel to UN monitors, further restricting the
multinational UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea,
whose 2,800 personnel administered a buffer zone
along the border. Both sides had rearmed since 2000
and deployed troops near the border in late 2005. The
UN Security Council called on Ethiopia to implement
the International Boundary Commission's judgment
regarding the border areas, particularly its a llocation to
Eritrea of Badme town, the flash point of war in 1998,
but no progress was made on this during 2005.
I llegal exploitation of natural resources continued in
the DRC, Liberia and Sudan. In Liberia, former
combatants occupied rubber plantations and tapped
rubber, claiming it was their only means of survival.
They were reportedly responsible for ki llings and
torture, including rape, of civilians.
There was encouraging progress in peacemaking in
some conflicts. In Senegal, for example, the 2004 peace
agreement that ended two decades of conflict in the
southern Casamance region of the country held
throughout 2005.

Impunity a nd justice
Despite widespread and systematic violations of
human rights, including war crimes and crimes against
humanity, most perpetrators were not held to account.
Although investigations were opened in a few cases,
the justice systems in many countries continued to
suffer from systemic corruption, lack of resources and
inadequate training for personnel. Despite encouraging

judicial pronouncements in some countries, there was
little progress in creating an adequate mechanism for
prosecution before domestic courts of war crimes and
crimes against humanity. The AU tended to downplay
the issue of accountability in the implementation of i ts
mandate.
I n Senegal, despite publicly expressed commitments
by the authorities, no steps were taken to end impunity
for perpetrators of human rights abuses. I n January,
parliament passed a law that provided an amnesty for
"politically motivated" offences committed between
1983 and 2004. Senegal did not respond positively to the
extradition request and international arrest warrant
issued by a Belgian judge and charging Chad's former
President Hissene Habre with gross human rights
violations committed during his 1982-90 rule. Hissene
Habre moved to Senegal after he was ousted from
power in 1990. In November, the Dakar Appeal Court
declared itself "not competent" to rule whether to issue
an extradition order in the case. A few days later, the
authorities stated that the AU should indicate who had
jurisdiction to rule on the case and declared that
H issene Habre would remain in Senegal pending the
AU's decision.
There were some limited steps at the international or
regional level to address impunity. I n January, a UN­
appointed commission of Inquiry reported that war
crimes and crimes against humanity had been
committed in Darfur, and that the Sudanese justice
system was unable and unwilling to address the
situation. In March, the UN Security Council passed
Resolution 1593, referring the situation in Darfur to the
International Criminal Court (I CC). The resolution
required Sudan and all other parties to the conflict to
co-operate fully with the Court. However, as a result of
US pressure, a provision was inserted in the resolution
to exempt nationals of states not party to the Rome
Statute of the ICC (other than Sudan) from the
jurisdiction of the ICe. The ICC began investigations,
but by the end of 2005 had not been granted access to
Sudan.
In January, the Ugandan government formally asked
the ICC to investigate and prosecute war crimes and
other serious human rights abuses that had occurred
during the armed conflict in the north of the country. I n
October, t h e I CC issued arrest warrants for five senior
leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army charged with war
crimes and crimes against humanity committed In
Uganda since July 2002.
Two years after the Prosecutor of the ICC announced
that the Court would look into the hundreds of
thousands of crimes committed in the DRC since J uly
2002, investigations had yet to result in any
international arrest warrants. The likelihood that
only a handful of suspected perpetrators would be
prosecuted underlined the necessity for
comprehensive action by the DRC government to
reform the national justice system and end impunity.
Former Liberian President Charles Taylor continued

against humanity, war crimes and other serious
violations of international law. In J uly, the leadership
of the Mano River Union countries (Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra Leone) publicly stated that some of Charles
Taylor's activities in Nigeria breached the terms of his
asylum.
Trials of prominent genocide suspects continued
before the I nternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
( lCTR) in Arusha, which held 60 detainees at the end of
2005. Five trials involving 20 defendants continued
from previous years, and five new trials involving seven
defendants began in 2005. Two judgments were given:
one defendant received a six-year prison sentence and
another received life imprisonment. One suspect
surrendered himself to the ICTR and was later
transferred to The Hague for detention pending his trial
on charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide
and complicity in genocide. Another suspect was
arrested in Gabon. He was charged with genocide,
conspiracy to commit genOCide, direct and public
incitement to commit genocide, and persecution as a
crime against humanity.
A report by the African Commission on Human and
Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) of a fact-finding mission to
Zimbabwe in 2002, which was offiCially made public in
February 2005, concluded that human rights violations
had occurred in Zimbabwe. The ACHPR made several
recommendations, but by the end of the year almost
nothing had been done to implement them.
Zimbabwean government ministers and offiCials made
disparaging comments about the report and the ACHPR.
I n December, the ACHPR adopted a resolution on
Zimbabwe condemning violations of human rights. The
ACHPR did not, however, make publiC the report of its
July 2004 mission to Sudan.

Violence against women
Women remained Without adequate protection in law
and practice, and continued to face violence and
discrimination. Women were raped and subjected to
other forms of sexual violence by government agents as
wel l as partners, employers and others. I n some
communities, FGM and forced marriages were still the
norm. In Cameroon, approximately 20 per cent of
women and girls were reported to have been subjected
to FGM, which was sti l l legal. Provisions also remained
in the Penal Code that exempted a suspected rapist
from judicial proceedings i f he marries the victim,
effectively protecting the perpetrator while subjecting
the victim to further abuse.
Hundreds of thousands of women were believed to
have been raped by government forces and armed
political groups in confliCt. In eastern DRC, rape was
sometimes committed in front of the victim's children,
family or community. In some cases, the girl or woman
was killed or deliberately wounded. Few rape survivors
had access to appropriate medical care. In Togo,
security forces and militia groups a llegedly raped
women suspected of supporting the opposition.
Legislative reform to increase respect for women's
human rights began or was completed in some
countries. In Ghana, civil society organizations

discussed reform of abortion legislation and the
absence of laws prohibiting marital rape, and some
members of parliament advocated tougher sentences
for rape and sexual assaults against women. In Liberia, a
law on rape was passed that had a broader definition of
rape. However, it included the death penalty among the
punishments for perpetrators, despite Liberia's
commitment to abolish the death penalty. The Kenyan
parliament agreed to discuss a proposed Sexual
Offences Bill and discussed a draft law on rape,
sponsored by women's groups. The draft law proposed
broadening the definItion of rape and denying bail to
anyone charged with raping a minor.
In Nigeria, some states introduced legislation on
violence against women In the home, but the federal
government did not review discriminatory laws or
amend national law to comply with the Protocol to the
African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the
Rights of Women in Africa, which Nigeria had ratified.

28

Despite the lack of official statistics, it was estimated that
nearly two thirds of women in certain groups in Lagos
State, for example, were victims of violence in the home.
Discriminatory laws and practices, dismissive attitudes
within the police, and an inaccessible justice system
contributed to violence against women being widely
tolerated and underreported.

Economic, social and cultura l rights
Many governments engaged in practices that
systematically denied people their rights to shelter,
food, health and education. In Zimbabwe, hundreds of
thousands of people were forcIbly evicted and their
homes demol ished as part of Operation Murambatsvina
(Restore Order). The operation was carried out against
a backdrop of severe food shortages. The government
repeatedly obstructed the humanitarian work of non­
governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies,
including attempts to provide shelter for the homeless.
Amnesty International Report 2006

REG I ONAL OVE RVI EWS - AFRICA

I n Nigeria, thousands of people were made homeless
without due process, compensation or the provision of
alternative housing.
In Niger, serious food shortages were compounded
by years of drought and an invasion of desert locusts in
2004, the worst in more than a decade, which wiped out
much of the country's cereal production. The UN
estimated that famine put in danger the l ives of over a
quarter of Niger's population. The famine had a knock­
on effect in neighbouring Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and
Nigeria, all of which experienced rising prices or food
shortages. Despite warnings of the impending famine,
international donors failed to respond quickly. I n
Mozambique, over 800,000 people needed food a i d a s
a result o f prolonged drought.
High death rates from AI DS-related illnesses
seriously affected economic and social development in
many countries of the region. The southern Africa
region continued to have the highest prevalence rate of
HIV in the world and severe problems in access to care
and treatment. Swaziland had the highest rate globally
with 42.6 per cent, and more than three quarters of
people known to need antiretroviral treatment were
still not receiving it. In South Africa, new figures
revealed that around 6 million people had been
infected with H I V by 2004, with less than 20 per cent of
them receiving antiretroviral drugs. In Mozambique,
approximately 200,000 people were unable to access
antiretroviral drugs and other treatment for HIV
infection.

Death pena lty
Prisoners remained under sentence of death in
Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria,
Somal iland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
In Uganda, the High Court in Kakamega freed four
people who had been on death row since 1995 after a
successful appeal against their death sentences. In a
landmark judgment, the Constitutional Court of Uganda
ruled in favour of ending laws that stipulate a
mandatory death sentence. The Attorney General
appealed against the ruling.
In the DRC, argument over abolition of the death
penalty resurfaced during parliamentary debates on
the new Constitution. An early draft of the Constitution
proposed abolition, but a majority in the Senate and
National Assembly rejected the change.
H u man rights defenders
Across the region, governments remained hostile to
human rights defenders, and many faced harassment,
arbitrary arrest and detention, and assault.
In the DRC, Pascal Kabungulu, Executive Secretary of
the human rights organization Heirs of Justice, was shot
dead by three armed men in J uly at his home in Bukavu,
South-Kivu. An official commission of inquiry failed to
report its findings, and no perpetrators had been
brought to justice by the end of 2005. In Zimbabwe,
numerous NGOs and individual human rights defenders
were harassed and intimidated by the state. In Rwanda,
several members of Civil society, including staff of
human rights organizations, were forced to flee the
Amnesty International Report 2006

country for fear of being persecuted or arbitrarily
arrested. Some previously outspoken human rights
activists were intimidated into silence.
In Sudan, the government launched legal
proceedings against one of the leading human rights
groups in the country, the Sudan Organisation Against
Torture, in an apparent attempt to si lence it. Its
members faced more than five years' imprisonment.
Prominent human rights activist Mudawi Ibrahim was
arbitrarily arrested and detained without charge,
including when he was trying to leave Sudan to receive
an award in Ireland for human rights activism. He was
later released.
In Somalia, Abdulqadir Yahya Ali, director of the
Centre for Research and Dialogue, was assassinated in
Mogadishu in J uly by unidentified assailants.
In Togo, a group of young people associated with the
ruling party prevented the Togolese Human Rights
League from holding a press conference. In Angola,
Luis Aratijo, coordinator of SOS-Habitat, a housing
NGO, was briefly detained in J une and November
because of his activities to prevent forced evictions.
The authorities in Cameroon continued to use criminal
libel laws to imprison journalists in cases that appeared
to be politically motivated.
In Equatorial Guinea, lawyer and human rights
defender Fabian Nsue Nguema, a former prisoner of
conscience, was accused of misconduct and arbitrarily
suspended from the Bar Association for a year.
Many prisoners of conscience in Eritrea remained in
indefinite and incommunicado detention, without
charge or trial, and some were tortured or ill-treated. A
new law in May imposed severe restrictions on NGOs.
Human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience
were also held in Ethiopia. In Mauritania, however,
several NGOs were offiCially recognized for the first
time.

AM E R I CAS
The denial of human rights continued to be a daily
reality for many people in the Americas, particularly
those in the most vulnerable sectors of society such as
indigenous communities, women and children.
However, civil society, including the human rights
movement, continued to gain strength and influence in
their demands for better living conditions, government
transparency and accountability, and respect for
human rights.
The lives of the majority of people were blighted by
discrimination and poverty, both of which led to social
unrest and political instability in a number of countries.
I ndigenous movements, representing some of the
poorest and most marginalized people in the Americas,
stepped up their chal lenge to traditional political
structures, particularly in the Andean region.
Police abuse, torture and ill-treatment of detainees
remained widespread. "Disappearances" continued to be
reported in the context of Colombia's internal conflict.
Violence against women was endemic throughout the
region and the murders of hundreds of women in El
Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico, as well as the apparent
indifference of the authorities, caused widespread
outrage. The conflict in Colombia and high levels of
organized crime throughout the region, continued to
adversely affect the rights of vast numbers of people.
US policies pursued in the name of securi ty
undermined human rights both within the USA and in
many countries around the world.
Natural disasters, including a series of devastating
hurricanes, affected countries in the Caribbean and
Central America and the southern states of the USA,
exacerbating already serious levels of poverty and
margInalization. In many cases, such as in New Orleans
and other communities in LouiSiana State in the USA,
the authorities did not provide adequate protection
and aid provision was slow and insufficient.

National security and the 'war on terror'
Hypocrisy and a disregard for basic human rights
principles and international legal obligations
continued to mark the USA's "war on terror".
Thousands of detainees remained held without
charge in US custody in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantiinamo
Bay in Cuba, and in secret detention centres known as
"black sites" believed to exist in Europe, North Africa
and elsewhere. Torture and other ill-treatment
continued to be reported and further evidence
emerged that the US authorities "outsourced" torture
by means Including "rendition" - the transfer of
individuals to another country without any form of
judicial or administrative process, sometimes in secret.
Around 500 detaInees remained in Guantiinamo Bay,
where they were held in conditions amounting to cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment and continued to be
denied their right to challenge the lawfulness of their
detention.
Despite mounting eVidence that the US government
had sanctioned "disappearances' as wel l as

30

interrogation techniques constituting torture or other
ill-treatment, there was a failure to hold officials at the
highest levels accountable, including individuals who
may have been responsible for war crimes and crimes
against humanity.
US "war on terror" policies that undermined human
rights standards were challenged during 2005.
Legislation was passed prohibiting the torture and
inhumane treatment of detainees anywhere in the
world, despite initial objections from the Bush
administration that the prohibition would hamper its
ability to obtain information from detainees. However,
the bill also severely limited the Guantiinamo
detainees' access to federal courts and called into
question the future of some 200 pending cases in which
detainees had chal lenged the legality of their
detention.
The USA increased its military assistance programme
in Colombia despite continued evidence of grave
human rights violations by military personnel and
paramilitary groups operating with their active or tacit
support.

Conflict and crime
The rule of law in several countries was threatened by
abusive government policies, corruption,
discrimination and inequality that sparked social
protest by marginalized communities, particularly in
the Andean countries. Indigenous movements were
again at the forefront of many of the extended protests
and were increasingly vocal in demanding their rights
and participation in political life. The governments in
Ecuador and Bolivia were forced to resign as a result of
mass discontent.
In Colombia, the rule of law was threatened by
government policies in the context of the long-running
confliCt. All parties to the conflict continued to commit
widespread human rights abuses principally against the
civilian population.
Human rights and the rule of law were a lso under
threat through high levels of violence in several
countries, especially in urban areas. In some
Brazilian, Central American and Caribbean Cities,
entire neighbourhoods were trapped between
criminal, often gang-related, violence and the
repressive response of the state security forces whose
methods violated the rights of entire communities.
Although most public attention was devoted to crime
against the wealthy, it was the lives of the urban poor
which, deprived of state protection, were most
dominated by violence.
The trend towards mil itarization of law enforcement
continued. In Central America the role of the armed
forces was increasingly directed towards maintaining
public order and combating crime.
In Haiti, illegal armed groups and police officers were
implicated in the killing and kidnapping of civilians.
The proliferation of small arms remained a concern,
despite attempts by some governments to restrict
them. In a referendum in Brazil, 64 per cent of the
electorate voted against a proposal to ban commercial
sales of firearms.

Impunity and justice
Members of the security forces continued to commit
widespread human rights violations with impunity.
Across the region torture and other il l-treatment,
sometimes resulting in deaths in custody, were
reported but few of the perpetrators were punished.
Victims, their relatives or those representing them
when they filed complaints, as well as witnesses,
members of the judiciary and investigators, were
frequently intimidated, harassed, threatened with
death and sometimes kil led.
Many prisons were severely overcrowded and
lacking in basic services. Often, the conditions
amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
This caused several riots across the region resulting in
scores of deaths, mostly of young, poor men.
Inefficient, corrupt and discriminatory judicial systems
meant that detainees who came from poor and
marginalized communities could languish for months
and even years in prison without being tried and
sentenced, and frequently without access to defence
lawyers.
Excessive use of force by the security forces to curb
crime and civil unrest were reported in Brazil,
Colombia, Ecuador, jamaica, Paraguay and elsewhere
in the region. In some cases, people were killed as a
result.
The lack of independence and impartiality of judicial
systems in the region - because of corruption or
political bias, or because of corporate interests within
police and military courts - remained a serious concern
and fed the cycle of impunity for human rights
violations.
There was significant progress in addressing the
unresolved legacy of past human rights violations in
some Latin American countries. Former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet was placed under house arrest on
charges related to human rights violations. Having been
stripped of his legal immunity and declared "mentally
competent" to stand trial, victims and their relatives
were hopeful that their quest for justice for over 30
years might be fulfilled.
Victims and relatives of more recent grave human
rights violations saw their right to justice move closer
to realization when the former Peruvian President,
Alberto Fujimori, was arrested in Chile pending an
extradition request on charges of murder, forced
disappearance and torture.
The Argentine Supreme Court of justice declared the
Full Stop and Due Obedience laws null and void,
opening the way towards truth and justice for
thousands of victims of human rights violations
committed in Argentina between 1976 and 198).
Adolfo Scilingo, an Argentine former naval officer
who had admitted to being aboard planes carrying
detainees who were drugged, stripped naked and
thrown into the sea during the military governments in
Argentina, was tried and sentenced in Spain on charges
of crimes against humanity. In another case, a ruling by
Spain's Constitutional Court opened the way for former
Guatemalan President Rlos Montt and other former
military officials to be tried for human rights violations.
32

However, there were also significant setbacks. In
Colombia, the justice and Peace Law threatened to
guarantee impunity for members of illegal armed
groups implicated in human rights abuses, including
war crimes and crimes against humanity, who agreed to
demobilize. In Haiti, scores of former mil itary and
paramilitary officials serving sentences for their
involvement in past massacres escaped prison and
some were granted unconditional release for no
apparent lawful reason. Despite five years in office, the
Special Prosecutor assigned to bring to justice those
responsible for widespread human rights violations in
Mexico in the 1960s, 1 970S and 1980s achieved virtually
no progress.

Gender-based violence
Violence against women continued to be one of the
most pressing human rights challenges in the Americas.
Countless women and girls faced violence on a daily
basis and could not count on their government to
provide them with the basic level of protection and
security that is their fundamental right.
Governments across the region continued to ignore
provisions enshrined in women's human rights treaties.
Although most countries in the region had laws to
prevent and protect women from violence in the home
and community, police investigations into allegations
of violence against women were rarely effective,
criminal justice systems frequently failed to take
violence against women seriously and perpetrators
were rarely punished.
The number of women and girls murdered in Ciudad
juarez, Mexico, continued to rise and there was
insufficient progress to end impunity for past
abductions and murders both in this city and in the city
of Chihuahua. The number of women killed in
Guatemala rose to up to 665 compared to 527 in 2004,
and the increase of sexual abuse and murders of
women in El Salvador that began in 2002 continued.
Little progress was made in investigating these killings
and preventing future ones.
The lack of speCific definitions in law to criminalize
Violence against women continued to be an obstacle to
obtaining justice in a region where gender-based
discrimination remained endemic in state institutions.
However, some progress was made. I n Mexico, the
Supreme Court ruled that rape within marriage is a
crime, ending a 15-year legal battle during which
members of the judicial system argued that since the
purpose of marriage was procreation, forced sexual
relations by a spouse was not rape but "an undue
exercise of a [conjugal] right". I n Guatemala, the
Constitutional Court suspended a law that allowed
rapists, in certain circumstances, to escape prosecution
if they married their victim.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)
people continued to suffer discrimination and
violence. I n the USA a study carried out by Al
indicated a heightened pattern of misconduct and
abuse by police of transgender individuals and of a l l
LGBT people of colour or who are young, immigrants,
homeless or sex workers. In Nicaragua, gay and
Amnesty International Report 2006

REG I O NAL OVE RVI EWS - AM E R I CAS

lesbian relationships continued to be criminal ized
and a number of sodomy laws were still in force in
Caribbean countries.

Economic, social and cultu ra l rights
According to UN studies, there were signs of a slight
reduction in poverty levels in some countries in the
region. However. these figures masked pockets of
decline in some places. including Haiti. and in some
rural areas in Guatemala. Peru and elsewhere. Income
and social inequalities remained among the highest in
the world. undermining the potential for overall
development. Marginalized and dispossessed
communities in rural and urban settings in many
countries continued to live in extreme poverty with
their rights to health care. clean water. a livelihood.
education and shelter disregarded.
Participation of indigenous peoples in political
affairs was not matched with improvements in their
enjoyment of economic. social and cultural rights.
despite repeated calls by international banks and
others to develop help and support for indigenous
peoples and afro-descendants and to invest in rural
communities. A World Bank study of indigenous
peoples in Bolivia. Ecuador. Guatemala. Mexico and
Peru found that indigenous peoples were 13 to 30 per
cent more likely to be poor than non-indigenous
peoples.
The H IV/AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 24.000
lives in the Caribbean in 2005. making it the leading
cause of death among adults aged between 1 5 and 44. A
total of 300.000 people were believed to be living with
HIV in the region. including 30.000 people who became
infected in 2005. In the other parts of the region.
infection rates rose. especia l ly among men. Women sex
workers were also badly affected.

Amnesty International Report 2006

The conflicts over resources. such as land and water.
and privatization plans were reflected by the number of
human rights defenders attacked on account of their
efforts to raise legitimate concerns in these areas.
A summit of Americas' governments held in
Argentina in November failed to break the deadlock on
long-stalled negotiations to establish a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FrAA). Some countries. led by
Argentina. Brazil and Venezuela. vigorously opposed
the initiative.
However. liberalized trade and investment
continued to prevail in the region. through bilateral
agreements or sub-regional arrangements. There were
protests about the effect of such agreements on
entrenching poverty in large sectors of the population
and the faIlure of governments to ensure that human
rights safeguards were built into the agreements.
Human rights continued to take a back seat to
economic interests. increasing the risk that
irresponsible trade practices or investment decisions
would undermine human rights. Areas of specific
concern included labour rights. access to affordable
medicines and intellectual property rights.

Death penalty
Death sentences continued to be handed down in
several countries. including Belize and Trinidad and
Tobago. However, the only executions in the region
were in the USA. Mexico abolished the death penalty
for all crimes.
In December the USA carried out its I.oooth
execution since 1977. when executions resumed after a
moratorium. Despite this shameful landmark. the trend
towards restricting its application continued. In March.
the US Supreme Court banned the execution of child
offenders (those aged under 18 at the time of the crime).

33

REGIO NAL OVE RVI EWS - AS IA-PACI F I C

bringing the USA into l i ne with international standards
prohibiting such executions. Two people were released
from death row on grounds of innocence. However,
among the 60 people executed in 2005 were people
with mental disabi lities, defendants without access to
effective legal representation and foreign nationals
denied their consular rights.

Human rights defenders
Human rights activists across the Americas campaigned
vigorously to hold governments and armed groups to
their obligations to respect international and domestic
human rights standards.
Women's rights activists struggled to reform
antiquated laws on rape and domestic violence and
were often threatened or intimidated for trying to
support victims of violence and sexual abuse.
I ndigenous activists in Central America championed
their community's rights to defend their livelihoods and
the right to be consulted on issues that affect their
ancestral lands, such as the extraction of natural
resources or the construction of dams. AI feared that
some gay, lesbian and transgender activists went
underground following mounting homophobia in
Jamaica and some other Caribbean countries.
The d i fficulties and dangers faced by activists in the
Americas ranged from intimidation and restrictions
on travel, to arbitrary detention and unfounded
accusations of terrorism and other violent activities.
The authorities often refused to take reports of
violations against human rights defenders seriously,
suggesti ng that the reports were fabricated or
exaggerated. Activists working local ly on rural
poverty and development, often in isolated areas, and
journal ists covering issues such as corruption were
killed in Brazi l , Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico. I n
Ecuador, members o f an N G O that campaigns to
protect i ndigenous communities and the environment
from the adverse effects of oil dri l l and fumigation
of coca plantations were threatened with death. In
Cuba human rights activists, political disSidents and
trade unionists continued to be harassed and
intimidated and attacks on freedom of expression and
association were frequent.
The use of the judicial system to hamper the work of
human rights defenders by threatening them with
investigation or detention on unfounded criminal
charges was a serious problem in Colombia, Cuba,
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. Cases were
also reported in the USA.
Government efforts to protect human rights
defenders at risk were marred by extended delays by
some authorities in implementing requests for
precautionary measures to protect named
individuals, as recommended by the Inter-American
Commission of Human Rights. Some governments only
managed to offer protection measures such as bul let­
proof vests and were unable to muster suffiCient
pol itical will to tackle deep hostility towards human
rights work within their governments, or to correct
legal provisions restricting the right to defend
human rights.

34

AS I A- PACI F I C
With 56 per cent of the world's population, two
emergent economic superpowers, a host of armed
conflicts, a series of natural disasters and civil society
organization ranging from minimal to vibrant, the ASia­
PaCific region continued to provide a challenging and
dynamic context for the promotion of human rights in
2005. Ongoing conflicts and security concerns
persisted, heightening the vulnerability of populations
and providing the context for many grave abuses.
Welcome moves in 2005 towards a greater
acceptance of international human rights standards
included the ratification by Afghanistan of the UN
Refugee Convention, the ratification by I ndia of the
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child on the involvement of children in armed
conflict, and the ratification by the Indonesian
parliament of the International Covenant on Civil and
Pol itical Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, SOCial and Cultural Rights.
National human rights institutions continued to
operate in several countries, including Afghanistan,
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Sri Lanka
and Thailand, a lthough not in Bangladesh, China and
Viet Nam. I n Pakistan, a draft bil l to establish a national
human rights commission was presented to parliament.
There were also positive moves towards cooperation
between national human rights bodies, including those
in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phi lippines and Thailand.
2005 saw moves towards a thawing of relations
between states historically hostile to each other. There
were talks and cross-border transport between India
and Pakistan, and six-party discussions on North Korea
progressed with an accord in which North Korea
pledged to abandon i ts nuclear programme in return
for assurances on aid and security.
PolitiCized religious movements impacted on the
everyday reality of human rights, especially in south
ASia. There were constraints on women's movement and
dress as well as impediments to the ability of minority
groups to practise their beliefs and live peacefully.
Asia moved centre stage in international trade and
business affairs with the Global Compact and the World
Trade Organization's meetings held in China and Hong
Kong. India and China continued to show fast rates of
economic growth. However, national indicators
suggested that millions of people were living in poverty
- from more than a quarter of the population in
Cambodia, I ndia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, to
around half the population in Bangladesh and Vi et Nam.
Although the Internet was widely taken up, in parts
of Asia it was not the tool of freedom of expression it
had promised to be. I n China, access continued to be
heavi ly monitored by the state, with many websites
blocked and users prosecuted for posting political
opinions or information embarrassing to the
government. I n Viet Nam, the sharing of opinions and
information on the web resulted in prosecutions for
"espionage".

Security concerns
Attacks against civilians by armed groups affected
many parts of the region, including AFghanistan,
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
Bombings caused carnage and robbed hundreds of
people of their lives.
Some state responses to such attacks were
disproportionate and at times discriminated against
marginal or minority groups, reinforcing pre-existing
grievances or persecution. Arbitrary arrests in the
name of combating terrorism were reportedly made in
AFghanistan, including by US and Coalition forces, and
in Pakistan by the security forces. I n China, people
charged with terrorism and "state secrets" offences
were tried in secret. In India, the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act continued to provide the state with
many of the powers that had been heavily criticized in
annul led counter-terrorism legislation. In Australia,
detention without trial and renewable control orders
were introduced through counter-terrorism legislation.
New national security legislation in South Korea
continued to be used against those engaged in peaceful
political activities. In Malaysia, al leged Islamists had
two-year detention orders renewed despite the
National Human Rights Commission urging the trial or
release of all Internal Security Act detainees.
The role of the USA in its "war on terror" continued in
the region during 2005. Air attacks by US forces killed at
least 1 5 civilians in Pakistan and dozens in AFghanistan.
Abuses reportedly continued in US bases in AFghanistan
and prompted popular unrest, during which people
were kil led. Men returning to AFghanistan from US
custody in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, brought home
gruelling accounts of torture and i l l-treatment which
further fuelled local anger, anxiety and unrest.

Troubled states
In a number of states in the region, the national
framework through which protection against and
redress for human rights abuses could be sought was
weak and i neffective.
The AFghan state continued to fail to deliver safety,
security and the rule of law to its people. Warlords
believed to have been responsible for human rights
abuses wielded power and instilled a climate of fear in
parts of the country. Fundamental flaws in the criminal
justice system, the legacy of decades of conflict, and
deeply embedded discrimination against women
profoundly militated against the promotion of human
rights and justice for past and continuing violations,
particularly for women and girls.
In Nepal, the King cited the need to counter violence
by Maoist groups to declare a state of emergency in
February, dismiss the government and suspend civil
liberties. Mass detentions followed and there was a
further breakdown in security for much of the
population.
I n Timor-Leste, the very newness of the institutional
structures meant there was a shortage of judges,
prosecutors and defence lawyers. This seriously
impacted on the right to a fair trial and other aspects of
the criminal justice system.
Elsewhere in the region, governments in countries
including Myanmar, North Korea and Viet Nam
appeared to be largely impervious to pressure to
uphold human rights. The authorities in Myanmar, for
example, continued to violate human rights through
widespread and long-term political imprisonments,
forced labour, land confiscations and displacement of
minorities, thereby showing utter disregard for the
population and the international community.

Armed conflicts
Armed conflicts persisted in several places, including
Afghanistan, parts of India, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri
Lanka and southern Thailand.
Two areas of armed conflict that were affected by the
December 2004 tsunami saw very different developments
in the following 12 months. Indonesia underwent a
process of negotiation leading to a peace agreement in
Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam in August. By contrast, Sri
Lanka witnessed increased violence, including the
assassination of the Foreign Minister in August, growing
insecurity in the east, and a marked deterioration of the
situation in the north in December, shortly after the
election of a new President. At the end of 2005 there was
deep concern about the escalation of violence in Sri
Lanka and the viabi lity of the ceasefire agreement.
The conflict in southern Thailand continued to
deteriorate in 2005 with a considerable heightening of
the climate of fear and constraint. Both sides to the
conflict were implicated in human rights abuses and
violence. I n the Phi lippines a ceasefire between the
government and secessionist forces in Mindanao,
although fragile, largely held throughout 2005.
Discrimination
States continued to fail in their duty to protect the
human rights of all, both by maintaining discriminatory
laws and by fai ling to ensure that those who suffer
discrimination have adequate redress.
Ethnicity, gender, socio-economic factors and sexual
identities continued to provide the backdrop for
discrimination across the region. Among those targeted
were dalits ("low caste" people) and adivasis
(indigenous people) in India; Ahmadis in Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Indonesia; Montagnards and Buddhists in
Viet Nam; indigenous peoples in Australia; Karen, Mon,
Rohingyas and Shan in Myanmar; Uighurs in China; and
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across
the region. Among the abuses such targeted groups
suffered were forced labour, displacement,
persecution, and restrictions on freedom of expression
and the right to practise their religion.
On a positive note, a landmark ruling by a Fiji court
recognized that provisions in the Penal Code used
against consensual homosexual activity violated
constitutional guarantees on privacy and equality.
Violence against women
Women and girls continued to suffer a vast array of
forms of violence, including domestic Violence, forced
abortions and sterilizations, forced marriages, killings
and crimes of "honour". Such abuses were systematic
and carried out on a massive scale.
Violence against women continued to be closely
i nterrelated with cultural attitudes and practices of
gender discrimination, such as wanting babies to be
boys, the belief that women should not leave the home
and the view that women should not take decisions
relating to marriage.
Gender discrimination constrained life and
employment choices, thus making women and girls
particularly vulnerable to trafficking -a third of a l l
Amnesty International Report 2006

global human trafficking was estimated to originate
from or be located in Asia. Many countries in the region
continued to view trafficked women as i llegal
immigrants and failed to prosecute the traffickers.
justice and safety often escaped women facing
violence because of inadequate or non-existent state
mechanisms, or because penalties for perpetrators
were inconsistent or did not reflect the seriousness of
the violence. As a result, many of those who
perpetrated violence against women enjoyed impunity.
The need for changes in attitudes as well as legal
reform meant that progress in challenging the violence
was patchy and slow. Some notable efforts included the
establishment of an inter-ministerial council aimed at
combating violence against women in Afghanistan; the
adoption or proposal of laws to protect women from
domestic Violence in Cambodia, Fiji and India; the
introduction of legislation against sexual harassment in
China; the draft before parliament of anti-trafficking
legislation in Indonesia; and the establishment of the
first purpose-built shelter for victims of family violence
in the Solomon Islands.
The plight of the so-called "comfort women"
demonstrated the low priority of delivering redress to
women victims of violence. Having been victims of
mil itary systems of sexual slavery more than 50 years
ago, these women continued to campaign for
reparations through the courts in japan and elsewhere,
but at the end of 2005 were sti ll waiting for justice.

Migrants and refugees
Asia continued to see significant migration flows within
and beyond the region. Migrant workers and their
families faced uncertainty, vulnerability and poor
treatment in many countries, includmgjapan,
Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan. Few states in the
region, particularly receiving states, had ratified the
I nternational Convention on the Protection of the
Rights of All M igrant Workers and Members ofThelr
Families.
Refugees and asylum-seekers faced marginalization,
harassment and arbitrary arrest. Laws and practice in
several states allowed ill-treatment of refugees,
including caning of migrants and asylum-seekers in
Malaysia and arbitrary detention of asylum-seekers
and refugees in detention centres in Australia.
The conflicts in Sri Lanka and Nepal generated
significant numbers of internally displaced people. I n
Nepal, an estimated 200,000 displaced people suffered
a severe lack of services, including housing, health and
education. I n Sri Lanka, hundreds of thousands of
people displaced by the conflict and the tsunami were
particularly vulnerable to conflict-related violence.
Natural disasters
The region suffered devastating natural disasters in
2005, and the extent of the impact of the 2004 tsunami
became clear during the year. I n Indonesia, it emerged
that over 700,000 people had died, were still missing or
had been displaced as a result of the tsunami. I n
Thailand, at least 100,000 people had been affected. I n
S r i Lanka, 35,322 people died a n d 516, 150 were

37

REG I O NAL OVE RVI EWS - ASIA- PAC I F I C

displaced. I n India, a n estimated 15,000 people died
and more than 1 12,000 were displaced.
A powerful earthquake that struck the Pakistan/India
border region In October 2005 left an estimated 73,000
dead in Pakistan and at least 1 ,200 dead in India's
jammu and Kashmir state. Between 2 and 3 million
people were made homeless. Further deaths and
widespread suffering were witnessed in the severe
weather conditions in the following Himalayan winter.
Concerns about relief efforts after the tsunami and the
earthquake centred on ongoing conflict, access to
remote areas and allegations of discrimination.

Economic, socia l and cu ltural rights
India and China enjoyed considerable international
attention and support for their economic growth and
status as emerging players in the global economic
scene. While claims of a decrease in the number of
those In "absolute poverty" were contested, any
parallel improvement in human rights was not
manifest. Economic development did not priontlze
realization of economic, social and cultural rights. I n
China, rural migrant labour continued t o suffer dire
conditions, and hundreds of thousands of peasant
farmers were increasingly marglnalized through land
expropriation, lack of health care and the failure of the
state to provide education for millions of children in
rural areas. Rural-urban disparities and the growing
gap between rich and poor fuelled social unrest in the
countryside. In I ndia, legislation was introduced in
2005 to guarantee minimum annual employment for the
poor In selected areas.
Across the region, conflict and environmental
degradation still adversely affected many communities.
In Afghanistan, up to a third of the population could not
rely on safe or reliable sources of food, drinkable water
or shelter. In India, thousands of people were stil l
awaiting remedies for the 1984 Bhopal disaster.
Death pena lty
The Asia-Pacific region continued to have a poor profile
with regard to the death penalty, although a notable
minority of countries were abolitionist. The death
penalty was retained in 26 countnes, Including
Afghanistan, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore,
Thailand and Viet Nam. Capital offences included tax
fraud, murder, drugs smuggling, robbery and
kidnapping.
In South Korea an unofficial moratorium remained in
place. A death penalty abolition bill introduced in 2004
by a member of parliament and former death row
Inmate passed its first parliamentary hurdle, with
bipartisan support, in February 2005.
China and Mongolia still refused to make death
penalty statistics public and official statistics from
some other countries were considered unreliable. Even
so, official statistics remained high. They included at
least 1,770 executions and 3,900 death sentences in
China, at least 31 executions and 241 death sentences in
Pakistan, at least 2 1 executions and 65 death sentences
in Viet Nam, and at least 24 death sentences in
Afghanistan.

38

Practices that aggravated the suffering of those
awaiting execution included the sudden announcement
of executions in japan, so that those about to be killed
did not have the chance to meet their families and other
loved ones. In Pakistan, the unreliability of
documentation relating to registration of births led to a
lack of confidence that all those facing execution were
adults and that a 2001 commutation order for juveniles
on death row was applied to all child offenders
sentenced to death.
Key abolitionist voices in the region included the
President and Chief justice to the Supreme Court in
India, the Foreign Minister in Sri Lanka and the Home
Minister In Japan. However, no country in the ASia­
Pacific region abolished the death penalty in 2005.

Human rights defenders
Human rights activists, particularly those defending the
rights of women, came under increasing attack by
private individuals and groups as well as by agents of
the state. Human rights defenders across the region
faced threats, harassment, and arrest and assault for
their work. China detained many human rights
defenders, including journalists and lawyers, and some
were sentenced to prison terms. Activists were also
arrested during political crackdowns in Cambodia and
Nepal, and human rights defenders suffered death
threats in Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Impunity for crimes against human rights defenders
remained a problem, even in the most high-profile
cases. I n Thailand, for instance, despite pressure from
the Prime Minister to resolve the "disappearance" of
human rights lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit In March
2004, none of the suspects had been brought to justice
by the end of 2005.
Despite the tremendous pressures facing human
rights defenders, the scale of human rights activism
across the region was remarkable. Human rights
defenders were at the forefront of struggles to advance
economic, social and cultural rights, particularly in
China, India and the Philippines. Women human rights
defenders began forging partnerships, including at the
first-ever global gathering of women human rights
defenders in Sri Lanka in December 2005. At this
meeting, which brought together some 200 activists
from around the world, women activists developed a
range of strategies to combat the violence,
discrimination and other abuses they experience
specifically because of their gender and because of
their work in defence of human rights.
In some cases, victims of abuse became committed
human rights defenders. In Pakistan, for example,
Mukhtaran Mai, a survivor of gang-rape, became an
activist for the right of all women to live their lives in
safety and dignity.

Direct attacks on civilians, including i n Russia, Spain,
Turkey and the UK, led to loss of life and many injuries.
Governments continued to attack human rights in the
name of security, including through measures that
undermined the universal and absolute ban on torture
and other ill-treatment.
The legacy of previous conflicts, including impunity
for crimes committed during them, persisted. Cyprus
continued to be a divided island and no significant
progress was made in resolving the status of the
region's internationally unrecognized entities, situated
within the borders of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova
but remaining outside of those states' de facto control.
However, steps were taken to open talks on the final
status of Kosovo.
Many countries in the region were a magnet for those
attempting to escape poverty, violence or persecution.
The fact that asylum is principally a human rights issue
continued to be all but lost in the face of political
pressure to control "illegal immigration" or to prioritize
'security concerns". In breach of their international
obligations, some states unlawfully detained asylum­
seekers and conducted expulsions without due
process, including to countries where those seeking
protection were at further risk of violations. Asylum­
seekers, migrants and minorities remained among
those continuing to face racism and discrimination
across the region.
While the process of accession to the European
Union (EU) continued to encourage human rights
progress in some states, institutionally the EU
continued to have a minimalist concept of its domestic

human rights role. Adoption of the EU's constitutional
treaty, incorporating its Charter of Fundamental Rights,
stalled after rejection by voters in two member states.
The EU's proposed new Agency for Fundamental Rights,
while potentially a significant step forward in
overcoming E U complacency towards observance and
fulfilment of human rights within its own borders,
showed a limited and ad hoc approach to human rights
policy - with abuses by member states largely excluded
from its remit.

Security and human rights
Security continued to ecli pse observance of
fundamental human rights, to the detriment of both
issues. In the UK, new measures purportedly to
counter terrorism were enacted even though the
country had some of the toughest anti-terrorism laws
in the region. The enactment of other measures,
including provisions that would undermine the rights
to freedom of expreSSion, association, liberty and fair
trial, was pending at the end of the year. People
previously held Without charge or trial , labelled
'terrorist suspects' on the basis of secret intell igence
they were not al lowed to know and therefore could
not refute, were placed under restrictive 'control
orders" after their detention had, in 2004, been ruled
incompatible with their human rights. Most of them
were subsequently reimprisoned under immigration
powers pending deportation on national security
grounds: many of the men and their families suffered
serious deterioration in their mental and physical
health as a result of their ordeals.
The UK government also continued to undermine
the universal and absolute ban on torture by trying to
deport people they deemed to be terror suspects to

countries w i t h a history of torture or other i l l ­
treatment. The authorities sought to rely o n
inherently unreliable and ineffective "diplomatic
assurances" featured in Memorandums of
Understanding agreed with states with a wel l­
documented record of torture. I n December the
highest court in the U K delivered a landmark
judgment upholding the absolute inadmissibility as
evidence in legal proceedings of information
extracted under torture. However, earlier in the year
a German court ruled thut eVidence possibly obtained
under torture or other i l l-treatment was admissible in
legal proceedings. In France, a draft anti-terrorism
law would al low longer periods of incommunicado
detention and so would remove safeguards against
torture and other i l l-treatment.
Disclosures at the end of the year suggested the
involvement of a number of European states in i llegal
and secret transfers ("renditions") by the USA of
individuals to countries where torture was rife, or to US
custody in military bases and secret locations around
the world. Both the Council of Europe and the European
Parliament launched inquiries into allegations of secret
US Central I ntelligence Agency (CIA) detention centres
In Europe and of C IA-chartered aeroplanes making
flights in or out of European airspace said to have been
used in abductions and unlawful transfers of prisoners.
In Uzbekistan, the authorities responded brutally
when a group of armed men seized various buildings in
the city of Andizhan in May. Witnesses reported that
hundreds of people were killed when security forces
fired recklessly and without warning on a mostly
unarmed and peaceful crowd of demonstrators that
Included children.
In a disturbing development in Turkey, against a
background of increasing Violence between the
security services and the armed opposition Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), there were reports of direct
offiCial involvement in the November bombing of a
bookshop In the $emdinli district of Hakkari in which
one man was killed.

Refugees, asylum-seekers and migra nts
There was a consistent pattern of human rights
Violations linked to the Interception, detention and
expulsion by states of foreign nationals, including
those seeking International protection. At least 1 3
people were kil led when trying t o enter the Spanish
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco, allegedly
as a result of Spanish and Moroccan law enforcement
officers using disproportionate and lethal force to
prevent them entering the enclaves.
Men, women and children continued to face
obstacles in accessing asylum procedures. I n Greece,
I taly, Spain and the UK, some were unlawfully detained
and others were denied necessary gUidance and legal
support. Many were unlawfully expelled before their
claims could be heard, including from Cyprus, Greece,
Ita ly, Kazakstan, Malta, Russia and Spain. Some were
sent to countries where they were at risk of human
rights violations. The fact that EU member states were
among those doing this i llustrated the EU's failure to
Amnesty International Report 2006

acknowledge that it faced a crisis of protection, rather
than of asylum. Elsewhere, Intense International
pressure was placed on Kyrgyzstan to honour its
obligation to offer protection to those fleeing the
Andizhan events in Uzbekistan.

Racism a nd discrimination
ContinUing raCism, discriminatIOn and Intolerance
were often identity-based. In many countries In the
region, Jews and Muslims were among those targeted
by Individuals and organizations for hate crimes.
In Russia, there were hundreds of racially motivated
phYSical assaults; at least 28 of them resulted In deaths.
In France, migrants and French nationals of North
African and sub-Saharan extraction, apparently
enraged by discriminatory practices in employment
and other areas, and the often racist and aggressive
conduct of the police, began rioting in Cities and towns
across the country in October after the deaths of two
boys in disputed circumstances. A state of emergency
was declared.
Across the region Roma remained severely
disadvantaged in key areas of public and private life
such as hOUSing, employment, education and health
services. They were also frequently the targets of
racism by law enforcement offiCials.
I n some countries of the former Yugoslavia,
discrimination on ethnic grounds in areas such as
employment and housing continued to block a durable
and dignified return for many people displaced by the
conflict.
Others faced discrimination around issues of their
legal status. Meskhetians in the Krasnodar Territory i n
Russia continued t o b e refused recognition of their
citizenship on ethniC grounds, and so were unable to
access a wide range of basIc rights. In G reece, the
authorities stil l refused to reissue citizenship
documents to members of the Muslim population in
western Thrace, with those affected thereby denied
access to state benefits and institutions. In Slovenia,
thousands of people unlawfully "erased" in 1 992 from
the registry of permanent residents, mainly people
from other Yugoslav republics (many of them Roma),
were stil l waiting for their status to be resolved. As a
result of the "erasure" many were denied ful l access to
their economic and SOCial rights.
A climate of intolerance against the lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities in
Latvia, Poland and Romania saw local authorities
actively obstructing public events organized by LGBT
groups amid openly homophobic language used by
some highly placed politicians. However, in Spain and
the UK new laws recognized partnerships for same sex
couples.
Violence against women
Domestic violence against women and girls remained
Widespread across the region, affecting all ages and
SOCIal groups. Positive attempts to tackle it included
prOVisions In the new Turkish Penal Code offering
greater protection for women against Violence in the
family, and special courts established for women victims

41

REG I O NAL OVE RVI EWS - E U ROPE/CE NTRAL ASIA

of domestic violence in Spain. However, the law in Spain
- as In other places - continued to leave the onus on the
victim, not the state, to lodge a formal complaint or take
the initiative in organizing protection.
Other gaps in legal protection included no specific
criminal ization of domestic violence in countries such
as Albania and Russia. Too often, initiatives such as the
opening of a shelter, the establishment of a helpline or
provision of other services happened through the
efforts of individuals and NGOs struggling with
Inadequate funding. Moscow, the capital of Russia and
a city of 10 million people, remained without a single
shelter for women who were victims of violence.
Poverty, lack of education, family breakdown and
crime networks contributed to the continuing problem
of trafficking of human beings, including of women and
girls for enforced prostitution. Protection for the
survivors and prosecution of the perpetrators were
hindered by issues such as a failure to provide
trafficked people with an automatic right to protection
and assistance; the lack, or inadequate Implementation
of, witness protection law; failure to cnminalize
Internal trafficking; and threats and fears of reprisals.
One potentially positive step was the opening for
signature In May of the Council of Europe's Convention
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.

Abuses by officials and impunity
Torture and ill-treatment, often race-related, were
reported across the region. Victims described a
catalogue of abuses, including being beaten, stripped
naked and threatened with death; deprivation of food,
water and sleep; having plastic bags placed over their
heads; and threats against their family. i n some cases,
detainees reportedly died as a result of such abuse or
excessive use of force, including in Bulgaria, Russia and
Spain.
Although there were some pOSitive developments,
including moves by new administrations in Georgia and
Ukraine to tackle torture and i l l-treatment, there were
stil l obstacles In these and other countries that
prevented the eradication of such abuses. The
obstacles included police cover-ups, victims' fear of
repercussions, lack of prompt access to a lawyer, and
the lack of an effective, properly resourced and
Independent system to investigate complaints. Failure
to conduct prompt, thorough and Impartial
investigations led to a n overwhelming climate of
impunity in Turkey, Uzbekistan and elsewhere in the
region. In Russia, impunity remained the norm for
serious human rights abuses in the context of the
Chechen conflict.
In many countries, conditions in prisons, as wel l as in
detention centres for asylum-seekers and irregular
migrants, were inhuman and degrading.
intense international pressure on some countries in
the western Balkans produced improved cooperation
With the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia early in the year, with the capture or
apparently voluntary surrender of a number of
suspects accused of cnmes, including war CrImes and
CrImes against humanity. Among those held was former
42

Croatian Army General Ante Gotovlna, although other
suspects continued to evade arrest. Lack of full
cooperation with the Tribunal together with
insufficient efforts by domestic courts remained an
obstacle to justice.

Death pena lty
There was further progress towards total abolition of
the death penalty in the region. Legal amendments In
Moldova removed the last provisions for the death
penalty from the Constitution. Similar draft
constitutional amendments were proposed in
Kyrgyzstan.
Uzbekistan announced that capital punishment
would be abolished from 2008, but this was l ittle
comfort for all those affected by the death penalty.
Dozens of people were believed to have been
sentenced to death and executed during 2005 in a
criminal Justice system flawed throughout by
corruption and which consistently failed to
investigate al legations of torture. Relatives,
tormented by uncertainty, were not told in advance
the date of executions and were denied the bodies of
their executed relatives and knowledge of where they
were buried. Uzbekistan also flouted its international
legal obligations by executing at least one person
whose case was under consideration by the UN
Human Rights Committee, at one point even assuring
the Committee that the man remained al ive when the
death certificate indicated that he had been executed
three weeks earlier. Belarus and Uzbekistan remained
the region's last executioners.
Repression of dissent
Civil, political and religious dissent remained
systematically and often brutally repressed In Belarus,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, offiCial
attempts to block a lternative reports of the many
deaths in Andizhan involved widespread intimidation,
beatings and detentions, including of witnesses,
demonstrators, journalists and human rights
defenders. In Belarus, opposition activists were
imprisoned on false criminal charges. In Turkmenistan,
political dissidents and members of religious minority
groups were among those harassed, arbitrarily
detained and tortured.
In Russia, the climate of hostility towards human
rights defenders intenSified and some individuals were
prosecuted for exercising their right to freedom of
expression. A new law affecting NGOs, requiring
stricter registration rules and increased state scrutiny,
threatened to further compromise the independence of
civil society.
In Serbia, increasing attacks by non-state actors on
human rights defenders, with the tacit support of the
state, were reminiscent of the period under former
PreSident Slobodan Milosevic. In Turkey a Wide range
of CrItical opinions remained open to criminalizatiOn,
with writers, publishers, human rights defenders and
academics among those prosecuted under a law which
penalized "denigration" ofTurkishness, the state and its
institutions.

M I D D LE EAST/ N O RTH AFR I CA
At first sight, the pattern of widespread abuse that has
long characterized human rights in the Middle East and
North Africa remained firmly entrenched in 2005.
Indeed, considering the appalling toll of abuses
perpetrated by all parties to the conflict in Iraq, the
continuing struggle between IsraeliS and Palestinians,
and some of the views expressed by I ran's new
President, the picture could have appeared very bleak.
Despite this and the persistence of grave violations
across the region, there were some signs to suggest that
2005 might come to be seen as a time when some of the
old certainties began to look less certain and a new
dynamic began to take hold. The wal l of impunity
behind which so many perpetrators of torture, political
kills and other abuses had sheltered for so long
began to fracture. Former Iraqi President Saddam
Hussain was brought to trial on charges relating to
executions of vil lagers in 1982, and an unprecedented
UN Security Council-mandated inquiry implicated
senior Syrian and Lebanese offiCials in the 2005
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq
al-Hariri.
In Morocco, the Arab world's first truth commission
shed important light on grave human rights abuses
committed over a period of more than 40 years and
brought acknowledgement and reparation for at least
Amnesty International Report 2006

some of the Victims, although not yet justice. In Libya,
the authontles announced a belated Investigation into
the killing or "disappearance" of possibly hundreds of
pnsoners at Tripoli's Abu Selim Prison in 1996.
Women, for so long subject to discrimination in both
law and practice, finally won the right to vote in Kuwait
and achieved greater recognition of their human rights
in countries such as Algeria and Morocco. Even i n Saudi
Arabia, the exclusion of women from participation in
the country's first ever municipal elections sparked
debate and growing pressure for change.
Only time will tell whether these were the first signs
of real and overdue change or merely instances that
bucked the trend. However, the emergence of an
increasingly active and outspoken community of
human rights activists was a further promising
development. Using the Internet and the opportunities
provided by the growth and popularity of satellite
television, human rights actiVists were able
increasingly to communicate information and share
ideas unimpeded by national boundaries both within
and beyond the region and to derive new strength and
solidarity from the regional and global alliances to
which they contributed.
However, 2005 also brought repression and misery to
far too many people in the region as their human rights
were abused or denied. Some were targeted because of
their political views, others because of their religion or
ethnicity, yet others for their sexual orientation.
Throughout the region women were subject to varying
degrees of discrimination and Violence because of their
gender. Countless others were unable to enjoy fully
their economiC, social and cultural rights.

Conflict, violence a nd crimes under
international law
The persistence of armed conflict and other forms of
political violence was the context for war crimes and
cnmes against humanity perpetrated by several
parties. Thousands of children and adult civilians were
kil led or injured in the continuing conflict in Iraq, many
of them victims of suicide bomb attacks carried out by
militant groups that frequently targeted civilians. Other
civilians, Including IraqiS and foreign nationals, were
abducted and held hostage; some were released but
others were killed by their captors. Troops of the US-led
multinational force and I raqi government forces also
committed widespread abuses, including torture and
unlawful killings of civilians, and detained thousands of
suspects arbitrarily and without access to due process.
In November, the I raq conflict spilled over to Jordan
when suicide bombers apparently linked to I raq
targeted three hotels i n the capital, Amman, killing 60
people and wounding many others. In Egypt, bombs
that targeted civilians exploded in Cairo in April and
Sharm el-Sheik in July; 90 people were kil led and at
least 100 were injured.
New evidence emerged of human rights violations
by governments and i ntell igence services in the
Middle East/North Africa region and those in the USA
and other Western countries in their close
collaboration in the 'war on terror". A I interviewed

REGIO NAL OVE RVI EWS - M I D D LE EAST/ N O RTH AFRICA

detainees in Yemen who said that they had been
briefly detamed and tortured in Jordan and then held
for many months in secret detention centres under US
control. whose location they never learned. before
being flown to Yemen. Yemeni authorities told AI that
the detainees were being held at the behest of the US
government.
There was increasing information to indicate that
individuals suspected of terrorism by the US authorities
had been secretly and forcibly transferred to countries.
includmg Egypt. Morocco. Jordan and Syria. for
interrogation. Senior US offiCials continued to proclaim
their administration's opposition to torture despite
such transfers ("renditions") of suspects to countries
whose security services had long records of torturing
detainees with impunity. Neither the USA nor any of the
countries concerned disclosed the number of those
transferred. where they were being held or their
Identities.
As a further sign of close collaboration. three
countries - Lebanon. Libya and Jordan - signed
bilateral agreements with the UK under which they
agreed to accept individuals whom the UK authorities
said were suspected of terrorism and wished forcibly to
expel. All three countries. under the terms of these
Memorandums of Understanding with the UK. were
required to provide speCific assurances that anyone
returned under the agreement would not be tortured or
treated mhumanely. in impliCit recognition that these
countries had failed to respect the guarantees against
torture to which they had previously committed under
international law.
Several countries invoked the "war on terror" as a
justification for maintaining long-standing emergency
powers. as in Egypt. or for introducing new legislation
that threatened to violate human rights ostenSibly in
the interests of protecting national security. as in
Bahrain. Scores of prosecutions on terrorism-related
charges were mounted in countries that included
Algeria. Egypt. Jordan. Morocco and Tunisia. In many
cases. defendants appeared before special or ordinary
courts whose procedures fell far short of those required
by international fair trial standards. Some complained
that they had been tortured and ill-treated while held
in pre-trial detention and forced to ·confess". However.
courts rarely ordered investigations or gave credence
to such claims.

Impunity, justice and accounta bility
With few exceptions. perpetrators of human rights
abuses continued to benefit from impunity as
governments failed to hold them to account and
ensure justice for their victims. I n many countries in
the region. security and i ntelligence services were
given free rein to detain suspects for long periods.
often holding them incommunicado and without
charge and exposing them to torture and i l l­
treatment, confident that they did so with offiCial
acquiescence and Without fear of intervention by the
courts. Detainees were frequently tortured in Syria in
pre-trial detention. In Egypt. I ran and Tunisia,
defendants frequently complained of torture when
44

they were eventually brought to trial only for courts
to dismiss their al legations out of hand without
investigation.
The problem was exacerbated by the continued
prevalence of exceptional courts. including military
courts empowered to try civilians. In Egypt and Syria.
such courts were maintained under long-standing
states of emergency. Special courts were also used to
try and sentence political suspects in Lebanon and
Oman. In Libya. the General People's Congress
abolished the People's Court. a notoriously unfair
special court that had previously sentenced many
critics and opponents of the government to long prison
terms or death. Despite this. neither in Libya nor in
most other countries in the Middle East and North
Africa could it be said that there was an independent
judiciary. especially in cases having a political or
security aspect.
Police and security forces also operated largely
behind a shield of impunity when they used excessive
force. causing deaths and injuries. whether in I ran and
Yemen. where the victims were often members of
religious or ethnic minorities; in Egypt and Morocco.
where the targets included refugees and migrants; or in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. where Palestinian
children were among those kil led with impunity by
Israeli troops. In Iraq. both US and other foreign forces
and those of the Iraqi government used excessive force
with impunity.
Killings of civil ians by Israeli forces and Palestinian
armed groups continued in Israel and the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. although on a lesser scale
than in recent years. While Israel used a wide range of
judicial and extrajudicial means to punish Palestinians
individually and collectively for killings of Israelis.
Palestinian victims were denied justice and redress.
Impunity remained the rule for Israeli forces who
unlawfully kil led and ill-treated Palestinians. In J uly
Israel passed a new law denying Palestinians the right
to claim compensation for death. injury or damage
caused by I sraeli forces. The Palestinian Authority also
failed to take action against Palestinian armed groups
responsible for unlawful killings and abductions amid
increasing lawlessness.
The issue of impunity for past grave abuses came into
sharp focus during the year. I n Algeria. the government
held a national referendum to win support for its plan
to extend an amnesty to those responsible for the
thousands of political kills. "disappearances" and
widespread torture that were so much a feature of the
internal conflict that raged from the early 1990s.
In neighbouring Morocco. however. an EqUity and
Reconciliation Commission appointed by King
Mohamed VI completed its inquiries into
"disappearances" and other violations committed
between 1 956 and 1999. and at the end of the year
submitted its final report. Although its statutes
categorically excluded the identification of individual
perpetrators. the Commission represented a unique
initiative within the region. one that appeared likely to
clarify a good number of cases of past abuse and ensure
both offiCial acknowledgement of. and the payment of

reparation for, some of the suffering to which victims
and their relatives had been exposed. The independent
Moroccan Human Rights Association, meanwhile,
organized its own informal public hearings in which
some victims named individuals they held responsible
for past violations against them.
In Iraq, justice continued to be denied to countless
victims of abuse. However, former President Saddam
Hussain was finally called to account for some of the
crimes committed when he was in power, crimes whose
enormity was reflected following the discovery of mass
graves in 200), Facing charges related to only one of the
many incidents of killings for which his government
was believed responsible, it remained to be seen
whether he would receive a fair trial. The initial
conduct of the trial did not inspire confidence. Yet, for a
once-powerful leader to have to answer to some of his
victims was a breakthrough for a region i n which
impunity had been well-entrenched for so long.
In neighbouring Syria, senior government figures
came under pressure as a UN investigation implicated
them and Lebanese political leaders and security
officials in the February bomb explosion that kil led
former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and 22
others in Beirut. However, the kills and
"disappearances" of thousands of Syrian and Lebanese
nationals in past decades remained almost entirely
uninvestigated.

Refugees and migra nts
Most countries lacked a legal regime for the protection
of refugees and asylum-seekers. Only seven - Algeria,
Egypt, I ran, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen - were

46

parties to the UN Refugee Convention and its 1967
Protocol. Long-standing refugee communities Within
the region continued to face discrimination and denial
of their human rights by governments in host countries.
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon remained barred from
working in certain professions, despite some easing of
restrictions during the year, and faced other limitations
severely affecting their rights to education and
adequate housing. Despite the Israeli withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip, the situation for Palestinian refugees
there and in the occupied West Bank continued to
worsen because of land acquisitions, house
demolitions, closures and other controls on movement
imposed by the Israeli authorities and the increasing
lawlessness arising from rivalry between Palestinian
armed groups.
In Egypt, a three-month demonstration by Sudanese
refugees and migrants seeking improvements in their
living conditions, protection from return to Sudan and
resettlement in a third country came to a head in
December when police used force to disperse the
demonstrators. At least 27 people were kil led and
others were injured.
Europe's restrictive immigration policies contributed
to the difficulties faced by several North African
countries which refugees and migrants from further
south sought to traverse in order to gain entry to
Europe's southern borders. The Spanish enclaves of
Ceuta and Mel illa emerged as particular pressure points.
Between August and October, Spanish and Moroccan
police used excessive force against people, mostly from
West Africa, who sought to enter Spanish territory by
climbing the border fences. At least I) people were kil led.
Amnesty International Report 2006

REGI ONAL OVE RVI EWS - M I D D LE EASTI N O RTH AFR I CA

Many others were rounded up by Moroccan police,
transported to remote desert areas along the border with
Algeria and dumped, left to fend for themselves without
adequate water or shelter. Amid wide publicity and
condemnation, both governments said they would
investigate the killings, but no such investigation was
known to have been started by the end of 2005.

Women's rights
Women continued to suffer legal and other forms of
discrimination throughout the region, although 2005 saw
a quickening process of change. In Kuwait, women for
the first time became eligible to vote in the country's
national elections. In Morocco, King Mohamed VI
announced that citizenship would be granted to all
children born of women with foreign spouses and that a
discriminatory law severely limIting this right would be
reformed. In Algeria too, amendments to the Family
Code removed some aspects of discrimination, although
not enough to give women equal status with men.
That such changes represented something of a
breakthrough said a lot about how much further change
is necessary before women truly achieve equal status in
the region. Violence against women, including within
the family, remained widespread and insufficiently
addressed by governments and state authorities. I n
Iraq, where increasing religious sectarianism emerged
as a feature of the political breakdown, women came
under greater threat of violence because of how they
dressed and behaved.

Human rights defenders
Human rights defenders continued to face a
momentous task as they sought to promote wider
understanding and ensure more effective protection of
the nghts due to all people in the region regardless of
age, gender, national ity, religion, sexual orientatIOn or
other defining characteristics. They faced many
obstacles and in some cases put their lives on the l ine to
defend their own and others' fundamental rights.
Independent human rights organizations were active
in a majority of countnes, despite restrictIve laws
designed to regulate the operation of non­
governmental groups. However, human rights
defenders continued to be targeted for abuse or
harassment, particularly in Iran and Syria. In TUnIsia,
the run-up to a UN-sponsored world summit in
November was accompanied by an increase In state
repression directed against leading human rights
activists. The repression persisted through the summi t
itself which, ironically, aimed to advance international
information exchange through the use of new
technology. Sahrawi human rights defenders who
documented abuses by Moroccan forces in confronting
protests earlier in the year were jai led in Western
Sahara.

Economic, social and cultura l rights
Many communities faced denial of or were hampered
from accessing basic economic, social and cultural
rights. Marginalized people were particularly
vulnerable, Including Bedouins in Israel, Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon, members of ethnic and religious
minorities in I ran, and migrants, especially women
migrant workers in Gulf countries and Lebanon. For
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Israeli policies and controls made life especially harsh.
Palestinians were left without shelter by destruction of
their homes; without livelihood by the seizure of land
and closures; and without access to adequate health
care due to road closures and checkpoints. Access to
scarce water resources increasingly emerged as a likely
flashpoint for the future.
Death pena lty
Both I ran and SaudI Arabia continued to carry out
executions - at least 94 and 88 respectively in 2005. In
both countries the real totals were probably higher.
I ran's victims included child offenders, while a large
proportion of those executed in Saudi Arabia were
foreign nationals, including some who were sentenced
after trials whose proceedings they did not understand.
I n September, Iraq carried out its first executions
since the death penalty was restored in August 2004,
and the effective moratorium on executions that had
existed in the Palestinian Authority since 2002 was
ended by five executions. Algeria, Israel, Morocco and
Tunisia remained abolitionist in practice.

The government and its international pa rtners
remained inca pa ble of providing security to the
people of Afghanistan. Factional commanders
secured positions of public a uthority, acted
independently of government control a nd remained
a major source of insecurity. Absence of rule of law,
and a barely functional criminal justice system left
many victims of human rights violations, especially
women, without redress. Over 1 ,000 civilians were
killed in attacks by US and Coalition forces a nd by
armed groups. US forces continued to carry out
a rbitrary a rrests a nd indefinite detentions. Refugees
were pressured into returning to Afgha nistan,
despite continuing threats to their safety.
Background
The 2001 Bonn process culminated In the holding, in
September, of elections to the National Assembly
( Wolesi jirga) and prOvinCial councIls. Marred by a
climate of intimidation in the run up to polling, there
was widespread public dismay at the number of
factional leaders - many accused of human rIghts
abuses - who stood for election.
Women were guaranteed at least a quarter of the
seats in the Wolesijirga but faced social and
administrative barriers. The legitimacy of the process
was called into question on account of the low turnout,
notably in Kabul.
In February, the UN Development Programme ranked
Afghanistan at 173 of 178 in the world in terms of
development, reflecting the country's severe socio­
economic situation.
The flawed UN-supported Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) programme
ended in March. It was supplemented by the
Disarmament of Il legal Armed Groups (DIAG) project. In
September, the UN extended the mandate of the NATO­
led International Security Assistance Force to 2006.
In February, Cherif Bassiouni, the UN Independent
Expert on the Situation of Afghanistan, criticized the
Afghan criminal justice system and the US detention of
Afghans. The mandate of this position was, however,
ended by the UN Commission on Human Rights in AprI l ,
in accordance with US wishes.
Redressing past violations
I n January, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights
Commission (AI HRC) issued a report examining measures
to address past human rights violations. In December,
Amnesty International Report 2006

the government passed the Transitional Justice Action
Plan, which calls for the commemoration of victims,
vetting of state employees to exclude human rIghts
violators, the creation of a truth-seeking mechanism, the
promotion of natIOnal reconciliation and the
establishment of justice mechanisms for past crimes.
a In July Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, a commander who
had fled to the UK in 1 988, was sentenced to 20 years'
imprisonment In connection with human rIghts
violations carned out by him and those under hiS
command. The UK authOrIties cited their obligations
under the UN Convention against Torture as the basis
for prosecution.
a In September, Habibullah Jalalzal and Hesamuddin
Hesam, both former senior officials of KHAD, a security
body during the 1980s, were sentenced to nine and 12
years' imprisonment respectively following a trial in
the Netherlands.
Many regional offiCials and commanders - often
called warlords - continued to wield power Within
Afghanistan. Some continued to maintain lInks With
armed groups responsible for abuses that included war
crimes committed during armed conflicts since 197980, including mass killings and rape. In December a
national conference on truth-seeking and
reconcilIation was held.

Violence against women
In a climate of continued lack of public security and rule
of law, women were denied enjoyment of their human
rIghts. Women continued to face systematic and
widespread Violence and discrimination in publIc and
prIvate Including discriminatory customary practices. In
June the government established an inter-ministerial
council aimed at combating Violence against women, but
by the end of 2005 few legal provisions to protect women
had been promulgated, and fewer implemented.
a In April, a shura (council), relying on customary
practices, authorized the murder of a 29-year-old
woman named Amina in Badakhshan. Six men,
members of one family, were subsequently arrested,
but It was not known if they were charged or trIed.
a In May, the bodies of three women were found
raped and strangled on a road in Pul-e KhumrI. Arrests
fol lowed but it was not known whether these resulted
In trIals.
Ineffective justice system
Flaws in the administration of Justice remained a key
source of human rights violations, especially in rural
areas. All stages of the legal process were hampered by
corruption, the influence of armed groups, lack of
oversight mechanisms, non-payment of salaries and
inadequate infrastructure. Detainees continued to be
held unlawfully for prolonged periods and denied a fair
trIal. There were reports of Inhumane conditions in
prisons.
a In October, prisoner of conscience Ali Mohaqqeq
Nasab, the editor of a journal on women's rights, was
sentenced to two years' imprIsonment for "defamation"
and "blasphemy". An appeal court in December
suspended his sentence and he was freed.

Abuses by a rmed groups
Hundreds of civil ians including aid workers, election
officials and clerics were killed by armed groups such as
the Taleban, who were resurgent i n the southern
region. Most of the killings resulted from SUicide
attacks and roadside bombs.
a On 30 May, cleric Molavi Abdollah Fayyaz, who had
spoken out against the Taleban, was shot dead in
Kandahar. During his funeral ceremony the fol lowing
day, a sUicide bomber killed at least 21 people.
a On 20 july, two or more unidentified gunmen i n
Paktika killed Hamld Mohammad Sarwar, an election
worker from the JOint Electoral Monitoring Board, who
was educating voters ahead of the September elections.
At that stage, he was the fourth Afghan working i n
support of the elections t o b e killed.
Violations by US and Coalition Forces
US forces continued to arbitrarily detain hundreds of
people beyond the reach of the courts and their own
families, UN human rights experts, the A I H RC and, i n
some Instances, the I nternational Committee of the
Red Cross ((CRC). Excessive use of force during arrest
and torture and ill-treatment inside Bagram airbase
and other US facilities continued to be reported.
Conditions for many detainees reportedly i mproved i n
the second h a l f o f the year.
In May, reports of torture and ill-treatment in US­
controlled facilities led to civil unrest across the
country. In jalalabad up to seven people d ied in riots.
The UN called on the USA to open the detention
facilities at Bagram airbase to the A I H RC.
Despite repeated calls for independent
investigations into reports of torture by US forces and
deaths i n custody, investigations were conducted
under the auspices of the US Department of Defense.
Military operations undertaken by US and Coalition
Forces continued to result i n civilian deaths or injury,
usually following air strikes in southern areas. There
were concerns that not all necessary precautions had
been taken in the conduct of such attacks.
a In 2005, more than 20 US military personnel were
investigated In connection with the deaths in custody In
2002 of Dilawar and Habibullah, two Afghan detainees
held in Bagram airbase. As of December 2005, seven
low-ranking soldiers had been convicted of minor
offences and received light penalties, but no one had
been held directly responsible for the deaths in custody.
a On 4 july, US military sources confirmed that they
had kil led 17 civilians in an air strike in Chichal village,
Kunar province.
Hundreds of Afghans were released by the US
authorities from Bagram airbase and Guantanamo Bay
during 2005. Some claimed that they were ill-treated in

In june it was announced that up to 90,000 Afghans
had left Pakistan for Afghanistan over the preceding
two and a half months. Hundreds of others had moved
within Pakistan as camps were consolidated.
In August, the Minister for Refugees and Repatriation
stated that 40 per cent of all returned refugees were i n
a vulnerable situation, 'struggling between hope and
hopelessness". The same month Afghanistan ratified
the UN Refugee Convention.

Human rights defenders
The growing community of human rights defenders
faced harassment and death threats. In November, a
member of the A I HRC was the target of a grenade
attack.
a Shaheeda Hussain, a women's human rights
defender and candidate for the Wolesi jirga, was shot
at in her car during the election campaign.
Death penalty
At least 24 death sentences were passed by lower and
appeal courts. AI did not learn of any executions. I n
February, three people were sentenced t o death in
connection with the killing of a taxi driver. They
appealed against the sentence. In May, four men were
sentenced to death in connection with armed robbery
and murder. In August, seven men were sentenced to
death in connection with the kidnapping of election
workers and, i n a separate case, robbery.

A number of detainees complained that they were
tortured or il l-treated during arrest, in police custody
or in prison. I nvestigations into complaints tended to
be delayed and inconclusive, a lthough in a few cases
police officers were prosecuted or disciplined.
Detention conditions, particula rly for remand
prisoners held in police stations, remained harsh.
Domestic violence was com mon. There were a rrests
and prosecutions for trafficking women and children
for forced prostitution and cheap la bour.
Background
Poverty. unemployment and widespread corruption
continued to undermine efforts to promote the rule of
law. National elections in July were won by the
Democratic Party and its allies. who cal led for a
crackdown on corruption and organized crime.
Tortu re and ill-treatment
Police officers or prison guards allegedly beat
detainees during arrest or subsequently In detention.
At least six such complaints. three of them made by
taxi-drivers. related to police officers attached to Kor�e
police station.
Cl Rrok Pepaj was arrested In Shkoder in April and
charged with trafficking explosives. He subsequently
filed a complaint against a named judicial police officer
whom he accused of torture. forgery and "abuse of
office". He al leged that follOWing his arrest he was
repeatedly kicked and beaten with truncheons by
masked police officers and that while hiS head was
crushed between two tables he was forced to sign a
document that he could not see. He suffered damage to
hiS kidneys; In October he was reported ly still urinating
blood and receiving medical treatment while in pre­
trial detention.
E'l In April the M inistry of Justice dismissed the
director and the chief of the police guards ofTirana
prison 302 after a number of remand prisoners
complained that they had been physically and
psychologically I l l-treated. Also in April. criminal
proceedings were started against two police officers at
Lushnje police station follOWing a complaint by a
detainee. M iti Mitro. that they had beaten him.
In May the UN Committee against Torture conSidered

preferrtng to invoke lesser charges. such as "arbitrary
acts". which usually resulted in non-custodial
sentences. AI did not learn of any convictions for these
offences. although there were several reports that
police officers had received disciplinary punishments
for ill-treating detainees.
a On 30 June AIi Shabani was al legedly beaten and
injured by Kor�e traffic police officers after he failed to
obey their orders. He was brought to hospital With
sertous head injuries. Police sources dented that he had
been beaten and claimed that he had Injured himself.
He was charged With resisting arrest. A local prosecutor
reportedly declined to investigate a complaint filed by
Ali Shabani. who subsequently brought a civil suit
against the police.
a In Aprtl Elsen Gropa from Patos al leged that the
investigation of a complaint he had filed I I months
previously was being deliberately delayed by the
Investigating and police authorities. He complained
that two police officers had twice arrested him and
beaten him at Fier police station In an unsuccessful
attempt to force him to confess to a crime or to give
them money to close the case. He said that he had
supported his allegations with photographs of his
injuries and a medical forensic report.
Conditions of detention
In March a new prison In Lezhe was opened as part of a
plan supported by the European Union (EU) to Improve
the infrastructure of the penitentiary system. Despite
thiS and certain other improvements. prison conditions
continued to be marked by overcrowding and poor diet
and hygiene. leading to frequent protests by prisoners.
Conditions for remand prisoners In Vlore detention
centre and in pre-trial detention facilities In police
stations were particularly harsh. In violation of
domestic law. some convicted prtsoners continued to
be held together with remand prISoners and minors
(under 18 years of age) sometimes shared cells with
adult detainees. A 2003 government deCISion to
transfer responSibility for all pre-trtal detention
facil ities from the Ministry of Public Order to the
Ministry of Justice had not been implemented by the
end of 2005.
Violence against women
Surveys indicated that domestic violence was common.
affecting up to 40 per cent of women. Intimate partner
violence affected women of all ages and social groups
and was often persistent. Women rarely reported such
53

ALG

incidents to the police, and few perpetrators were
prosecuted, except in cases of seriOUS injury or death.
At least three women were convicted of killing partners
whom they claimed had persistently subjected them to
physical and psychological violence.
The law did not adequately protect victims of
domestic violence, for whom there were limited
support services provided by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). The Criminal Code did not
specifically crImlnalIze domestic violence. Local NGOs
compiled a draft law aiming to Introduce procedures to
give victims of domestic violence legal protection, as
envisaged In the 2003 Family Code

Trafficking
Poverty, lack of education, family breakdown and crime
networks at home and abroad contributed to the
trafficking of women and chi ldren for sexual
exploitation and cheap labour. There were reports that
a lthough the numbers of Albanian women being
trafficked might be decreasing, many were being re­
trafficked, sometimes as often as tWice In a month.
The adoption of a witness protection law In Albania
In 2004 appeared to have encouraged EU countries to
deport victIms of trafficking. However, difficulties in
Implementing the law meant that protection was In
practice Inadequate and victims were usually unwil ling
to testify against their traffickers for fear of reprisal.
There were also concerns that traffickers or their
families were uSing bribes or threats to Induce relatives
of those victims who did testify to persuade them to
withdraw their testimony. According to official figures,
62 people were prosecuted for trafficking women for
prostitution, and 1 3 people for child-traffickin g
between January and June.
In February the government approved a national
strategy to combat child trafficking. In November the
UN Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child
prostitution and child pornography, following a visit to
Albania, welcomed the legislative measures, but called
on the authorities to "develop a national child
protection system aimed at combating the poverty that

A LG E R IA
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
Head of state: Abdelaziz Boutefl i ka
Head of government: Ahmed Ouyahia
Death penalty: abolitionist i n practice
I nternational Criminal Court: signed
UN Women's Convention: ratified with reservations
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: not
signed

The government promoted a controversial plan aimed
at bringing closure to the internal conflict of the
1 990s a mid continuing restrictions on human rights.
The level of violence decreased in comparison with
previous years, but hundreds of people were killed,
a mong them dozens of civilians. Tens of thousands of
cases of tortu re, killings, abductions and
"disa ppearances" carried out since 1 992 by the
security forces, state-armed militias and armed groups
had still not been investigated; this remained the key
obstacle to addressing the legacy of the conflict
Torture continued to be reported, particularly in the
cases of suspects accused of "belonging to a terrorist
group", More than a dozen suspected members of
a rmed groups were sentenced to death, most ofthem
in their absence. A moratorium on executions
remained in place. Changes to the law gradually
improved the legal status of women, but many
discriminatory provisions remained unchanged.
Background
Gas price rises at the beginning of the year sparked
violent protests throughout the country.
Demonstrations, strikes and violent protests erupted
throughout the year over a range of social, economic and
political problems, including water, job and housing
shortages, public mismaragement and corruption.
An aSSOCiation agreement with the European Union
entered into force on I September. The agreement,
which sets out conditions for trade lIberalization and
security co-operation, contains a human rights clause
which IS binding on both parties.
The state of emergency, imposed in 1992, remained In
force.
Killings
Some 400 people were killed as a result of continuing
violence, including dozens of civilians. Attacks by
armed groups on military targets, and to a lesser
extent, civilians, continued to be reported. Dozens of
people suspected of being members of armed groups
were kil led dUring operations by the security forces.
There were concerns that some of these killings may
have been extrajudiCial executions.
Impunity
PreSident Abdelaziz Boutenika offiCially stated that some
200,000 people were believed to have been killed since

Amnesty International Report 2006

1992, but there was no commitment to establishing the
truth about these killings and other gross human rights
abuses, the vast majority of which had not been
investigated. Instead, President Bouteflika called a
referendum seeking a mandate to exonerate the security
forces and armed groups, ostenSibly in an effort to bring
closure to the conflict of the 1990S.
A Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation was
adopted by referendum on 29 September. In a speech
made in late March, President Bouteflika declared that
reconciliation required thllt families of victims of
human rights abuses make sacrifices and that they
might have to renounce some of their rights.
The Charter proposes clemency or exemption from
prosecution for members of armed groups who give
themselves up to the authorities. Armed groups have
been responsible for widespread and grave abuses ­
such as targeted killings of civilians, abductions, rape
and other forms of torture - some of which amount to
crimes against humanity. Although perpetrators of
certain serious abuses were not to be exempt from
prosecution, no detai Is were provided concerning the
process for determining who would be eligible. Similar
measures introduced in 1 999 were applied arbitrarily
and resulted de facto in wide-ranging impunity for
abuses committed by armed groups.
The Charter denies that the security forces and state­
armed militias have been responsible for serious
crimes, thus conferring systematic impunity. This
denial stands in stark contrast to a body of evidence
which points to their responsibility for thousands of
cases of torture, extrajudicial executions and
"disappearances", some of which constitute crimes
against humanity.
Victims of human rights abuses, human rights
defenders, and others opposing the Charter were
intimidated by state agents in an effort to stifle
criticism. Some continued to express their anger at
the authorities' failure to uphold their right to truth
and justice. I n the province of Blida, near the capital,
Algiers, victims of abuses by armed groups and their
fami lies gathered at the cemetery on the day the
referendum was held to remember the dead and bury
their bal lots in protest at the provisions of the
Charter.
The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,
summary or arbitrary executions and the UN Working
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances
expressed concern about the proposed measures. They
urged the Algerian government not to adopt laws which
would contravene its obligations under international
law to ensure the right of victims of grave human rights
abuses to truth and full reparations.
By the end of the year, no concrete measures had
been taken to implement the provisions of the Charter.

'Disappearances'
No new cases of "disappearance" were reported during
the year, but several thousand Algerians remained
"disappeared" and no progress was made in clarifying
their fate and whereabouts. The Charter for Peace and
National Reconciliation speCifically denies state
Amnesty International Report 2006

responsibility for "disappearances", claiming that past
wrongful acts have been punished.
At the end of March the mandate of an offiCial
commission on "disappearances", set up with a narrow
mandate in 2004, expired. The head of the commission
publicly excluded criminal prosecution of those
responsible for the "disappearances" and proposed
compensation payments to the families, many of whom
continued to endure economic hardship. The
commission remained silent on the state's duty to
investigate serious human rights violations and to
guarantee the victims' right to an effective remedy. The
head of the commission told AI in May that, on the basis
of complaints which families had made to the
authorities, it had concluded that 6, 1 46 individuals had
"disappeared" at the hands of security officers between
1992 and 1998. However, media reports later quoted
him contradicting this by saying that half of these were
"terrorists·, rather than victims of state abuses. The
commission did not have powers to investigate cases of
"disappearances·. The commission's confidential
report to the President had not been made public by the
end of the year.
Many fami lies of the "disappeared" feared that the
compensation payments would be a substitute for long­
overdue investigations. The government did not
respond to the interest expressed since August 2000 by
the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary
Disappearances to visit the country.

Torture and i ll-treatment
There were further allegations that individuals arrested
after protests were tortured or ill-treated in custody. The
vast majority of allegations of torture made during 2005
and in previous years were not investigated. The U N
Committee o n the Rights of the Child expressed concern
about a number of cases of torture and ill-treatment of
children reported in previous years. The UN Special
Rapporteur on torture was not invited to Algeria, despite
repeated requests to visit the country since 1997.
In violation of national and international law,
detainees accused of "belonging to a terrorist group"
continued to be held in a secret location during garde a
vue detention (the period before they are brought
before the judicial authorities) and denied their right to
communicate with their families, putting them at risk of
torture.
a Amar Saker was arrested on 19 February and
reportedly tortured over a period of 15 days while held
by the Department for Information and Security, an
intelligence agency formerly known as Military
Security. Among other things, he alleged that he was
beaten until he lost consciousness, given electric
shocks and suspended by his arms for three days to
force him to sign a police report which he had not read.
He was charged with "belonging to a terrorist group
operating in Algeria and abroad" and remained in
detention awaiting trial at the end of the year. The
allegations of torture were not known to have been
investigated, although a prison doctor had certified
that his body bore traces of violence when he was
transferred to prison.

Freedom of expression and assembly
JournalIsts, civil society activists and government critics
faced harassment and intimidation and risked
imprisonment. Pressure on journalists remamed high.
Dozens of Journalists who criticized representatives of
the state and security forces or reported on human rights
abuses and corruption al legations faced charges of
defamation, many of which were filed by public officials.
Some 18 journalists were sentenced to imprisonment on
defamation charges; others received suspended
sentences and heavy fines. Nearly all remained at liberty
pendmg appeals at the end of the year
Cl Mohamed Benchicou, former editor of the French
language daily Le Matin, remained in prison. He had
been convicted of violatmg exchange regulations and
sentenced to two years' Imprisonment m J une 2004.
Further prison terms and heavy fines were imposed in a
series of lawsuits for defamation, but remained at
appeal stage.
I ndependent organizations, among them human
rights groups and independent trade unions, were
repeatedly refused authorizations for public events.
('1 Kamal Eddme Fekhar - a doctor, elected member
of the Parliamentary Assembly m the province of
Ghardaia in southern Algeria, and a member of the
Socialist Forces Front and of the Algerian League for the
Defence of Human Rights - was imprisoned for five
months, apparently to d iscourage him and others from
political activity. He was accused of mcitement to
rebellion and arson, among other things, in the wake of
violent demonstratio ns which took place in the area in
late 2004. Some of the protesters reported having been
beaten on arrest and i l l-treated or threatened with
torture during questionmg to force them to sign police
reports incriminating Kamal Eddine Fekhar.
Eyewitnesses reported that he had attempted to
negotiate a peaceful settlement of the confliCt.
The authOrities stepped up pressure on familIes of
the "disappeared" to abandon their public protests
agamst the Charter for Peace and National
Reconciliation. At least three demonstrations by
families of the "disappeared" were violently dispersed
by the security forces. Several relatives of the
"disappeared" were summoned by security forces,
questioned and threatened with legal proceedmgs
should they continue their protests.
j Belkacem Rachedi, whose father "disappeared" m
1995 and who had publicly accused members of a local
militia of having arrested hiS father and of being
responsible for his "disappearance", was sued for
defamation by two of the alleged perpetrators. In one
of the cases, a court in Relizane provmce, western
Algeria, sentenced him to a Six-month suspended
prISon term and a fine; the second case remamed
pendmg at the end of the year. The court had failed to
investigate some 10 complamts lodged by the Rachedi
family since 1997 m respect of the father's
"disappearance'.

with men m transmitting their nationality t o their
children. Changes to the Family Code revised some
proviSIOns diScriminating against women but fell far
short of offering women equal status with men. Key
changes include the mtroduction of the same legal age
for marriage for both men and women, and of a legal
requirement for a divorced man to provide housing for
his former wife if she has custody of the couple's under­
age children. Homelessness among divorced women
and their children had been recognized as a growmg
problem. The new law also rescinded the legal duty of a
wife to obey her husband and introduced equal rights
and duties for men and women dUring marriage.
However, numerous proviSions which discriminate
agamst women were maintained. These include
polygamy and a husband's unilateral right to divorce.
Discriminatory provisions governing inheritance rights
remained unchanged.
Algeria maintamed reservation s to key articles of the
UN Women's Convention, undermining its purpose. In
February, the UN expert committee overseeing
implementat ion of the Convention recommended that
the government establish a bindmg timelme for
reforming discrlmmatory legislation and wlthdrawmg
reservations to the Convention. The committee also
expressed concern about the lack of progress m
addressing the situation of female relatives of the
"disappear ed" and of women who had suffered physical
and sexual violence by armed groups.
An unprecedented study on domestic violence was
published, reflecting increasing recognitio n of violence
against women as a problem in Algerian society. The
study, which was conducted collaborat ively by Algerian
governmen tal and non-govern mental bodies, revealed
factors facilitating violence against women and
identified needs for improving care for survivors.

Hundreds of families were forcibly evicted from their
homes. Police were responsible for human rights
violations, including extrajudicia l executions and
excessive use of force. There were a Iso reports of
human rights violations by police and soldiers in
Cabinda, with no prosecutions of a ny accused
officers. Human rights defenders and political
activists were threatened a nd briefly detained for
their non-violent activities. Efforts to improve human
rights increased with the a ppointment of a Justice
Ombudsma n.
Background
Hundreds of families were left homeless in Kwanza
Norte province as a result of heavy rains and floods in
the first quarter of 2005.
In February. Angola ratified the African Union
Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention and
Combating of Terrorism. In May It became the looth
country to sign an agreement with the USA, which was
subsequently approved by the National Assembly,
giving US troops and others immunity from prosecution
before the International Criminal Court.
In March, the UN Committee on Human Rights ruled
that the Angolan government had breached journalist
Rafael Marques' human rights. He had been arrested
and imprisoned for six months in October 1999 for
criticizing PreSident Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
ordered to pay damages to the PreSident. The
Committee held that hiS conviction and sentence
constituted an unlawful Interference With his nght to
freedom of expression and urged the government to
provide him With an effective remedy. Including
compensation. He had not been compensated by the
year's end.
A J ustice Ombudsman was appointed in April . The
establishment of an Ombudsman Office was provided
for by the Constitution of 1992 but was delayed by the
civil war. The law establishing the mandate of the
Ombudsman and his Office had not been approved by
the end of the year
Elections were scheduled for late 2006. PreSident
Jose Eduardo dos Santos announced that he would
stand as the preSidential candidate of the ruling
People's Movement for the liberation of Angola
(Movimento Popular de Llberta�ao de Angola,MPLA).
An amended electoral law was promulgated in August
Amnesty International Report 2006

after the Supreme Court ruled that some of its
provisions barring PreSident dos Santos from standing
were unconstitutional.
In November the country was offiCially declared free
of the Marburg fever epidemic which, between March
and J u ly, killed 227 out of the reported 252 people
Infected. Most cases occurred in the northern province
of Uige.
In November, the Huila PrOVincial Court convicted
Jose Marques Pinto, the administrator of a ranch
owned by a former minister, of the i llegal imprisonment
and torture of 18 villagers In 2003- He was sentenced to
28 years' Imprisonment.

Forced evictions
The regulations for the implementation of a land law
approved in 2004 had not beeen drafted by the end of
2005 and consultation with Civil society groups had not
started.
Hundreds of families were made homeless and had
their property destroyed or stolen after being forcibly
evicted from their homes in several Luanda suburbs.
They were not given compensation. Members of the
national and military police, who aSSisted the Luanda
prOVincial government fiscal agents and private
demolition brigades who carried out the evictions, used
force. There were no investigations into allegations of
police misconduct.
a An ongoing land dispute between the Catholic
Church and about 2,000 fami lies in the Wenji Maka
neighbourhood was not resolved. Between June and
November, scores of families were forcibly evicted by
heaVily armed police officers who beat reSidents and
used excessive force. Dozens of reSidents and human
rights activists were arrested and released without
charge within 24 hours.
a Over 300 fami lies in Cidadania neighbourhood
had their houses demolished and were forcibly
evicted, some for the fifth time, in September.
Apparently, the land had been allocated to a former
member of the government. The demolitions were
carried out by a private construction firm and
municipal fiscal agents, protected by about 20 heavily
armed police officers.
a Over 600 families were forcibly evicted from their
homes i n Cambamba I and 11 i n November. Police
arrived at about 7am and started demolishing the
houses and beating residents who opposed the
evictions. Twelve people, including Luis Araujo, the
coordi nator of the non-governmental organization
(NGO) SOS-Habitat, were arrested for a l legedly
inciting violence and held overnight at the local police
station. The following day they appeared in court but
were released for lack of evidence. The Judge referred
the case to the criminal Investigation police.
Policing a nd human rights
Efforts were made to improve police respect for human
rights and to combat impunity. In July the Angola
National Police signed an agreement with the
Association for Justice, Peace and Democracy to
provide human rights and civic education to the police.

Some police officers were expelled from the force for
misuse of firearms and beatings. However, no police
officer was known to have been prosecuted for human
rights violations, including extrajudicial executions,
torture and ill-treatment or the use of excessive force
dUrIng 2005.
a In January, a police officer extrajudicially executed
Antoninho Tchsiwugo, a homeless youngster, in the city
of Lobito. The officer went to the fourth floor of the
abandoned buildmg where Antonmho Tchsiwugo and
other homeless young people lived, threatened them
with his gun, grabbed and handcuffed Antoninho
Tchsiwugo and shot him in the head at close range. The
officer then removed the handcuffs and threw the body
down the elevator shaft. The body was removed the
next day by the police and buried without informing his
family. It was not clear whether the officer was arrested.
Following pressure from the local NGO, OMUNGA
Project, officials from the Attorney's Office in Luanda
went to Lobito in February to investigate the killing and
stated that the officer had escaped from prison, with the
connivance of his colleagues. In June, an official from
the Ministry of the I nterior stated that the officer had
been arrested in March and was in prison. He had not
been trIed by the end of the year. Two of the witnesses
to the killing received threats and were later arrested on
suspicion of theft. In March, Jose Patrocinio,
coordinator of the OMUNGA Project, received veiled
threats because of his work on this case.
Police apparently used excessive force to prevent a
demonstration by university students protesting against
the cost of transport. The students were reportedly
beaten. About 20 students, including student leader
M fuca Fualala Muzambe, were arrested and brIefly held
at the 3rd Police Station where they were beaten again
before being released without charge.

Simulambuco Treaty which incorporated Cabinda into
Angola. However, further demonstrations were
banned; police used force to suppress them and
demonstrators were arrested.
There were unconfi rmed reports of sporadic fighting
in May and June between Angolan forces and the Front
for the Liberation of the Cabindan Enclave (FLEC). Civil
society groups accused both sides of embarking on a
campaign of misinformation and cal led on them to
enter negotiations.
The appointment in February of a Catholic bishop
from outside Cabinda to the province led to violent
protests. In June the police reportedly used force and
tear gas to disperse a demonstration protesting at the
appointment.
In November Rapid Intervention Police used
firearms to disperse a reportedly peaceful
demonstration in Landana and beat demonstrators.
Some 25 demonstrators were arrested and briefly
detained.

Political violence
There were several reports of politically motivated
violence between supporters of the MPLA and the
National Union for the Total I ndependence of Angola
(UNITA). In March, one person was reportedly kil led
and 28 others were wounded in clashes between M PLA
and UN ITA supporters in the southern town of Mavinga,
when UN ITA members tried to raise their flag to
commemorate the 39th anniversary of the
organization's foundation.

Thousands of prisoners were reportedly held in very
poor conditions. Excessive use of force by the secu rity
forces against demonstrators and indigenous groups
was reported. Important judicial decisions signalled
progress in ending impunity for human rights
violations by the milita ry.
Background
Although there was some economic recovery during the
year, levels of poverty remained high. Unemployment
ran at 12. 1 per cent and some five million people were
reported to be working in the informal economy,
largely without labour rights or access to social
security. Demonstrations by piqueteros (unemployed
protesters) demanding jobs, better pay and better
unemployment benefits continued.
In September, the government approved a National
Plan against Discrimination.
I ndigenous people
In August and September indigenous representatives
demanded that the national government stop violent
evictions and suspend mining projects in regions
inhabited by indigenous communities.
a In J uly, 73-year-old Jose Galarza - leader of the
Wichi indigenous people in Pozo Nuevo, Salta
Province - was reportedly seriously injured when he
was hit by rubber bullets fired by police as they
entered indigenous land to recover a landowner's
vehicle. Wichis had taken the vehicle in protest at the
fencing off of land they claimed belonged to the
community.
Demonstrations
In April teachers taking part in a peaceful
demonstration in support of a pay demand in Salta,
Salta Province, were beaten and threatened with
firearms by police. Some demonstrators required
medical attention and some were arrested and
charged. All were subsequently released.

Tucuman, Mendoza and Magdalena prisons staged
protests and riots in which several prisoners died.
a In October at least 33 inmates died during a fire in
block 16 of Penitentiary Unit 28 in Magdalena, Buenos
Aires Province. The prisoners had reportedly been
protesting to demand better conditions. Most of those
killed died of asphyxiation. Reports indicated that
prison guards locked the gates when the fire started;
prisoners from a neighbouring block managed to help
release some of those trapped inside. A j udicial
investigation was i nitiated but had not concluded by
the end of the year.
a In J une, Ricardo David Vide la Fernandez. an
adolescent sentenced to life imprisonment, was found
hanging in his cell in the maximum security block No. 2
in the Provincial jail in Mendoza, Mendoza Province.
Days before, Ricardo David Videla had been held in his
cell in inhuman and degrading conditions, according to
a Local Commission on Penitentiary PoliCies.

Judicial decisions to end impunity
In J une the Supreme Court ruled that the Ful l Stop and
Due Obedience laws were unconstitutional, upholding
the decision by Congress in August 2003 to declare the
laws null and void. The judicial ruling cleared the way
for the prosecution of members of the military
suspected of human rights abuses during the military
governments (1976-83).
Adolfo Scilingo
I n April former naval officer Adolfo Scilingo was tried in
Spain on charges of crimes against humanity, including
arbitrary detention and torture, committed in
Argentina during the military governments. He was
sentenced to 640 years' imprisonment of which he was
expected to serve 30 years. The former officer had

Conscientious objectors to compulsory military
service remained in jail. A new law failed to introduce
a genuine civilian a lternative service despite
Armenia's com mitments made to the Council of
Europe. The a uthorities reportedly ill-treated some
residents who were peacefully protesting at the
demolition of their homes.
Background
Opposition parties boycotted a 27 November
referendum on constitutional reforms and contested
offiCial reports of an overwhelming turnout and ·yes·
vote. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe concluded that although the referendum
generally reflected the will of voters, serious abuses in
several pol l stations raised questions about offiCial
turnout claims. The authorities failed to prevent an
opposition demonstration in the capital, Yerevan, on 29
November to protest that the constitutional reforms
were not sufficiently far-reaching.
On 6 May the Constitutional Court ruled
unconstitutional a provision in the Law on the Human
Rights Defender that allowed the Ombudsperson to
make recommendations to the courts to ensure the
right to a fair trial. The Ministry of Justice had argued
that it undermined the judiciary's independence. The
Ombudsperson questioned whether the judiciary could
be Independent, given their direct appointment by the
head of state, and said most complaints received by her
Office were about unfair trials.
Conscientious objectors imprisoned
Armenia did not release jailed conscientious objectors,
in defiance of its commitments to the Council of
Europe. Although a law that came Into force In 2004
provided for unarmed military service, this was not a
genuinely Civilian alternative to compulsory military
service, and the authOrities continued to imprison
conscientiOUs objectors.
At least six members of the Jehovah's Witnesses
religiOUS group who had begun but then abandoned
unarmed military service were sentenced to prison
terms of up to three years. They had objected to the
service being under the control of the Ministry of
Defence and not genuinely civilian. They complained of
restrictions on their movements and of being forced to
wear military-style uniforms.
("/ On 3 November, four conscientious objectors who
had abandoned their unarmed military service were
60

sentenced to three years' imprisonment for being
absent without leave. They had been working in a
psychiatric hospital. They were reportedly detained for
five months in the hospital compound, forced to shovel
snow with their bare hands and locked out in freezing
rain with no outdoor clothes. Their appeal was pending
at the end of 2005.

Alleged i ll-treatment of peaceful protesters
I n August the police al legedly used excessive force
against peaceful protests by reSidents of Yerevan over
demolition of their homes for an urban renewal
scheme. Those who refused to vacate their homes had
parts of their houses destroyed One reSident was
allegedly removed by force and severely beaten. The
police forcibly removed barricades. A lawyer
representing several reSidents, Vahe Grigorian, was
arrested on 10 October, reportedly on fabricated fraud
charges based on evidence obtained under duress. He
was still in pre-trial detention at the end of the year.
The father of one of his clients told the Ombudsperson's
Office that he had been ill-treated and forced to
incriminate Vahe Grigorian. The protesters said the
compensation paid was not adequate and their eviction
illegal - claims supported by the Ombudsperson's
Office, which received more than 200 complaints.

I ndigenous people continued to make up a
disproportionate percentage of the prison
population. Major changes to immigration detention
practices resulted in the release of child asylum­
seekers and their families. However, the policy of
ma ndatory detention of asylum-seekers remained
unchanged. There were concerns that new counter­
terrorism measures could have a negative impact on
fundamental human rights.

Welfare found that on average 48 per cent of women
fleeing domestic violence were turned away from
specialist accommodation for lack of resources.
The Victorian state government abolished the partial
defence of provocation to murder and amended self­
defence laws in recognition of the gendered nature of
these defences. Victoria and New South Wales
established pilot, specialized domestic violence courts.
ey In August, a Northern Territory court sentenced a
50-year-old man to one month's imprisonment with
two years suspended after a charge of raping a 14-year­
old girl was reduced to "carnal knowledge". The man's
defence argued that he had a right to sexual relations
with the girl who was a "promised bride" under
Aboriginal customary law. In December an appeal court
found the sentence "manifestly unjust" and ordered
that the man serve at least 18 months' imprisonment.

Indigenous people
The government's Productivity Commission report,
Overcoming I ndigenous Disadvantage: Key Indicators
2005, noted an increase in the number of indigenous
Australians who reported being victims of violence. The
report noted that indigenous people were II times more
likely than other Australians to be imprisoned and that
the life expectancy of indigenous people was around 17
years less than that of the population as a whole.
A coroner's inquiry into the 2004 death in custody of
Cameron Doomadgee on Palm Island started in February
2005 and was continuing at the end of the year.
Refugees and asylum-seekers
In June, the government announced changes to
migration legislation affecting asylum-seekers and
refugees. These i ncreased ministerial discretionary
powers and resulted in the release of all children and
their families from immigration detention centres into
community detention. Not all those released were
granted permanent visas and many stil l faced uncertain
futures.
Public awareness of the detention of an Australian
permanent resident and the forCible removal from
Australia of an Australian citizen resulted in inquiries
into Australia's immigration detention centres and into
the operation of the Department of Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs. The ensuing reports were critical of
both cases and found additional instances of wrongful
detention, poor case management and inadequate care
of detainees' mental health.
Human rights and security
Counter-terrorism laws introduced in December
contained measures with potentially negative impacts
on fundamental human rights. Measures included
preventative detention in secret for 1 4 days Without
charge or trial, and renewable control orders for up to
12 months; the latter could severely constrain freedom
of movement and association and could limit

employment and communications. Freedom of speech
was limited by new sedition laws.
Australian Davld Hicks entered hiS fourth year in
detention in Guantanamo Bay, pending his trial by a US
military commission which fails to meet international
fair trial standards. The Australian government
continued to assert such commissions would deliver
fair trials. David Hicks' trial was stayed by a US court on
14 November 2005 (see United Kingdom entry).
Mamdouh Habib, the other Australian detainee held by
the US authorities in Guantanamo Bay, was repatriated
to Australia without charge in January 2005.

There were allegations of ill-treatment by police.
Austria failed to comply with a ruling by the U N
Human Rights Committee. New laws o n asylum and
police powers contravened human rights standards
a nd could threaten the work of huma n rights
defenders. Overcrowding in prisons continued to
worsen.
Allegations of police i ll-treatment
There were continuing allegations of il l-treatment and
harassment by police, particularly of foreign nationals.
ey I n J uly, the trial opened of six police officers, three
paramedics and a doctor charged with involuntary
manslaughter under especia l ly dangerous conditions in
connection with the death i n J uly 2003 of Mauritanian
citizen Cheibani Wague in Vienna. In November, the
Higher Criminal Court in Vienna sentenced the doctor
and one polIce officer to suspended seven-month
prison terms; the other defendants were acquitted. AI
had repeatedly expressed concern about the
circumstances surrounding the death of Cheibani
Wague while being restrained by police officers and

impartial investigation aimed at bringing those
responsible to justice. Evidence produced in the trial
also highlighted deficiencies within the police training
system with regard to restraint methods.
a In March, the I ndependent Administrative Tribunal
concluded that the arrest, detention and beating of a
young man by police in Vienna on 1 3 August 2004 was
unlawful.
a During a stop-and-search police operation against
a family from Ghana in Ansfelden, in July, a woman, Mrs
A., was arrested, taken to a police station and strip­
searched, apparently without any legal basis. The
police officers involved have not reportedly faced any
criminal investigation.

Complia   with international human
rights law
In violation of the requirement to ensure an effective
remedy to people whose rights under the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (iCCPR) have been
violated, the authorities refused to pay compensation to
Paul Perterer, who was denied his right to a fair hearing
when he was dismissed from the civil service. On 20
August 2004, the UN Human Rights Committee concluded
that Austria had violated Paul Perterer's right to a fair
hearing and recommended that the authorities ensure
him an effective remedy, including compensation.
Austria argued that neither the ICCPR (to which Austria is
a state party) nor the views of the Human Rights
Committee have any effect in domestic law.
Extradition
In September, the Vienna Court of Appeal confirmed a
previous court decision a llowing the extradition of
Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahmin Bilasi-Ashri to Egypt on the
basis of diplomatic assurances. Bilasi-Ashri would be at
serious risk of torture and other serious human rights
violations if returned to Egypt. On 18 November, the
European Court of Human Rights issued an interim
measure notto extradite Bilasi-Ashri.
New laws on asylum a nd foreign nationals
Several provisions in the new Asylum Act and the Aliens
Police Act contravened international refugee and
human rights standards. A provision penalizing people
who "abet" "unauthorized habitation" could result in
persecution of human rights defenders who represent
asylum-seekers.
Justice sector
The Ministry of Justice failed to address deficiencies in
the prison system. Prisons continued to be
overcrowded, and conditions were aggravated by an
increasing number of mentally ill inmates and a
decrease in staff. Sixty taser guns were in use in judicial
institutions as of J uly.
Arms control
Despite amendments, long-standing loopholes
remained in the Law on War Material, allowing surplus
weapons to be transferred to countries where they
might be misused for human rights violations.

Rights to freedom of expression and assembly were
restricted. The security forces used excessive force to
break u p peaceful opposition demonstrations. Scores
of opposition activists and journalists were beaten
and detained. Seven opposition leaders were
pardoned a nd released. Charges of attempting to
overth row the government were brought against
dozens of opposition activists a nd state officials.
Several were reportedly tortured or ill-treated in
detention.
Background
Despite a presidential decree in May that the November
parliamentary elections were to be held in a
democratic manner, there was constant obstruction of
opposition campaigning. I nternational observers
reported that the elections did not meet international
standards. After the pol l , opposition parties formed a
new coalition, the Democratic Popular Front,
announced a boycott of the new parliament, and
demanded a re-run in at least 100 constituencies.
In March, E l mar Husseinov, editor of the weekly
Monitormagazlne, was killed In suspicious
circumstances outSide his home in the capital, Baku. His
death sparked large-sca le demonstrations amid
opposition claims that he was murdered because of his
criticism of offiCial corruption. The authorities denied
any involvement. No one had been brought to justice
by the end of 2005.
Excessive use of force
Between May and December, the security forces used
excessive force to break up both authorized and
unauthorized demonstrations in Baku, kicking and

beating protesters and journalists. Scores of
demonstrators were detained, and some were
reportedly beaten in custody.
Cl The excessive force reportedly used to break up an
authorized demonstration by the Democratic Popular
Front in Baku on 26 November provoked criticism from
the USA and the European Union. No attempt was
apparently made to disperse the crowd peacefully, and
opposition leaders said they were hit on the head with
truncheons by the police, despite offering no resistance.
Cl At an unauthorized demonstration organized by
opposition coalition Azadlig (Freedom) on 9 October, 1 4
journalists were among those said to have been
severely beaten. Idrak Abbasov, of the Zerkalo (Mirror)
newspaper, was reportedly hit on the head repeatedly
with baseball bats by a plainclothes police officer and
other men until he lost consciousness. He was taken to
hospital, where guards allegedly prevented other
journalists from seeing him.

Opposition trials: update
In February the Organization for Security and Co­
operation in Europe (OSCE) published its findings on
the trials of 125 people charged in relation to the
October 2003 post-election violence. In 2004 at least 40
men received prison sentences after unfair trials for
their al leged participation in the violence. The OSCE
report concluded that most of the trials fel l well short
of international fair trial standards, that the courts
admitted evidence reportedly obtained through the use
of torture, and that defendants were denied the rights
to presumption of innocence and to prepare an
effective defence. The report called for the release or
retrial of all those denied a fair trial.
Cl I n March, seven opposition leaders imprisoned
since October 2003 were pardoned by PreSident Aliev
and subsequently released. In J uly their convictions
were quashed in court, allowing them to run in the
November elections. They had been sentenced in
October 2004 to prison terms of between two and a hal f
and five years for their a lleged participation in the 2003
post-election violence. The Supreme Court had turned
down their appeal.
State secu rity a rrests
Cl I n August, Ruslan Bashirli, the leader of Yeni Fikir
(New Thinking), a youth organization with reported
links to the opposition Azerbaijani Popular Front Party
(APFP), was arrested on charges of attempting to
overthrow the government. He denied offiCial
accusations of accepting money from Armenia to
destabil ize the country. He was reportedly put under
pressure to implicate APFP leader AIi Kerimli in an
alleged coup plot. He was remanded in custody for
three months. Pro-government demonstrators
attacked his family home and APFP offices with
impunity, and his father was made to resign from his
job. Members of Yeni Fikir were reported ly detained,
threatened, beaten, denied medical care and coerced
into making statements against Yeni Fikir and APFP.
Cl Dozens of offiCials, including government
ministers, were arrested or dismissed following an
Amnesty International Report 2006

alleged coup attempt in October. Four offiCials
reportedly confessed on state television to conspiring
with Rasul Quliev, the exiled leader of the opposition
Azerbaijani Democratic Party. There were fears that
their confeSSions had been coerced. Rasul Quliev was
detained in Ukraine on 17 October after his plane was
prevented from landing in Baku. Azerbaijan requested
his extradition on embezzlement charges, but he was
eventually released by a court in Ukraine. The
authorities in Azerbaijan detained scores of his
supporters, and claimed to have seized weapons. Some
were later charged.

Three people were arrested in connection with
material published on an I nternet website. A human
rights activist a ppea red before a court on charges
that seemed to be politically motivated. Security
forces used excessive force to disperse
demonstrators in the ca pital al-Manama.
Key developments
The government proposed a new counter-terrorism law
to the National Assembly (parliament) in April under
which anyone convicted of committing or planning
terrorist acts would face the death penalty. Human
nghts activists and some members of parliament
criticized the proposed law as an attempt to restrict
freedoms excessively. The law was approved by the
parliament in December and was due to be referred to
the Shura (Consultative) Council and then ratified by
the King in 2006. I n july, parliament approved a new
law to regulate political associations. This requires
associations to be approved by the M inister of justice
who can also apply to the Supreme Court to have them

64

dissolved or cease their activities. Human rights and
other groups criticized the new law as overly restrictive
and called on King Hamad bin ' Issa AI Khalifa to cancel
it. He had not done so by the end of 2005.
Human rights activists and some members of the
parliament continued to urge the government to press
for the release of six Bahraini nationals detained by the
US military at Guantanamo Bay. Three of them were
returned to Bahrain in November and released.

Political arrests
Three men were arrested in February In connection
with comments published on their Internet website
discussion forum (www.bahrainonline.org) which were
alleged to be critical of the government and offensive
to the royal family. 'AIi 'Abdul lmam, Mohammad al­
Mousawi and Hussain Yousef were detained for 15 days
on the orders of the Public Prosecution. The charges
against them incl uded "inciting hatred, defamation and
spreading false information". The three went on hunger
strike during their detention at al-Hoora police station
i n al-Manama. They were released on 14 March. At the
end of the year it was not clear whether they were still
awaiting trial.
Human rights defenders
Ghada jamsheer, a leading human rights defender,
appeared in court in june. She faced charges of
insulting the judiciary; defamation and slander of a
family court judge; and slander of the husband of a
victim of domestic violence. The first charge arose from
petitions and articles issued between October 2002 and
june 2003 by the Women's Petition Committee, of which
Ghada jamsheer is the d irector. The group was formed
In October 2002 to campaign for the reform of personal
status courts and the codification of family laws. Ghada
jamsheer denied all the charges, most of which were
dropped or dismissed by the courts. However, the
charge of slandering a judge remained pending at the
end of the year.
Lawyers acting for the Bahrain Centre for Human
Rights (BCHR) filed a court case against the Ministry of
Labour in january. The action contested the Minister of
Labour's decision to order the closure of the Centre in
September 2004 for an alleged breach of the 1989
Societies Law. The application was rejected by the High
Civil Court in january. The lawyers acting for the Centre
then reportedly referred the case to the Administrative
Court in Apri l, where it was believed to remain pending
at the end of the year.
Excessive force
In june, the security forces were reported to have used
excessive force when dispersing peaceful
demonstrators cal ling for more job opportunities who
had gathered outside the Royal Court in Rifa'a in al­
Manama. Many of the demonstrators were beaten and
some required hospital treatment. About 30 were
arrested but released the same day without charge. In
july, a further demonstration against unemployment
resulted in more than 30 people being severely beaten
by the security forces; some required hospital

Convention against Torture. The Committee regretted
the government's five-year delay in submitting the
report, but noted that several positive developments
had occurred in Bahrain �tnce 2001. However, the
Committee expressed concern about the continuing
"lack of a comprehensive definition of torture" in
Bahraini law; the "provision of blanket amnesty to all
a Ileged perpetrators of torture and other crimes by
Decree 56 of 2002"; and the "lack of redress available to
victims of torture". It urged the government to adopt

women, including domestic violence, and to amend
Decree 56 to "ensure there is no impunity for officials
who have perpetrated or acquiesced in torture and
other cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment".

In January AI held a conference in al-Manama on
violence against women in the Gulf region.

A rising tide of violence, much of it perpetrated by
Islamist groups, affected most parts of the country.
The main ta rgets of the violence were human rights
defenders, lawyers, j udges, opposition activists,
members of minority communities a nd places of
worship. Police abuses, including torture, continued.
Violence against women was widespread. At least
three people were executed.
Background
Escalating levels of violence, including several waves of
bombings, combined with lack of appropriate action by
the authorities pushed Bangladesh to the edge of a
human rights crisis. The government - a four-party
coalition led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
- at first blamed the main opposition Awami League
before acknowledging that it faced growing Islamist
militancy. I n February it banned two Islamist groups ­
Jama'atul Mujahldeen (Assembly of the Holy Warriors)
Bangladesh and Jagrata Muslim Janata (Awakened
Muslim Citizens) Bangladesh.
The World Bank cancelled funding for three
development projects, blaming government corruption
for its decision. For the fifth consecutive year, the non­
governmental organization Transparency International
named Bangladesh the world's most corrupt country.
In August, the High Court declared the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution unlawful. The
amendment had legitimized the imposition of martial
law from 1975 to 1979. Following an appeal by the
government, the Supreme Court suspended the High
Court ruling.
Escalating violence
After a series of isolated bomb attacks from the
beginning of the year, on 17 August hundreds of small
bombs, many targeting government buildings, were
detonated within a period of 30 minutes across the
country. Two people were killed and hundreds injured.
Jama'atul Mujahideen leaflets at the bomb sites called
for the introduction of IslamiC law in Bangladesh.
Hundreds of people were arrested in the fol lowing
weeks.
At least 25 people were kil led and hundreds injured
in Similar attacks at other times in the year. On 29
November Bangladesh's first suicide bombings marked
a significant escalation in the violence and sparked
widespread criticism of the ruling coalition for failing to
prevent such attacks.

Ta rgets of attacks and other abuses
Opposition members
Opposition activists faced attack by Islamists and
members of the ruling BNP.
a On 27 J anuary a bomb kil led five people, including
former Finance Minister and leading Awami League
pol itician Shah Abu Mohammad Shamsul Kibria, at an
Awami League rally in Habiganj, north-east of the
capital Dhaka. The family of the assassinated
pol itician demanded an independent international
Investigation, but the government refused their
demand.
a Hundreds of Awami League supporters were
reportedly injured on 15 August when various Awami
League gatherings were attacked by BNP members.
Human rights defenders
Human rights defenders continued to face abuses by
the police, army and other law enforcement
personnel, including arbitrary arrest and torture.
They were also harassed through the fi ling of
unsubstantiate d criminal accusations against them.
Many were threatened by individuals or groups linked
to armed criminal gangs or political parties. Some
were phySica lly attacked. Despite the attacks, human
rights defenders remained extremely active.
a Suresh Chandra Halder, former General Secretary
of the Association for Village Advancement, a non­
governmental organization in Faridpur, was arrested
on 9 August, reportedly without a warrant. He
remained in Faridpur jail for more than three months,
and was denied medical treatment vital for his
diabetes and other medical conditions. His
harassment was believed to be linked to his attempts
to expose corruption in the Association, which
angered members of the organization linked to the
government. On the orders of a court, he was released
on 25 November.
Journalists
Hundreds of journalists were reportedly harassed,
intimidated and attacked by state agents and non-state
actors including Islamist groups.
a On 5 February a bomb outSide the press club in
Khulna seriously injured Sheikh Belaluddin Ahmed, the
local bureau chief of the daily Dainik Sangram. He died
several days later.
a A national conference to discuss repression of
journalists planned for 1 1 November in Dhaka by the
Federal Union of journalists was reportedly stopped
by the government two days before it was due to
start.
Lawyers and judges
Islamist groups attacked courts, judges and lawyers,
apparently because they practised non-Islamic law.
a On 3 October, two people were kil led when bombs
exploded in court buildings in several places around
the country. jama'atul MUJahideen appeared to have
carned out the attacks. Two judges were killed on 14
November when a bomb was thrown at their car in
jhalakathi.
a Nine people, including two lawyers, were killed on
29 November by suicide bombers outside courts in
Chittagong and Gazipur.

Attacks on mi nority communities
Attacks on minorities, including Hindus, Christians,
Ahmadis and tribal people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
and elsewhere were carried out with apparent
impunity.
a On 24 july, dozens of tribal villagers in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts were severely beaten and
otherwise abused, reportedly by soldiers, at Fakinala
Nee Aung Karbari Para, Manikchari sub-district, in
Khagrachari.
a A hate campaign against members of the
Ahmadiyya Muslim jamaat continued and involved
attacks on Ahmadi places of worship. In one attack in
April, more than 50 men, women and children were
reportedly injured at Sundarban Bazar in
jotindryanagar by the I nternational Khatme Nabuwat
Movement Bangladesh, an Islamist group.
a In October, Hindu temples and houses were
attacked and set on fire in Rangpur. Five people were
reported to have been seriously injured.
Abuses by police
a Shankar Sen, aged 27, reportedly died on 14 August
al legedly after being tortured by police at Ramna police
station. He had been arrested six days earlier on
suspicion of stealing a mobile phone. Relatives said
Shankar Sen had mental health problems.
a On 24 August, Mokaddes Hossain, General
Secretary of the Tetulbaria union of the jubo League,
died allegedly as a result of torture by police. He was
arrested on his way home from attending an Awami
League event.
Violence against women
According to media reports, in the first quarter of the
year alone, more than 1,900 women were al legedly
subjected to violence, over 200 were killed allegedly
following rape, over 300 women were allegedly abused
for not meeting their husbands' dowry demands and
over 100 were trafficked. Acid Survivors Foundation
said that at least 166 incidents of acid attacks involving
210 victims - 1 38 of whom were women - took place in
the first nine months of the year. Social stigma, police
refusal to act on most reports of violence against
women, and a lack of legal and community support for
the victims prevented many of them from seeking
justice. However, almost all reports of acid attacks
were believed to have been investigated by the police.

REPUBLIC OF BElARUS
Head of state: Alyaksandr Lukashenka
Head of government: Sergei Sidorsky
Death penalty: retentionist
International Criminal Court: not signed
UN Women's Convention and its Optional Protocol:

The government continued to restrict freedom of
expression and assembly. Opposition activists were
a rbitrarily deta ined and a llegedly ill-treated by
police. Some were given lengthy prison sentences for
exercising their right to freedom of expression.
Human rights defenders and civil society
organizations were subjected to further restrictions
a nd harassment. No progress was made in
investigating four cases of "disappearance". Use of
the death penalty continued.
Background
The government clampdown on civil society and
freedom of expression remained of concern to the
international community. I n February the
Representative on Freedom of the Media of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE) visited Belarus. He criticized its restrictive
media legislation, lack of an independent news media,
and laws that criminalize libel and protect state
offiCials from legitimate critiCism. On 10 March the
European Parliament adopted a resolution strongly
condemning the harassment of opposition figures. The
resolution called for efforts to overcome the isolation
of Belarus through the creation of alternative news
sources and the provision of scholarships in the
European Union to Belarusian students.
Prisoners of conscience
Government critics were sentenced to prison terms
or continued to serve long prison sentences for
voicing their opposition to the government or its
policies. Some prisoners had their sentences reduced
under an amnesty declared by PreSident Lukashenka
on 5 May to commemorate the end of the Second
World War.
a M ikhail Marinich, an opposition leader sentenced
to five years' imprisonment on 20 December 2004, had
his sentence reduced to three and a half years in
February. He had been convicted on trumped-up
charges of abusing a n offiCial position and theft. The
court of appeal granted his appeal because of his past
services to the state and his deteriorating hea lth. He
had a stroke on 7 March, but the authorities failed to
inform his family or lawyer, who only learned of it
when a fellow-inmate was released and told a
newspaper. He was transferred to a prison hospital in
M insk on 15 March and returned to the prison colony
on 1 8 May. In July he was hospitalized again with an
Amnesty International Report 2006

eye infection. I n August his sentence was reduced by a
further year under the May amnesty measure.
a On 31 May Nikolai Statkevich, chair of Narodnaya
Gramada, a social democratic party, and Pavel
Severinets, head of the Popular Front youth movement,
were sentenced to three years of corrective labour by
Minsk Central District Court. They had been convicted
of public order offences (under Article 342 of the
Criminal Code) for organizing protests in Minsk.
Opposition activists were protesting at electoral
irregularIties in parliamentary elections in October
2004 and in a referendum in which President
Lukashenka won the right to lift the constitutional limit
of two presidential terms. Their sentences were
immediately reduced to two years under the terms of
the May amnesty.
a On 10 J une, Andrei Klimov, a former businessman
and outspoken opposition politiCian, was sentenced to
one and a half years of "restricted freedom" after being
convicted of public order offences for organizing
protests on 25 March. He started his sentence in
September. Many protesters had been injured when
riot police forcibly dispersed the March demonstration,
which marked Freedom Day, the anniversary of the
creation of the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918. On
28 March, 24 demonstrators were sentenced to jail
terms of between three and 15 days for administrative
offences.

Update
a On 5 August, Yury Bandazhevsky was conditionally
released under the May amnesty after serving four
years of an eight-year sentence. Former rector of the
Gomel State Medical I nstitute, he had been convicted in
June 2001 of bribe-taking, although AI believes that the
real reason for his imprisonment was that he had
criticized offiCial responses to the Chernobyl nuclear
reactor catastrophe of 1986. He remained subject to
restrictive conditions, among them reporting regularly
to the police and being barred from any managerial or
political functions. In addition he was required to pay a
fine of 35 million Belarusian roubles (US$17,OOO), the
amount he was al leged to have taken in bribes, before
he was al lowed to travel abroad.

Clampdown on freedom of expression
Opposition groups were harassed and threatened.
Protests at the failure of investigations into the
"disappearances" of four people, widely believed to have
been killed by state agents, were among those that law
enforcement officers suppressed with excessive force.
a The youth opposition movement Zubr recorded 417
incidents of harassment, including detention, of their
members by the authorities between January and
December. Three members were expelled from
educational establishments for their political activities.
a In April police Special Forces (OMON) beat and
detained peaceful demonstrators who had gathered on
the 19th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear aCCident.
A 14-year-old boy was al legedly pulled into a police van,
so forcefully that ligaments in his hand were torn, and
threatened for wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan
"Free Marinich".

a On 7 J uly police dispersed a demonstration to
commemorate the anniversary of the "disappearance"
of television camera operator Dmitry Zavadsky in 2000.
His wife, Svetlana Zavadskaya, was reportedly punched
in the face by riot police officers.
a On 16 September police attempted to disrupt a
demonstration to observe the anniversary of the
"disappearance" of opposition leaders Viktor Gonchar
and Anatoly Krasovsky in 1999, and reportedly beat five
Zubr protesters. One of them, Mikita Sasim, was treated
in hospital for head injuries.

Human rights defenders
Human rights organizations, already severely hampered
in their work by bureaucratic registration requirements
and controversial guidelines, faced further
obstructions. During the year parliament adopted a
number of amendments to laws on public associations
and political parties that further strengthened state
control of non-governm ental organizations . In July a
presidential decree limited the financial support such
groups could receive from Belarusian organization s and
donors. I n August internationa l financial support for
any activities that "aimed to change the constitutiona l
order in Belarus, overthrow state power, interfere in
internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus, or encourage
the carrying out of such activities" was prohibited by
amendment of a presidential decree of 22 October 2003a In April the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, the last
remaining registered human rights organization, applied
for a tax exemption for financial assistance from the
I nternational Helsinki Federation. ln June it was
Informed that the request could not be granted because
the funding was not in line with the presidential decree
on the acceptance of foreign financial support.
a I n J uly, Andrei Pochebut, Yusef Pozhetsky and
Mecheslav Yaskevits, three prominent members of the
Union of Poles of Belarus, were given prison sentences
of between 10 and 15 days for protesting at government
interference in the running of the Union. Police
subsequently seized control of its headquarters. The
three were convicted of "participating in an illegal
protest" and "disobeying police orders". The
government had refused to acknowledge the removal in
elections of government supporters from its leadership.
Death penalty
No offiCial statistics on the death penalty were
published. According to the human rights group Viasna,
at least one execution was carried out in 2005.
In July the deputy head of the presidential
administration said that abolition of the death penalty
could be considered "once social and economic
preconditions were in place". Despite this statement
from the government, there were no moves to end the
use of the death penalty.

Racist attacks di rected agai nst ethnic, religious and
other mi norities continued to be reported. Little was
done to implement the National Plan of Action on
Domestic Violence (2004'()7). Foreign nationa ls,
including minors, continued to be confined to
a i rport tra nsit zones for extended periods, in
conditions often a mounting to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment. A Belgian cou rt found two
Rwa ndans guilty of war crimes com mitted in 1 994
in Rwa nda.
Background
During 2005, Belgium signed a number of human rights
instruments including the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture and the European
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human
Beings.
In October, the Belgian Council of M inisters proposed
draft counter-terrorism legislation to parliament. The
stated intent of the draft law was to modify the current
criminal and judicial codes in order to "improve the
methods of investigation in the fight against terrorism
and grave and organized crime". The measures proposed
included extending the hours during which a house
search can be conducted; al lowing suspects to be filmed
without the authorization of a judge; and authorizing the
creation of a confidential file to which suspects and their
lawyers may be denied access. The law was awaiting
approval at the end of the year.
Prison conditions
New legislation on prison conditions was not
implemented and prison conditions continued to fall
short of human rights standards.
On 18 March, a riot involving approximately 50
inmates took place in I ttre prison in the region of
Walloon. The riot ended with three people injured and
extensive material damage. On 27 March, the Council of
State nullified the disciplinary proceedings initiated
against some detainees thought to be responsible.
Prison officers responded to this decision by going on
strike for more than a week. The lawyer acting on
behalf of some of the prisoners reported that the
judgement of the Council of State had been ignored and
her clients were being held in solitary confinement.
There were also al legations that the inmates in soli tary
confinement were not allowed to read or write and
those with an "Arab sounding" surname were denied
contact with the religious counsel.

A delegation of the Council of Europe's Committee for
the Prevention ofTorture and Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment (CPT) carried out its fourth
visit to Belgium in April.
A month-long strike by the prison guards at Antwerp
prison started in September. They were protesting
against overcrowding in detention facilities and the
shortage of personnel. One of the consequences of
overcrowding was that detainees were not allowed any
daily exerCise, despite a court order to reinstate daily
exercise periods.

Racism and discrimination
In its annual report published in June, the Centre for
Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism
(Centre pour I'egalite des chances et de la lutte contre
le racisme) expressed its concern at increasing
xenophobia and racism in the country. The report
highlighted employment discrimination, social
discrimination and discrimination in access to public
services. It also noted discrimination against people
with disabi lities, on the basis of sexual orientation and
linked with health conditions.
Many racist incidents directed against ethnic, religious
and other minorities continued to be reported in 2005.
a In March, a Muslim woman resigned from her job in a
food processing firm in Ledegem, western Belgium, after
her employer received seven written death threats from a
previously unknown organization. The threats stated that
the life of the woman and the lives of her colleagues were
in danger because she wore a headscarf to work. Two
bullets were included in the seventh threatening letter.
Despite the threats, her employer was actively supportive
of her, and in April she resumed her job at the firm.
a In March and May, the Juvenile Court of Louvain
found three individuals guilty of a violent attack against
two gay men in 2003- I t was the first time a judgment by
a Belgian court had referred specifically to sexual
orientation and homophobia as the motivation behind
a violent attack. The three men were sentenced to 100euro fines.
a In J une, two trials regarding anti-Semitic acts
opened in Antwerp. In the first case, a 22-year-old man
was sentenced to Six months' imprisonment and a fine
of 550 euros on a charge of racism for threatening a
Jewish man with a knife. The second case involved a 23year-old man who was also convicted of racism for
verbally abusing two Jewish youths. He received a two­
month suspended sentence and a fine of 330 euros.
Violence against women
The prevalence of violence in the home remained a
serious concern. According to a poll commissioned by AI
in February and carried out within the French-speaking
community, 29 per cent of Belgians knew of at least one
household in which domestic violence had taken place.
I n June, AI together with a large number of
representatives of civil society - including women's
organizations, unions, friendly societies and the largest
employer's federation in Belgium, the Belgian Federation
of Enterprises - presented the Belgian authorities with a
list of principles and priorities on domestic violence.
Amnesty International Report 2006

The lack o f official government statistics regarding
gender violence in the home meant that the true scale
of the problem was difficult to gauge. By the end of the
year little had been done by the authorities to
implement the National Plan of Action on Domestic
Violence initiated in 2004.

Detention and deportation of
foreign nationals
I n February the report of an independent commission
(the so-called Vermeersch 1 1), set up by the Minister of
the Interior to re-evaluate the techniques used In
forcible deportations, was made public. The commission
addressed some issues of concern including the need for
transparency during forced removal; for asylum­
seekers denied entry into Belgian territory from a
transit zone to be provided with a right of appeal; and
for the need to assign legal guardians for
unaccompanied minors to be investigated. However, it
concluded that a foreign national who resists forcible
return can be detained until they abandon all resistance
and can be expelled, raising concerns at the lack of a
clear definition of what would constitute resistance and
at the absence of a maximum period of detention.
Foreign nationals, including minors, continued to be
confined to the airport transit zones for extended
periods and in conditions often amounting to cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment. The UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated in
December, that the number of minors detained in such
centres had continued to increase during the year and
the length of their detention had also increased.
Universa l jurisdiction
Although the law on universal jurisdiction was
amended in 2003 so that victims could lodge complaints
directly with an investigating magistrate only i f the case
had a direct connection with Belgium, a limited number
of cases were pursued.
a On 29 June, two Rwandans were convicted of war
crimes and murder committed in 1994 in Rwanda. Half­
brothers Etienne Nzabonimana, aged 53, and Samuel
Ndashyikirwa, aged 43, were sentenced to 12 and 10
years' imprisonment respectively.
a In September, Belgium issued an international
arrest warrant against the former President of Chad,
Hissene Habre. He was accused of human rights
violations including torture, murder and
"disappearances". Hissene Habre was arrested in
November by the authorities in Senegal, where he had
taken up residence. The Senegalese authorities stated
that he would remain in detention until January 2006
when his extradition would be d iscussed at the summit
of the African Union.

exploited as slave labour on farms a nd in homes in
return for food, clothes a nd schooling. Judicial
i nvestigations into kil lings during political unrest in
2003 were delayed. Prison inmates protested at
severe overcrowding a nd the lack of minimum

Background
There was widespread political unrest. Public
demonstrations and road blockades led to the
resignation of President Carlos Mesa Gisbert in J une.
The protests were staged mainly by indigenous
communities. peasants and miners. who ca l led for
early elections and a greater role in determining

community's recently harvested crops of rice and
pineapples.
In August the Ombudsman called on President
Rodriguez Veltze to promote the correct
implementation of Law 1715 in the Province of
Guarayos, Department of Santa Cruz. Law 1715 regulates
entitlements to communal land and use of natural
resources by indigenous communities. In November he
urged the authorities to end the exploitation and slave
labour of 14,000 indigenous Guarani people in Chaco,
Chuquisaca Department. I ndentured labourers
received food, clothes and a daily payment of under
US$2, and children did farm or domestic work in
exchange for a school education.

Delayed investigation i nto ki llings
I nvestigations into killings of civilians i n October 2003
were further delayed. In October senior armed forces
officers refused to testify to the court investigating the
killings on the grounds that they had acted within the
Constitution. In November the Supreme Court
confirmed the court's request for their testimony, and
PreSident Rodriguez Veltze, as Commander in Chief of
the armed forces, authorized them to testify.
In November former head of state Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada was served in the USA with judicial
documents related to the criminal investigation in
Bolivia into his responsibility for crimes committed at

I mpunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity
during the 1 992-95 war was widespread. Thousands
of "disa ppeara  s" were still unresolved. Victims
a nd their families were denied access to justice. Lack
of full co-<>peration with the I nternational Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Tribunal),
particula rly by the Republika Srpska ( RS), remained
an obstacle to justice. Efforts to tackle impunity in
proceedings before domestic courts remained largely
insufficient, a lthough some war crimes trials were
conducted. The first convictions for war crimes
committed by Bosnian Serbs were passed by RS
courts. Of the one million refugees a nd internally
displaced people who had retu rned to their homes
since the end of the war, many continued to face
discrimination.
Background
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) remained divided in two
semi-autonomous entities, the RS and the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBi H), with a special status
granted to the Brcko District.
The international community continued to exert
significant influence over the country's political
process, in particular through a High Representative

71

80S

with executive powers nominated by the Peace
Implemen tation Council, an Intergover nmental body
monttorlng implementa    of the Dayton Peace
Agreement. Approximat ely 6,500 troops of the
European Union (EU)-Ied peacekeep force EUFOR
and 400 members of the European Union Police Mission
remained In BiH. In November negotiation s for a
StabilisatiO n and Associatio n Agreement (SAA) between
the EU and BiH were opened.

International prosecutions for wa r crimes
The Tribunal continued to try al leged perpetrators of
serious violations of internatio nal humanttar lan law. In
january, Vldoje BlagojeviC and Dragan jokic. former
officers of the Bosntan Serb Army (Vojska Republike
Srpske, VRS), were sentenced to 18 and nine years'
ImprISonm ent respective ly for their role in the killing of
thousands of Bosntak men and boys after the fall of
Srebrentca in july 1995.
I n November Sefer Halilovlc, former Chief of the
Main Staff of the Army of Bosnta and Herzegovin a
(Armlja Bosne i Hercegovin e, ABI H), was acquitted of
the charge of murder as a war CrIme for the killing of
non-Bosnia ks in the villages of Uzdol and Grabovica.
The Tribunal ruled that It had not been established
beyond reasonable doubt that he had effective control
over the troops when the crimes were committed.
In December Miroslav Bralo, former member of the
Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijece odbrane,
HVO), the Bosnian Croat armed forces, was sentenced
to 20 years' Imprisonmen t for crimes committed in 1 993
against Bosniaks i n and around the villages of Ahmici
and Nadloci. Mlroslav Bralo had pleaded guilty to eight
counts of war crimes and CrImes against humanity,
Including persecutions, murder, torture and inhumane
treatment, outrages upon persona l digntty Including
rape, and unlawful confinement.
The trial continued of former President of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Mi losevic.
charged With war crimes and crimes against humanity
for hiS alleged Involvement in BiH, Croatia and Kosovo,
and with aiding and abetting genocide in the war in BiH.
Co-operation between the RS authorities and the
Tribunal remained inadequate. By the end of 2005, no
suspect Indicted by the Tribunal had been arrested by
the RS police. A policy of "voluntary surrenders" by the
RS authOrities resulted In a number of transfers from
the RS, or with the assistance of the RS authorities.
However, the policy Violated the obligation of the RS to
co-operate fully by arresting and transferring indicted
suspects. Six publicly indicted suspects remained at
large, some of them believed to be in the RS or in Serbia
and Montenegro.
Under a 'completion strategy" laid down by the U N
Security Council, the Tribunal was expected to
conclude all cases, Including appeals, by 2010. The last
indictments before the clOSing down of the Tribunal
were confi rmed and unsea led between February
and Apri l .
In February former VRS officers Zdravko Tolimlr,
Radivoje Mi letic and Milan Gvero were indicted on
charges of war crimes and CrImes against humanity
72

against the Bosnlak population in the Srebrenica and
Lepa enclaves. RadivOje Mi letlc and Milan Gvero
surrendered voluntarily but Zdravko Tolimir remained
at large at the end of 2005· Also in February the Tribunal
indicted Rasim Delic, former Commander of the Main
Staff of the ABiH, for murder, cruel treatment and rape
committed in 1993 and 1995 against the non-Bosniak
population. Following his indictment, he voluntarily
surrendered.
Among those who surrendered voluntarily were
Momcilo Perisic, former Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav
People's Army, In March. He was indicted in February,
charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity
In BiH and Croatia, inclUding against the civilian
population during the siege of Sarajevo and against
non-Serbs after the fall of Srebrentca. The indictment
against former RS Interior Mintster Mico Stanisic
confirmed In February, charged him with war cri es
and crimes against humanity, committed as part of a
JOint criminal enterprise aimed at permanently
removing non-Serbs from areas under Bosnlan Serb
control. He voluntarily surrendered.
In May the Tribunal deCided for the first time to refer
one of ItS Indictments to a national JUriSdiction.
Following a request by the Prosecutor, the case of
former Bosnlan Serb soldier Radovan Stankovic
charged with the enslavemen t and rape of non- erb
women detained in Foca, was referred to the War
Crimes Chamber of the BiH State Court (see below). The
Tribunal subsequently transferred seven other
suspects' cases to BiH.
In August Milan Lukic. former member of a Bosntan
Serb paramilitary group Indicted for war crimes and
CrImes against humanity including exterminati On,
persecution , murder and Inhumane acts against the
non-Serb population In the Visegrad area, was arrested
in Argentina by the local police. He was stil l held in
Argentina at the end of 2005. In August former sub­
commander of the RS military police and paramilitary
leader in Foca, Dragan Zelenovic, indicted for torture
and rape committed by Bosnian Serb forces against
non-Serb women detained in Foca, was arrested in the
Russian Federation, where he remained in detention at
the end of 2005.

Domestic prosecutions for wa r crimes
A War Crimes Chamber within the BiH State Court. set
up to try cases referred by the Tribunal and
particularly senSitive cases, became operational in
March. The first trial before the Chamber started in
September. In December the Prosecution at the BiH
State Court confirmed indictments against II Bosnian
Serbs suspected of involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica
massacre. There remained concerns over the
inadequacy of mechanisms to ensure the transfer of
eVidence from the Tribunal to the Chamber, and to
ensure that the Tri bunal 's jurisprudence was
consistently applied In ItS proceedings. The War
Crimes Chamber only tried cases referred by the
Tri bunal and particularly sensitive cases, while a large
number of cases remained to be dealt With by RS and
FBiH courts.
Amnesty International Report 2006

BOS

In general, prosecutions were not actively pursued.
Victims, witnesses and courts, particularly in cases
before RS and FBiH courts, were not adequately
protected from harassment, intimidation and threats.
However, some war crimes trials opened or continued
before national courts.
In January the Sarajevo Cantonal Court sentenced
Veselin C ancar to four-and-a-half years' imprisonment
for crimes committed against the civilian population
detained by the Bosnian Serb forces in Foca. Former RS
policeman Boban Simsic, suspected of war crimes
against civilians in the Visegrad area, surrendered to
EUFOR troops in January. In May the War Crimes
Chamber decided that he would be tried at the BiH State
Court, and proceedings began in September.
In February, 1 1 former RS police officers were
acquitted by the Banja Luka District Court of charges of
i llegally detaining Father Tomislav Matanovic, a Roman
Catholic priest, and his parents in 1995. The bodies of
the priest and his parents were found in 2001 near
Prijedor, with close-range gunshot wounds.
Investigations into the killings reportedly continued.
I n June, Tomo M ihajlovic, a former RS police officer,
was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by the
Zenica Cantonal Court for crimes against the non-Serb
population in the Teslic area in 1992. Also in J une,
Goran Vasie, a former member of a Bosnian Serb
paramilitary group, received a six-year prison term
from the Sarajevo Cantonal Court for the cruel and
inhuman treatment of prisoners of war detained in the
Sarajevo suburb of Nedzarici in 1992.
In July, Abduladhim Maktouf, a BiH citizen of Iraqi
origin, was sentenced by the BiH State Court to five
years' imprisonment for his role in the abduction of
non-Bosniak civilians, who were beaten and ill-treated
in a detention camp in Orasac and one of whom was
beheaded. The sentence was quashed on appeal in
November and a retrial ordered.
In October Konstantin Simonovic was found guilty by
the Brcko Basic Court for war crimes, including torture,
against non-Serbs detained in the Luka camp near
Brcko and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.
In November, for the first time since the end of the
war, a war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb suspects before
an RS court ended in convictions. The Banja Luka
District Court sentenced Drago Radakovic, Drasko
Krndija and Radoslav Kneievic, former RS police
officers, to between 15 and 20 years' imprisonment for
the murder of six Bosniak civilians in Prijedor in 1994·
In December, the Banja Luka District Court sentenced
former VRS member N ikola Dereta to 13 years'
imprisonment for the murder of one Bosniak civilian
and the attempted murder of his father i n the v i l l age
of Strbine.

Unresolved 'disa ppeara  s'
According to estimates of the International
CommiSSion on Missing Persons (ICMP), between
15, 000 and 20,000 people who went missing during the
war were still unaccounted for. Many of the missing
were victims of "disappearances", and the perpetrators
continued to enjoy impunity. In August the BiH Council
Amnesty International Report 2006

of M inisters became the co-founder, with the ICMP, of a
national Missing Persons Institute.
I n a ceremony in J uly marking the loth anniversary of
the Srebrenica massacre, the remains of 610 victims
were buried at the Potocari Memorial. At the end of
2005 the remains of approximately 5,000 victims had
been recovered and over 2,800 victims identified.
Implementing a decision by the High Representative,
the RS in January appointed a working group to study
documentation produced by the Srebrenica
Commission, establtshed by the RS authorities to
investigate the Srebrenica massacre, with a view to
identifying those implicated. In its first report In March,
the working group presented a list of 892 suspects stil l
reportedly employed in R S a n d BiH institutions. The
High Representative expressed concern at the failure of
the RS Ministries of the Interior and of Defence to

Right to return in safety and dignity
Since the end of the war, out of an estimated 2.2 million
displaced people, more than a million refugees and
internal ly displaced persons (I DPs) were estimated to
have returned to their homes. According to the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees field mission in BiH,
between January and December, approximately 6,400
refugees and l OPs returned to their pre-war homes. Of
these, approximately 5,800 people were registered as
members of minorities.
Lack of access to employment continued to be a
major factor in people's decision not to return or
remain in their pre-war community. Employment
opportunities were scarce in general , reflecting the
weak economic situation and difficulties of economic
transition and post-war reconstruction. In addition,
returnees faced discrimination on ethnic grounds when
trying to find work and, in some cases, ethnically
motivated harassment and attacks.

B RAZ I L
FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
Head of state and government: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
Death penalty: abolitionist for ordinary crimes
I nternational Criminal Court: ratified
UN Women's Convention: ratified with reservations
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: ratified

Brazilians, especially the poor a nd socially excluded,
continued to suffer high levels of human rights
violations. There were few policy initiatives in the
area of human rights, with many federal government
proposa ls still awaiting implementation and few, if
any, state authorities introducing promised public
security reforms. Violations at the ha nds of the
police, including extrajudicial executions, torture
and excessive use of force, persisted across the
country. Torture and ill-treatment were widespread in
the prison system, where conditions were often cruel,
inhuman or degrading. I ndigenous peoples suffered
attacks a nd killings as well as forcible evictions from
their ancestra l lands and the federa l government fell
short of its stated goal of demarcating all remaining
indigenous lands by 2006. Human rights defenders
a nd land activists suffered threats, attacks and
killings. Impunity for human rights violations was the
norm, a rising from the slowness of judicial
proceedings and the reluctance of some of the
judiciary to prosecute such cases.
Background
The year was marked by a political crisis as evidence
emerged of high-level corruption InvolvIng members
of the government and of Congress. Accusations that
the governing Workers' Party (Partido dos
Trabalhadores. PT) had been involved in raising
undeclared electoral funds, awarding government
contracts dishonestly and bUYIng votes in Congress
shook the government and led to the resignation of
the President's chief of staff, Jose Dirceu. and his
subsequent expulsion from Congress. Three
parliamentary Inquiries into corruption were
Initiated and several members of Congress were
under Investigation by Congress' ethics commi ttee.
PreSident Luiz Inacio Lula da SIIva publicly
apologized, acceptIng some of the charges levelled
against his party, a lthough denying any involvement.
Important efforts were made towards disarmament,
with a law to control the carrying of guns introduced in
2003 apparently contributIng to a national decline In
homicides. However. BrazIlians rejected a total ban on
the sales of guns to Civilians In a national referendum
held in October, reflecting the public's anxiety about
levels of CrIme. The federal authorities reported a
declIne of 8.2 per cent In the number of homicides
natIOnally. the first such decline since 1992, whIle the
state of Sao Paulo reported notable declines over a
perIod of five years. These reductions were attributed

74

to a combination of efforts to control small arms,
alternative publIc security policies and targeted social
investment at local level.
In October the UN Human Rights Committee
expressed concern about a number of issues including
extrajudicial executions and torture by police forces
and threats to indigenous populations.

Public security and killings by the police
Reports of extrajudicial executions, excessive use of
force and the systematic use of torture by state polIce
forces persisted. Many states continued to defend
tough poliCing policies to counter high levels of crime.
The number of people killed by police in situations
offiCially registered as "resistance followed by death"
(implying that the police had acted in self-defence)
remained high in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo. Between 1999 and 2004, more than 9,000 cases of
police killings, predominantly "resistance followed by
death", were recorded in the two states. Investigations
into these killings continued to be minimal.
There were also recurrent reports of human rights
violations by federal and state police officers involved
in corrupt and criminal activity, and of killings
perpetrated by "death squads" i nvolving active and
former members of the police. State governments
consistently failed to implement the public security
reforms set out in the proposed Single Public Security
System (SUSP) and the federal government focused its
attention on police training rather than broader human
rights-based reforms. As a result, reSidents of poor
communities continued to suffer discriminatory,
invasive and violent policing which failed to combat
crime or provide any form of security.
a On 31 March, 29 people were killed in the Baixada
Fluminense district of Rio de Janeiro. The killings were
attributed to a "death squad" of mil itary police officers,
who drove through the towns of Ouelmados and Nova
Igua�u shooting randomly at passers-by. Ten mil itary
police officers and one former police officer were
arrested and charged with murder. Thejoint federal
and civil police investigation linked at least 15 earlier
killings to the massacre suspects, who were believed to
have been involved In kidnappIng and extorting money
from lorry drivers.
While official statistics of police kil lings declined in
Sao Paulo, human rights groups and reSidents of poor
communities reported several multiple homicides
allegedly committed by police officers.
A On 22 June, five youths aged between 14 and 22
were reported ly executed by members of the civil
police in the Morro do Samba community in Diadema.
During a raid on the area, 35 police officers reportedly
cornered the five in a house and sprayed them with
machine-gun fire from the door and through the roof.
Investigations into the killings were reportedly closed
as the Internal Investigations Unit claimed the victims
were all drug traffickers. Some family members of the
dead youths were forced to leave the community for
fear of reprisals.
In November the parliamentary Commission of
Inquiry of the lower house of Congress published its
Amnesty International Report 2006

BRA

final report on "death-squad" activity in the north-east,
detailing cases from nine states. According to one of
the parliamentarians responsible for the report, all
involved active or former police officers. The report
found links between state officials, business in terests
and organized crime across the north-east.

Torture and ill-treatment
Torture and i ll-treatment continued to be used at the
time of arrest, during interrogations and as a means of
control within the detention system. There were also
many reports of torture being used by law enforcement
officials for criminal ends.
Impunity persisted and lack of published information
about prosecutions under the 1997 Torture Law made
the extent of the problem uncertain. The federal
government's promised campaign against torture was
finally launched In December. Proposals for Brazil to
ratify the UN Optional Protocol to the UN Convention
against Torture were pending before Congress.
Throughout 2005 there were reports of torture in Sao
Paulo's FEBEM juvenile detention centres. Punishment
units were reportedly staffed by guards from the adult
prison system, contrary to the law. I n the Vila Maria
unit, which was reportedly used as a punishment
centre, detainees were allegedly tortured and locked
up all day. Concern was heightened by attempts by the
authorities to block access to the detainees.
Riots within the juvenile detention system led to the
death of at least five young detainees. In an apparent
attempt to undermine the work of human rights groups,
Governor Geraldo Alckmin accused two leading human
rights activists - Concei�ao Paganele and Ariel de
Castro Alvez - of inciting the riots. In November the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ordered
the Brazilian government to take measures to improve
the FEBEM system.
a In September, the mother of a juvenile in the Vila
Maria unit reported that her son had been so severely
beaten by wardens that he was urinating blood. Another
imprisoned juvenile showed his mother bruising and
signs of torture. He told her that the director of the unit
had personally ordered that his food be withheld. He
was kept for four days in solitary confinement, after
being dragged out of class by a guard who shot five times
into the ceiling to intimidate him.
In April, two civil police officers, from Xinguara in the
state of Para, were convicted of the torture of a 15-year­
old boy in 1999. The boy was severely beaten and
suffered continuing psychological problems. This was
the first conviction for torture in the region.
In November a video was aired on television showing
veteran soldiers of an armoured infantry unit in the
state of Parana inflicting electric shocks, drowning and
branding with irons during an initiation ceremony of
recent recruits. The army immediately announced the
suspension of the commanding officer and an internal
investigation.
Prison conditions
Conditions in prisons amounted to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment, and the prison population
Amnesty International Report 2006

continued to rise. Overcrowding, poor sanitation and
lack of health facilities contributed to frequent riots and
high levels of prisoner-on-prisoner violence. There were
also consistent reports of violent and abusive behaviour
by guards, including the use of torture and Ill-treatment.
Special punishment regimes for prisoners found guilty of
crimes within the prison system continued to be used,
although in July the National Council on Criminal and
Penal Policy of the Ministry of Justice described them as
unconstitutional and contrary to International standards
for the protection of detainees.
In Rio de Janeiro, human rights groups denounced
conditions in the Polinter pre-trial detention centre. In
August the unit held 1,500 detainees in a space designed
for 250, with an average of 90 men per 3m x 4m cell.
Between January and June, three men were kil led in
incidents between prisoners. OffiCials in the detention
centre were also forcing detainees to choose which
criminal faction they wished to be segregated with
inside Polinter. In November the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights ordered the Brazilian
government to take measures to Improve the situation.
In June, during a riot in Zwinglio Ferreira detention
centre in Presidente Venceslau, Sao Paulo state, five
detainees were beheaded by other prisoners from
opposing prison gangs.
In November the federal Commission of Human
Rights of Congress held a public hearing on women in
detention. The Commission received reports of human
rights violations against women detained in Sao Paulo,
who suffered from overcrowding, especially the 52 per
cent held, many irregularly, in police holding cells.

Abuses in connection with land disputes
Thirty-seven land workers were killed between January
and November, according to the Pastoral Land
Commission (CPT). However, according to the CPT, even
more died as a result of lack of medical or social
assistance after they were evicted from land they had
settled. Many land workers suffered death threats and
harassment, as did homeless activists in cities and
actiVists fighting against the constructions of dams.
In November, members of a congressional inquiry
into rural violence approved a final report which called
for farm invasions by land workers from the Landless
Workers' Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores
Rurais Sem Terra, MST) to be denoted "terrorist acts·.
They voted down a version of the report that cited the
lack of land reform as the major factor In land conflict.
Reports of the use of slaves or indentured labour
persisted. I n December, AI delegates were informed by
members of the Araquara town council that many sugar
cane workers in the interior of Sao Paulo state had died,
al legedly from exhaustion. According to these reports,
workers were forced to cut several tons of sugar cane
each day.
Proposed legislation that would allow the
confiscation of land where slave labour is used
remained in Congress. According to figures from the
CPT, by August the government's campaign to combat
slave labour had received reports of 173 such cases
involving 5,407 people.

B RA

I ndigenous peoples campaigning for land and human
rights faced violent attacks and forced evictions. Many
suffered extreme deprivation as a result. In Mato
Grosso do Sui, long-standing demarcation processes of
Guarani-Kaiowa lands were delayed by judicial
proceedings, culminating in the forced evictions of
Guarani-Kaiowa. While the federal government did
ratify some important territories, they remained a long
way from complying with their promised target of
demarcating all remaining indigenous lands by 2006.
a On 12 February, hired gunmen killed Sister Dorothy
Stang, a nun who had long campaigned on ecological
and land issues in Para state. Two days earlier she had
met the federal government's Special Secretary for
Human Rights and told him of death threats against her.
In December, two gunmen were convicted of the killing
but those who allegedly ordered it were sti l l awaiting
trial. After this killing, the federal government sent
federal police and army forces to help in investigations
and to support the formation of a protected ecological
area. Nevertheless, according to human rights groups,
numerous land activists in the region were stil l under
threat. A further 15 1and activists were killed in the first
Six months of 2005 in Para. An appeal to transfer Sister
Dorothy's case to the federal judicial system was turned
down by the Federal Appeals Court. This was the first
case to seek to use new legislation al lowing human
rights crimes to be heard in the federal system.
a I n February, two homeless activists were shot and
killed by military police officers during their forced
eviction from a building in Goania, Goias state.
a In June Adenilson dos Santos and his son jorge
were killed when four armed men, a llegedly
undercover police officers belonging to a "death
squad", opened fire at a party held by the Truka
community in Cabrob6, Pernambuco. The police
stated that there was an exchange of fire, but Truka
representatives stated that no one at the party was
armed. The Truka a lleged the attack was a result of
their struggle for land and their opposition to
organized crime and drug-trafficking organizations in
their territory.

civil police, he was threatened and intimidated.
According to reports, he continued to receive
anonymous death threats.

Impunity
The criminal justice system continued to fail those
suffering human rights violations, as few perpetrators
were brought to justice. There was little progress in
several long-standing cases. The commanding officers
convicted of the 1992 Carandiru massacre of prisoners
by the military police and the 1997 Eldorado dos Carajas
massacre of land activists remained at liberty pending
appeals. Individual police officers in both cases were
sti l l awaiting trial.
Human rights groups expressed dismay following the
government's announcement that only selected
archives relating to "disappearances" and killings of
political prisoners during the military government
would be opened.

Human rights defenders, including those defending

attacks and killings. The federal government's
promised programme for the protection of human
rights defenders showed little sign of implementation.

Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: signed

Reports of torture or ill-treatment of police detainees
continued. Discrimination against the Romani
community persisted, a lthough legal action to
enforce anti-<liscri mi nation legislation achieved
favourable court rulings, including a landmark
decision that esta blished the right of Romani
children to equality in education. Some residents of
care homes for people with mental disa bilities
continued to live in conditions that a mounted to
inhuman and degrading treatment. A cou rt ruled
that neglect by the state caused the deaths of 1 3
children deprived o f food a n d heating a t a care home
in 1 996 and 1 997.
Political developments
After a general election in June. a coalitIOn government
was eventually formed two months later, headed by
Sergey Stanishev of the Socialist Party. The far-right
party Ataka (Attack) saw a rapid rise in support, coming
fourth in the poll.
Bulgaria made progress towards greater respect for
human rights in an attempt to meet the criteria for
membership of the European Union (EU), scheduled for
2007. Efforts were made to observe the rights of
suspects in criminal proceedings, to end trafficking in
human beings and to fulfil health rights. However, the
European Commission expressed concerns about ill­
treatment by law enforcement officials, discrimination
against Roma and the living conditions of people with
mental disabilities In its annual report, published in
October, on Bulgaria's preparations for EU accession.
Police and prison abuses
The European Court of Human Rights gave a number of
rulings that poor conditions of detention had
amounted to cruel or degrading treatment. The Court
also found in several cases that Bulgaria had violated
the right to liberty and security of person, the right to
a hearing within a reasonable time, and the right to
fair trial.
Reports of torture or ill-treatment by law
enforcement offiCials continued. Failure to respect the
detainee's right to be questioned in the presence of a
lawyer often contributed to such abuse.
a On 16 Apri l Jul ian Krastev, aged 38 and homeless,
was reportedly beaten to death by a police sergeant in
the town of Varna. He had been living in a cupboard in
the apartment block where the officer lived.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Reportedly, the officer had been drinking alcohol and
two police colleagues witnessed the assault. The officer
was dismissed from the police and charged before the
Varna Regional Mil itary Court.
a In November, 39-year-old businessman Anguel
Dimitrov died during a police operation in Blagoevgrad,
according to the police from a heart attack during his
arrest. Following public protests by his family, who
claimed that the police were responsible for his death,
an inquest was opened. I n December, the findings of an
autopsy revealed that he had died from a haemorrhage
caused by a blow to the head. Although the Interior
Ministry publicly accepted responsibility for the
wrongful actions of the police and the Blagoevgrad
police chief resigned, the Prosecutor's Office
announced that there was insufficient evidence to
bring a prosecution.
The International HelSinki Federation, a human
nghts organization, reported inhuman conditions In
several detention facilities, especially in Plovdiv and
Nova Zagora. There were no effective mechanisms to
respond to complaints of Ill-treatment and violence
between prisoners. Medical care in prISons was of poor
quality and was not integrated within the national
health care system.

Discri mination against Roma
The Romani community was most often targeted for ill­
treatment by law enforcement offiCials and
discriminatory treatment.
a In July the Grand Chamber of the European Court
of Human Rights for the first time addressed the racial
element i n a case involving the deprivation of l i fe. I t
upheld a n earlier decision b y the Court in the
landmark case of Nachova v Bulgaria, which involved
the 1996 kill of two unarmed Romani army
deserters by a m i litary police officer. The Court
unanimously found the Bulgarian state responsible
for the deaths of the two men, and for the failure to
conduct an effective offiCial investigation into
al legations that the killings were motivated by anti­
Roma racism.
a I n J une a court in Blagoevgrad ruled against a
restaurant for refusing to serve a group of Romani
customers in March 2004 while serving non-Romani
people who had arrived later. The Romani group
brought a complaint of discrimination a fter waiting
for service for an hour, and the restaurant owner was
unable to show that he had not treated them
differently from others, as required under Bulgaria's
comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation.

Forced evictions in Sofia
a On 31 August at least 24 Romani houses in the Hristo
Botev municipality of Sofia were demolished, leaving
some 150 Roma homeless. In September the authorities
in Vuzrazhdane municipality subsequently warned
Romani inhabitants to abandon their illegally
constructed houses in Serdika district within seven
days. However, a day before the scheduled
demolitions, the Sofia District Court ordered the
evictions to be postponed pending a decision on the
Roma's legal entitlement to remain. The authorities had

77

BUR

reportedly made no provision for compensation or
alternative accommodation for those to be evicted.

School segregation
a In October the Sofia District Court ruled that the
Ministry of Education, the Sofia municipality and a Sofia
school had segregated Romani children in violation of
anti-discrimination legislation. It found that the
school's students were all Romani, not through the
choice of the students but because of failures by the
authorities. The court held that substandard conditions
in the school, lack of control over school attendance
and lower educational requirements violated Romani
children's right to equal and integrated education.
This was a landmark case for Bulgarian Roma, who
faced discrimination in many spheres of publiC life,
including education and employment. According to the
European Roma Rights Centre, between 70 and 90 per
cent of students in special schools for children with
physical and developmental disabilities in Bulgaria
were Roma.

People with mental disabilities
People with mental disabilities living in social care
homes were not effectively protected from physical
and mental abuse. The services they received did not
meet international human rights standards or conform
to best professional practice.
a The situation for former residents of a care home in
Dragash Voyvoda, closed in 2003 following publicity
about inadequate medical care and harsh living
conditions, was only slightly improved in some of the
homes to which residents had been transferred.
Although their material provision had in most cases
improved slightly, some stil l lived in conditions that
amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. There
was stil l no independent mechanism to ensure prompt,
thorough and impartial investigation of reported
abuses against residents of mental health institutions.
a In june, Ivailo Vakarelski, aged 24, was found dead
in the State Psychiatric Hospital in Karlukovo to which
he had been admitted several days earlier. According to
reports, his body showed extensive bruising. Hospital
staff were said to have told his parents that an autopsy
could only be performed if they paid for one, even
though the hospital was obliged to perform an autopsy
under the Health Care Act. The regional prosecutor
ordered an investigation after the local prosecutor
initially declined to investigate the death.
The International HelSinki Federation reported that
many Bulgarian psychiatric hospitals and social care
homes lacked faci lities for adequate treatment or care
for people with mental and developmental disabil i ties.
Despite some improvements, food was insuffiCient, and
treatment methods were not compatible with
international obligations to provide the highest
attainable level of health and life in dignity for people
with disabilities.
a In May the District Court of Plovdiv acquitted three
members of staff from a social care home in Dzhurkovo
who had been charged in connection with the deaths of
13 children from hypothermia, malnutrition and lung
diseases between December 1996 and March 1997. The
78

court was unable to establish a causal link between the
deaths and negligence by staff, but found that neglect
on the part of the state had left the home without the
means to pay for food and heating, resulting in living
conditions that were cruel, inhuman and degrading.

Loca l, legislative and presidential elections were
held, signalling the end of Burundi's transition
period, a lthough a rmed conflict continued in two
provinces. Government forces committed serious
human rights violations including arbitrary arrests
and detentions, rape and extrajudicial executions.
An opposition armed group committed a buses
i ncluding unlawful killings. Sexual violence against
women, including rape, persisted. The Burundi
authorities forcibly retu rned more than 5,000
Rwandan a sylu m-seekers, a nd reportedly a llowed
Rwandan soldiers into the country to take them back
to Rwa nda. At the end of 2005, 499 detainees were
u nder sentence of death.
Background
2005 saw a series of elections. On 28 February, a
national referendum on the Constitution produced a
"yes" vote of more than 90 per cent. However,
negotiations between the political parties relating to
the electoral code and the schedule for local and
legislative elections stal led. The UN Secretary­
General and regional leaders intervened, setting a
deadl ine of August to complete the electoral process,
and the PreSident called local elections on 3 j une,
legislative elections on 4 july and the presidential
election on 1 8 August.
The former armed opposition group, the CNDD­
FDD, won the local elections with more than 55 per
Amnesty International Report 2006

BUR

cent of the vote, and in the legislative elections
gained 59 of the 1 1 8 seats in parliament. On 26 August,
Pierre Nkurunziza, leader of the CNDD-FDD, became
President, ending the transitional period that started
in 2002.
Armed conflict continued throughout 2005 between
one armed group, PALl PEHUTU-FNL, known as the FNL
(Forces nationales de liberation), and the government
armed forces (Forces de defense nationale, FDN) in the
provinces of Bujumbura rural and Bubanza, despite the
presence of 5,634 UN peacekeeping soldiers serving
with the UN Operation in Burundi (ONUB). The FNL stil l
refused t o negotiate a ceasefire agreement with the
government.

Human rights violations
Government armed forces composed of former CNDD­
FDD fighters and soldiers of the former Burundi armed
forces (Forces armees burundaises, FAB) were
responsible for serious human rights violations.
Civilians in Bujumbura rural and a lleged FNL members
were subjected to abuses including arbitrary arrests
and detentions, rape and extrajudicial executions.
a On 14 May in the commune of Isale the FDN
al legedly shot dead 17 FNL fighters who were
reportedly unarmed.
After the election, the security forces and the
national intelligence agency (Documentation
nationale) undertook operations to secure the borders
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and to
counter the FNL. During these operations, they
frequently detained Burundi and DRC nationals
arbitrarily.
a On 24 September, a Congolese refugee from the
Banyamulenge community was arrested in the town
centre of Bujumbura by intelligence agents. He was
held for more than three weeks without being told the
legal basis for his arrest.
a During the week beginning 3 October, intel ligence
agents arrested two local civil servants and dozens of
other people in Bujumbura for allegedly being FNL
members. According to reports, several of them were
beaten and injured in detention.
Human rights abuses by the FN L
Throughout 2005, the FNL threatened and intimidated
the civilian population in the provinces of Bujumbura
rural and Bubanza, often demanding shelter or food.
During the election period, low-level government
offiCials and civilians suspected of collaborating with
government armed forces were killed by the FNL.
Between 6 March and 6 June, the FNL reportedly killed at
least six local administrative staff in Bujumbura rural
province and abducted three others. Several political
members of CNDD-FDD were beheaded and rural
families were targeted for merely speaking with soldiers.
a On 16 June, a group of 11 combatants, reportedly
belonging to the FNL, entered a Protestant church
service in Muyaga, Muhutu commune. Once inside, they
closed the doors and Windows of the church and fired
into the congregation. Eight people were kil led and 30
others were wounded.
Amnesty International Report 2006

a A single mother was attacked on 1 4 August a t her
home in the province of Bujumbura rural by armed FNL
combatants who accused her of working for the
government. According to her statement, to punish her,
they buried her child alive, physically assaulted her and
tied her to a tree. She only managed to escape after
three days.
During the second half of 2005, the FNL sought to
expand its activities in other provinces, notably
Bubanza and Ngozi, often with the help of local offiCials.

Violence aga inst women
Rape and other forms of sexual violence perSISted
despite the implementation of a ceasefire In most areas
of the country.
a On 20 August, H.A., a 16-year-old girl from the
commune of Murwi, Cibitoke province, was raped. The
alleged perpetrator was arrested but then immediately
released.
According to the human rights department of
ONUB, in 2005, only one out of every three women
raped lodged a complaint. Of these, the majority
dropped their case before anyone was brought to
justice.
Death pena lty
At the end of 2005, 499 detainees were under sentence
of death. The last executions, of seven civilians, took
place in 1997, but courts continued to pass death
sentences.
Kassi Manlan verdict
On 3 May, the Bujumbura appeals court sentenced to
death four people accused of taking part in the
assassination of Dr Kassi Manlan, the representative of

National Truth and Reconciliation Commission
Legislation establishing a National Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (NTRC), passed in
December 2004, mandated the NTRC to establish the
truth about acts of violence committed in the course of
the conflict since 1962, specify which crimes had been
committed, other than genocide, and identify both
perpetrators and victims of such crimes. In a report
published In March, the UN Secretary-General raised
doubts about the credibility and Impartiality of the
NTRC and addressed the feaSibility of establishing an
International J udicial commission of inquiry. It
recommended amending the composition of the NTRC
by including an international component (originally it
was to comprise 25 members, all Burundians) and
setting up a special chamber within the court system of
Burundi. This chamber would be competent to
prosecute those bearing the greatest responsibility for
the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes, and would be composed of national and
internatIOnal judges. In November, the new
government designated a delegation of eight members
to establish an NTRC in col laboratIOn with the UN.
On 15 November, the authorities set up a commission
to Identify political prisoners. Composed of 21
members, ItS tasks included defining political prisoners
and formulating recommendations.
J uvenile justice
In most prisons, children endured harsh and
overcrowded conditions. Some child detainees

Although Burundl ratified the African Charter on the

to go back to Rwanda. As early as 25 May, more than
7,000 of them had found their way back to Burundl. The
Burundian authorities then reportedly allowed
Rwandan soldiers to enter the country, to destroy the
asylum-seekers' makeshift camps and to forcibly
repatriate them once more. On 1 3 June, Burundian
officials described these people as "illegal Immigrants".
After the elections, the new government declared
that there would be no fOrcible returns and that It
would allow UNHCR to assist asylum-seekers. However,
the authOrities continued to refer to them as "il legal

Between January and December, UNHCR faCilitated
the repatriation of some 60,000 Burundlan refugees
(returnees), bringing the total number to 300,000 since
2002. The lack of land available in Burundi caused
problems for returnees trying to regain their former

her If she tried to recover It. Marthe Misago asked the

considerable political pressure on the judiciary.
In February a closed session of the National
Assembly lifted the parliamentary immunity of three
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) members. The SRP responded
by boycotting the legislative chamber until August. The
boycott and a culture of declining attendance meant
that parliament was repeatedly Inquorate.

judiciary. Several judges and prosecutors were
removed without due disciplinary procedures. and the

Refugees
Montagnard refugees from Viet Nam continued to cross
into Cambodia. Some were forcibly returned before
they could present their asylum claims, in breach of
Cambodia's obligations under the 1 951 UN Refugee
Convention.
Following a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding
signed by Cambodia, Vi et Nam and the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees in January, refugees who did
not wish to resettle in a third country or to return to Vi et
Nam were sent back to their native Central Highlands
despite the absence of permanent monitoring (see Viet
Nam entry). Of the several hundred people awaiting
resettlement abroad in sites in Phnom Penh, some 340
were resettled, mainly in the USA.
The government warned that villagers assisting
Vietnamese Montagnard asylum-seekers in the border
provinces would face trafficking charges. Harassment
and threats were reported against individual human

with public disorder and released to await trial. The
men, who should have been brought before a judge
within three days, were transferred to Kondengui
Central Prison in Yaounde on 13 June, where they saw a
lawyer for the first time. They were subsequently
charged with sodomy because of their real or perceived

two former government ministers.

Southern Cameroons National Council
In December, the Appeal Court in Yaounde decided on
appeals by imprisoned members of the Southern
Cameroons National Council (SCNC) against their 1999
convictions by a military tribunal. Adelbert Ngek and
Promise Nyamsai, who were serving lo-year prison
terms, had their convictions quashed and were released.
Three prisoners had their Ii fe sentences reduced to 25
years, and one had a 20-year term reduced to 15 years.
Two prisoners had 15-year terms reduced to 10 years, and
four others had lo-year terms confirmed. Two prisoners,
Wilson Che Neba and Samuel Che Neba, had been
released in May after servmg eight-year prison terms.
The prisoners who remained in custody appealed to the
Supreme Court against the decIsion of the Appeal Court.
The prisoners had been denied an appeal for more
than five years. After lawyers lodged a complaint with
the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights
on the prisoners' behalf, the Minister of Defence
announced in November 2004 that they could appeal to
the Appeal Court. The hearings, which started m January
2005, were repeatedly adjourned because the authOrities
failed to produce some of the prisoners in court or

The prisoners had been sentenced to between eight

Background
Although most of the country was politically stable,
insecurity persisted in the north. Repeated clashes
between armed gangs and members of the security
forces caused more than 10,000 civil ians to flee to
southern Chad. Armed gangs were reported to have

March President Bozize dismissed the Vice-President,
Abel Goumba, who had stood as a presidential

early 2003, as well as those that took place after
President Bozize took power In March 200). However,
in January the government formally requested the ICC

Although there were no further arrests of journalists
following the press law passed in 2004, several
independent media journalists were threatened with
death after they reported electoral malpractices,
including intimidation of voters by members of the
seCUrI ty forces.
o After the second round of presidential elections in
May, Zephirin Kaya and Patrick Akibata of Ndeke Luka
radio station were reportedly threatened with death by
President Bozize's supporters and members of his
preSidential guard. SimIlar threats were reportedly
made against Alexis Maka Gbossokotto, editor of Le
Citoyen newspaper.
Continued detention of a government opponent
Virtually all government opponents still held at the end
of 2004 were released during 2005. However, Simon
Kulumba, who had been briefly released due to i l l­
health, was re-arrested and remained in custody
without trial. He had been arrested in 2003 and accused
of colluding with former President Patasse to embezzle
funds from the sale of fuel donated by Libya. Those
freed included General Ferdinand Bomba Yeke, former
President Ange-Felix Patasse's head of security, who
was released In October after being pardoned by
President Bozize. General Bomba Yeke had been in
custody without charge or trial since November 2003.

Freedom of expression remained under threat, a nd
journal ists faced politica l ly motivated and
a rbitrary a rrest, prolonged detention a nd
i m prisonment. Thousands of refugees a rrived from
the Centra l African Republ ic. The legal framework
governing the construction of an oil pipeline
u ndermined the rights of those l iving and working
i n the vicinity.
Background
A new constitution was approved allowing PreSident
Deby to stand for re-election by removing the previous
two-term limit. It was approved after a referendum in
J une which was boycotted by the opposition and
human rights organizations.
A peace agreement was signed in August between the
authorities and the Movement for Democracy and
Justice in Chad (Mouvement pour la democratie et la
justice au Tchad. MDjT). one of the Chadian armed
opposition groups which had been active in Tibesti
'
northern Chad. A dissident group of the MDjT rejected
the agreement and said that it would carry on fighting.
In October, a group of soldiers including military
officers deserted their posts in N'Djamena and fled to
the eastern part of the country. The deserters called on
President Deby to step down and to free political
prisoners. PreSident Deby then dissolved the
presidential guard and created a new unit drawn from
the army and the police.
In November, the opposition coalition refused to
appoint representatives to the electoral commission
for the 2006 legislative and presidential elections. The
opposition asked for the contested census, which was
closed in january, to be reopened.
In September, gunmen on horseback from Sudan
attacked the vil lage of Madayouna, eastern Chad.
Dozens of people were kil led, including villagers and
members of the assailant group. In a radio interview,
PreSident Deby accused the janjawid militia group of
being behind this attack.
In December the town of Adre, in eastern Chad close
to the Sudanese border, was attacked. The Rally for
Democracy and Liberty (Rassemblement pour la
democratie et la liberte, RDL), a new armed opposition
group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The
Chadian authorities blamed Sudan which denied any
Involvement in the attack.

Refugees
Around 200,000 Sudanese refugees remained in Chad,
nearly half of them living in the south-eastern region of
Goz-Beida. Thousands of refugees fleeing human rights
abuses in the Central African Republic arrived in Chad.
Freedom of expression under attack
Freedom of expression came under attack throughout
2005. Journalists faced politically motivated and
arbitrary arrest. prolonged detention and
ImprISonment. Between July and September, at least
four journalists were sentenced to prison terms. They
were released In September on apPf'al.
In July, Samory Ngaradoumbe, El Hadj Garonde
Djarma and Koumbo Singa Gali of the weekly
L 'Observateurwere sentenced to prison terms after the
publication of articles critical of the authorities.
Samory Ngaradoumbe was sentenced to three months'
Imprisonment and a fine after his newspaper published
an open letter asking PreSident Deby to release
prISoners. Garonde Djarma was sentenced to three
years' imprisonment after he criticized the
constitutional amendment allOWing PreSident Deby to
stand for re-election. Koumbo Slnga Gali was
sentenced to one year's ImprISonment after her
newspaper published an interView with imprISoned
journalist Garonde Djarma.
I n August, Michael Didama, editor of the weekly Le
Temps, was convicted on charges of defamation and
incitement to hatred after the publication of articles on
the activities of armed opposition groups in eastern
Chad. He was sentenced to SIX months' imprisonment.
In September the N 'Ddjamena Court of Appeal
overturned the convictions of Garonde Djarma and
Koumbo Singa Gali because of procedural
Irregularities. The court also overturned the conviction
of Samory Ngaradoumbe. Mlchael Dldama's conviction
was upheld but hiS sentence was reduced to the time he
had already served. All the journalists were freed.

Cameroon t o fulfil their obligations under international
human rights law. The report said that the contracts
created risks for all human rights, ranging from civil and
political to economiC, social and cultural rights. For
example, some clauses in the contracts made it difficult
or impossible for Chad to regulate the activities of the
oil consortium, including to protect the safety and
health of workers or the rights to food and water for
people living near the oil development areas. AI called
for the contracts underpinning this project to be
amended to guard against the risks to human rights. AI
also urged project lenders to institute policies to
ensure that such contracts would not obtain funding In
the future.
In November, the authorities substantially modified
the Revenue Management law, which governs the
proceeds of the pipeline project. This law originally
sought to ensure that revenue from the project was
used for the benefit of local populations, through
health and education spending for example, and for
future generations. The government's amendment
would allow revenues to be diverted to military and
security spending. I n December the PreSident of the
World Bank expressed serious concerns about the
proposed amendment to the Revenue Management
law.

Impunity
I n August, the authorities dismissed at least six people
who had served under deposed President Hissene
Habre. It was unclear whether any formal charges were
brought against people suspected of committing human
rights violations.
Few steps were taken to bring Hissene Habre to
justice for human rights violations committed during
his time In power. In November, the Dakar Appeal
Court in Senegal declared itself "not competent" to
rule on whether to issue an order for Hissene Habre's
extradition to Belgium. In a press interView, President
Deby appealed to the Senegalese PreSident to
extradite Hissene Habre (see Senegal entry).

The prosecution of Augusto Pinochet for human
rights violations committed u nder his milita ry
government took a significant step forwa rd.
However, the 1 978 Amnesty Law was used to acquit
five former secret service agents of involvement in a
1 974 "disa ppearance". Prisoners were injured in
fighting over the minimal facilities provided in
prisons.
Background
Presidential elections in December produced no
outnght wmner. The two candidates who obtained the

Chile - were set to contest the second round of the
elections m January 2006.
Provisions for the appointmen t of " designated"

introduced under the military government (1973-90),
was amended by Congress. The amended Constitution
also a llowed Chile to ratify the Rome Statute of the

tax evasion and other finanCial cnmes to proceed. I n
November, Augusto Pmochet was charged and placed
under house arrest. The charges agamst him included
the murder of 1 19 people and the "disappearance" of 15
others m 1975 as part of "Operation Colombo". Other
charges mcluded homicide, torture, kidnapping, money
laundering, tax evasion and falsifying documents. This
was the first time prosecutors m Chile had successfully
cleared all the legal hurdles and indicted him.
I n January the Supreme Court put a time limit of Six
months on judicial investigations into "disappearances"
and other human rights violations by the mil itary
government, but suspended the rulmg in May. This
allowed investigation to continue into more than 150
cases of human rights violations.
In J une, five former secret service agents were
acqUitted under the 1978 Amnesty Law of involvemen t
in the "disappearance" of Diana Ar6n SVigilsky in 1974.
Although the Amnesty Law - introduced by military

under internatio nal law, it was invoked to absolve the
accused.

Limited legal and judicial reforms did little to
improve human rights protection. Tens of thousands
of people continued to be detained in violation of
their human rights and were at risk of torture or ill­
treatment. Thousands of people were sentenced to
death or executed. The authorities frequently
resorted to the use of force agai nst growing socia l
unrest. There was a renewed crackdown on the media
a nd I nternet controls were tightened. The Uighur
community in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous
Region (XUAR) continued to face severe repression
as pa rt of the authorities' "war on terror". Freedom of
expression and religion continued to be severely
restricted in Tibet and other Tibetan areas. China's
a rms sales to Sudan raised concerns that its actions
were contri buting to human rights violations in other
countries. China continued a limited dia logue with
selected members of the international commu nity on
human rights issues. However, human rights
defenders at home continued to be arbitrarily
detained and some were sentenced to prison terms.
International community
Uncontrolled arms exports from China continued to
fuel massive human rights violations in Sudan. The
Chinese government opposed the strengthening of the
UN Security Council arms embargo on Sudan.
The European Union (EU) resisted lobbying from the
Chinese government to lift its arms embargo on China.
Imposed after the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in June 1989.
The government continued to engage with UN human
rights mechanisms. although It largely failed to
implement their recommendations. The UN High

Rapporteur on torture visited China in August and
November. In September. China and the Russian

protection for the interests of petitioners but these

I n formal networks of rights defenders publicly
lobbied the authorities and the international
community about various abuses. However. the
authorIties continued to use broadly defined national
security offences to prosecute and imprison activists,
including lawyers. petitioners and housing rights
advocates. Civil society organizations continued to
grow in number and effectiveness. However. controls
were tightened to curtail the activities of those who
challenged official poliCies.
U Hou Wenzhuo. director of the non-governmental
Empowerment and Rights I nstitute. was subjected to
numerous abuses in connection with her human rights
activities. Including eviction from her home and office
in Beijing and arbitrary detention by the police in
southern China. Her work i ncluded investigating
reports of illegal land expropriation from farmers in
Foshan. Guangdong province. She fled China i n
October in fear of further arbitrary detention by
the police.

Journalists and Internet users
The authorities became increasingly intolerant of
reporting which covered sensitive issues or questioned
government policies. There was a renewed crackdown
on journalists and the media. Those reporting on
senSitive issues or who challenged the status quo were
at risk of dismissal. arbitrary detention or
imprisonment. Broadly defined "state secrets" offences
continued to be used to prosecute journalists and
reporters. Restrictions on I nternet use were tightened
and dozens of people remained behind bars for
accessing or circulating politically sensitive
information on-line.
a Journalist Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in
prison in April for leaking "state secrets". He had posted
to an overseas website Communist Party instructions
on how Journalists should handle the 15th anniversary
of the crackdown on the 1989 pro-democracy
movement.

Despite ongoing reforms to the Household
Registration (Hukou) System. m igrants from rural to

sentenced to three years In prison in October for
"disrupting public order" when he travelled to Beljing in
January In an attempt to commemorate deceased
former Premier Zhao Ziyang.

Violence against women
Despite laws prohibiting such practices, many women
continued to be subjected to forced abortions and
stertlizations by local authorities attempting to comply
with strict famtly planning policies.
Prohibition of sex identification of foetuses
appeared to have little effect on the sex Imbalance.
Trafftcklng In women and chi ldren, especially girls,
continued to be reported.
Some provinces adopted regulations aimed at
preventing domestic violence but abuses reportedly
remained widespread.
Women in detention remained at risk of sexual abuse
and other forms of torture or ill-treatment.
In August the authorities amended the Law on the
Protection of Women's Rights and Interests specifically
to prohibit sexual harassment of women and
strengthen women's rights to lodge complaints.
9 Chen Guangcheng, a blind, self-trained lawyer, was
harassed, beaten and arbitrarily detained at his home
in September after he attempted to sue the local
authorities In Llnyi city, Shandong province, for
conducting forced stertlizations and abortions In
pursUIt of birth quotas. He remained held at the end of
the year.
Repression of spiritual and religious groups
Religious observance outside official channels
remained tightly circumscribed. In March, the
authorities promulgated a new Regulation on Religious
Affairs aimed at strengthening offtcial controls on
religiOUS activities.
The crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual
movement was renewed in April. A Beijlng offiCial
clartfied that since the group had been banned as a
"heretical organization", any activities linked to Falun
Gong were illegal. Many Falun Gong practitioners
reportedly remained in detention where they were at
high risk of torture or ill-treatment.
Unregistered Catholics and Protestants associated
with unofficial house churches were also harassed,
arbltrartly detained and imprisoned.
'=51 In November, prominent defence lawyer Gao
Zhlsheng was forced to close down his law firm for a
year after he refused to withdraw an Open Letter to the
President and Premier calling on the authorities to
respect religious freedom and to stop the "barbariC"
persecution of Falun Gong. The order came shortly after
he had filed an appeal on behalf of underground
Protestant pastor Cai Zhuohua who had been sentenced
to three years in prison for illegally printing bibles.
Death pena lty
The death penalty continued to be used extensively
and arbitrarily, at times as a result of political
Interference. People were executed for non-violent
crtmes such as tax fraud and embezzlement as well as
90

drug offences and Violent Crtmes. Based on public
reports available, AI estimated that at least 1,770 people
were executed and 3,900 people were sentenced to
death during the year, although the true figures were
believed to be much higher.
Several miscarriages of justice in death penalty cases
published in the Chinese press in the first half of the
year caused considerable public disquiet and increased
momentum towards reform. In September, a senior
Supreme Court official announced that the Court was
establishing three branch courts to review death
sentences. Previously this had been delegated to lower
courts, redUCing safeguards against unfair proceedings.
OffiCials anticipated that the reform would lead to a 30
per cent reduction in executions. However, national
statistics on death sentences and executions remained
claSSified as a state secret, making analysis and
monitoring of the death penalty problematic.
a Wang Binyu, a migrant worker from Gansu, was
sentenced to death in Nxia in June for stabbing to
death his foreman and three others during a violent
dispute about unpaid wages. He reportedly needed
the money to pay for an operation for his father. He
was executed in October despite calls for leniency
from academics and members of the public in the
Chinese media.

Torture, a rbitrary detention and unfa i r trials
Torture and ill-treatment continued to be reported in a
wide variety of state institutions. Common methods
Included kicking, beating, electric shocks, suspension
by the arms, shackling in painful pOSitions, and sleep
and food deprivation. Restricted access to the outside
world for detainees and a failure to establish effective
mechanisms for complaint and investigation continued
to be key factors al lowing the practice to flourish.
In May the authorities announced a pilot project
allowing police interrogation of criminal suspects in
front of video cameras and lawyers in three regions. In
July the authorities announced that they were
accelerating their campaign to prosecute police who
extract confeSSions through torture, adding that 1 , 924
offiCials had been prosecuted since the campaign was
launched in May 2004.
B Gao Rongrong, a Falun Gong practitioner, died in
custody in June after being detained in Longshan Re­
education through Labour facility in Shenyang,
Liaoning province. OffiCials had reportedly beaten her
in 2004, including by using electro-shock batons on her
face and neck, which caused severe blistering and
eyesight problems, after she was discovered reading
Falun Gong materials in the faci lity.
A proposed new Law on the Rectification of I l legal
Behaviour was reported ly being discussed by
legislators as a replacement for Re-education through
Labour - a system of administrative detention used to
detain hundreds of thousands of people for up to four
years without charge or trial. OffiCials indicated that
the new law would probably reduce terms of
detention. However, elements that contravene
International fair trial standards potentially remain
unchanged.

A campaign aimed at improving the conduct of the
police and eradicating torture was initiated, but few
efforts were made to Introduce the fundamental legal
and institutional reforms necessary to prevent such
abuses in practice.
People accused of political or criminal offences
continued to be denied due process. Detainees' access
to lawyers and family members continued to be
severely restricted and trials fell far short of
international fair trial standards. Those charged with
offences related to state secrets or terrorism had their
legal rights restricted and were tried in camera.

North Korean asylum-seekers
People continued to flee across the border into China
to escape the acute food shortages in North Korea.
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of North Koreans were
arrested and forcibly returned by the Chinese
authorities who considered them to be economic
migrants and denied them access to any refugee
determination procedures, in breach of the UN Refugee
Convention. Unconfirmed reports suggested that at
least five South Korean nationals of North Korean
origin were abducted in China and forcibly taken to
North Korea.
Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR)
The authorities continued to use the global "war on
terror" to justify harsh repression in the XUAR,
resulting in serious human rights violations against the
ethnic Uighur community.
While China's latest "strike-hard" campaign against
crime had subsided In most parts of the country, it was
officially renewed in the XUAR in May to eradicate
"terrorism, separatism and religious extremism".
Repression resulted in the closure of unofficial
mosques and arrests of imams.
Uighur nationalists, including peaceful activists,
continued to be detained or imprisoned. Those charged
with serious "separatist" or "terrorist" offences were at
risk of lengthy imprisonment or execution. Those
attempting to pass information abroad about the
extent of the crackdown faced arbitrary detention and
imprisonment.
The authorities continued to accuse Uighur activists
of terrorism without providing credible evidence for
such charges.
a Rebiya Kadeer, a prisoner of conscience released
in March, became a key target in an apparent attempt
to counter her influence as a Uighur activist abroad.
a Writer Nurmuhemmet Yasin was sentenced to 10
years' imprisonment in a closed trial in February after
he published a short story entitled "Wild Pigeon" about
a trapped bird that commits suicide in captivity ­
apparently seen by the authorities as an allegory for
Uighurs living in China.
Tibet Autonomous Region and other
ethnic Tibetan areas
Freedom of religion, expression and association
continued to be severely restricted and arbitrary
arrests and unfair trials continued. Some prisoners of

a Tashi Gyaltsen and four other monks were assigned
to between two and three years' Re-education through
Labour in Xillng, Qinghai province, in February for
publishing a newsletter which contained poems and
articles deemed to be politically sensitive.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
In April the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal
overturned all remaining convictions against eight
Falun Gong practitioners for obstructing and assaulting
the police during a demonstration in March 2002. Some
charges against them had already been quashed on
appeal in 2004.
In September, the Coroner's Court's verdict on the
death of Kim Shuk-ying and her two daughters at the
hands of her husband accelerated the process of
revising the Domestic Violence Ordinance, which
narrowly defines domestic violence as physical
violence between couples.
Human rights activists protested against a deciSion
by the Hong Kong authorities to commission the Society
for Truth and Light, a conservative Christian group
which opposes gay rights and "excessive use" of human
rights, to educate school teachers on human rights and
anti-discrimination.
Police used pepper spray, tear-gas and bean-bag
rounds against protesters during ministerial meetings
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December,
prompting accusations by human rights mOnitors of
excessive use of force. More than 1,000 protesters were
detained, and several claimed to have been ill-treated
in police custody. All were later released, but 14 were
charged with unlawful assembly and released on bail .
Their trial had n o t taken place b y the end of the year.
a William Leung, a 20-year-old gay man, successfully
chal lenged a law which prohibits sex between
consenting men under 21. A court of first instance ruled

appeal against the ruling, but the appeal had not been
heard by the end of the year.

Although the number of killings and kidnappings in
some parts of the country fell, serious human rights
a buses committed by all pa rties to the conflict
rema ined at critical levels, Of pa rticular concern were
reports of extrajudicial executions carried out by the
security forces, killings of civilians by a rmed
opposition groups a nd paramilitaries, a nd the forced
displacement of civilian communities, Paramilitaries
who had supposedly demobilized u nder the terms of a
controversial law ratified in July continued to commit
human rights violations, while a rmed opposition
groups continued to commit serious and widespread
breaches of international humanitaria n law.
I ndividuals who may have been responsible for war
crimes and crimes against humanity were not brought
to justice.
Background
President A lvaro Uribe ratified the j ustice and Peace
Law on 22 ju l y. The law, which prOVides a legal
framework for the demobilization of members of
paramilitary and armed opposition groups, fails to
respect international standards on the right of victims
to truth, Justice and reparation and threatened to
exacerbate Colombia's endemic problem of Impunity.
By the end of 2005, negotiatIOns between the
government and the paramilitary umbrella
organization, the United Self-Defence Forces of
Colombia (Autodefensas Unldas de Colombia, AUC), led
to the reported "demobilization" of more than half of
the country's estimated 20,000 AUC-linked
paramilitaries. However, paramilitaries In supposedly
demobilized areas continued to commit Violations, and
evidence of links between paramilitaries and the
security forces remained strong. There were also fears
that government poliCies designed to reintegrate
members of illegal armed groups Into Civilian life risked
recycling them into the conflict.
Efforts to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the
main armed opposition group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas
92

Revoluclonanas de Colombia, FARC), failed to achieve
concrete results. However, "talks about talks" With the
smaller National liberation Army (Ejercito de
liberaClon NaclOnal. ELN) resumed In December. The
FARC and ELN were responsible for senous and
widespread breaches of international humanitarian
law, especially kldnappings, hostage-taking and killings
of civi lians.
On I Apnl, Colombia ratified the Inter-American
Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons

The Justice and Peace Law: paramilitary
demobilization
The justice and Peace Law grants significantly reduced
prison sentences to members of il legal armed groups
under Investigation for human nghts abuses who agree
to demobilize. Although most of the beneficianes were
expected to be paramilitanes, by the end of 2005 the
law had reportedly only been applied to around 30
alleged FARC prisoners. Because of the problem of
impunity, few members of I llegal armed groups were
under investigation for human rights offences. Most
demobilized paramilitaries thus benefited from de
facto amnesties granted under Decree 128,
promulgated in 200).
The j ustice and Peace Law gives JudiCial
Investigators strict time limits to investigate each
case, With little Incentive for potential beneficiaries
to collaborate with investigators. The partiCipation of
victims in legal proceedings IS limited, and there are
no provisions to expose third parties, such as the
security forces, who have played an integral part in
coordinating human nghts Violations carried out by
paramil itanes.
The law was criticized by the Office in Colombia of
the UN High CommiSSioner for Human Rights, and the
Inter-Amencan Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)
and Inter-American Court of Human Rights of the
Organization of American States (OAS).
All paramilitaries were supposed to demobilize by
the end of 2005. However, the process stalled in
October after the government transferred paramilitary
leader Diego Fernando Munllo Bejarano, alias "Don
Berna", to prison for his alleged Involvement In the 10
April killing of legislator Orlando Benitez, and over
rumours about his pOssible extradition to the USA on
drug-trafficking charges. The demobilization process
resumed in December after an agreement was reached
In November between the government and the AUC
extending the tlmescale for demobilization.
More than 2, 750 killings and "disappearances"
were attn buted to paramil ltanes between the
announcement by the AUC of a ceasefire in 2002 and
the end of 2005. Because of its limited mandate, the
M ission to Support the Peace Process I n Colombia,
set up by the OAS in 2004 to venfy the ceasefire,
could not take action aga inst parami l ltaries who
fai led to abide by the ceasefire nor comment on
government policy.
The government encouraged demobilized
paramilitaries to work In Intelligence-related activities,
such as the Civilian informer network, as auxil iaries In

secunty force operations, as "civic police", and as
pnvate security guards. ThiS raised fears that the
mechanisms that led to the creation of paramilitary
groups were being replicated and threw into doubt the
government's commitment to reintegrate combatants
fully into civilian life.
There were reports that paramilitary groups were
still recruiting members after they had supposedly
demobilized. On 25 August, the IACHR wrote to the
government asking for clarification of reports that
paramllitaries were still recruiting minors In Medellln,
despite having supposedly demobilized in 2003There were numerous reports of human rights
violations committed by paramilitaries in areas where
they had supposedly demobilized, including Medellfn,
and eVidence of collusion between paramilitaries and
the security forces.
t9 On 29 january, paramilltaries reportedly kil led
seven peasant farmers in El Vergel, San Carlos
Municipality, Antioquia Department. l'1embers of the
armed forces were allegedly patrolling In El Verge I from
26 to )1 january. just before the killings, the army had
reportedly been searching for one of the victims, who
they labelled a subversive.
"l On 9 j uly, paramilitaries al legedly killed six
civilians in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca Department.
The police, who had been patrolling the area,
reportedly withdrew hours before the killings. The
paramilitary group, the Calima Bloc (Bloque Calima),
which operated In Buenaventura, supposedly
demobilized in December 2004.

Impunity
Impunity for human nghts abuses remained the norm.
High-ranking military personnel, and paramilitary and
guerrilla leaders, continued to evade justice.
Action was taken In very few cases. I n july, an army
lieutenant, three soldiers and a civilian were formally
charged for the August 2004 killing of three trade
unionists in Arauca Department, while the Office of the
Attorney General ordered the arrest of six soldiers for
the killing In April 2004 of five civilians, including a
baby, in Cajamarca Municipality, Tolima Department.
However, criminal investigations into the possible
Involvement of more senior officers In these killings did
not advance.
In january, the Supreme Court dismissed a case
against former Rear Admiral Rodrigo OUlnonez
regarding his role in the 2001 Chengue massacre, in
which at least 26 people were kil led by paramilitanes,
operating in collusion with the armed forces. The
Procurator General's Office criticized this decision,
cal ling on the Office of the Attorney General to press
forward criminal investigations into the massacre.
On 15 September, the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights ruled that the Colombian state must pay
compensation to the families of 49 peasant farmers
kil led by paramilitanes in 1997 In Mapiripan, Meta
Department. Paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso,
now officially demobilized, and several army officials,
including retired general Jalme Humberto UscategUl,
have been impl icated in the killings.
Amnesty International Report 2006

The military Justice system continued to claim
jurisdiction over cases of potential human rights
violations committed by members of the security
forces, despite the 1997 ruling of the Constitutional
Court that such cases must be Investigated by the
civilian justice system.
o In Apnl, the military justice system absolved 12
army soldiers of responsibility in the killing of seven
police officers and four civilians in Guaitarilla
Municipality, Nanr'lo Department, in March 2004.

Kills by the security forces
There were continuing reports of extrajudiCial
executions by the security forces, with some estimates
suggesting at least 100 fatalities. These killings were
often falsely described as "guerrillas killed in combat".
Although the military Justice system claimed
jurisdiction over most such cases, and then archived
many of them, the civilian justice system was
sometimes able to Intervene.
d I n july, the Office of the Attorney General ordered
the arrest of eight soldiers for the killing of Reinel
Antonio Escobar Guzman and brothers juvenal and
Mario Guzman Sepulveda in Dabeiba MUnicipality,
Antioquia Department, on 8 May. The army had a lleged
that the three men were FARC guerrillas killed In
combat.
Civilians were reportedly killed by the police anti­
not Unit (Escuadron Movil Antidlsturbios, ESMAD)
during protests. ESMAD agents carry no vIsible
individual identification.
o On I May, at least eight ESMAD agents al legedly
beat 15-year-old Nlcolas David Neira during a May Day
march In Bogota. A week later he died of his Injuries,
a On 22 September, j hony Silva Aranguren died and
several other students were injured after a llegedly
being shot by ESMAD agents during a protest at a
university In Cali.
Abuses by armed opposition groups
On 12 September, ELN leader Gerardo Bermudez, alias
Francisco Galan, was released from prISon for a limited
penod to help restart the peace process. As a result,
exploratory talks between government and ELN
representatives took place In Cuba from 16 to 22
December.
The FARC and ELN continued to commit serious and
repeated breaches of international humanitarian law,
including hostage-taking and civilian killings.
d On 15 August, the ELN kil led two priests and two
other civilians on the Teorema-Convencion highway in
Norte de Santander Department.
"9 On 2) August, the FARC allegedly killed 14 peasant
farmers in Palomas, Valdivia MUnicipality, AntlOqUla
Department.
The FARC also carried out disproportionate and
indiscnminate attacks which resulted in the deaths of
numerous civilians.
a On 20 February, three civilians and three soldiers
died, and I) civilians and II soldiers were Injured, when
a bomb exploded In a hotel in Puerto Toledo, Meta
Department.

o On 3 October, a bomb killed three members of a n
indigenous community, including two children, i n
Florida Municipality, Valle d e l Cauca Department.

Violence against women
Women and girls continued to be killed, tortured and
kidnapped by both sides in the conflict.
o On 24 May, a woman and her husband were
detained by the army in Saravena Municipality, Arauca
Department. The woman was reportedly handed over
to a paramilitary who raped her.
o On 9 August, an indigenous woman was allegedly
raped by a soldier in Coconuco, Cauca Department.
o The body of Angela Diosa Correa Borja was found
on 15 September in San Jose de Apartad6, Antioquia
Department. She had a llegedly been killed by the FARC
after they accused her of collaborating with the police.
Kidnappings
I n November, the government announced plans to set up
an "international commission" to help negotiate the
release of FARC hostages. However, repeated
speculation about a possible prisoner exchange failed to
yield results by the end of 2005. The FARC and ELN
continued to hold numerous hostages, including high­
profile politicians such as former presidential candidate
lngrid Betancourt, kidnapped by the FARC in 2002. There
were more than 751 kidnappings in 2005, compared to
1,402 in 2004, of which 27) were reportedly carried out by
armed opposition groups and 49 by paramilitaries.
Responsibility could not be attributed in 208 cases.
o On 23 january, the ELN allegedly kidnapped
community leader Hector Bastidas in Samaniego
Municipality, Narino Department. He had not been
released by the end of 2005.
o On 31 March, the FARC kidnapped five human rights
activists working with the Afro-descendant
communities of jiguamiand6 and Curvarad6 in Choc6
Department. They were released on 8 April.
o On 30 August, paramilitaries abducted at least 1 1
children and I ) adults i n E l Carmen Municipality, Norte
de Santander Department, during an attack in which
three people were killed and a woman was allegedly
sexually abused. The 24 were subsequently released.
Paramilitary units operating in this region supposedly
demobilized at the end of 2004.
Attacks on civilians
Civilians continued to bear the brunt of the conflict, with
trade unionists, human rights defenders and community
activists, as well as indigenous, Afro-descendant and
displaced communities, and those living in areas of
Intense conflict, at particular risk. At least 70 trade
unionists and seven human rights defenders were killed
in 2005. At least 1,050 civilians were killed or
"disappeared" in non-combat situations during the first
half of 2005.
More than 310,000 civilians were internally displaced
in 2005, compared to 287,000 in 2004. Economic
blockades imposed by combatants and clashes
between the parties to the conflict created serious
humanitarian crises in different parts of the country.

94

o About 1 , 300 members of the Awa indigenous
community were forced to flee their homes in June
because of clashes between the army and FARC in
Narino Department.
The Peace Communi ty of San Jose de Apartad6,
Antioquia Department, which insists on the right of
civilians not to be drawn into the conflict, was again
attacked. Over 150 of its members have "disappeared"
or been killed Since 1997, mostly by paramilitaries and
the security forces, but also by the FARe. On 21
February, eight community members, including
community leader Luis Eduardo Guerra, were kil led by
men who witnesses claimed were army troops. The
community has often been labelled as subverSive by the
army and paramilitaries, while the FARC accuses it of
siding with its enemies. On 20 March, PreSident Uribe
publicly accused some Peace Community leaders of
being FARC auxiliaries.
Members of the jiguamiand6 and Curvarad6 Afro­
descendant communities also continued to be
threatened by the security forces and the
paramilitaries.
o On 24 October, the body of Afro-descendant
activist Orlando Valencia was found in Chirigorod6
Municipality, Antioquia Department. He had been
abducted by al leged paramilitaries on 15 October, hours
after being detained by police who accused him of
being a FARC member.
Clashes resulting from attacks by the FARC on 14 and
17 April against security force units in the indigenous
community ofToribio, Cauca Department, resulted in
the death of IO-year-old Yanson Trochez Pavi, and
injuries to 19 civilians. The FARC reportedly used gas
cylinders in the attacks, while the security forces
allegedly used aerial strafing in their response.

Freedom of expression
Freedom of expression was undermined by continued
threats, kidnappings and killings of journalists.
o On 11 january, journalist julio Palacios Sanchez was
killed by unknown assailants in CLicuta, Norte de
Santander Department.
o On 20 February, the FARC detonated a car bomb
outside the Cali headquarters of the RCN television and
radio station, injuring two people.
o On 16 May, journalists Hollman Morris, Carlos
Lozano and Daniel Coronell, who have repeatedly
denounced human rights violations by paramilitaries,
received death threats in the form of funeral wreaths.
US military aid
In 2005, US assistance to Colombia was some US$ 781
million, with military aid accounting for around 80 per
cent of the total. The US Congress again required that
the US Secretary of State certify progress in speCific
human rights categories before the final 25 per cent
could be transferred. Given the lack of progress on
several human rights categories, the US State
Department withheld its certification for several
months before granting it. US financial assistance to the
paramilitary demobi lization process was approved,
albeit with certain human rights conditions. In August,
Amnesty International Report 2006

CO N

the State Department announced it would cease
security assistance to the XVII Brigade of the Colombian
army, due to accusations of human rights violations,
including the February killings in San Jose de Apartad6.
Assistance was not to be renewed until the accusations
were "credibly addressed".

Intergovernmental orga nizations
The UN Commission on Human Rights expressed
concern at violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law, recognizing the responsibility of
armed opposition groups, paramilitaries and the
security forces. It deplored report� of extrajudicial
executions attributed to members of the security forces
and other public servants and reports of arrests and
mass searches carried out without appropriate legal
foundations. It also expressed concern about collusion
of state agents with paramilitaries. It condemned
violence against women committed by all parties to the
conflict and the impunity which prevailed.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC O F TH E CONGO
Head of state and government: J oseph Kabila
Death penalty: retentionist
International Criminal Court: ratified
UN Women's Convention: ratified
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: not signed

Slow progress was made in building security, justice
and respect for human rights after nea rly a decade of
wa r. Tens of thousa nds of people died in continuing
conflict or from preventable disease and starvation.
Extrajudicial executions a nd other unlawful killings,
arbitrary a rrests, unlawful detentions, acts of torture
or il l-treatment, and life-threatening prison
conditions were reported across the country. The
security forces used indiscriminate or excessive force
to break up political protests. Ethnic tensions were
ma nipu lated for political ends in politically or
militarily strategic areas, i ncluding Katanga and
North-Kivu provinces. Insecurity persisted in eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo ( D RC), where war
crimes were committed by Congolese a rmed factions
and foreign armed g roups from Rwa nda and
Uganda, including unlawful killings, rape, torture
and the use of child sold iers. The government and the
international community largely failed to address
the i mmense humanita ria n needs of a population
brought a bout by insecurity, displacement and lack
of access to huma nitarian a nd medical care.
Background
The transitional power-sharing government, created in
200) and including members of the former government,
major armed groups, opposition political parties and
civil society, made little progress towards unification
and a tranSition to democratic rule. Serious delays in
the passing of electoral laws and the organization of
elections planned for June 2005 resulted in the
transition being extended to June 2006.
Factionalism and mistrust within the government
contnbuted to continued tension and occasional
armed conflict between military units supposed to be
part of a unified national army. I ntegrating tens of
thousands of members of former armed groups and the
former army into the new army started in early 2005, as
did the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
into civilian life of tens of thousands of other fighters.
Former belligerents remained reluctant to dismantle
their military structures, and Integration was reSisted
in some areas. In North-Kivu hundreds of soldiers
deserted before being persuaded to return to their
units. The integration process was under-resourced,
with no or minimal payment of salaries, and insufficient
supplies of food, water and medical equipment to
integration sites. Coordination was poor between the
integration of fighters into the new army, led by the
95

CO N

mil itary, and the reintegration of demobilized fighters
Into CIvilian life, led by a civilian government body.
Projects to support re-entry Into civilian life, involving
thousands of child soldiers, were stIli not fully
IdentIfied or functional. In I turi, a voluntary
Disarmament and Community Reinsertion programme
had disarmed over 12,500 combatants from former
armed groups by the end of 2005 out of an estimated,
but disputed, total of 15,000. However, most
communIty projects to facilitate reInsertion Into
civilian life were considerably delayed or not
undertaken at all, leavIng thousands of demobilized
militia members without access to alternative forms of
employment . Thousands of other combatants, opposed
to demobilization, were stili at large.
The peacekeepIng force of the UN Organization
MIssion In the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUC), with only some 16,000 troops at the end of
200';, continued to be overstretched. The governments
of Uganda and Rwanda allegedly continued to channel
support to armed groups, or factions of armed groups,
that opposed the transitional government.

Unlawful kills
All armed forces and groups were responsible for
unlawful kIlls, which were reported on an almost
daily basis.
Government security forces used excessive and
sometimes lethal force to break up public
demonstrations. In January, scores of people in Kinshasa
were kIlled or seriously Injured by army and polIce UnIts
dunng protests at the postponement of the elections.
On 30 June, the notIonal end date of the transition,
10 protesters In a number of cities were reportedly shot
dead by the securi ty forces.

North-Kivu
Armed groups that faIled to engage in the milItary
Integration process continued to commit almost dally
kIlls and other grave human rights abuses in North­
KIVU, particularly in Rutshuru territory. Information
emerged that hundreds of civilians had been killed,
raped or tortured In Nyablondo, in Maslsi territory, and
Buramba, in Rutshuru territory, in December 2004,
folloWIng fightIng between rIVal forces not integrated
into the new army. Many abuses appeared to be
ethnically motivated.

South-Kivu
Thousands of ciVIlIans were kIlled, raped and abducted,
and child soldiers contInued to be used, especially In
the Walungu and Kabare territones of South-Klvu
where Rwandan insurgents operated
� On 9 and 10 July around 40 civilIans, mainly women
and chIldren, were killed In Ntulumamba locality,
reportedly by a group of armed Rwandan fighters.
Government forces were also responsible for
killIngs, rapes and lootIng dunng counter-insurgency
operations.

Ituri
Despite a significant Improvement In secunty around
Bunla town, the ltun district was still affected by
Violence. On 25 February, nine UN peacekeepers were
kil led In Kafe. a region believed to be the stronghold of

96

several ethniC and polItical armed mIlitias. Murder,
rape and looting by the militias drove over 80,000
Civilians from their homes to camps for the internally
displaced, despite the presence of three Integrated
army brigades in parallel or joint securIty operations
With MONUC forces.

Katanga
Katanga prOVInce experienced heightened InstabIlity
and a sharp increase In kIllings, rapes, abductions and
looting, maInly by mayi-mayi militia. In the north,
frequent fightIng between maYI-mayi and government
forces resulted in massive population displacement.
Dunng an ethnic and political leadership contest, at
least 65 people were detaIned Incommunica do In Apnl
and May by military Intel ligence agents In connection
with an al leged secession plot. A number were
reportedly tortured or severely ill-treated Most were
released without charge. Others were still in detention
In Kinshasa at the end of 2005.

Violence aga inst women
Large numbers of women and girls contInued to be
subjected to rape and other forms of sexual Violence by
government forces and armed groups. In eastern DRC,
girls under five and women over 70 were not spared.
Rape was sometimes committed in front of the victim's
chi ldren, family or community, and was often
accompanied by other extreme forms of torture. In
some cases, the girl or woman was kIlled or deliberately
wounded. Few rape survivors had access to appropriate
medical care.
'iJ Bltombo Nyumba, a 56-year-old widow and mother
of four children, died from her injunes and inadequate
medical treatment in June 2005 after seven soldiers
tortured and raped her in Flzl territory, South-Kivu.
Attacks on human rights defenders
In most areas the authorities remained hostile to
human rights defenders. A number of prominent
defenders were physically attacked, il legally detained
or threatened.
9 Pascal Kabungulu, Executive Secretary of the
human rights organization, Heirs of Justice (Hentlers de
la Justice), was shot dead by three armed men on 31 July
at his home in Bukavu, South-Kivu. An official
commission of Inquiry failed to report ItS findIngs, and
no suspected perpetrators had been brought to justice
by the end of 2005.
Tortu re and ill-treatment
Torture and Ill-treatment contInued of detainees In the
custody of the milItary, police and other security
forces It was frequently faci litated by the use of
incommunicado detention. Among practices reported
were sustaIned beatings, often with sticks, lengths of
metal or rifle-butts; death threats or mock executIons;
prolonged suspension by the arms or legs from walls or
doors; and the forCing of detaInees to stare for long
periods Into strong sunlIght.
Conditions in many prisons and detention centres,
which were often overcrowded, insanitary and Iife­
threatenIng, amounted to cruel, Inhuman or degradIng

CO N

treatment. Deaths from malnutrition or untreated
medical conditions were common. In some prisons, little
effort was made adequately to separate children from
adult Inmates, or women from men. In many cases
detainees were refused access to lawyers, family
members or medical care, especial ly In pre·trial
detention.

Impunity and lack of access to justice
Despite systematic violations of human nghts, hardly
any suspected perpetrators were brought to justice No
effort was made to exclude Individuals suspected of
grave human nghts abuses from the new army, and
people allegedly responsible for crimes under
international law and other human rights abuses
assumed key positions In the army and transitional
institutions.
Victims of human rights abuses were blocked from
pursuing legal action against the perpetrators by
fai lings In the Justice system. Few had the confidence
I n the system to lodge a legal complaint They had to
pay for the costs of summons and court proceedings.
Authorities failed to protect victims and witnesses
from Intimidation or repnsals. Rape surVivors, many
of them l iVing I n the same communities or areas as
their attackers, were particularly affected by the lack
of access to justice, and lived I n fear of further
assault
Justice offiCials operated with limited resources,
without office equipment or even baSIC legal texts.
Non-payment of police and judicial sa lanes had a
demoraliZing and corrupting effect. Pre trial detainees
langUished In pnsons for want of funds to bnng them to
tnal, including their transport to court Pol itical
Interference and pressure, sometimes accompanied by
threats or dismissal . were exerted on judges,
prosecutors and police officers.
Despite the Introduction In 2002 of a revised military
penal code, mil itary courts and tribunnls sometimes
failed to respect international fair trial standards. In
summary trials before such courts, defendants did not
have ful l or adequate legal representation.

In March argument over abolition of the death
penalty resurfaced during parliamentary debates on
the new natIOnal Constitution. An early draft of the
Constitution proposed abolition, but a majority In the
Senate and National Assembly rejected the change.

Repression of freedom of expression
In advance of national elections, and as dissatisfaction
with the tranSitional government grew, pol itically
motivated harassment and detentions were used in an
attempt to silence government critiCS. Members of
human nghts organizations, journalists and opposition
activists were arbitrarily detained for denounCing
human nghts Violations or criticizing the authorities.
More than 40 journalists were detained, and many were
charged with defamation. Others were threatened.
Journalist Franck Ngyke Kangundu and hiS wife were
shot dead In unexplained circumstances outSide their
home on 3 November. Dozens of opposition activists
and some high-profi le figures perceived as a political
threat were harassed or detained.

More than 20 people were a rrested in January and
Febru a ry in connection with an a lleged plot against
the government; more were a rrested later in the yea r.
Several of them were gra nted provisional release, but
most remained in custody without trial at the end of
the year. A trial of 1 5 serving members of the security
forces and a civilian charged with genocide a nd
crimes against huma nity ended in August. All 1 6
were acquitted, but the cou rt held the government
responsible for the "disa ppearance" of at least 80
returning refugees in 1 999.
Background
The 2003 peace agreement between the government
and the armed opposition National Resistance Council
(Conseil national de resistance, CNR) was not
implemented and armed clashes were reported. In
March the government announced a programme of
demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of
some 450 former CNR fighters but the armed group did
not participate.
There were reports during the year of looting and
lawlessness by CNR combatants. In one incident in
April they attacked a UN humanitarian delegation
visiting the Pool region and stole the delegates'
property. On 13 October, three gendarmes, two
policemen and a Chinese trader were killed during
clashes between members of the security forces and
CNR combatants in Brazzaville. The combatants were
occupying a house a llocated by the government to CNR
leader Fredenc Bitsangou as part of the 2003 peace
accord. On 19 October government forces attacked the
combatants and drove them out of Brazzavil le.
In July the Congolese Human Rights Observatory
(Observatoire congolais des drOlts de I'homme, OCDH),
a local independent human rights group, pulled out of
the government-sponsored National Human Rights
CommiSSion. The OCDH accused the Commission of
failing to act on human rights abuses and of lack of
independence.
Former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had
been sentenced to death in absentia in May 2000,
returned home in October to bury his wife. Parliament
granted him an amnesty in November.
Congo remained suspended from the Kimberley
process, which traces the ongin of diamonds, although
officials said that they were doing all they could to
rejoin the process.

98

I mpunity
In July the trial of 15 members of the security forces and
a civilian began before the Brazzaville criminal court.
The men were charged with genocide and crimes against
humanity for their al leged role in the "disappearance" in
mid-1999 of more than 350 refugees returning from the
neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo
(formerly Zaire). Members of the security services were
not suspended from their positions before or during the
trial. When the trial concluded in August, the court
found the state responsible for the "disappearance" of at
least 80 people but acquitted all the defendants on the
grounds that they bore no responsibility for the
"disappearances". The court failed to specify who had
carried out the "disappearances" but ordered the state
to pay unspeCified compensation to the families of the
victims. Local and international human rights
organizations expressed concern that the criminal court
had only pursued the case to prevent the trial of the
alleged perpetrators by an independent foreign court.
Detention without trial
In January, at least eight gendarmes and four civilians
accused of involvement in the theft of arms from
Bifouiti gendarmerie were arrested in Brazzavi lle and
detained at the headquarters of the Central Directorate
of Military Intelligence (Direction centrale des
renseignements militaires, DCRM).
In February, more than 20 members of the security
forces and civilians accused of plotting against the
government were arrested in POinte-Noire and
detained by the security services. They were

were allowed visits thereafter.
I n September they were charged with endangering
the security of the state. They had not been tried by the
end of the year. At least four of the detainees, including
Magoud Beconith Cotody and Jean Romain Tsiba, were

COTE D' IVO I R E
REPUBLIC OF COTE O'IVOIRE
Head of state: Laurent Gbagbo
Head of government: Charles Konan Banny (replaced
Seydou Diarra i n December)
Death penalty: abolitionist for all crimes
I nternational Criminal Court: signed
UN Women's Convention: ratified
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: n ot signed

The postponement of presidential elections in
October, despite intense di plomatic efforts by the
African Union and pressu re from the UN a nd the
internationa l community, resulted in political
deadlock. In Oecember a transitional government
and prime minister were a ppoi nted. A resu mption of
hostilities was averted by international efforts to
find a peaceful solution to the crisis a nd the presence
of 1 0,000 peacekeeping troops. Both government
security forces and the New Forces ( Forces
Nouvelles), a political coalition of former a rmed
opposition groups in control ofthe north, continued
to com mit human rights a buses. People suspected of
supporting the opposition forces were reportedly
killed in the custody of the security forces. The death
of a foreign national deta ined by opposition forces
was bel ieved to be the result of torture or other ill­
treatment. l nter-ethnic tensions were stirred up by
xenophobic propaganda. No progress was made in
demobilizing forces under the peace process.
Freedom of expression was under consta nt attack by
both sides.
Background
In February a pro-government militia attacked a New
Forces position in the first renewal of hostilities since
forces loyal to President Laurent Gbagbo bombed
rebel-held towns in November 2004, shattering an IB­
month ceasefire,
In Apri l, following mediation by South Africa's
President Thabo Mbeki, both sides signed an
agreement ( Pretoria I ) declaring an official end to the
war, and pledged to demobilize, disarm and
reintegrate all forces enl isted since the start of the
insurgency in September 2002. Fol lowing ethnic
clashes in the west in May and June, all the parties
further agreed in J une ( Pretoria 1 1) to African Union
sanctions against forces that failed to implement
peace agreements, In July, President Gbagbo adopted
legal amendments identified in the peace accords as
pre-conditions for presidential elections i n October,
but the New Forces and other opposition parties
claimed the amendments were not in line with the
Pretoria agreements,
In July tensions Increased after attacks by
unidentified armed groups on guard posts in two towns
close to Abidjan, the economic capital, in which at least
five military policemen were kil led, In August, General
Amnesty International Report 2006

Mathias Doue, a former Army Chief of Staff, threatened
to use "any means" to oust President Gbagbo, saying he
was an obstacle to peace,
In October, following postponement of the
presidential elections, the African Union proposed that
President Gbagbo remain In power until October 2006,
12 months beyond his term of office, while conditions
were created to hold fair elections, Under this
proposal, which was endorsed by the UN, a new Prime
Minister "acceptable to all lvorian parties" was
appointed in December as a result of the mediation of
Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria, Prime Minister Charles Konan
Banny and a new government that included members of
all lvonan political parties were appointed for a
transitional period until October 2006 to prepare
future presidential elections,
The UN Security Council and Secretary-General
continued to raise the possibi lity of sanctions against
those undermining the peace process, In October, after
a visit to Cote d'lvoire, the head of the UN Sanctions
Committee said that the international community
would impose "measures" against political factions if
they failed to reach a peace agreement.

Deaths in detention and unlawful killings
The security forces were responsible for the
extrajudicial execution of detainees suspected of
supporting the armed elements of the New Forces,
a In April , Samassi Abdramane, Toure Adama and
Nimba Kah Hyacinthe were arrested by the police on
suspicion of being "rebels", They were denied access to
their lawyer, although their families were able to visit
them at police headquarters in AbidJan some days after
their arrest. A few days later, their bodies were found In
the morgue at Anyama, 20km north of Abidjan, Despite
a judicial investigation, by the end of 2005 no
significant progress appeared to have been made in
identifying their killers,
a In J uly, following an attack by unidentified armed
men on police stations in the towns of Abgovi lle and
Anyama, the security forces arrested dozens of civilians
as suspects, A number were reported to have been
extrajudicially executed, including Kone Gaoussou, a
driver, and Diarra Laceny, an apprentice driver, No
investigation was known to have been opened into
these deaths,
Abuses by the New Forces
Armed New Forces units continued to be responsible
for human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention,
torture and ill-treatment.
a In March, Brian Hamish Sands, a New Zealand
national, was arrested on suspicion of being a
mercenary and detained Incommunicado in Bouake,
the New Forces stronghold. He died three weeks later,
according to the New Forces from natural causes,
However, autopsy findings appeared to exclude this
pOSSibility. Other reports suggested that he had been
tortured or might have committed SUICide, There was
no independent investigation into the circumstances
surrounding his death,

Also In March, some 35 men accused of being pro­
government fighters were arrested by the New Forces.
They were transferred to Korhogo, where they were
allegedly detaIned for months Incommun icado, without
charge or trtal and at rtsk of torture

Extrajudicial executions by French
peacekeeping forces
In May, soldIers of the French peacekeepin g force
Ltcorne kIl led Firmln Mahe, an alleged hIghway gang
leader wanted for murder and rape. He suffocated
whIle being transferred to hospItal on the road
between Bangolo and Man in the west In October,
three members of the French forces - including
General Henri Poncet, former commander of the
peacekeeping force - were suspended and
reprtmanded over their role In covering-up the killtng.
French Investigator s subsequent ly launched a mIlitary
Investlgatton and a criminal investigation into
voluntary manslaughter.
Ethnic clashes in the west of the country
In the west, antagontsm between the indIgenous
population and farmers from other regIons or
nelghbourtng countries such as Burklna Faso continued
to provoke ethnic clashes. XenophobiC rhetortc by
politIcians and the news medIa aggravated the conflict
, In May and June, more than a hundred people were
ki l ied, many WI th machetes and cudgels, In two
separate incIdents In Duekoue, 500km north-west of
AbldJan. The conflict took place In a region under
government rule, alongside the "confidence zone"
controlled by French soldIers and the peacekeeping
force of the UN OperatIOn In Cote d'lvoire (UNOCI).

Freedom of expression under attack
Journalists and media organizatio ns were harassed and
attacked by the security forces and pro government
mti itlas.
f � In July, members of the Young Patriots (Jeunes
Patriotes), a loosely defined movement profeSSing
support for PresIdent Gbagbo, destroyed copIes of
opposItIo n newspapers including Le Patriotea nd Le
Nouveau Reveil.

'I Also In July, the National Counctl for RadIO and
TelevisIo n Broadcas ting suspended broadcasts of RadIO
France Internationale in Cote d' lvoire, and accused the
station of unprofessIO nal and bIased coverage Its
broadcasts were stIli suspended at the end of 200S.

"not working In the Interests of the country".

Demobilization at a sta ndstill
The stalling of the demoblltzation, disarmament and
reintegratIon programme constituted one of the most
obvious faIlures of the peace process. An estimated
50,000 combatants enltsted since the start of the
insurgency In September 2002 were supposed to enter
the programme, They Included armed elements of the
New Forces, pro-government mIlitia members, and
women and child soldiers. However, none of the
measures anticipated In the tImetable had been
implemented by the end of 2005, in particular the
preparatIon of sItes designated for demobIlized
combatants. The main obstacle to progress appeared to
be a lack of mutual confidence between the
government and the New Forces leadershIp.

The legacy of the 1 991 -95 war continued to
overshadow human rights in Croatia, Many of those
responsible for human rights violations during the
confl ict continued to evade justice. The Croatian
judicial system failed to address wartime human
rights violations, rega rdless of the ethnicity of the
victi ms or ofthe perpetrators. Of at least 300,000
Croatian Serbs displaced by the conflict,
approximately 1 20,000 were officially registered as
having returned home,

Background
In March the European Union (EU) Council decided to
postpone the beginning of accession talks, because of
the failure of the Croatlan authonties to fully co-operate
with the I nternational Cnmlnal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia. In October, after the Tribunal's Prosecutor
assessed that Croatia was fully co-operating with the
Tribunal, the EU Council decided to open membership
talks with Croatia. The EU Council agreed that less than
full co-operation with the Tribunal at anv stage would
affect the overall progress of the negotiatIOns and
could be grounds for their suspension
War crimes and crimes against humanity
International prosecutions
\. i In December former Croatian Army General Ante
Gotovlna was arrested In Spain, apparently after the
Croatian authorities had provided the Tribunal with
Information on his whereabouts. He was subsequently
transferred to the Tnbunal's custody. Ante Gotovina
was indicted by the Tnbunal on seven counts:
persecution; murder - including the murder of at least
1 50 Croatian Serbs; plunder; wanton destruction of
cities, towns and vil lages; deportation and forced
displacement; and other Inhumane acts.
i In January Pavle Strugar, a former lieutenant­
General in the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska
narodna armlja, J NA), was sentenced to eight years'
impnsonment for his role In attacks on civilians and
the destruction of cultural property during the
shel ling of Dubrovnik's Old Town in December 1 9 9 1 .
\.i In February the Tnbunal i nd icted Momcilo Pensic,
former JNA Chief of Staff, for war crimes and CrImes
against humanity committed during the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovlna (BiH), including
his al leged role in the shelling of Zagreb in 1 995.
t� In June the Tribunal Prosecutor withdrew her
appl ication to refer the "Vukovar Three" case to a
domestic jurisdiction in the former Yugoslavia, Citing
its highly senSitive nature and the fact that any
deCision to transfer it would provoke "deep
resentment in one or the other country considered for
the transfer". The accused, Mile Mrksic. Mlroslav
Radlc and Veselin S ljivanCanin, who remained in the
Tribuna l's custody, are all former J N A officers indicted
for their alleged involvement in the removal and
execution of more than 250 non-Serbs from Vukovar
hospital, after Vukovar fell to the JNA and Croatlan
Serb forces In 1 9 9 1 . The tnal started at the Tribunal
In October.
:'l In November the case of Rahim Ademl and M l rko
Norac was offiCially transferred to Croatia. The
Prosecution had requested the transfer in 2004. Mirko
Norac was already serving a pnson sentence in
Croatia after being convicted In 2003 by the Rljeka
County Court of war crimes agai nst non-Croat
civilians. The accused are former Croatian
Army commanders charged With crimes agai nst
humanity and war crimes, i ncluding murder and
persecutlOns, committed against Croatian Serbs
dUring military operations in the so-cal led "Medak
pocket" in 1993.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Domestic prosecutions
Trials for war cnmes and crimes against humanity
continued or started before local courts, often In
absentia. In some cases these trials did not meet
Internationally recognized standards of fairness. In
general, ethniC bias continued to affect the
investigation and prosecution by the Croatian Judiciary
of wartime human rights violations. There continued to
be widespread Impunity for crimes allegedly committed
by members of the Croatian Army and poiJce forces.
i In February, three former Croatlan police officers
and one serving police officer, accused of having killed
six captured JNA reservists In 1991, were acquitted by
the Varazdln County Court. In May 2004 the Croatian
Supreme Court had quashed a prevIous acquittal In this
case by the Bjelovar County Court and ordered a retrial.
i In April proceedings against 27 CroatJan Serbs,
Roma and Ruthenians, 18 of whom were being tried in
their absence, reopened at the Vukovar County Court,
In what was reportedly the biggest war crimes trial ever
held in Croatia. The defendants, who faced charges of
genocide, were suspected of crimes against the civilian
population of the village of Miklusevci, near Vukovar, in
1991 and 1992. The trial initially started In 2004 on the
basis of an indictment Issued In 1996 against 35
suspects. It was suspended when it was ascertained
that eight of the accused had died
i In May proceedings started at the Zagreb County
Court against five former members of a Croatian
Ministry of the Interior Unit. In September, three
received prison sentences of between five and JO years
for the murder of a member of the Croatian Army In
1 9 9 1 . The other two defendants were sentenced to two
and four years' Imprisonment for abducting and
detaining three Croatlan Serbs liVing In Zagreb who
were later kil led by unknown perpetrators in Pakracka
poljana. Two of the accused went Into hiding the day
after the verdict was Issued and were still at large at the
end of 2005.
"] In July an investigation was launched Into murders
and "disappearances" of Croatlan Serb Civilians In
Osijek In 1991 and 1992. In October two suspects,
reportedly former members of the Croatlan Army, were
arrested on suspIcion of Involvement in the wartime
murder of four Croatlan Serbs. In December Anto
Dapic, President of the Croatian Party of Rights and
Mayor of OSijek, reportedly disclosed to the media the
names of 1 9 potential witnesses who could testify
about crimes committed against Croatian Serbs In
OSijek, leading to concerns about their safety and their
Willingness to testify In court.
:y In September the retrial started at the Split County
Court of eight former members of the CroatJan Military
Police, accused of having tortured and murdered non­
Croat detainees In Split's Lora military prison In 1992.
Four of the accused were tried In their absence An
Initial trial held In 2002 ended With an acqUittal verdict,
subsequently overturned by the CroatJan Supreme
Court.
'I In September the trial restarted at the Karlovac
County Court of a former member of the Croatian
special police on charges of having kil led 13 disarmed

JNA reservists In 1991. Two earlier acquittal verdicts had
been overturned by the Croatlan Supreme Court.

Right to return/ attacks against Croatia n Serbs
At least 300,000 Croatian Serbs were displaced by the
1 991 -95 conflict, of whom approxim ately 120,000 were
offiCially registered as having returned home. One of
the greatest obstacle s to sustaina ble return was the
failure of the Croatian authont ies to provide adequat e
hOUSing for Croatian Serbs who were stripped of their
nghts to SOCially owned flats dunng and after the war.
Cases of Violence and harassm ent by private
individua ls against Croatian Serbs appeared to have
Increased In 2005. These Included racist graffiti, threats
and assaults. The most serious Incident saw the
apparently ethnical ly motivate d killing in May of an
elderly Croatian Serb man in Kann, near Zadar. The
investiga    into this murder was continuin g at the
end of 2005. Also in May, there were three bomb attacks
on mUnicipa lity buildings In the predomin antly
Croatian Serb towns of Borovo and TrpinJa and in the
premises of a Croatian Serb party In Vukovar I n August
a bomb was thrown Into the yard of a house owned by a
Croatlan Serb In the Imotski region, damaging the
bUi lding. In October and November two Croatian Serb
returnees were kil led by explosive devices In a wood in
the vil lage of Jagma, Lipik municipal ity. The Incidents
raised particular concern Since both occurred, In
Similar circumstanc es, in an area that was not
conSidered to be affected by mines. The Croatian
authorities were still investigatin g the incidents at the
end of the year.

Violence against women
In February the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Dlscnmination against Women expressed, among other
things, its concern over the high incidence of domestic
Violence, the limited number of shelters available for
victims of Violence and the lack of clear procedures for
law enforcement and health care personnel dealing
with domestic violence. The Committee also expressed
concern at the high incidence of trafficking in women.

Restrictions on freedom of expression, association
and movement continued to cause great concern.
Nea rly 70 prisoners of conscience remained in
prison. The US embargo continued to have a negative
effect on the enjoyment of the full range of human
rights i n Cuba. The economic situation deteriorated
and the government attempted to suppress private
entrepreneurship. More tha n 30 prisoners remained
on death row; no one was executed.
Background
There was increasing internation al concern about
Cuba's failure to improve civil and political rights. In
Apnl, in a highly politicized process, the UN
Commissio n on Human Rights condemned Cuba once
again for its human rights record.
The government maintained a tight control on those
who criticized it, and detained several human rights
defenders and political dissidents. However, in May the
Assembly to Promote Civil Society - a coalition of more
than 350 Independent non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) - held an unprecedented meeting of dissidents
in Cuba.
The authorities launched an energetic campaign to
tackle Informal economic activities and widespread
corruption in the state sector.
Prisoners of conscience
Prisoners of conscience continued to be arrested and
sentenced for their peacefully held views. Some were
released for health reasons.
a Rene G6mez Manzano and J ul io Cesar L6pez
Rodnguez were detained, a long With several others, In
the capital Havana after participating in a peaceful
anti-governm ent demonstratio n on 22 July. Rene

On 13 July around 20 people were detained while
participating In a peaceful event in Havana. They were
commemorat the " IJ de Marzo" tugboat disaster of
1994. in which some 35 people were killed while
attempting to flee Cuba when their boat was
reportedly rammed by the Cuban authorities. Six

a Prisoner of conscience Mario Enrique Mayo
Hernandez, sentenced to 20 years' Imprisonment in
2003, was conditionally released on health grounds on

Restrictions on freedom of expression,
association and movement
Human rights activists, political dissidents and trade
uniOnists were harassed and intimidated. Such attacks
were frequently perpetrated by quasi-official groups,
the rapid-response brigades, allegedly acting in
collusion with members of the security forces.
Freedom of expressIOn and association continued
to be under attack. All legal media outlets were under
government control and independent media
remained banned. I ndependent Journalists faced
intimidation, harassment and imprisonment for
publishing articles outside Cuba. Human rights
defenders also faced intimidation and politically
motivated and arbitrary arrests.
The laws used to arrest and imprison journalists,
relating to defamation, national security and disturbing
public order, did not comply with international
standards. According to the international NGO
Reporters Without Borders, 24 journalists were
ImprISoned at the end of 2005.
a Oscar Mario Gonzalez Perez, an independent
journalist, was arrested on 22 July after covering a
demonstration. He remained In prison without charge.
Dissidents continued to face restrictions when
attempting to travel abroad.
a Miguel Sigler Amaya, a member of the unoffiCial
Alternative Option Movement (Movimiento
Independlente Opcion Alternativa), was detained at
Havana I nternational Airport when he and his fami ly
were about to board a plane to the USA even though
they had exit visas as political refugees. He and his
family were released several days later and finally left
Cuba on 5 October. Miguel Sigler Amaya's brothers,
Guido and Ariel, both prisoners of conscience,
continued to serve sentences of 20 and 25 years
respectively.
a In December, representatives of Ladies in White

relatives who had marched every Sunday since March
2003 demanding the release of their husbands, brothers

Foreign nationa ls were reported to have been

excessive force against demonstrators and
journalists at a picket by stri king lorry drivers. State
policies failed to provide protection, support, justice
or redress to victims of violence in the fa mily.
Background
The de facto separation of the north and south parts of
the island persisted, with the northern part remaining
unrecognized by the internatIOnal community. The
Committee of M issing Persons, which reconvened in
2005 in an attempt to discover the fate of about 2,000
people missing In ethnic strife since 1963, held further
meetings but made little progress.
Detention and deportation of foreign
nationals
Experts from the European Union Network of
I ndependent Experts in Fundamental Human Rights
expressed concern in January that foreign nationals
arriving in Cyprus in 2004 had been deported without
being offered access to the asylum process. They cited
cases of individuals who had been detained for
prolonged periods pending deportation, even in cases
where deportation orders could not be carried out or
where detainees' asylum applications were under
consideration.
Foreign detainees at the Central Prison in Nicosia
complained that prison staff mocked them and made
racist comments, the Ombudsperson reported in
February. She also reported that foreign nationals who
had filed asylum applications were being detained in
police stations around the country
I n May there were reports that foreign detainees had
been beaten while held in poor detention conditions in
Limassol police station.
In July the Ombudsperson reported receiving
complaints from foreign nationals applYing for asylum
who said they had been detained in police stations, ill­
treated and forced to sign declarations withdrawing
their requests for asylum. In one case, an Iranian
asylum-seeker was arrested I n February, detained for
three months I n limassol police station and
subsequently expelled to I ran. He had been arrested
after he viSited the police station to Inform the Cypriot
authorities that his address had changed. In her report,
the Ombudsperson said that his arrest and detention
were arbitrary, and that the expulSion was in violation

Excessive use of force
On 1 8 July members of the special police Mobile
I mmedia te Response UnIt were alleged to have used
excessive force against demons trators and Journali sts
at a picket by striking lorry drivers. In response to a
complai nt by the Union of Journali sts, the
Ombud sperson carried out an investig ation. She
conclud   that the police had exhibite d "unpard onable
neglIgence" and failed to Inform the strikers about their
"intenti on to ensure, using any possible means,
Includin g violenc e, lorry access across the picket l i ne".
The Ombudsperson also conclud   that "the situatio n
[which led to the beating and arrest of one camera man
in particul ar] was not of an intensit y or gravity and did
not bear a serious or direct danger such that would
J ustify the Involve ment of the police officer In charge

police reconsi der their role In poliCin g future
demon stration s to ensure that the public's right to
freedom of Informa    was not compromised and that
their actions dUring the poliCing of such demonstrations
were not excessive.

Cyprus had not formula ted a Nationa l Action Plan to

included limited psychological support to victims; a
lack of coordIna    between police and the Judiciary ;
the absence of traInIng for lawyers and judges; the lack
of Informat ion In foreign languages to assist non­

There were continuing reports of police i ll-treatment.
Discrimination agai nst Roma
Roma contInued to face discrimination In employment,
housing and education. They also suffered frequent
Violent attacks by racist Individuals.

Housing
DiSCrImInatory practices in public and private rental
markets meant that in practice Roma could frequently
not obtain hOUSIng, even if they were able to present
finanCIal guarantees, and as a result lived In segregated
substandard hOUSIng. Ostensibly neutral eligibility
requirements, such as an adequate education level for
all members of the family applying for hOusing,
disproportionately affected Roma whose level of
education was often lower than that of ethnic Czechs.
Cl I n J une, the mUnIcipality in the northern town of
BohumIn Issued eviction orders to the predominantly
Romani reSidents of a hostel that it deCided to convert
into flats. The municipality offered no feaSible plan to
provide the IOW-income reSidents with alternative
accommodation. Instead, it proposed to segregate the
men from the women and children, and move them into
a shelter for single mothers. Most of the reSidents left
while the remaining 15 appealed against the eviction '
orders. By November a regional court had ordered
them to leave the hostel, without instructing the
authorities to provide alternative accommodation.
They appealed, and pending a decision, the town
authOrities were prohibited from evicting them

Education
In May the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg deCided to admit a complaint filed by 18
schoolchildren of Romani origIn against the Czech
Republic. The complaint al leged racial discrimination in
education. The applicants claimed that their placement
in "special schools" for mentally disabled children on
the basis of their ethnic origin constituted racial

a The League of Human Rights, a local non­
governmental organization, reported that on I
February an 1 8-year-old Roma youth, R.B., was
assaulted by municipal police in the city of Krupka. He
was stopped on the street by the police and taken in a
patrol car to a bar where he had allegedly earlier
broken a window. He was reportedly kicked in the
body and head in front of several witnesses, and
required treatment for extensive i njuries. The League
of Human Rights filed a complaint on behalf of R.B.
with the state police but, despite witness testimonies,
the case was closed.
a On 20 April, brothers Jan M. and Jozef M., both
minors, were reportedly i l l-treated after being taken
into custody by police in a Prague street on suspicion
of il legally pasting posters. In the car, Jan M . was hit by
a policeman. At the police station in Prague 3 (Z izkov),
the boys were made to strip naked and do push-ups in
front of three policemen. During the interrogation, Jan
M . was reportedly hit on the head so hard that his ear
and nose bled and he had concussion. Relying on the
testimony of the three policemen and despite a
medical report on one of the youngsters, the case was
not taken forward by the Inspectorate of the I nterior
Ministry. The League of Human Rights appealed against
the decision of the inspectorate and, as of November,
the case was under investigation by the state attorney.
a On 30 J uly police intervened to disperse some
5,000 people gathered in a field near the village of
M lynec, West Bohemia, for a music festival known as
"CzechTek", which was allegedly unauthorized and
causing damage to private property. Police in riot gear
reportedly shot tear gas grenades and used water
cannons to end the festiva l . More than 80 people were
injured, and around 20 members of the public and five
police officers sought medical attention. I n November,
the Ombudsman's office stated that the intervention
was legal but that police failed to take adequate
preventive measures that might have helped to avoid
the later use of force.

Mental health issues
Despite the banning of cage beds in psychiatric
institutions under the Ministry of Health, their use was
still permitted in social care centres under the M inistry
of Labour and Social Affairs. These centres housed
children and adults with mental disabilities and people
with substance abuse problems.
In May, parliament adopted an amendment to the
law on social care on the use of restraint in a l l social
care i nstitutions, including cage beds. Regularization
of restraint use was cited as the objective of the law,
although i n fact it legalized the use of restraints. The
amendment allows employees of social care homes
who are not qualified physicians to make decisions
regarding restraint use. Moreover, the amendment
does not provide for supervision of the restraint
order, time l imits on restraint, or a complaint
mechanism for victims.

Forced sterilization o f women
In late 2004, the Ministry of Health established a panel to
review the files of alleged victims of forced sterilization,
to facilitate investigation of the issue and to respond to
queries from the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman was
conducting an independent investigation into
approximately 80 complaints against hospitals that
allegedly sterilized women without their informed
consent. In December, the Ombudsman produced a final
report, stating that in most cases of forced sterilization,
women were not able to give informed consent because
they did not understand the procedure, because of lack
of time (sometimes the procedure was carried out within
a few minutes of their agreeing to it, or after labour had
started) or because of misleading information on the part
of hospital personnel about the nature and
consequences of the sterilization procedure. A number
of these cases were transferred to the state attorney and
the police for investigation.
a The Group of Women Harmed by Sterilization, a
victim advocacy group, lodged formal complaints in
cases of Romani women sterilized under coercion.
In November, the Ostrava District Court indicated that
it would uphold the complaint of Helena Ferencikova,
who was sterilized in an Ostrava hospital in 2001 while
giving birth to her second child by caesarean section.
The court was expected to rule that, in violation of the
rules on informed consent, the doctors secured her
consent when she was deep in labour and did not fully
understand the consequences of her actions.

There were mass expulsions of Haitians and

Although officials stated that the round-ups and

Haitians with a legal right to remain in the Dominican

9 I n May, more than 3, 000 Haitians and black
Dominicans were forcibly expelled In three days. They
were reportedly rounded up in the early hours of the
morning, forced onto buses and left at the Haitian
border. Many were unable to collect their belongings and
some were allegedly separated from family members.

Access to nationality
1':5 I n October, the I nter-Amencan Court of Human
Rights ruled in the case of Dilcia Yean and Vio/eta
Bosico v Dominican Republic. The two girls of Haitian
descent were born on Dominican territory and lived
there all their lives but were denied Dominican
nationality In contravention of the country's
Constitution. As a result, they could not obtain birth
certificates or enrol in school, and remained vulnerable
to expulsion. The Court found that the Dominican
Republic's application of nationality laws and
regulations was discriminatory and therefore
contravened international human rights standards.

six months of 2005, the Care Centre for Battered
Women reported 386 cases of sexual violence in which
205 women were beaten.

Human rights defenders
Father Pedro Ruquoy, a Belgian Catholic priest,
received death threats in September apparently
because of his work on behalf of Dominican peasants
and Haitian migrants working in sugar cane
plantations. As a result of the threats and other
intimidation, Father Ruquoy was forced to leave the
Dominican Republic in November after 30 years of
missionary work in the country. According to reports,
other human rights defenders working on behalf of
Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian origin also had to
flee the country.

Assaults

Haitians faced an increasing climate of xenophobic
hosti lity, particularly after the murder in May of a
Dominican shop owner in the north of the country,
allegedly perpetrated by Haitian migrants. I ncidents of
lynching were reported, often after the murder or rape
of a Dominican, and several Haitians were killed. The
security forces failed to intervene to halt attacks.
'9 In August, three Haitians were lynched and burned
alive fol lowing an a lleged argument with a group of
Dominicans.

Killings by security forces
There was an Increase in the number of people kil led in
shoot-outs ('lntercambios de disparos") with members
of the security forces, apparently in the context of anti­
crime operations. Between January and August, 348
people were killed in this way, according to offiCial
statistics, compared with 360 such deaths during the
whole of 2004. Uncorroborated reports suggested that
a number of these fatal shootings may have been
extrajudicial killings. Fifty-five members of the security
forces were reportedly killed in the same eight-month
period.
Torture and ill-treatment
In August, five inmates from the prison in the city of
Mao were reportedly tortured by police personnel from
the prison, leaving them with broken ribs, arms and
legs. They had allegedly helped another inmate to
escape. The escaped prisoner was eventually shot dead
by prison guards. According to press reports, the Chief
of the Nationa I Pol ice ordered the local pol ice

The i ndependence of the j udiciary was threatened by
the sacking of Supreme Court judges. There were
clashes between demonstrators and the secu rity
forces during protests in the ca pita l, Quito, in April,
and the provinces of Sucumbios a nd Orellana in May
and August. Critics of the government were
threatened. Cases of torture a nd ill-treatment by the
police continued to be tried in police courts.
Background
The political atmosphere remained unstable. Following
public protests over interference in the appointment of
Supreme Court judges, first by Congress and later by
PreSident Gutierrez, Congress ousted and replaced the
PreSiden t on 20 Apri l. In October, when he returned
from Colombia, he was arrested and charged with
corruption and undermining the security of the state.
The number of refugees fleeing the internal armed
conflict in Colombia grew, asylum applications

reportedly reaching 20,000 by October. Colombian state
forces and armed opposition groups reportedly entered
Ecuador's increasingly militarized border areas.
The appointment of the Human Rights Ombudsman
in July was criticized by human rights defenders for
apparently flouting procedures aimed at ensuring the
involvement of civil society. The candidate supported
by civil society organizations was denied the
opportunity to be considered for the position.

J udicial independence attacked
In March, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
independence of judges and lawyers said that the
replacement by Congress of most Supreme Court judges
in December 2004 had been unconstitutional. Also in
March, the new Court withdrew corruption charges
against three former heads of state in a move that
appeared to favour their political affiliations. In April,
PreSident Gutierrez sacked the Court in an attempt to
avert an impending constitutional criSis. A new Court
was appointed at the end of November.
Attacks on human rights defenders
There were continued reports of individuals working to
protect human rights, and people who criticized the
authorities, being threatened and harassed.
a In July, Maria Teresa Cherres Mesias, a community
leader from Orellana province, was threatened and
intim idated apparently because of her work
defending the labour rights of oil company workers in
the region.
Il l-treatment of oil protesters
In May and August, the government declared a state of
emergency in response to demonstrations, strikes and
occupations in the provinces of Sucumbios and
Orellana. Protesters were demanding greater local
investment of revenues from oil exploitation in the
area. Amid reports of violence by protesters, dozens of
people, including minors, were detained by police, and
some were reportedly ill-treated in custody. No
investigation was opened.
Torture a nd impunity
I n November the UN Committee against Torture
expressed concern at the high level of allegations of
torture and ill-treatment, i ncluding of indigenous
peoples, women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people. The Committee expressed
serious concern that complaints of human rights
violations by the security forces continued to be tried
in police and military courts, which were neither
independent nor impartial.
n On 2 February, Juan Carlos Pesantes Umatambo
was detained at a police roadblock for not carrying
identity papers, and reportedly forced to strip, hosed
with cold water and beaten with a metal bar. An
investigation was opened in a civil court, and the judge
ordered the arrest of a police officer. However, a
parallel investigation was conducted in a police court.
The arrested officer was remanded in police, not
prison, custody. Reportedly, none of the other officers

accused of involvement was suspended from duty. By
the end of 2005 no deCision had been made as to
whether the civil or police court would be granted
jurisdiction over the case.

Economic, social and cultural rights
Many women and children from marginalized
communities still did not have access to health care
guaranteed them under 1998 legislation. In some
provinces, health centre and hospital staff were
reportedly not even aware of the legislation.
Children
I n June, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child
expressed concern at continued discrimination against
indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian people, including
children; the limited enjoyment of the rights to
education and health by poor indigenous children; the
lack of poliCies on widespread abuse and violence
within the family; and the high levels of child labour
and commercial sexual exploitation of children.

in bom b attacks in Cairo in April and Sharm el-Sheikh
in July. Scores of people were a rrested in con nection
with the attacks and at least 14 people, i ncluding
severa l police officers, were killed in shoot-()uts
between police a nd a l leged suspects. Peaceful
demonstrations calling for political reform were
violently dispersed. Nonllovernmental organizations
( NGOs) continued to operate under a restrictive law
introduced in 2002. Hundreds of members of the
ba nned Muslim Brothers organization were a rrested;

EGY

scores of them remained held awaiting trial at the
end of the year. Thousa nds of suspected supporters
of ba nned Islamist groups, including possible
prisoners of conscience, remained in detention
without charge or trial; some had been held for years.
Torture and ill-treatment in detention continued to
be systematic. Deaths in custody were reported. I n
the majority o f torture cases, the perpetrators were
not brought to justice. At least two people were
sentenced to death; no executions were known to
have taken place.
Background
The nationwide state of emergency imposed in 1981
remained i n force despite calls by human rights groups
and others for it to be l i fted.
President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak began a fifth
term of office following an election in September, when
for the first time other candidates were a llowed to
stand against him after the government amended
Article 76 of the Constitution. The amendment was first
proposed by President Mubarak in February and then
approved by a national referendum in May, which some
opposition parties sought to boycott. Nine candidates
stood against the PreSident in September, but he was
returned by a large margin. There were some
allegations of electoral fraud. In December Ayman
Nour, leader of the al-Ghad party who came second in
the election with less than 10 per cent of the poll, was
prosecuted and jailed for five years. al legedly for
fraudulently obtaining signatures to support his
application to legalize his party. The prosecution
provoked widespread international and national
criticism.
Elections for a new parliament were held in three
stages in November and December. They were marred
by serious irregularities and by violence. including
police shootings of voters, which left at least 11 dead
and many others injured. Many supporters of
candidates associated with the Muslim Brothers were
detained by police, and many others were violently
attacked by supporters of the ruling National
Democratic Party (NDP) who were allowed to act with
impunity. While the N DP kept its majority in
parliament, the Muslim Brothers won 88 seats, six
times more than they held in the previous parliament.
Egypt's government-sponsored National Council for
Human Rights (NCHR) issued its first report in April,
covering February 2004 to February 2005. I t called for
the abolition of the state of emergency. drew attention
to continuing human rights violations, notably torture
and il l -treatment, and made a number of
recommendations.
In September, the European Union and Egypt began
negotiating an Action Plan for Egypt within the
framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Twenty-five Egyptian NGOs called for a stronger human
rights agenda to be considered during negotiations.
Human rights violations in the 'war on terror'
New Information emerged about Egypt's role in
connection with the international "war on terror".

While visiting the USA in May. Prime Minister Ahmed
Nazif stated that more than 60 people had been forcibly
transferred to Egypt by US forces since September 2001.
However. no Egyptian or US officials provided further
details of the individuals concerned or their fate. I n
addition. the Egyptian authorities continued actively to
seek the forcible return of alleged members of Islamist
groups from abroad.
Scores of people detained following the bomb
attacks on civilians at Taba and Nuweiba in October
2004 were released during 2005. but more than 100
others were stil l detained at the end of the year. many
of them apparently held under administrative
detention powers. Many of those released alleged that
they had been tortured in detention.
a Ahmed Abdallah Raba·. who was arrested in
November 2004 in a l-'Arish. was detained without
charge for three and a half months. mostly without
contact with his relatives or a lawyer. For most of that
time. he was held at Istiqbal Tora prison. However. he
was taken twice to the State Security Intelligence (SS!)
headquarters in Cairo for interrogation where. he
a lleged. he was repeatedly tortured for a week by
being beaten. hung by his wrists and ankles in
contorted positions and subjected to electric shocks
while a l l the time naked and with his eyes covered by
a blindfold. He said that a doctor regularly checked on
the health of torture victims while he was at the SSI
headquarters.
Further arrests were made following the bomb
attacks in Cairo in April and in Sharm el-Sheikh in July.
Again. many of those detained were reportedly
tortured and there were at least two deaths in custody
in circumstances suggesting that torture or ill­
treatment were contributory factors.
a Muhammad SUleyman Youssef and Ashraf Sa'id
Youssef. two cousins. both died soon after being
detained. Following the former's death on 29 April. his
family was reportedly pressured by the authorities into
signing a medical report which attributed his death to
natural causes. Ashraf Sa 'id Youssef. who was detained
on the day that his cousin died. was held
incommunicado for I) days and his relatives only
learned of his whereabouts when he was transferred to
al-Minyal University Hospital with serious head injuries
on 11 May. He died six days later. The Public Prosecutor
said he caused his own injuries by repeatedly banging
his head against his cell wal l . No proper investigation
was known to have been carried out.
The authorities generally failed to conduct prompt.
impartial and thorough investigations into al legations
of torture. especially in cases having a political or
security aspect, where officials responsible for carrying
out investigations were allowed to commit abuses with
impunity. By contrast, there were several prosecutions
of police officers accused of torturing. ill-treating or
causing the deaths of suspects in ordinary criminal
cases. There were reports that some torture victims had
received compensation.
Defendants facing charges relating to national
security or terrorism were frequently tried before
courts established under emergency legislation or
Amnesty International Report 2006

EGY

military courts, even when the defendants were
civi lians. These courts fail in many respects to satisfy
international standards for fair trial; for example, they
provide for no right of ful l judicial review before a
higher tribunal .
a Muhammad Abdallah Raba' and Muhammad Gayiz
Sabbah went on trial before the (Emergency) Supreme
State Security Court at Ismailia in july, accused in
connection with the Taba and Nuweiba bomb attacks of
October 2004. Both defendants alleged at the trial's
opening session, which AI observed, that they had been
tortured by the SSI to force them to confess. They were
then referred for medical examination, but a
subsequent report dismissed their allegations and the
court failed to order a thorough, impartial
investigation. Although arrested in October 2004, they
first had access to their lawyers only on the opening
day of the trial.

Violence against women
In july, a coalition of 94 organizations and civil
associations from various governorates launched a
national campaign to criminalize a l l forms of domestic
violence against women in Egypt. The launch was
declared during a conference organized by the Nadim
Centre for the Psychological Treatment and
Rehabilitation of Yictims of Yiolence in the presence of
a number of human rights and women activists.
Restrictions on freedom of expression,
association and assembly
Restrictions on freedom of expression, association and
assembly persisted. NGOs continued to operate under
a restrictive 2002 law; some faced obstacles at the
Ministry of Social Affairs when seeking to register and
obtain legal status. For example, the Ministry turned
down the Egyptian Association Against Torture's
application to register, a decision subsequently upheld
by an administrative court.
journalists continued to be threatened, beaten or
imprisoned because of their work. A Bill i ntroduced by
President Mubarak in February 2004 that would abolish
prison terms for publishing offences was not made law.
On several occasions, police used excessive force
against people demonstrating against government
policies or to assert their basic rights. At other times,
police stood back and took no action when supporters
of the ruling NDP physically assaulted opposition
supporters.
a Scores of demonstrators advocating a boycott of
the May referendum to amend the Constitution and
journalists working for opposition newspapers were
assaulted, reportedly by NDP supporters. Some of the
assaults a llegedly took place in the presence of police
who failed to intervene. The Public Prosecutor ordered
an investigation into the assaults but closed It in
December on the grounds that there was insufficient
evidence to prosecute.
a During the December parliamentary elections,
police fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear
gas into crowds seeking to vote at polling stations that
police had closed or cordoned off in al-Daqahlia,
Amnesty International Report 2006

al-Sharqia and other areas. At least 11 people were
killed in the violence. No official investigation was
known to have been held.

Refugees and migra nts
I n December, 27 Sudanese refugees and migrants were
killed and others injured when police brutally
dispersed what had been for three months a peaceful
sit-in close to the offices of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees in Cairo. Police were said to have aimed
water cannons at protesters and subjected them to
indiscriminate beatings. The demonstrators, whose
numbers had swelled to around 2,500 by December,
were cal ling for improvements in their living
conditions, protection from return to Sudan, and
resettlement in Europe or North America.
Prison conditions
In September, up to 2,000 prisoners were released for
health and humanitarian reasons, reportedly following
recommendations by the NCHR. Thousands of other
detainees were held in prisons where conditions
amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Hundreds held in administrative detention were
reportedly suffering from i l lnesses including
tuberculosis, skin diseases and paralysis, which were
common because of lack of hygiene and medical care,
overcrowding and poor food quality. Scores of them
went on hunger strikes in May and june to protest
against their ill-treatment and lack of adequate medical
care.
a Relatives of hundreds of administrative detainees
held a sit-in at the Lawyers' Syndicate's building in
Cairo for several months prior to the September
presidential elections. They were protesting against the
continued detention of their relatives and the
conditions of detention, which had caused health
problems. They also demonstrated in October outSide
the Ministry of the Interior building in Cairo's Lazoghly
Square to cal l for the release of their relatives, some of
whom were thought to have been detained for more
than a decade.

Impunity for past human rights violations, including
"disappeara  s", persisted. Reports of violence
against women increased but investigations
remained inadequate. There were threats against
human rights defenders.
Background
Criminal violence increased during the year by around
34 per cent, according to the National Civil Police. There
were 3,761 murders, 82 per cent committed with
firearms. The harsh government initiatives of previous
years against maras (gangs) did not bring the
improvements in the security situation predicted by the
authOrIties. I nstead, the prison population increased,
causing greater overcrowding and protests. Prisons
designed for 7,000 held around 12,000 inmates.
Natural disasters hit El Salvador, particularly
affecting the poor. In October a volcanic eruption killed
two peasant farmers and displaced over 5,000 people.
Later, HUrrIcane Stan caused extensive damage and
casualties. The authorities were criticized for failing to
provide prompt relIef to the victims.

"disappeared" children. Only some of the Court's
recommendations had been implemented by the end
of 2005.
Three more cases of children who "disappeared"
during the armed conflict were admitted by the I nter­
American Commission on Human Rights in November.

Violence against women
There was a sharp rise in the number of women
murdered. According to the National Civil Police, 323
women and girls were killed between January and
November, a rise over the corresponding period in
2004. The incidence of domestic violence also
increased. In the first six months of the year, the
emergency system of the National Civil Police received
nearly 12,000 calls reporting incidents of domestic
violence and 24 women were killed by partners or
family members.
The report of the 2004 visit of the UN Special
Rapporteur on violence against women was published
in February. She recommended that the government
prevent, investigate and punish acts of Violence against
women, whoever the perpetrator, and prioritize ending
impunity for these crimes. The authorities apparently
took no steps to comply with the recommendations.
No progress was made in investigating cases of
women who had been killed and, in some cases, raped
in previous years. AI called on the authorities to
properly investigate such cases, but no progress was
evident by the end of 2005.
Human rights defenders
Four offiCials from the Human Rights Procurator's
Office were arrested in April on charges of having
committed "arbitrary acts" while monitoring the
procedures followed in the deportation of an
Ecuadorian doctor. He had been living in El Salvador for
several years and was married to a Salvadorean citizen
'
and denied allegations that he had participated in
political activities. The Human Rights Procurator's
Office conSidered the arrests to be harassment of its
offiCials, an obstruction to their lawful activities and a
demonstration of the government's opposition to the
institution's work. The four offiCials were released after
three days.

'Disa ppea red' children
In March the I nter-American Court of Human Rights
ruled that the state of El Salvador, by fai l i ng to carry
out an effective and timely investigation into the
"disappearance" of three-year-old Ernestina and
seven-year-old Erlinda Serrano Cruz in June 1 982
dUrIng a military operation in Chalatenango, had

Suspected political opponents were a rbitrarily
detained without charge or trial. At least 20
detainees, including prisoners of conscience, were
still in custody after being detained in 2003 and
2004. There were reports of torture, in at least one
case resulting in death. Two people were alleged to
have been killed unlawfully by soldiers. Four
government opponents reportedly "disappeared" in
custody following their a bduction from neighbouring
countries. Conditions at Black Beach prison in the
capita l, Mala bo, were life-threatening. Over 20
soldiers and former military personnel were g iven
long prison sentences for an alleged attempted cou p

sentenced to long prison terms after a n u nfair trial in
2004 were released. Two young boys were u nlawfully

Background
I n january, Equatorial Guinea signed the Protocol to
the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on
the Rights of Women in Africa.
Despite high levels of economic growth and oil
production, poverty remained widespread. Shortages
of drinking water in the main cities, sometime lasting
for several weeks, were frequent. According to the UN
Development Programme's Human Development
I ndex, life expectancy decreased from 49. 1 years in 2001
to 43-3 years in 2005·
In September a H igh Court in the United Kingdom

were accused of financing an al leged coup attempt in
March 2004.

At least 20 people arrested in 2003 and 2004, including
some 12 prisoners of conscience, continued to be held
without charge or trial. I nterrogation of the detainees by
the investigatingjudge started in late December 2005.
Dozens of suspected political opponents were
arbitrarily detained, some of them briefly. Others were
still in prison, without charge or trial, at the end of
2005. Most appeared to be prisoners of conscience.

a Vidal Bomaba Sirube, Marcelino Barila Buale and
DeograClas Batapa Barila were arrested in january,
apparently on suspicion of being members of the
Movement for the Self-determination of Bioko Island
(Movimiento para la autodeterminaci6n de la isla de
Bioko, MAl B). They were stil l held without charge or
trial in Black Beach prison at the end of 2005. Vidal
Bomaba Sirube, a lawyer reSident in Spain, received no
medication for a chronic kidney ai lment.
a In April , 75-year-old Anastasia Ncumu was arrested
and briefly detained after she took food to her son in
Bata prison, apparently because she had criticized
President Obiang.

Death in detention, torture and ill-treatment
Police tortured or i l l-treated detainees with impunity.
At least one detainee was reported to have died as a
result of torture. Those responsible were not brought
to justice.
a I n March taxi driver Mariano Esono "Nenuco" died
in the Mondoasi police station in Bata, a week after his
arrest for allegedly not repaying a debt to his employer.
He was reportedly burned with an iron and subjected to
electric shocks on his genitals and face. He was taken to
court, where a judge was said to have ordered
immediate hospital treatment. However, police officers
allegedly returned him to the police station, where he
died soon afterwards, then tried to hide his body by
burying it on a beach, where they were observed by
passers-by. They then returned the body to his family.
a In May Prosper Diffo, a Cameroonian car mechanic,
was held for four hours at police headquarters in Bata.
He was reportedly beaten with batons and kicked
because he had refused to work on the Provincial
Governor's car. He required two days' treatment in
hospital and could not work for a month. He received
no compensation, and those responsible were not
brought to justice.
'Disappeara  s'
The authorities failed to disclose the whereabouts of
detainees who "disappeared" fol lowing their arrest in
late 2004. A further four people "disappeared" i n 2005.
a Former Navy Commander J uan Ond6 Abaga, a
refugee in Benin since 1997, was allegedly abducted by
Equatorial Guinean security personnel in February.
Lieutenant-Colonel Florencio Bibang Ela, soldier Felipe
Esono Ntumu "Pancho" and civilian Antimo Edu were
arrested in April in Lagos, Nigeria, and transferred to
the capital, Abuja. In july, Equatorial Guinean security
personnel reportedly abducted them from N igerian
custody after bribing prison offiCials. After being
returned to Equatorial Guinea, all four men were
imprisoned incommunicado in Black Beach prison,
where they were a llegedly tortured and denied medical
care. They subsequently "disappeared". The three
members of the armed forces were tried in their
absence in September on charges of attempting a coup
in October 2004, and sentenced to 30 years'
imprisonment. The state-controlled radiO said that they
were outside the country. No offiCial announcement
was made about the fate of Antimo Edu.

Unlawful killings
Soldiers who kil led two people in Bata were not brought
to Justice.
a Placido Ndong Anvam died in January, a few days
after being beaten in the street by soldiers who
appeared to be drunk.
a I n May, Miguel Angel Ndong Ond6 died from his
injuries 10 days after a soldier allegedly ordered him to
raise hiS hands and shot him at close range. He had
been returning home with a woman friend in the early
hours of the morning, when they were followed by the
soldier and there was a brief fight.

Unlawful a rrest of children
Two 12-year-old boys were unlawfully arrested,
detained and charged in February in Malabo. They were
held in a police station for three days on charges of
killing another child three years earlier, before being
taken before a judge to have their detention legalized.
The judge ordered their detention at Black Beach
prison, which has no facilities for juveniles. They were
released two weeks later to await trial. The trial had not
started by the end of 2005. Under national law, the age
of criminal responsibility is 16 and there is no juvenile
justice system.

Unfair political trials
Further arrests took place in January of people accused
of involvement in an al leged coup attempt in October
2004. Of the 70 prisoners who were tried by a mi Ii tary
court In Bata in September, on charges of treason and
undermining the security of the state, 20 soldiers and
former soldiers were convicted and sentenced to
prison terms of between six and 30 years. The rest of
the accused were acquitted. The trial was unfair. The
defendants were held incommunicado before the trial
and reportedly convicted on the basis of confession
statements they said were extracted under torture.
They bore scars consistent with their allegations. There
IS no right of appeal from a military court.

arbitrarily suspended from the Bar Association for a year,
for alleged misconduct. The suspension order did not

him, and he was given no opportunity to refute any
accusation. His suspension appeared to be politically
motivated and related to his work as a lawyer for people
tried for alleged coup attempts, including a group of

days at a time. The situation improved In late April.
Prisoners were held incommunicado from February to

E R ITR EA

Several thousand prisoners of conscience, many held
because of their rel igious beliefs a nd others for
political reasons, were in indefinite and
i ncommu nicado detention without charge or trial,
some in secret locations. Many detainees were
tortured or ill-treated, and large numbers were held
in metal shipping containers or u nderground cells.
Background
The government took no steps to establish a multi­
party democratic system as required by the 1997
Constitution. The ruling party, the People's Front for
Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), was the sole party
a llowed and no opposition activity or criticism was
tolerated.
Two thirds of the population were dependent on
international emergency food aid. They included
70,000 people l iving in internally displaced people's
camps since the war with Ethiopia in 1998-2000, and
refugees who had returned from Sudan. Many donors
suspended development aid programmes because of
the government's failures in democratization and
human rights.
Human rights defenders were not al lowed to
operate. A new law in May imposed severe restrictions
on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), al lowing
them only to work on relief and rehabilitation projects

ERI

through government structures. International NGOs
had to deposit US$2 mil lion in Eritrean banks and local
NGOs US$I million. No local NGOs were able to register.
The government continued to support two Ethiopian
armed opposition groups fighting inside Ethiopia, the
Oromo Liberation Front and the Ogaden National
Liberation Front. The Sudan-based armed opposition
Eritrean Democratic Alliance was supported by
Ethiopia, although it was not clear that it had carried
out any armed activities inside Eritrea during 2005.

Fears of a new wa r with Ethiopia
The UN Security Council called on Ethiopia to
implement the International Boundary Commission's
judgment regarding the border areas, particularly its
al location to Eritrea of Badme town, the flashpoint of
war in 1998. Ethiopia refused to agree to border
demarcation, instead cal l for negotiation over
certain issues. Eritrea demanded UN action against
Ethiopia to enforce the border judgment.
In October, Eritrea banned UN helicopter flights and
other travel to UN monitoring posts, further restricting
the multinational UN M ission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
(UNMEE), whose 2, 800 personnel administered a buffer
zone along the border. Both countries had re-armed
since 2000 and deployed troops near the border in late
2005. The UN Security Council threatened sanctions
against either side if it started a new war.
Religious persecution
A 2002 ban on religions other than the Eritrean
Orthodox Church, the Catholic and Lutheran Churches
and Islam remained in force. Minority religions were
ordered to register and provide detai Is of their
members and finances, which many refused to do,
fearing reprisals. Those that applied received no
response, and remained banned.
The government cracked down on evangelical
Christian churches such as the Kale H iwot (Word of Life)
and Mullu Wengel (Full Gospel) churches. More than
1 , 000 believers from some 35 churches were arrested by
police in at least 23 incidents during 2005 in Asmara and
other towns, while worshipping In their homes or at
weddings. They were detamed without charge or trial,
tortured or ill-treated, and usually were only released
if they agreed to stop attending religious gatherings.
Parents of detained children were forced to sign
guarantees that their children would stop worshippmg.
At least 26 pastors and priests, and over 1,750 church
members, including children and 175 women, and
dozens of Muslims, were in detention at the end of 2005
as prisoners of conscience because of their religious
beliefs. jehovah's Witnesses and members of new
groups within the Eritrean Orthodox Church and Islam
were also detained on account of their beliefs.
a In january, Pastor Ogbamlchael Haimanot of the
Kale Hiwot church was detained in Asmara. He suffered a
mental breakdown in Sawa army camp on account of
prolonged solitary confinement, forced labour and
denial of medical treatment. He was released m October.
a In july, Semere Zaid, an agriculture lecturer at the
University of Asmara who had been detained for a
Amnesty International Report 2006

month i n January o n account of worshipping i n the
Church of the Living God, was rearrested. He was
detained in the Karchele security prison, then moved to
Sembel civil prison to serve a secretly imposed prison
term of two years.
In August, Patriarch Antonios, head of the Eritrean
Orthodox Church, who had apparently opposed
government interference in church affairs, was
reportedly stripped of his authority by the government
and restricted in his movements. The government
denied undermining him.

Prisoners of conscience and politica I prisoners
Few details were available about prisoners of
conscience arrested for their political opinions. Three
trade unionists - Tewelde Gebremedhin, Minassie
Andezion and Habtom Woldemichael - were detamed
in Asmara in March and were stil l detained without
charge at the end of 2005.
Thousands of prisoners of conscience detained in
previous years remained in incommunicado detention
throughout 2005, some of them in secret locations. No
political prisoners were brought before a court.
Prisoners of conscience included 11 former
government ministers detained in secret since a
September 2001 crackdown on people calling for
democratic reforms. They were publicly accused of
treason but never charged. They included Haile
Woldetensae and Petros Solomon, both former Foreign
Ministers, and Mahmoud Ahmed Sheriffo, a former
Vice-President.
Dozens of women prisoners of conscience were held.
They included Aster Fissehatsion, a former PFDj central
committee member arrested in 2001, and Aster
Yohannes, the wife of Petros Solomon, who had
returned voluntarily from the USA in 2003 to be with her
children. She was detained on arrival at Asmara airport,
despite a previous government guarantee of her safety.
Other prisoners of conscience were former leaders
of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (now the
government), such as Bitwoded Abraha, a n army
major general detained a l most continuously for the
past 13 years and reportedly mental ly ill as a result;
civil servants and professionals; and some 300
asylum-seekers forcibly returned by Malta in 2002 and
by Libya in 200l
During 2005 several prisoners of conscience were
i l legally sentenced to prison terms in their absence by a
secret security committee. They were denied the right
to present a legal defence or to appeal to a higher court.
Military conscription
M i litary service was compulsory for all men aged
between 18 and 40, although the upper age limit for
women's conscription was reduced to 27. The
internationally recognized right of conscientious
objection was denied.
a Six jehovah's Witnesses were detained in 2005 for
refusing military service, bringing the total number to
22. They included Paulos Iyassu, Negede Teklemariam
and Isaac Moges, detained incommunicado in Sawa
army camp since 1994.

EST

Several hundred youths fled the country to avoid
military service, and many conscripts escaped from
military service to seek asylum abroad. In J uly and
November, relatives of conscript ion evaders were
detained in the southern Debub Region.

Journalists
Two prisoners of conscience were released. Saadia
Ahmed, a television reporter for the government's
Arabic-language service, detained in 2002, was freed in
early 2005, and Aklilu Solomon, a reporter for the Voice
ofAmerica international radio station, detained in
2003, was freed in mid-2005.
Ten other journalists arrested in 2001 when the
entire private press was shut down, and two others
arrested in 2002, were sti ll detained without charge or
trial at the end of 2005. They were held incommunicado
and in secret without charge or trial.
a Dawlt Isaac, owner and editor of Setit newspaper
and a Swedish citizen, detained in 2001, was released
for a few days' medical treatment in November, then
returned to prison.
Torture and ill-treatment
People detained on account of their political opinions
or religious beliefs were tortured in military custody.
They were tied up in painful positions for hours or
days, particularly in a method nicknamed "helicopter",
and beaten. Conscript soldiers were also punished in
this manner.
Religious and political prisoners were often held in
harsh conditions with little or no medical treatment
and Inadequate food and sanitation. Some were held in
underground cells or metal shipping containers.

A report published by the European Committee for
the Prevention ofTorture (CPT) docu mented a
number of positive developments, but some areas of
concern remained. The Council of Europe's Advisory
Committee on the Framework Convention for the
Protection of National Minorities issued a report also
noting progress, while continuing to express
concerns about the treatment of non-nationals a nd
national minorities in Estonia. Many residents
continued to live in the country without citizenship
and as a result often faced discriminatory practices,
particula rly in the fields of education and labour and
language rights.
Tortu re and ill-treatment
In April, the CPTpublished a report based on the findings
of a visit to the country by a CPT delegation in 200),
The CPT delegation recorded that it had received
very few reports of ill-treatment in detention.
However, there were a number of allegations that
people had been punched, kicked or hit with batons at
the time of detention. The CPT recommended that "no
more force than is reasonably necessary" should be
used during apprehension.
The CPT report expressed concern about conditions
of detention which could amount to inhuman or
degrading treatment at the Kohtla-Jarve and Narva
detention centres. Detainees were locked up for 24
hours a day in cells that were generally dirty, badly lit
and ventilated, and overcrowded.
Other concerns raised by the CPT included: the
absence of special provisions for detaining juveniles
and the failure to house them separately from adults;
the absence in national law of an explicit legal right of
detainees to notify a third party of their detention; and
the lack of prompt medical screening of detainees on
arrival in detention facilities.
In response to reports of beatings of inmates in the
Tartu prison by masked members of a special squad in
May 2003, the CPT recommended independent
monitoring of any future activity by special
intervention squads in prisons.
Ethnic minorities
In February, the Council of Europe's Advisory
Committee on the Framework Convention for the
Protection of National Minorities noted that Estonia

1 14

Amnesty International Report 2006

ETH

had taken certain legal and administrative steps to
make the naturalization process more accessible and
streamlined, and that the rate of naturalization had
recently increased. However, it also noted that 150,536
people were living in Estonia without citizenship at the
end of 2004, a figure which the Committee described as
disconcertingly high.
The Committee noted that non-citizens were not
properly protected under current legislation and
recommended that Estonia introduce anti­
discrimination laws which included adequate legal
safeguards for non-citizens. It also encouraged the
authorities to make naturalization more accessible.
Such measures would include pursuing the proposals to
exempt elderly applicants from language requirements
under the Citizenship Act.
The Committee expressed concern that national
minorities did not have a legal right to communicate
with the authorities in a minority language free of
charge. I t also pointed out that regulations only
allowed written documentation to be submitted in a
minority language in local government units where
more than half of the population belonged to a national
minority. The Committee considered this to be an
excessively high threshold.
The Committee recommended that teaching of
Estonian in secondary schools should be pursued in a
way that did not harm the quality of education provided
to members of national minorities or limit their access
to higher education.
The Committee also expressed concern that
members of national minorities, especially young
women, experienced higher levels of unemployment
than other groups. The Committee called on authorities
to ensure that national minorities were not subjected
to direct or indirect discrimination in the labour
market. The Committee also recommended that the
authorities review the suitability of existing language
proficiency requirements in all sectors of employment
to ensure that they were realistic and proportionate
and did not have a discriminatory effect.

Opposition ca ndidates and supporters were a rrested,

Some 9,000 opposition supporters were detained in
June for severa l weeks following protests at a lleged
fraud in elections in which soldiers killed at least 36
people, I n November, police killed at least 42 people
after peaceful protests turned violent. Over 1 0,000
opposition supporters and demonstrators were
deta ined. Ten new members of pa rlia ment, 1 5
journalists, several human rights defenders and
prisoners of conscience were a mong 86 detainees
later cha rged with treason, genocide a nd other
offences. Civilians were killed and a rbitrarily
deta ined in the context of a rmed conflicts in the

remaining in detention without charge or trial.
Severa l Oromo community activists were prisoners of
conscience. Journalists and human rights defenders
were detained and threatened with prosecution for
criticizing the government. Death sentences were
passed but no executions ca rried out.
Background
Seven million people were dependent on emergency
food aid, with a critical drought and food shortages in
the Somali region in eastern Ethiopia.
The government faced armed opposition from the
Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and the Ogaden National
Liberation Front (ONLF), both based in Eritrea. Ethiopia
continued to support the Sudan-based armed Eritrean
opposition group, the Eritrean Democratic Al liance,
although it was not clear that it had carried out any
armed activities inside Entrea during 2005.
The UN Security Council called on Ethiopia to
implement its acceptance in principle of the
I nternational Boundary Commission's judgment
regarding the border areas, particularly its allocation to
Eritrea of Badme town, the f1ashpoint of war in 1998.
Ethiopia refused to agree to border demarcation,

Security Council threatened sanctions against either
side if It started a new war.

Elections
In the months preceding parliamentary and regional
assembly elections In May, there were arrests, beatings
and intimidation of candidates and supporters from the
two main opposition groupings, the Coalition for Unity
and Democracy (CUD) and the United Ethiopian
Democratic Front (UEDF). Election observers from
Ethiopian non-governmental organizations were only
allowed after they won a court case against the
National Election Board.
ProvIsiona l results in June gave the ruling Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) a
narrow majority. The opposition complained about
election fraud in over hal f the constituencies. European
Union election observers reported numerous election
irregularitie s. In re-runs in 31 constituencies, several
government ministers regained their seats after
opposition candidates Withdrew, alleging intimidatio n
and violence.
In the final results in September, including from the
delayed Somali region elections in August, the EPRDF
and affiliated parties won two thirds of the 527 seats.
Most CUD elected members of parliament and regional
assemblies did not take their seats, in protest at al leged
election fraud and at new procedural rules that
disadvantaged the opposition. Parliament withdrew
their parliamentary immunity.
Post-election killings and a rrests
On 8 June soldiers shot dead at least 36 opposition
supporters and wounded dozens of others in initially
peaceful demonstrations in Addis Ababa at alleged
election fraud by the EPRDF. In the weeks following,
police arrested some 9,000 people allegedly involved
In violent protests, including 2,000 Addis Ababa
University students, some 120 opposition party
offiCials, and six human rights defenders. The detainees
were initially held incommunicado, and many beaten
or i l l-treated. They had all been released without
charge by the end of J uly.
D Two air force officers who fled to Djibouti at the
beginning of the protests were forcibly returned and
detained after being denied access to asylum
procedures. They were reportedly tortured on their
return to Ethiopia, and sti ll detained incommunicado
without charge or trial at the end of 2005.
After the final election results, CUD called for non­
violent protests and stay-home strikes. On 31 October,
30 taxi drivers were arrested after drivers in Addis
Ababa protested by sounding their horns. On I
November peaceful street protests were followed by
shootings and violence. Riot police kil led at least 42
protesters and wounded about 200 others, some at
their homes. Police admitted 34 deaths, and said seven
police officers were killed and others injured.
In the weeks following I November police arrested
most CUD leaders, including 10 members of parliament,
15jOurnalists, human rights defenders, lawyers and a
teachers' union leader. The Prime Minister accused them
of treason and organiZing a violent uprising. They were
taken to court, allowed access to lawyers and relatives,
and remanded in custody for investigation. In December,
1 16

131 defendants (86 of whom were in custody) were
charged with the mostly capital offences of treason,
inciting armed uprising and genocide against an ethnic
group and members of the ruling party. Several thousand
school and college students were detained and beaten
by police in late December in Addis Ababa and towns in
Amhara region for demonstrating in support of the
release of the CUD leaders.
D The accused included 55 CUD party leaders and
others earlier arrested or declared "wanted", such as
Berhanu Negga, an economics professor and newly
elected Mayor of Addis Ababa; Birtukan Mideksa, a
former judge; and Yacob Hailemariam, a former UN
prosecutor in the Rwanda genocide trial in Tanzania.
Also charged, in their absence, were 30 government
opponents living abroad, mostly in the USA. Many of
the accused were prisoners of conscience. They denied
calling for violent protests, and on 28 November began
a hunger strike that lasted some weeks.

Other detentions and killings
Thousands of people remained in indefinite and mainly
incommunicado detention without charge or trial in
connection particularly with the armed conflicts in the
Oromia and Somali regions, and arrests continued
throughout the Oromia region. Thousands of Oromo
school students were detained - and many il l-treated
and some killed - in demonstrations in November and
December throughout the Oromia region in support of
the release of Oromo detainees and other political
demands.
A Diribi Demissie, President of the Mecha Tulema
Association, an offiCially registered Oromo community
welfare organization, was arrested in February with
three other members. He had been released on bail in
November 2004. The four were charged with armed
conspiracy and membership of the OLF, along with 24
others, including university students and two state
television journalists arrested in May 2004, Dabassa
Wakjira and Shifferaw I nsarmu. All denied the charges.
They were all acquitted by the High Court in June but
were immediately re-arrested after the prosecution
appealed to a d ifferent bench of the High Court. They
remained in custody at the end of 2005, with the 24
other co-accused.
a Some 900 alleged government opponents, all
members of the Anuak ethnic group, remained in
detention without trial in the south-west Gambela
region throughout 2005. Most had been arrested for
political reasons during the killings by the army and
civilian mobs in December 2003 in Gambela. Fifteen of
them, including former regional president Okello
Nyigello, were acquitted and freed in December.
Following a Commission of I nquiry into the killings,
seven soldiers were charged with murder. They had not
been tried by the end of 2005. Government soldiers
reportedly killed and arbitrarily detained Anuak
civilians on several occasions in 2005, including after
an attack by an armed Anuak group on a prison in
Gambela in November.
Human rights abuses were commi tted with
impunity by government forces against civi lians,

including the reported killing of over 20 civilians and
political prisoners in Kebri Dahar town i n the Somali
region in November.

Violence against women
In May the revised Criminal Code made female genital
mutilation a new criminal offence punishable by up to
10 years' imprisonment. I t also increased the punishment
for the traditional practice of bride abduction for the
purpose of marriage from three to up to 10 years'
imprisonment, and made the offence liable for
punishment as rape, removing the impunity previously
allowed to suspects who married the rape victim.
Women's organizations campaigned against harmful
traditional practices affecting women's rights and
against domestic violence.
Freedom of the media
The private press, which often criticized the
government, remained under pressure. The Ministry of
justice instigated further court action in 2005 against
the Ethiopian Free Press journalists Association (EFjA),
aiming to replace its leadership with a pro-government
group. A court ruled in favour of the EFjA. but in
December its president, Kifle Mulat, was charged with
treason in his absence, together with other journalists.
Most of the private press was shut down.
a I n December, three journalists were given prison
terms ranging from three to 15 months because of
articles published some years previously. Dozens of
other journalists and publishers arrested in previous
years were on bai l awaiting trial on charges under the
1992 Press Law.
a Three journalists were briefly detained during the
elections and released on bail.
a Fifteen journalists were arrested in the November
round-up of opposition leaders (see above) and
charged. Nearly all had previously been imprisoned
after unfair trials under the 1992 Press Law.
A new harsh Press Law, proposed by the government in
2003, was still under consideration but not yet enacted.

a Three prominent human rights defenders were
detained in the November arrests and charged with
treason: Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, the 75-year­
old founder and former president of the Ethiopian
Human Rights Council, who was in poor health; and
anti-poverty campaigners Daniel Bekelle, a senior
official of ActionAld, and Netsanet Demissie, president
of the Organisation for Social justice in Ethiopia.

Dergue trial update
The trial continued of 33 former senior government
officials on charges of genocide, torture and other
crimes. They had been in detention for 14 years. Other
trials continued in the absence of the defendants,
including former President Mengistu Hai lemariam,
whose extradition had been refused by the Zimbabwe
government.
The series of trials of less senior officials was stil l not
completed at the end of 2005. Over a dozen former
officials were under sentence of death at the end of
2005. Mekonnen Dori, 72, a prominent member of a
southern Ethiopia opposition party arrested in 1993,
who appeared to be a prisoner of conscience, was
acquitted of genocide and released in December.
Death pena lty
Several death sentences were imposed, but no
executions were reported. There were dozens of people
reportedly in prison after being sentenced to death in
previous years.

Legislative reforms were proposed to improve prison
services and provide protection against domestic
violence.
Reconciliation and Unity Commission
Pol itical power struggles continued among the civilian
and military elites. The government proposed
legislation to establish a Reconci l iation and Unity
CommiSSion with the power to recommend amnesty
for "poli tically motivated" crimes committed in
connection with the May 2000 coup and to grant
compensation to those affected by such crimes. The

by the m i litary, the politica l oPPOSition. a n d many
areas of civil society on this basiS. I n late 2005 a
parl iamentary committee recommended that the
amnesty proposal be amended to reflect
constitutional principles.

La ndmark ruling on discrimination
In April, two men were sentenced to two years'
imprisonment for homosexual acts. In August the High
Court overturned their conviction. It also declared
provisions in the penal code discriminatory and
unconstitutional in violating guarantees on privacy and
equality to the extent that they penalized consensual
sexual acts between males. The state appealed against
the ruling.
The Methodist Church held a ral ly i n June against
same-sex marriages, but two further applications for
large-scale marches were refused on the grounds that
they could encourage hate crimes.
Violence aga inst women
There was a 70 per cent increase in reported rapes and
attempted rapes since 2004, police said in November.
Where convictions were obtained for rape, prison
terms of up to 20 years were imposed.
In a report in November 2005 the Fiji law Reform
Commission recommended a comprehensive overhaul
of civil and criminal law responses to domestic
violence. It proposed imprOVing prosecutions,
strengthening protection and services for victims, and
adopting a national strategy to combat domestic
violence.
Law reform
Reform of the Prison Act was also among
recommendations made by the Fiji law Reform
Commission, which proposed a draft Corrections Bill to
bring prison services into line with international
human rights standards.

Impunity for police abuses
In Apnl, AI published a report demonstrating a lo-year
pattern of racist Ill-treatment and killings by the police.
The report highlighted failures in the J udicial system to
hold those responsible to account, and to provide
Victims of human rights Violations with the right to
redress and reparations. The report concluded that the
government's continued failure to address these
violations had led to a climate of impunity for law
enforcement officers, resulting in a "two-speed"
approach by officials which ensured that the
prosecution of cases brought by police officers
proceeded more quickly than those brought by the
victims of police abuse. The vast majority of such cases
Involved foreign nationals or French nationals of

o On 17 May, two policemen were given suspended
prison sentences after being conVicted of the senous
assault and racial abuse In 2002 of Kanm Latifi, a

proceedings were pursued only because Kanm Latlfi
initiated a pnvate prosecution.

roughly handled and detained for 12 hours after
challenging police treatment of a suspect restrained on
the ground in Montpellier in April 2004. He and others
subsequently published information about the case on
the Internet. He and an eyewitness testified in court
that he had not cal led the officers "Nazis" or "anti­
Semites", as al leged, but had peacefully protested that
the force used to arrest an unarmed man for a minor
publiC order offence was unacceptable.

Racism and discrimination
In February and March, the UN Committee on the
Elimination of RaCial DISCrImination conSidered
penodic reports by France on implementati on of the
UN Convention against Racism. The Committee
welcomed legislative measures to combat raCial
diSCrImination, including laws adopted in June 2004 to
ban the spread of racist messages on the I nternet and in
December 2004 to establish an offiCial body to
investigate and take action against discrimination.
However, the Committee recommended further
preventive measures, impartial investigation of all
complaints punishments proportionate to the gravity
of the crimes, and the publiCIZing of complaints and
compensation procedures.
In a report in February the Council of Europe's
European Commission against Racism and I ntolerance
(ECRI) acknowledged that France had taken steps to
combat racism and intolerance. These Included the
establishment of a free telephone helpline for
reporting racial discrimination and schemes to
facilitate the Integration of newly arrived Immigrants;
Improvements In Immigrant children's access to
education; and the creation of an independent police
and pnson oversight body, the National Commission on
EthiCS and Secunty. However, the ECRI pointed to
persistent complaints of Violence, humiliation, racist
verbal abuse and racial discnminatlO n by police and
gendarmerie officers, prison staff and personnel
working in reception centres or holding areas for
refugees and asylum-seekers.
A 38 per cent rise in complaints of police violence (97
in 2004, compared with 70 in 2003) was reported in
April by the National Commission on EthicS and
Security. In a third of cases, the violence was said to be
manifestly racist in character.
In March, the National Consultative Human Rights
Commission (CNCDH) published its annual report,
according to which the number of racist and anti­
Semitic attacks had almost doubled In 2004
compared with the previOUS year. The CNCDH
expressed its concern that anti-Semitism had become
"rooted" In society.
Anti-terrorism measures
Draft anti-terrorism law
A new antl-terronsm law proposed to the Council of
Min isters In October would remove safeguards
against torture or ill-treatment. Under the draft, the
pen od in which people suspected of terrorism could
be detained for Interrogation before being brought
before a judge (garde a vue) was to be extended from
Amnesty International Report 2006

F RA

four to SIX days. The M inister of I nterior, N icolas
Sarkozy, was reported as saying that such detainees
would have access to a lawyer only after 72 hours in
police custody. Combined with the continued failure
to videotape the interrogation of adult suspects, such
measures risked contributing to the effective
impunity of law enforcement officials for the torture
or i ll-treatment of detainees.
Other measures in the draft law were an expansion
of video and telephone surveillance; the monitoring of
public transport records; and new powers of official
access to connection data held by I nternet cafes and to
data on identity cards, passports, driving licences, car
registration documents, reSidence permits for non­
nationals and other personal records. The draft law
would also raise the sentence for heading a terrorist
organization from 20 to )0 years' imprisonment and,
under its provisions, people who had become
nationals through natural ization in the previous 1 5
years could have their French nationality withdrawn
and be expelled from the country (previously the l imit
was 10 years).
The proposed law was approved by both chambers of
parliament in December. It was then sent to the
Constitutional Council for approval.

Deportations
Cl In separate cases i n J uly and August, four Algerian
nationals were deported to Algeria where they were at
risk of torture or ill-treatment. The men were
reportedly suspected of a range of offences, including
promoting violence and religious hatred in mosques in
the Lyon and Paris areas. Three of them had served
prison sentences in France after being convicted on
charges including unauthorized entry to the country;
having links with terrorist networks; providing
paramilitary training to young Islamist activists; and an
attempted attack on a train.

Asylum rights curtailed
In April a three-year process of increasing restrictions
on asylum, included under a new asylum law i n
December 200), concluded with the implementation
of administrative measures. New regulations a llowed
less time for submitting asylum appl ications: asylum­
seekers were to be issued temporary residence
permits but had to complete their applications and
submit them in French within 21 days (previously
within a month).
A new list of 12 "safe" countries was adopted in June.
Under the new regulations the claims of people from
these countries are examined under a fast-track
procedure that lacks basic elements of protection.
Asylum-seekers are not granted a residence permit, do
not receive any support from the state, and have only
two weeks to submit their application in French. They
must be given a decision within two weeks, and may be
deported before any appeal is heard.
Under the new regulations, individuals held in a
detention centre and awaiting expulsion had only five
days to make an asylum application (previously they
had 12 days). The European Court of Human Rights
condemned Turkey for a similar procedure in 2000, on
Amnesty International Report 2006

the grounds that such a short time limit denied the
pOSSibil ity of adequate scrutiny of the asylum­
seeker's case.
A decree in May legalized the practice - already
implemented in certain prefectures from the beginning
of 2005 - of denYing language interpretation free of
charge to asylum applicants in detention centres.
Several administrative courts subsequently ruled that I t
was essential to provide interpreters, given that asylum
applications had to be submitted in French. I n J uly AI
and other non-governmental organizations filed an
appeal to overturn the decree before the State Council .
A t the close o f 2005 A I had still not received a response.
Domestic asylum law requires that applicants be given
the means to support their claim and that decisions and
information are communicated in a language the
applicant understands, whether in writing or through
an interpreter.

I neffective domestic remedies
On 27 January the European Court of Human Rights
ruled on the case of l Iich Ramirez Sanchez (often known
as "Carlos the Jackan. He was held in solitary
confinement after his arrest in 1994, was sentenced to
life imprisonment for murder in 1997 but remained
under investigation for other alleged crimes. He had
lodged an application with the Court in July 2004. The
Court was unanimous that the prisoner had been
unable to challenge his prolonged solitary confinement
because of the lack of any remedy in domestic law,
although it held that this did not violate the prohibition
of torture.

Reports of torture and ill-treatment by law
enforcement officers continued, despite efforts by
the authorities to address the issue. Some
perpetrators of attacks on religious minorities were
imprisoned but hundreds of others remained
unpu nished. Chechens sought by the Russian
Federation on terrorism charges a nd a Kurd wanted

judiciary appeared to be u nduly influenced by the
government There were allegations of government
interference with freedom of the media in pa rticu lar
in relation to television. The internationally
unrecognized breakaway areas of South Ossetia and
Abkhazia retained the death penalty.
Torture and ill-treatment
The authorities took a number of measures to tackle
torture and ill-treatment and several key government
offiCials publicly stated their commitment to fight such
abuses. The measures included legal amendments and
extensive monitoring of detention facilities, in particular
by the office of the Public Defender of Georgia
(Ombudsman). Eleven perpetrators of crimes amounting
to torture or ill-treatment were serving prison terms
handed down since the " Rose Revolution" in November
200J, In June Georgia recognized the competence of the
UN Committee against Torture to conSider individual
complaints and in August it acceded to the Optional
Protocol to the Convention against Torture.
Nevertheless, reports of torture and i l l-treatment
continued. The methods al legedly included putting
plastic bags over the detainee's head; plaCing a gun in
the detainee's mouth and threatening to shoot;
beatings, including with gun butts; kicking; and threats
against the detainee's family.
Most injuries inflicted by police were reportedly
sustained at the time of arrest. In some cases detainees
were reportedly tortured or i l l-treated in police
vehicles, in police stations, and in the Ministry of
I nternal Affairs. One detainee alleged that he was ill­
treated during a court hearing.
Many cases did not come to light because police
covered up their crimes and detainees were often
afraid to complain or identify the perpetrators for fear
of repercussions. There were shortcomings in the
implementation of legal safeguards aimed at
preventing torture and ill-treatment, such as prompt
access to a lawyer.
1 22

I mpunity for torture and i l l-treatment remained a
problem, and no victims of torture or ill-treatment
were known to have been awarded compensation.
According to the Human Rights Protection Unit of the
General Procuracy, 151 criminal cases or preliminary
investigations were opened and charges were brought
against 31 law enforcement officers during 2005.
However, procurators did not open investigations
into all potential torture and i l l-treatment cases in a
systematic manner. In dozens of cases where the
procuracy opened investigations the perpetrators
were not brought to justice. Many investigations were
not carried out in an impartial and independent
manner.
In March the UN Special Rapporteur on torture
issued a l ist of recommendations to the authorities
aimed at eradicating torture and ill-treatment, after
visiting Georgia in February. He recommended: that
judges and prosecutors should routinely ask detainees
how they had been treated; that any public official
indicted for abuse or torture should be suspended from
duty and prosecuted; and compensation, medical
treatment and rehabilitation for victims.
The European Committee for the Prevention of
Torture (CPT) stated in its report issued in June that in
Georgia, "criminal suspects ran a sign i ficant risk of
being i l l-treated by the police, and that on occasion
resort may be had to severe ill-treatment/torture".
In November AI urged the authorities to set up a
body independent of the police, procuracy and the
justice system to review investigations into
allegations of torture and i l l-treatment and judicial
proceedings in such cases. Such a body should have
the authority to present findings and make
recommendations to the relevant authorities and to
issue public reports. The organization also cal led on
the authorities to pay special attention to ending
torture and i l l-treatment in the regions of Georgia
outSide Tbilisi. AI called for masks and other clothing
that hides officers' personal identities to be
prohibited, other than in exceptional circumstances
when each officer should be identifiable by such
means as an identification number.
a Givi Janiashvili was arrested by more than 30
masked special unit police officers at his home in the
town of Rustavi on 12 May. He was unarmed, and said
that he put up no resistance. He was reportedly beaten
severely in front of his wife, his I J-year-old child and
several neighbours. A forensic expert who examined
him four days later found injuries consistent with his
account. Tbilisi city procuracy did not open an
investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment until
29 June.
In many cases investigations were not opened
promptly after complaints of torture or ill-treatment by
law enforcement officers.

he was transferred to a detention facility, where the
doctor who examined him found that his skin was
"sl ightly red" on his legs but diagnosed him as
"healthy". Two days later he was transferred to an
investigation-isolation prison, where Alexander
Mkheidze reiterated his al legations and a doctor
recorded bruising on his legs. Two weeks later he was
examined by a forensic expert who found bruises and
abrasions caused by a heavy blunt object consistent
with his a llegations.

Religious mi norities
There were several instances where members of
religious minorities were beaten and harassed by
supporters of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In some
cases, it was alleged that the attacks were incited by
Georgian Orthodox priests. Several perpetrators of
violent attacks on religious minorities in recent years
were imprisoned during 2005. However, hundreds
continued to enjoy impunity. Some of those who were
convicted were not tried for all the attacks they were
believed to have been involved in.
a On 3 1 January Vake-Saburtalo district court in
Tbilisi sentenced Basil Mkalavishvili, Petre Ivanldze
and Merab Korashinidze to six, four and one year's

rites or other religious rules and habits", "beatings"
and "arson". Other supporters of Basi l Mkalavishvili ­

Risk of expulsion
Chechen refugees sought by the Russian Federation on
terrorism charges and an ethnic Kurd wanted by
Turkey, who was a llegedly a member of the Kurdistan

country where they would be at risk of serious human
rights violations.
a In March, three young Russian citizens, Shengeli
Tsatiashvili and his younger brothers Suleiman and
Sosran, were reportedly detained in the Ministry of
Refugees and Accommodation in Tbilisi by officers of
the I nterior M i nistry's anti-terrorism group. They had
gone to the bUilding to register a n asylum claim for
the two younger men; the older brother had applied
for asylum in December 2004. They were reportedly
first taken to the offices of the anti-terrorism group
for questioning and then to the Red Bridge on the
border with Azerbaijan. They were left in the territory
between Georgia and Azerbaijan but managed to
return to Georgia. They returned to the Ministry of
Refugees and Accommodation, accompanied by
representatives of the Ombudsman's office and the
UN Association of Georgia, and registered the asylum
claim. Reportedly, there was no extradition request
for the three brothers and they were expelled
a lthough the authorities had not yet considered their
asylum applications.

force, Abkhazia had a de facto moratorium on
executions only.

evidence that had been provided by US authorities.
The court argued that it could not be proven that the
statements were obtained through torture or other ill­
treatment, apparently ignoring the widespread
evidence of torture and other ill-treatment in the
network of detention centres around the world used
by US authorities to hold terror suspects. The
statements reportedly comprised summaries of
interrogations of three people held by US authorities ­
Ramzi Binalshibh, Mohamed Ould Slahi and Khalid
Sheikh Mohammed.
In November, 1 3 of the 16 Uinder (regional states)
agreed to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to

Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony), Sachsen (Saxony) and
Sachsen-Anhalt (Saxony-Anhalt) refused to give their
reqUired approval .
Public debate continued o n whether there are
circumstances, including the threat of terrorism, that
justify the use of torture by law enforcement officials.

Refugees at risk
The Federal Agency for Migration and Refugees
continued to withdraw refugee status from individuals,
in particular refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and
Kosovo. When considering withdrawal of refugee
status, the Agency looked only at whether the situation
in the country of origin had changed. It did not
consider, as required by the UN Refugee Convention,
issues such as whether the authorities in the country of
origin could offer the returning refugees effective
protection. After refugee status had been withdrawn,
the reSidence permits of the indiViduals concerned
were often cancelled, putting them at risk of
deportation to their country of origin.
This policy began in 2004, when up to 16,800
refugees had their status withdrawn. In the first half of
2005, some 5,897 refugees lost their status, a slight drop
on the rate of the previous year, but 7,346 cases were
pending. In November the policy was confirmed by a
Federal Administration Court decision.
The German authorities continued to deport
foreigners to countries where the human rights
situation was extremely fragile. The German Aliens Act
a llows authorities to stop deportations to certain

The National Reconciliation Commission
On 22 April. the report of the National Reconci liation
Commission, investigating past human rights abuses
during Ghana's periods of unconstitutional
government between 1957 and 1993, was made public by
the government, together with a white paper accepting

recommendations had been implemented by the end of
the year. The government issued an apology to a l l those
who had been wronged by past governments.
The report concluded that the majority of human
rights abuses were attributed to the unconstitutional
governments. The recommendations included
reparation for and rehabilitation of victims, and paid
particular attention to rape and other sexual violence
against women. Specifics included a formal presidential
apology to victims of abuses by state agents, finanCial

Migra nts, refugees and members of minority groups
suffered human rights violations, including denial of
access to asylum procedures, ill-treatment in
detention and d iscrimination. Romani homes were
targeted for demolition in ways that breached
international sta ndards, a nd Roma faced
discrimination and racist attacks. A new law
improved the situation for conscientious objectors to
milita ry service, but still provided for punitive
a lternative civilian service.
Denial of refugee protection
The government contmued to faIl to comply with Its
oblIgations under internatIonal law m relation to
providing access to asylum procedures and the
prohIbition of refou/ement. On several occasIons
groups of people arrivmg in Greece seeking asylum
were forcibly expelled WIthout being gIven access to
asylum procedures. Cases were reported on Greece's
coastline and some islands, and at the border area of
Evros. DUrIng meetmgs WIth government officIals, AI
was told that such practices would be stopped, but
further cases were subsequently reported.
a On I April, 106 people who said they were
Palestinians, but whom the government maintained
were Egyptians, landed on the island of Crete seeking
asylum. They were reportedly expelled to Egypt 12 days
later without being given an opportunIty to file asylum
claIms. The group arrived In the Palaiochora area of
Crete after their boat sank Just off the coast. They were
escorted by police to a hotel, where they were detamed
for 10 days. The local police chief and the Deputy
Minister of Public Order initially refused to allow
Amnesty International Report 2006

human rIghts actiVIsts and lawyers to meet the group
and saId that a l l 106 would be immedIately expelled.
However, a meetmg with a lawyer present was allowed
on 7 April, during which the detamees said they wanted
to seek asylum in Greece. On 10 AprIl they were
escorted by police onto a ship bound for Athens. On
arrIval, they were detained at the Attica Aliens
Department and other police stations in Attica. AI
representatives who visited them on 12 AprIl witnessed
poor condItIons of detention and heard a llegations of
I l l-treatment by police. Later that day all 106 detainees
were put on a ship bound for Egypt.
a A group of 141 people shIpwrecked on Crete on 23
October were expelled to Egypt on 4 November,
reportedly without being given access to refugee
protection or lawyers.

Detention and il l-treatment of irregular
migra nts and asylum-seekers
Asylum-seekers and people WIthout legal permission to
be in the country (irregular mIgrants), including
unaccompanied minors, were arbItrarily detamed,
often in poor conditions which may have amounted to
cruel, mhuman and degrading treatment. Asylum­
seekers and irregular migrants a lleged that they were
I l l-treated by police officers and in detention centres.
Several Irregular migrants who arrIved on the Island
of ChlOs m April were detained in conditions that
amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,
including being held in a metal container close to the
island's main harbour. On 19 Apri l, human rIghts
actIvists on the Island demonstrated against the use of
the metal contamer to hold m igrants.
Police ill-treatment
On 13 December m the case of Bekos and Koutropou/os
v Greece, the European Court of Human RIghts found
that Greece had violated provisions of the European
Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which prohibit
torture and other ill-treatment, and disCrImmation in
the enjoyment of ECHR rights. The two applicants,
Greek Roma who were arrested in 199B, were taken to
Mesolonghl polIce station where polIce officers beat
them WIth a truncheon and Iron bar, slapped and kicked
them, threatened them WIth sexual assault, and
verbally abused them. The police officers m question
were cleared of ill-treatment by both the mternal
police mqulry and the trIal that ensued. In its Judgment,
the European Court of Human RIghts found that the two
Roma had suffered mhuman and degradmg treatment
at the hands of the police, that the authOrIties faIled to
conduct an effective investigation into the inCIdent,
and that the authorities failed to investigate possible
racist motives behind the incident.

Update: the killing ofVullnet Byty�i
On s June the polIce officer charged with fatally
woundmg Vullnet Byty�i was found guI lty of
manslaughter and received a suspended prison
sentence of two years and three months. Vullnet
Bytyp, an I B-year-old Albanian natIonal . was shot as

one o f the five Albanians who had attempted to cross
the border with Vul lnet BytY�1 to three months'
ImprISonment, suspended for three years, for i llegal
entry, and fined him.

Discrimination aga inst minorities
Romani families continued to be targeted for eviction
and demol ition of their homes In ways that
contravened international human rights standards,
including the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and anti-discrimination laws.
d On 23 and 24 June, during a "cleaning operation" by
Patras local muniCipality, II of around 20 homes
belonging to Albanian Roma legally reSiding in Greece
were demolished, including one that still contained the
family's belongings. There were also reports of arson
attacks against the Romani settlement in Patras on 2 1 ,
23 and 24 J une. No investigation into the attacks
appeared to have been initiated by the end of the year.
In October, according to the Greek Helsinki Monitor,
parents of Romani children attending the elementary
school of Psarl, outside Athens, were pressured by local
and education authorities to sign declarations asking
for their children to be moved to segregated, all­
Romani education facilities far from the Romani
settlement. The reports followed racist protests by
parents of non-Romani pupils demanding the removal
of Romani children from the school.
The authorities continued to refuse to re-issue
Citizenship documents to members of the Muslim
population of western Thrace. According to legal
provisions abrogated in 1998, Greek citizens who were
not of ethniC Greek origin could have their citizenship
withdrawn If they were believed by the authorities to
have emigrated to another country. People from this
minority were classified as "non-citizens": some of
them had lost their citizenship because they had left the
country at some point in their lives. I n most cases, the
authorities did not take adequate steps to ensure that
the people concerned were informed of the decision to
withdraw their citizenship in time to appeal against
these deCisions. Such people continued to be denied
access to state benefits such as security benefits and
pension a llowances.
Conscientious objection to mil ita ry service
In November parliament approved an amended law on
military service, which revised the conditions of
alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors.
The new law allowed people who have lost their claim to
conscientious objection status to reapply. However, the
length of alternative civilian service remained punitive
and the law stili fell short of international standards. In
particular, the board responsible for granting
conscientious objection status was not under a civilian
authOrity; professional soldiers were not al lowed to
change their views and become conscientious objectors;
conscientious objectors were not al lowed to vote or
form unions; and the right to conscientious Objection
could be suspended during war.
D In August the military court of Xanthi convicted
conscientious objector Boris Sotlrladis to three and a

1 26

half years in prison for d isobedience. He was
consequently imprisoned between 22 August and 20
September but was released pending appeal. The
appeal had not been heard by the end of the year. On 9
November the military court of loannina found him not
guilty of a further charge of disobedience.

Violence aga inst women
I nter-minis terial efforts to combat trafficking In human
beings continued . Several initiatives were started ,
including the establishmen t of shelters offering
protection to victims of trafficking. However, the
shelters remained empty, reportedly because of the
difficulties experienced by victims of trafficking In
obtaining official designatio n as such. In order for
victims to access shelter protection, they needed to
have filed complaint s against their traffickers and could
only be designated "victims of trafficking" by the
prosecutor to whom the complaint was addressed.
In December the government presented non­
governmental organizations (NGOs) with a draft law on
domestic Violence, expected to pass through
parliament in 2006. Successive governments had
worked on domestic violence legislation for three
years. While the draft contained a provision
criminalizing marital rape, the proposed law failed to
define "violence between family members" or to
recognize it as a form of discrimination against women.
It a lso failed to provide for the establishment and
organization of institutions for the protection of
victims of domestic Violence (including shelters and
medical care); to make training on domestic Violence
compulsory for police and judicial personnel; or to
allow NGOs to file suits in domestic violence cases. The
law also failed to allocate fund for activities aiming
to combat and prevent domestic violence.

G UATE MA LA
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA
Head of state and government: 6scar Berger Perdomo
Death pena lty: rete n tio n ist
International Criminal Court: not signed
UN Women's Convention and its Optional Protocol:
ratified.

Record numbers of women were kil led; the
government's response remained i neffective and
inadequate a nd there were few successful
prosecutions of those responsible. Human rights
defenders faced repeated threats and intimidation,
especially at times of nationwide protest against
government economic policies. Hundreds of cases of
disputes between rural communities a nd la ndowners
remai ned unresolved. Those responsible for past
human rights violations, including genocide,
committed during the internal armed conflict, were
not brought to justice.
Background
In March, Congress ratified a free trade agreement
(known as CAFTA) with the USA, the Dominican
Republic and other Central American states. This and
other economic policies, such as the expansion of
mining activities by foreign companies and proposed
privatization of parts of the public sector, caused
significant protest nationwide. At least two
demonstrators were killed, allegedly by members of the
security forces, and many were injured during
demonstrations.
The government issued public apologies in four
cases of past human rights violations committed
during the internal armed conflict. One public
apology, for the 1 982 Plan de Sanchez massacre of
more than 250 indigenous villagers by state forces,
had been ordered by the I n ter-American Court of
Human Rights.
An Office of the UN H igh Commissioner for Human
Rights was established i n September.
More than 650 people died in Guatemala in the wake
of Hurricane Stan which caused extensive damage and
casualties in Central America in October.
Efforts to make progress on a UN-backed proposal to
establish a commission to investigate illegal
organizations and clandestine groups failed to
materialize despite previous government assurances.
The proposed commission had been rejected by
Congress in 2004.
Violence against women
According to police figures, up to 665 women were
murdered in Guatemala, an increase from the 527 killed
in 2004. The attacks were often accompanied by sexual
violence and extreme brutality. Little progress was
made in bringing those responsible to justice. I n
January cases were transferred to a new investigating
Amnesty International Report 2006

agency with more resources, but this did not result in
successful prosecutions.
A law which considers sexual relations with a female
minor a crime only if the woman is "honest" remained
in force. However, a law which allowed rapists, in
certai n cases, to escape prosecution i f they marry their
victim, was suspended in December by the
Constitutional Court, the country's highest court.
a N ineteen-year-old Claudina Velazquez's body was
found on 13 August. She had died from a gunshot wound
to the head. There were bruises on her cheek and knee
and traces of semen were found. There were serious
concerns about the effectiveness of the investigation.
For example, tests on the principal suspects, to
ascertain i f they had fired a gun, were not carried out
and the investigating prosecutor attempted to return
her clothes to the family, who insisted that they be kept
as a potential source of future evidence.

Economic, social and cultural rights
Twenty-two evictions of rural communities were
reported to have been carried out in 2005. The
authorities showed undue partiality towards
individual, normally wealthy, landowners in issuing
eviction orders. The evictions themselves were
characterized by destruction of homes and excessive
use of force which sometimes resulted in injuries.
Threats and intimidation
During 2005, 224 attacks on human rights activists and
organizations were reported. The timing and nature of
many of these attacks suggested the involvement of
i llegal clandestine groups.
The Rapporteur for Guatemala of the I nter­
American Commission on Human Rights visited in July
and noted the d i fficult situation faced by human rights
defenders. While commending the government's
public declaration of support for defenders, the
Rapporteur concluded that impunity was a structural
problem and little progress was being made in
investigating present and past human rights violations
against activists.
a In January, Makrina Gudiel, a campaigner against
corruption and the daughter of a prominent human
rights defender who was murdered i n December 2004,
was attacked. Her car was drenched in gasoline in an
attempt to burn her al ive. She managed to escape and
remained in hiding for most of 2005.
a In May, the office of a national rural workers'
organization was raided. Computers were taken
containing important information on the organization's
work and members, while many other objects of value
were left behind. The organization had been active in
opposing CAFTA and forced evictions of rural
communities.
Impunity
There was no progress in trying past cases of genocide
or crimes against humanity in Guatemala.
In February, the Constitutional Court halted a trial in
the case of the 1982 massacre in Dos Erres, in which
over 200 people were kil led by the Guatemalan Army.
1 27

GUI

The Court determined that due process had been
violated. The case was pending at the end of the year.
a In September, the Spanish Constitutional Court
ruled that the case for alleged genocide against
Guatemalan General Rios Montt, military ruler of
Guatemala between 1981-82, and other officers, could
proceed in Spain.

Death pena lty
I n April President Berger announced he would seek to
abolJsh the death penalty. LegislatIOn was presented to
Congress in May where it remained pending at the end
of the year.
In two separate cases in June and September, the
I nter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that
articles of the Criminal Code relating to the
application of the death penalty for murder and
kidnapping were unclear and therefore could not be
applied. The Court ordered a reprieve for the two
prisoners who presented their cases and for a further
18 prisoners condemned to death for kidnapping. I f
Implemented, the judgments could reduce those on
death row from the current 29 to n ine.
No executions took place in 2005.

Severa l people were arrested following a n attempt to
assassinate the head of state in January. Police used
excessive force to disperse a protest march. Freedom
of expression remained u nder threat. Death
sentences continued to be imposed; no executions
were reported.
Background
I n January, an unidentified group wearing military
uniforms attempted to assassinate President Conte.
The authorities said that the attackers escaped after
gunshots were fired at a presidential convoy. Several
people, including military officers, were arrested.
In September, following clashes between different
ethnic groups in Nzerekore that left several people
injured, the authorities imposed a curfew and arrested
at least 20 people.
The opposition, which had boycotted presidential
elections in 2003, took part in local elections in
December 2005. The ruling Party for Union and
Progress won most urban districts and rural
development communities. Opposition parties accused
the authorities of rigging the polls.
Excessive use of force
I n November, police allegedly used excessive force
against high-school students during a protest march
over a lack of teachers in Telemele, 250km north of the
capital Conakry. Two students were kil led and a third
person who was shot died later in hospital.
Detention without trial
Around 11 military officers, including Amadou Diallo
and Alama Conde, held since November 2003 on
suspicion of plotting to overthrow PreSident Conte,
were still in detention without charge or trial at the end
of the year. I t was learned during 2005 that Moussa
Toure, a military officer arrested in 2003, had died i n
detention i n September 2004 a n d had been denied
medical care.
Attacks on freedom of expression
In August, the authorities ended the state monopoly on
broadcasting. A new law allows private citizens and
organizations to broadcast, but not political parties or
religious movements. Freedom of expression
continued to be curtai led, with journal ists, lawyers
and others who criticized state representatives at risk
of beatings, arrests and imprisonment.

The risks of conflict a nd insta bility remained high,
Political tension increased in the run-up to
presidential elections in July, and the election of
former President Joao Bernardo "Ni no" Vieira failed
to calm the situation. The police used firearms to
disperse a demonstration, killing four people and
injuring severa l others. There was no investigation
into this incident.
Background
Economic and social conditions remained dire and
continued to threaten the stability of the country,
ranked the sixth poorest In the world. In january, a
Amnesty International Report 2006

locust invasion threatened the cashew nut harvest, the
country's main cash crop. Following a donors'
conference in February, the government relied on
international donors to pay salary arrears, especially to
the armed forces, and to finance elections.
International donors also pledged assistance to
restructure the armed forces.
In March, a UN delegation visited the country to
assist in efforts to combat the proliferation of illegally
circulating small arms, estimated at around 175,000.
Former President joao Bernardo "Nino" Vieira was
sworn in as PreSident in October having won the
second round of presidential elections in july. The
elections were declared free and fair by international
observers. The delay in taking office arose because his
opponent, Malam Bacai Sanha, of the ruling African
Party for the I ndependence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape
Verde ( Partido Africano da I ndependencia da Guine e
Cabo Verde, PAl GC), contested the results and
demanded a recount of the votes.
At the end of October the new President dismissed
the government. Three days later he appointed Aristide
Gomes as Prime Minister. Aristide Gomes had been
expelled from the PAIGC in May for supporting
President Vieira in the presidential election. The PAIGC
rejected the appointment as unconstitutional. The
dismissed Prime M inister refused to hand over office
and demonstrators in Bissau protesting against the new
appointment burned tyres and caused some material
damage. There were no arrests.
In October the government declared that it had
fulfilled its obligations under the Ottawa Convention by
destroying its stockpile of about 5,000 landmines.
However, several minefields remained to be cleared.
There was conflict between Muslim groups in the city
of Gabu in the east in February. A month later, the
authorities accused the Muslim group Ahmadi of failing
to co-operate with other Muslim groups and banned it
from carrying out its activities. The group had been
banned and arbitrarily expelled from the country in
2001 by then PreSident Kumba lala, but in january 2005
the ban had been lifted following a court order.

Political violence and impunity
Political tension heightened around the presidential
elections and the army was placed on high alert.
Tension was exacerbated by the Supreme Court's delay
in making a decision to a llow two former presidents to
stand in the elections. Kumba l a la of the Social Renewal
Party ( Partido da Renova�ao Social, PRS) was
overthrown from power in September 2003 and banned
from seeking political office for eight years. joao
Bernardo "Nino" Vieira, a refugee in Portugal since
being ousted in 1999, was forbidden to seek political
office by the Constitution. Kumba lala threatened to
seize power if his candidacy was rejected. I n May, the
Supreme Court ruled that the two could stand.
Opposition parties criticized the ruling as politically
motivated. Despite the ruling, Kumba lala declared
himself PreSident and occupied the presidential palace
for a few hours. The army broke up a demonstration by
PRS supporters and pledged loyalty to the government.
1 29

G UY

In June, Kumba la la rejected the results of the first
ballot. The PRS organized a demonstration in his
support, which led to violence in which people lost
their lives. The Rapid Intervention Police reportedly
beat demonstrators and used tear gas and live
ammunition to disperse them, killing four and injuring
about six others. There were reports that some of the
demonstrators were armed with sticks, stones and
guns. About 50 people were reportedly arrested,
Including Artur Sanha, Secretary General of the PRS. All
were released uncharged after two days, pending an
investigation. However, no investigation was carried
out by the end of 2005.
A week before the second ballot, in July, a group of
armed men wearing military uniforms attacked the
M inistry of Interior. Two police officers were killed and
several people were injured in the attack. Twenty
people were reportedly arrested. The Army Chief of
Staff blamed the attack on people acting outside the
military command structure. No investigation into this
incident was known to have taken place.
Similarly, there was no investigation into the killing
in September 2004 of the Chief-of-Staff of the Armed
Forces. Soldiers arrested in 2002 and released in 2004
pending trial were not tried.

Freedom of expression
In September the government dismissed the directors
of the national television and radio stations. There
were reports that the dismissals were politically
motivated and related to the two men's a lleged support
for the PreSident-elect, Joao Bernardo "Nino" Vieira.

There were reports of killings by a "death squad"

vast numbers of cases of sexual violence against
women to tria I.

Guyana formally adopted the Caribbean Court of
Justice, inaugurated in April, as its highest appellate
court. Since independence in 1970, the Court of Appeal

'Death squad'
In April a Presidential Commission found that there was
no evidence of "a credible nature" l inking the Home
Affairs M inister to the activities of an al leged "death
squad". In June, following international pressure, the
M inister resigned. According to reports, several
witnesses failed to appear before the Commission
because of fears for their safety.
I n August a high court overturned the decision of a
lower court to charge an alleged hit-woman with the
J une 2004 murder of George Bacchus. He was shot dead
days before he was due to testify in a trial related to
"death squad" kills.
The separate killings of five people between August
and September were attributed in the news media to
"death squad" activities.
Violence against women
According to a report by the Guyana Human Rights
Association, in only nine out of 647 rapes reported from
2000 to 2004 was the perpetrator convicted. The report
detailed a rise of some 30 per cent in the incidence of
sexual violence against women, and a 16-fold increase
in statutory rape cases from 2000 to 2004. Only three
per cent of rape cases filed over the five-year period
resulted in a trial. The report pointed to "deficiencies
and weaknesses in the justice system".

Background
2005 was marked by instability and violence,
particularly in Port-au-Prince, the capital. The large
quantity of small arms in circulation fuelled criminal
activities and human rights abuses. The number of
kidnappings for ransom Increased dramatically with
over 1,000 cases between March and December. All
sectors of society were targeted, along with foreign
nationals. Among the victims was one of Haiti's best­
known journalists and poets, jacques Roche, who was
kidnapped and murdered in july. Many children were
abducted to extort money from their parents. At least
20 Haitian National Police (HNP) officers were arrested
for taking part in kidnappings.
The security situation improved general ly across
the country, a lthough armed gangs in the capital,
particularly in the Cite Soleil district, continued to
defy both the H N P and soldiers from the U N
Stabllization M ission i n Haiti ( M I NUSTAH). Clashes
between armed gangs and M I NUSTAH military and
H N P officers continued throughout 2005 - most of
those killed and injured were unarmed civilian men,
women and chi ldren, although several gang leaders
were also killed. Reports of unlawful ki l l i ngs, rape,
extortion and arson continued to be frequent in the
impoverished neighbourhoods controlled by armed
gangs.
M I NUSTAH had its mandate extended until February
2006 and its strength increased to more than 8,000
military personnel and UN police officers. In March,
M I NUSTAH forces reclaimed two police stations in Petit
Goiive and Terre-Rouge that had been occupied since
2004 by former officials of the Haitian Armed Forces
(FADH), disbanded in 1 995, and former rebels. M I NUSTAH
Amnesty International Report 2006

acknowledged responsibility for t h e deaths o f
civilians during mil itary operations carried o u t i n Cite
Solei I in j uly.
I n April, Remlssainthe Ravix. the self-proclaimed
leader of the demobilized armed forces, was killed In a
clash with police. Disarmament of the ex-FADH officers
and former rebels was not implemented by the end of
2005. Former members of the FADH pressed the interim
government to pay them compensation for their
demobilization in 1995 and to reinstate their pension
fund. The interim government agreed to pay US$28
million in compensation to the ex-FADH officers.
without making the payment conditional on
implementing a disarmament and demobilization
programme. In addition, hundreds of ex-FADH officers
were incorporated into the H N P without proper vetting
of their past human rights record.
Delegations from the UN Security Council and the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights visited
Haiti in Apri l. Both delegations raised concerns about
the human rights situation. The UN Security Council
strengthened M I NUSTAH's mandate to give it a more
vigorous role in professionalizing the H N P. after
numerous reports of human rights violations by police
officers. I n june the Minister of Justice resigned and the
Director of Police was dismissed after criticism from the
international community over the administration of
justice and the failures of the HNP to comply with
international standards of policing.
Local, legislative and presidential elections were
initially scheduled for October and November but were
postponed on four occasions until early 2006.
Shortcomings in organizing the bal lot and delays in
registering more than 4 m i llion potential voters,
particularly those l iving in impoverIShed
neighbourhoods and rural areas, gave rise to serious
concerns over the capability of the interim government
and the Provisional Electoral Council (Conseil Electoral
Provisoire, CEP) to organize the elections according to
international standards. The CEP endorsed 43 political
parties and 35 presidential candidates, only one of
them a woman.
There was continued concern about the
independence of the judiciary after the interim
government dismissed five members of the Supreme
Court follOWing their decision to a llow a candidate with
US and Haitian nationality to stand for president.

Violence against women
Gender-based Violence. in particular rape of women by
gang members, was reported increasingly frequently in
impoverished neighbourhoods of the capital.
Long overdue reforms to the Criminal Code to
address flaws in the criminalization of gender-based
violence. including rape, were finally introduced in
October by a PreSidential decree. Under the amended
Criminal Code rape was defined as a Criminal offence ­
previously it was considered a moral offence ­
punishable by up to 10 years' forced labour. However,
the majority of rapes were not reported to the
authorities for fear of reprisal or because of lack of
confidence in the authorities and the Justice system.

The interim government failed to combat the culture of
tolerance of violence against women and to provide
assistance for victims of sexual violence.

Killings a nd attacks by illega l a rmed groups
I l legal armed groups or gangs kil led dozens of
Civilians. Twelve police officers were also kil led
during 2005. Gangs a l legedly supporting former
PreSident jean-Bert rand Aristide comm itted most of
the killings. I nter-gang warfare decreased a fter a gang
leader linked to the Lavalas opposition was ki lled in
February.
a On 31 May, an armed group allegedly supporting the
Lavalas party attacked Tet-Boeuf public market in Port­
au-Prince and set it on fire. More than 15 people
reportedly died in the attack.
o On 10 August, groups armed with machetes (widely
known as "attachesi, allegedly acting in collusion with
HNP officers, reportedly killed at least 10 people in the
Delmas 2 and Bel-Air neighbourhoods of the capital.
Excessive force and unlawful killi ngs by police
The HNP continued to use excessive force and there
were several al legations of extrajudiCial executions.
The victims included criminal suspects, a journalist and
Lavalas supporters.
a On 14 january, HNP officers al legedly killed Abdias
jean, a Miami-based radiO reporter, while he was
covenng a police operation in Village de Dieu, Port-au­
Prince. The police denied the killing. Local residents
claimed that Abdias jean was kil led because he was
investigating the deaths of four alleged bandits killed
during the police operation. According to witnesses, he
identified himself to the police officers as a journalist
before he was shot dead.
a On 27 April, H N P officers opened fire on a peaceful
demonstration in front of M I NUSTAH headquarters.
Five people were killed and several others wounded.
a On 20 August, the H N P interrupted a football match
attended by about 5,000 people in the Martissant
stadium. According to reports, H N P officers ordered
everyone to lie down while " attaches"belonging to a
group called the Small Machetes Army (Lame Ti
manchet) attacked people identified by the police as
criminal suspects. The stadium was surrounded by
police officers and "attaches "who shot or hacked to
death those who attempted to flee. Nine people were
killed and four injured. At least 13 police officers were
arrested in connection with the killings.
Prisoners of conscience, political prisoners
Scores of detainees were held for long periods without
legal basis and denied a fair trial. In November, Louis
joinet, the UN Independent Expert on Haiti, expressed
concern about the lack of transparency of the justice
system and the unjustifiable delays in bringing
detainees to trial. He cal led for the release of all
political prisoners.
The UN Security Council and other international
bodies urged the interim government to expedite the
cases of political prisoners, in particular that of former
Prime Minister Yvon Neptune.
1 32

a Former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune, imprisoned
since june 2004, staged a hunger strike in March and
April in protest at his prison conditions and detention
without trial. In june, the investigative magistrate
finally indicted Yvon Neptune and 30 other individuals
for their involvement in an alleged massacre at La
Scierie in February 2004. At the end of 2005, he was still
awaiting trial.
a On 21 july, Father Gerard jean-juste, a CatholiC
pnest and Aristide supporter, was taken into police
custody after a mob attacked him outside the church
where journalist jacques Roche's funeral took place.
Considered a potential presidential candidate for the
Lavalas party, Father jean-juste was il legally arrested
and held on trumped-up charges. He was a prisoner of
conscience.
a Annette Auguste (known as S6 Ann). a grass-roots
organizer and folk singer, remained imprisoned without
having been formally charged. The 65-year-old woman
was arrested on II May 2004 by US Marines, part of the
Multinational Interim Force deployed in Haiti hours
after former PreSident Aristide went into exile. Annette
Auguste was handed over to the Haitian authorities,
who imprisoned her in the Petion-Ville Penitentiary.
The reason for her initial detention was unclear but she
remained imprisoned without trial on suspicion of
inciting Lavalas supporters to attack university
students in December 200).

Journalists u nder attack
journalists were harassed and subjected to abuse
throughout 2005. In September the Council of the Wise
(Conseil des Sages), a body of notable citizens created
to guide the interim government, publicly threatened
to prosecute journalists who broadcast the views of
opposition leaders advocating the return to Haiti of
former PreSident Aristide.
a On 14 january, Le Nouvellistenewspaper reporters
Claude Bernard Serrat and jonel juste were assaulted
by mobs in Bel-Air, a stronghold of Aristide supporters.
The mobs reportedly accused the press of contributing
to the ousting of the former president.
a Kevin Pina, a US journalist and film maker, and
jean Ristil, a Haitian journalist working for the
Associated Press, were arrested on 9 September while
monitoring a search at Father jean-juste's church (see
above). They were accused of showing disrespect to the
magistrate executing the warrant, but were released
without charge four days later.
a On 3 October, PreSident Boniface Alexandre's
security guards attacked Guyler C. Delva, a Reuters
correspondent, and jean Wilkens Merone, a Radio
Metropole reporter. Both journalists were covering a
ceremony marking the beginning of the judicial year
when they were dragged into a courthouse and
severely beaten.
I mpu nity
There was no effective system to administer justice,
uphold the rule of law and provide impartial protection
of human rights. Abuses committed by HNP offiCials
were committed with impunity. I nvestigations into
Amnesty International Report 2006

HON

most polIce violations, when conducted, did not meet
international standards. Prosecutions and convictions
for human rights violations were non-existent.
The authorities also failed to address human nghts
violations committed in previous years, including long­
standing cases of pol itical killings and massacres.
Former military leaders accused of human rights
violations during the 1991-1994 military government
continued to enjoy impunity. I nvestigations into the
cases of murdered Journalists Brignol Lindor and Jean
Dominlque were at a standstill.
tSl I n May, the Supreme Court overturned the
sentences passed i n the Raboteau massacre trial on
the grounds of a technical error. The court argued that
the tnal, i n 2000, should not have taken place before a
jury. Thirty-four former members of the military and
parami l i tary groups had been sentenced to prison
terms of two to 10 years. The Raboteau trial was
considered by human rights organizations as a
m ilestone in fighting impunity in Haiti. Most of those
convicted in the case had escaped from prison i n
early 2004.
a In August, LoUIs Jodel Chamblaln, former second in
command of a paramil itary group during the 1991-1994
military government, was freed from jail without any
legal grounds. He was awaiting his second trial for the
Raboteau massacre. He had been sentenced i n absentia
in 2000 and he turned himself in after President
Aristide was ousted in 2004. According to Haitian law,
those sentenced in absentia face a re-trial once they
return to Haiti.

Disarma ment
little progress was made towards disarmament. A
National Commission on Disarmament was created i n
February but only became operational In July. Repeated
calls from the UN Secunty Council to implement
without delay a disarmament programme remained
unheeded. Lack of political will to disarm i llegal armed
groups undermined efforts to establish peace and a
secure environment throughout the transition process.
M I NUSTAH initiated small-scale disarmament
programmes as pilot projects at a community level, but
faced opposition from sectors of Haitian society.

The killing, torture, imprisonment on fabricated
criminal charges and harassment of human rights
defenders and indigenous community activists
continued. Complaints of violence against women in
the fa mily continued to soar.
Background
In November elections, Manuel Zelaya of the
opposition Liberal Party was elected President.
In June, Honduras had over half ItS external debt
written off as part of a programme for heavily Indebted
poor countnes. Some 64 per cent of the population
lived In poverty, and Honduras ranked 116 out of 177
countries i n the UN Human Development Index.
Hurricanes left dozens dead, thousands homeless and
crops destroyed.
Attacks on human rights defenders
Activists defending the environment and the nghts of
indigenous people were among those killed, tortured
and imprisoned. The government showed little polItical
will to end the abuses, instigated i n most cases by
powerful landowners or logging Interests.
a Edickson Roberto Lemus, regional coordinator of a
leading peasant farmer organization, the National
Union of Farm Workers, was killed on 24 May. An
unidentified individual shot him on a bus. He was on his
way to visit the peasant group Renacer (Rebirth) in the
community of El Pajuiles, Yoro department, which had
been served with an eviction order on 19 May. The
authorities had reportedly said they could provide no
protection after he received threats. By the end of 2005
no one had been identified or detained i n relation to hiS
killing.
a FelIciano Pineda, a community leader In the
mUnicipality of Gracias, Lemplra department, was
attacked and senously injured in June. He was
handcuffed and arrested on hiS arrival at hospital, and
subsequently imprisoned before he could receive
proper medical treatment. Criminal charges brought
against him were reported ly fabricated. In December
he was acquitted of the charge of homicide but
remained in pnson on other lesser charges, despite the
fact that the time l imit for bringing him to trial on these
charges had lapsed.
a The case of convicted Indigenous community
leaders MarcelIno and Leonardo Mlranda, who were
attempting to have 25-year prison sentences
overturned, was still before the courts. They were
convicted after a politically motivated trial because of

their work to resolve local land disputes and defend
indigenous rights. Both men were repeated ly tortured
In pre-trial detention . An appeal on procedur al defects
submitted to the Supreme Court in 2004 was rejected in
August. In October a new appeal, on defective
applicatio n of the law, was submitted to the Supreme
Court. A decision was pending at the end of 2005.

Violence agai nst women
Special domestic violence courts were reported ly
overwhe lmed with growing numbers of complain ts,
said to total over 30,000 between 2000 and mid-2005 ·
Accordin g to the Special Prosecuto r for Women's
Affairs, three out of 10 women who submitted
complain ts were eventual ly killed by their attacker . I n
August, Deputy Attorney General Omar Cerna was
reported as acknowl edging that al legations of violence
In the family were not taken seriously enough.
a In January, Marta Beatriz Reyes died after being set
on fire while she slept, reported ly by her estranged
husband . Taken to hospital in San Pedro Sui a with
second and third degree burns to 40 per cent of her
body, she died II days later. After endurin g years of
violence, she had left her husband. Although she
submitted several complai nts to the police, they failed
to protect her or take action.
Children a nd young people
A high level of killings of children and young people
persisted, with 431 deaths in 2005. Government
initiatives to investigate and bring those responsible to
justice, promised in previous years, did not materialize,
and the perpetrators continued to enjoy impunity.
a The case of four young people who were killed in
1995 In Tegucigalpa was submitted to the I nter­
American Court of Human Rights in February following
failure by the government to act on recommendations
made by the Inter-American CommiSSion on Human
Rights. The four were among around 120 people
detained by the police in September 1995· Their bodies
were found two days later in different parts of the city;
each had been shot several times in the back of the
head. The case was representative of thousands of
similar cases that the authorities have failed to
investigate.

Racist attacks on Roma and other minorities, a nd
discri mination against Roma in all sectors of
public services, continued. There was official
acknowledgement that segregation in schools had
increased for Romani children, a quarter of whom
were being ta ught separately despite anti­
discrimi nation legislation. In education, health ca re
and housing, the Romani popUlation continued to
face deprivation and discrimination. legislation
to tackle violence against women in abusive
relationships was delayed.
Racism and discrimination
Racist attacks and other racially motivated crimes
continued to target Romani and JeWish communities.
Public statements by senior political figures and the
news media fostered racism and intolerance. Prime
Minister Ferenc Gyurcsfmy apologized after referring to
the Saudi Arabian football team as " full of terrorists" in
February. The Vice-Chairman of Parliament's Human
Rights Commission, Zsolt Semjen, also came in for
criticism in February for a homophobic jibe at a rival
political party.
In February the Constitutional Court declared
provisions in a housing decree to be discriminatory and
unconstitutional. The decree declared people ineligible
for social housing if they had previously occupied
accommodation without legal entitlement. The Court
held that the decree had a disproportionately negative
effect on Roma, and conflicted with local government
obligations to house the socia l ly deprived. Romani
families reportedly received eviction notices even
during a moratorium on winter evictions.
a By denying two Romani men entrance to a disco
bar in Nagyhalasz, ItS owners had Violated their dignity
and infringed legal requirements of equal treatment,
the Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg County Court held in June.
Under comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation
from 2003, the Court awarded 150,000 Hungarian
forints (US$695) to each man as victims of racial
discrimination. The disco bar was ordered to refrain
from further discrimination against Roma.
In September, the European Roma Rights Centre
based in Budapest, the capital, issued a report on
Romani children's rights in Hungary, in advance of a
periodic review of Hungary's obligations by the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child in J anuary 2006.
The report described how Romani children
Amnesty International Report 2006

INO

experienced segregation in education, health care
and housing, and said that disproportionately high
numbers were removed from their families by the
state. More than half of Romani households did not
have access to hot running water, and 17 per cent of
the Romani population l ived in settlements where
there is no doctor.
In November the Commissioner for Integration of
Disadvantaged and Roma Children at the Hungarian
Ministry of Education confirmed that the segregation of
Romani children remained a serious problem. At least
3,000 elementary school c lasses and 178 schools were
predominantly made up of Romani students, and 25 per
cent of Romani students were being taught in a
segregated environment.
The police reportedly downplayed the discriminatory
motivation of physical assaults on Roma and other
minorities, and this reluctance was claimed to have led
to punishments for the perpetrators of violent crimes
that did not reflect the gravity of the offence.
a The case of 15-year-old Roma J6zsef Patai, who was
stabbed on a bus in Budapest in May, was initially
treated as a racist crime. However, after it emerged that
the perpetrator was himself Roma, the police became
reluctant to consider racism as a motive in subsequent
crimes.

Domestic violence
A resolution on the development of a national strategy
to prevent and effectively address domestic violence,
passed by parliament in 2003 in response to public
concerns, remained largely unimplemented. The draft
Law on the Order of Protection, requiring an abusive
partner to temporarily leave jointly owned premises,
was delayed. The only crisis centre in Budapest for
women experiencing violence in the home remained
partially closed, and no new shelters were established.
A new law to protect victims of domestic violence
was being drafted. However, it stil l required a court to
issue an order to restrain an abuser from approaching a
victim, making immediate intervention by the police
impossible. In addition, the draft law did not provide
for extension of the lO-to-30-day limit of a restraining
order, and imposition of such an order remained
virtually impossible unless the victim was able or
willing to testify against the abuser.
In January the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women found in a landmark
case that Hungary had not provided effective
protection from domestic violence. In a case brought
before the Committee, an applicant who had been
subjected to regular and severe violence, and whose
partner had threatened both her and the children, was
not admitted to a government shelter as none was
equipped to accept her with her children, one of whom
had severe disabilities. Neither protection nor a legal
restraining order was available under national law.
Legal proceedings initiated by the applicant herself
were slow and ineffective, and a domestic court
ordered that she share ownership of their apartment
with her partner. The Committee ordered immediate
measures to guarantee the physical and mental
Amnesty International Report 2006

integrity of the woman and her family, and to ensure
that all victims of domestic violence were accorded the
maximum protection of the law.

Perpetrators of human rights violations continued to
enjoy impunity, particularly in Gujarat, which
witnessed widespread violence in early 2002. There
were reports of human rights violations in the
context of unrest in several states, including Jammu
a nd Kashmir and some north-eastern states. The
government repealed security legislation which had
been used to facilitate a rbitrary arrests, torture and
other grave human rights violations. However, some
of the provisions allowing these violations were
transferred into existing laws, a move widely
criticized by human rights organizations. Socially
and economically marginalized groups, including
women, dalits and adivasis (tribal people), continued
to face systemic discrimination and serious doubts
remained a bout whether moves to enact new laws
could achieve the intended a i m of protecti ng their
rights. Some states in central a nd eastern I ndia,
where traditional adivasi h abitations a re located,
witnessed an increase in violence involving a rmed
groups and state forces.
Background
Ongoing peace talks between India and Pakistan
ensured the resumption of bus services across the
divided Himalayan region of Kashmir after 58 years. In
October and November, transport lines were opened at
five points along the Line of Control in Kashmir to
facilitate the delivery of aid to people affected by the
earthquake in October. However, with issues at the core
of the conflict yet to be taken up, relations between the
two countries improved at only a slow pace.
During the year, government and foreign agencies
were engaged in the relief efforts for those affected by
the 26 December 2004 tsunami which killed an
estimated 15,000 people and displaced more than
1 12,000 others in the southern states ofTamil Nadu,
Kerala and Andhra Pradesh and the union territories of
Pondicherry and Andaman and the Nicobar Islands.

I n Andhra Pradesh, peace talks between the state
governmen t and the Maoist (naxalite) People's War
Group (PWG) col lapsed after eight months, signalling a
return to a series of attacks during which civilians were
routinely targeted. Similar Incidents were witnessed in
several central and eastern states, putting members of
already marglnalized rural and adivasi populations at
Increased risk.
In the north-east, talks between the Union
government and a section of the National Socialist
Council of Nagaland remained inconclusive. There
were moves to initiate talks between the Union
government and the United Liberation Front of Assam.
The region also witnessed sporadic clashes between
members of tribal communities during which Civilians
were targeted.
The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government
Introduced a draft bill to prevent communal violence,
following widespread CrItiCism of Its predecessor for
failing to halt the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat
targeting the Muslim minOrity. However, some of the
bill's provIsions were criticized as repressive.
Proceedings regarding the 1992 demolition of Babrl
Mosque at Ayodhya, in which senior leaders of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were faCing trial, made
little progress dUring the year.
Following a vigorous civil society campaign, the
Indian parliament passed landmark legislation
guaranteeing the right to Information. However, it was
unclear whether various union and state government
agencies would fu lly enforce this legislation.

Violence aga inst women
In an effort to stem increasing abuses against girls and
women, including dowry deaths, sexual assault and
acid attacks, parliament in August passed the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Bill
(2005), which legislates for comprehensive protection
of women from all forms of domestic violence.
Traditional preference for boys has led to thousands
of female foetuses being aborted despite the
prohibitIOn of pre-natal sex determination for this
purpose. In May the Health Minister stated that there
had not been a single conviction for breaking the ban
since It was introduced eight years earlier.
Many of the abuses suffered by Muslim women in
Gujarat In 2002 fell outside the definition of rape in
national law, thereby hampering victims' quest for
justice.
The Supreme Court in October objected to a 2003
order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court reducing a 10year sentence for rape to nine months' imprisonment.
It held that an inadequate punishment for rape was an
"affront to society".
The personal law of specific communities became a
political issue after the All India Muslim Personal Law
Board confirmed Muslim clerics' fatwa concerning the
marriage of Imrana l Iahi. Imrana lIahl alleged rape by
her father-in-law In June In Muzzaffarnagar, Uttar
Pradesh; the Board subsequently annulled her
marriage and pressed for her rape allegation to be re­
framed as a charge of adultery. Imrana I Iahi and her

1 36

husband defied the directive but the local vil lage
council continued to put pressure on them to withdraw
their charge of rape.
A petition seeking to prevent the establishment of a
parallel Muslim judicial system and binding fatwas
issued by Muslim clerics or organizations was pending
in the Supreme Court at the end of the year.

Jammu and Kashmir
Pol itically motivated violence slightly decreased but
torture, deaths in custody and "d isappearances"
continued to be reported. At least 38 people were
reported to have died in custody. In January, the
Minister of State for Home Affairs stated that some
600 people, including 174 foreigners, were held under
the Public Safety Act (PSA), a preventive detention
law. I n October 44 detainees were released but new
detentions were reported. Several people had been
held under the PSA for over 10 years under successive
PSA detention orders.
a Farooq Ahmad Dar was detained In November
under his ninth consecutive PSA order. He had been In
continuous detention under the PSA since 1991.
Civilians were repeatedly targeted by state agencies
and armed groups.
a In May, armed fighters threw a grenade just as
children were leaving their school in Srinagar, kill
two women who had come to pick up children and
injuring 50 others, including 20 pupils.
a I n July, fourjuveniles aged between II and 15 were
shot dead by paramilitary Rashtriya Rifles in Kupwara
district. Local people said that the boys had
participated in a marriage party and gone for a stroll
but ran away when ordered to stop. They said that the
army had been informed of possible movements of
people attending the party late at night.
In September, the State Human Rights Commission,
which had registered 3, 187 cases of human rights
violations since its inception in 1991, reiterated its
earlier complaint that government departments failed
to implement its recommendations.
Gujarat
Survivors of targeted killings and sexual violence in
2002, some of which had amounted to crimes against
humanity, continued to be denied justice and
reparations. Key cases relating to these killings and
sexual assaults of Muslim women in which
complainants had sought transfers to courts outside
the state, were sti l l pending in the Supreme Court at
the end of the year. I n December a mass grave
containing the remains of Muslim victims was found.
I mpu nity
Members of the security forces continued to enjoy
impunity for human rights Violations.
a Nine years after the "disappearance" and killing of
human rights lawyer JaW Andrabl in Srinagar, Jammu
and Kashmir, an army major identified as responsible
by a special investigation team had still not been
brought to justice. Army representatives asserted that
they had not been able to locate him.

More than two decades after the anti-Sikh riots in
Delhi and elsewhere in the aftermath of Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi's assassination, a judicial commission
concluded that there was credible evidence pointing to
the involvement of two leaders of the Congress party
heading the ruling U PA. Both were forced to resign from
their offiCial posts. Several others belonging to the
same party were cleared of charges, leading to criticism
by human rights organizations. Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh offered a public apology to the Sikh
community and the government promised to reopen
some of the riot cases.
In Punjab, the vast majority of police officers
responsible for serious human rights violations during
the period of civil unrest i n the mid-1 990S continued
to evade justice, despite the recommendations of
several judicial inquiries and commissions. I n
response t o 2,097 reported cases o f human rights
violations during this period, the National Human
Rights Commission (NH RC) had ordered the state of
Punjab to provide compensation i n 109 cases
concerning people who died in police custody. The
N H RC did not address issues of liability; the culture of
impunity developed during that period prevai led.
Reports of abuses including torture and ill-treatment
persisted.
a Six policemen were convicted of the abduction and
murder of human rights defender jaswant Singh Kalra
in 1995. Kalra had exposed large-scale violations in
Punjab.

H u man rights defenders
Human rights defenders in many parts of the country
continued to be harassed and attacked. Among them
were activists working on behalf of marginalized
communities including daJits and adivasis who faced
systemic discrimination.
Abuses by armed groups
There were reports of abuses - including torture,
attacks and killings of civilians - by armed groups in
jammu and Kashmir, the north-east and several central
and eastern states where left-wing armed groups were
becoming increasingly active. (See jammu and Kashmir
above.)
a In November, during elections in Bihar, Maoists
(naxalites) attacked the jehanabad prison. More than
340 prisoners, including key Maoist leaders, were freed.
Eight prisoners belonging to a private army of dominant
landed castes, Ranvir Sena, were killed and 20 others
kidnapped.
Following the upsurge in the activities of left-wing
armed groups in several states, the government set in
motion plans for joint inter-state anti-naxalite
operations. These initiatives raised concerns over the
rights and safety of adivasi populations who
traditionally inhabit the area.
In ju ly, there was an attack on the disputed
religiOUS site at Ayodhya. Later in October, during the
run-up to the annual festival season, Delhi was rocked
by a series of blasts which left 66 people dead and
more than 220 injured.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Death pena lty
At least 77 people were sentenced to death during the
year; no executions took place. No comprehensive
information on the number of people under sentence of
death in each state was available.
President Kalam and the newly-apPointed Chief
j ustice to the Supreme Court expressed themselves in
general against the death penalty. The PreSident sought
from the I ndian parliament a comprehensive policy to
deal with clemency petitions from those under
sentence of death.
Security legislation
More than a year after the repeal of the Prevention of
Terrorism Act (POTA), cases of all those held under the
Act had not been fully reviewed Within the stipulated
period. In addition, a number of state governments had
not taken action on the recommendations of a judicial
committee set up to review the cases.
Human rights organizations continued to express
concern over amendments made to the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act which granted special
powers to the state, Similar to those previously
provided by the POTA. Although the 1958 Armed Forces
Special Powers Act (AFSPA) was under review, there
was concern over its continued enforcement in
"disturbed areas", including large parts of the north­
east.
a Syed Geelani, a Kashmiri lecturer sentenced to
death under the POTA for conspiring, planning and
abetting the attack on the parliament bUilding in New
Delhi in December 2001 and acquitted on appeal in
2003, was shot and injured in February outside his
lawyer's office. The inquiry into the shooting was
entrusted to the very police force that Syed Geelani
alleged had harassed him since his release. An appeal
filed by police against his acquittal was dismissed by
the Supreme Court in September.
Economic, social and cultura l rights
Despite positive economic gains in recent years,
approximately 300 mil lion people remained mlred i n
poverty.
Following persistent reports over increasing rural
unemployment and campaigns to empower the rural
poor, the UPA government enacted legislation to
guarantee minimum annual employment for all poor
households in selected rural areas. However, guidelines
for its implementation had not been fully framed by the
end of the year.
Twenty-one years after the Union Carbide
Corporation's (UCC) pesticide plant in Bhopal leaked
toxic gases that took a heavy toll on lives and the
environment, survivors continued to struggle for
adequate compensation, medical help and
rehabilitation. The plant site had still not been cleaned
and toxic wastes continued to pollute groundwater.
UCC and Dow Chemicals (which took over UCC in 2001)
had publicly stated that they had no responsibility for
the leak or its consequences. AI joined a year-long
campaign by the Bhopal survivors and other
organizations to call for an Immediate clean-up of the

1 37

INO

pollutants from the site and the affected surroundings
as well as a full remedy for the victims, and for those
responsible to be brought to justice.

Other issues
There was grave concern at the intensification of social,
political, cultural and economiC discrimination,
oppression and violence against dalits. Data suggested
that few cases under the Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989
had resulted in convictions.
Adlvasi communitie s in several states continued to
face great pressure from dam and mining developme nt
proJects, expansion of modern forms of agriculture and
settlements . Legislation aimed at recognizing and
guaranteein g the rights of these communitie s to access
forest areas and resources was under debate in the
I ndian parliament at the end of the year.

Although the general situation in Na nggroe Aceh
Da russa lam ( NAD) improved after a peace
agreement was signed in August by the government
and the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh
Merdeka, GAM), impunity for serious human rights
violations remained a concern. In Pa pua, cases of
torture and arbitrary detention were reported. Across
the country, the police used excessive force against
demonstrators, and ill-treatment in detention
facilities and police lock-ups was widespread. At
least two people were executed by firing squad a nd
at least 1 0 people were sentenced to death. Freedom
of expression remained severely curta iled and at
least 1 8 people were detained for criticizing the
government.
Background
For the first time a representative of I ndoneSia chaired
the annual session of the UN Commission on Human
Rights in Geneva. In September parliament took the
necessary steps to approve ratification of the
I nternational Covenant on Civi l and Political Rights and
the I nternational Covenant on EconomiC, Social and
Cultural Rights.
Various religious minority groups came under threat.
Members of the Ahmaddiya community were targeted
for attacks, sometimes forcing them to flee. The Liberal
Islam Network was also attacked, and several Christian
churches were forced to close i n J ava. I n Maluku and
Central Sulawesi, ethnic and religious tensions
continued to result in violence.
On I October bomb attacks in Bali kil led 23 people.
Nanggroe Aceh Darussa lam
On 15 August a Memorandum of Understanding
between the government and GAM was signed setting
out a framework to end peacefully the 29-year conflict
in NAD. Over 200 monitors from European Union and
ASSOCiation of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries were deployed to monitor compliance with
the agreement. By the end of the year over 30,000
police and army personnel had left the province and
the fourth phase of the decommissioning of GAM's
weapons had been completed. There was hope that the
peace process would hold. Preparations for local
elections were well under way.
In January human rights monitors, humanitarian aid
agencies and journalists were allowed to operate in
NAD for the first time since martial law was declared in

1 38

Amnesty International Report 2006

IND

May 2003- Their presence, although mainly restrIcted to
areas affected by the 2004 tsunami, contributed to an
enhanced feeling of securIty In the province.
In May, as part of the government's post-tsunami
reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts, the Civil
Emergency status in NAD was downgraded to Civil
Order status. This had little impact in practice as
military operations continued. However, as a result of
the peace agreement in August the human rights
situation improved significantly.
Despite conSiderable human and financial
Investment in the reconstruction effort, there was
Widespread critiCism of the aid agencies' lack of local
consultation and coordination. In November over
1 30,000 people were still living in tents or temporary
barracks waiting for permanent housing. There were
concerns that many were living in facilities that did not
meet basic needs.
In August more than 1 , 400 political prisoners and at
least two human rights activists were released from
prIsons in NAD and Java as part of an amnesty granted
to alleged GAM combatants and their supporters. I n
October, concerns were raised that 1 1 5 GAM prisoners
had not been released. During the military and civil
emergencies, suspected GAM members and supporters
faced unfair trials. Many suspects were denied full
access to lawyers and were convicted on the basis of
confessions reportedly extracted under torture.
According to local human rights orga nizations,
during the Civil Emergency period alone (May 2004May 2005) 80 civilians were killed: three died as a
result of torture; 64 were assassinated; six were
abducted and killed; and seven were killed during
shootings. There were concerns that past human
rights violations would not be prosecuted and that
Impunity could undermine prospects for a lasting
peace. Despite provisions within the Memorandum of
Understanding that a human rights court would be set
up, the government announced that the court would
not have powers to hear cases from the past.

Pa pua
In March, the military announced plans to increase
troop numbers in Papua by 15,000. There were
concerns that this might lead to more human rights
violations in the province. Hundreds of additional
military troops were reportedly sent to Merauke In
October. Concerns were also expressed that troops
Withdrawn from NAD could be deployed in Papua.
Tight restrictions on access to Papua by international
human rights monitors, as well as harassment and
intimidation of local activists, hampered independent
human rights monitoring. At least two peaceful
supporters of Papuan independence were sentenced to
long jail sentences. There were reports of arbitrary
arrests, torture and Il l-treatment.
a In April , prisoners of conscience Yusak Pakage and
Filep Karma were sentenced to 10 and 15 years in prIson
respectively for having raised the Papuan flag in
December 2004. Both were imprisoned in Jayapura,
Papua province, and had lodged appeals to the
Supreme Court by the end of the year.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Security legislation
Between April and June, at least 64 CIVilians were
arrested under the Law on Combating CrIminal Acts of
Terrorism. Concerns about the legislation remained,
including the inadequate defimtion of acts of
"terrorism"; provision for up to six months' detention
without access to judicial review; and provisions
allowing capital punishment. There were reports that
36 of those arrested were arbitrarily arrested and four
of them were ill-treated.
a In June, four peasant farmers - Jumaedl, Jumeri,
Mastur Saputra and Sutikno - who were arrested in
relation to a bomb attack in Tentena, Sulawesl distrIct,
in May, were reportedly beaten by police dUrIng
interrogation. An internal investigation was initiated
by the police but there were fears that it would not lead
to full prosecution of those found responsible.
Excessive use of force
Members of the police used excessive force on
numerous occaSions, including against demonstrators
and detainees.
a In September, 37 people were reportedly wounded
when the police shot into a crowd of around 700
peasant farmers in Tanak Awuk, Lombok Island. The
gathering was organized to commemorate National
Peasants' Day and to discuss land issues. The police
said they were responding to people attacking them.
The National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM)
sent a team to investigate the incident in October.
Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment
According to a survey conducted by a local non­
governmental organization, over 81 per cent of
prisoners arrested between January 2003 and April
2005 in Salemba detention centre, Cipinang prison and
Pondok Bambu prison, all in Jakarta, were tortured or
ill-treated. About 64 per cent were tortured or ill­
treated during interrogation, 43 per cent during arrest
and 25 per cent during detention.
For the 12th consecutive year, the request by the UN
Special Rapporteur on torture to conduct research in
the country was not granted.
At least 29 men convicted of gambling and two
women were caned under local Sharia (Islamic law)
i n NAD.
Impunity
The Human Rights Courts proved unable to bring
perpetrators of serious human rights violations to
justice, including those i n Tanjung Priok, Timor-Leste
and Abepura.
In a report submi tted to the UN Security Council, a
Commission of Experts (CoE) appointed by the UN
Secretary-General to review the prosecution of
serious violations of human rIghts In Timor-Leste
(then East Tlmor) in 1 999 concluded that the JudiCial
process before the I ndonesian ad hoc Human Rights
Court for Timor-Leste was "manifestly inadequate
with respect to investigations, prosecutions and
trials". The CoE pointed to provisions in the terms of

1 39

INO

reference of the Truth and Friendship Commission,
officially established by the governments of I ndonesia
and Timor-Leste in March to reveal the truth about the
1 999 events, which 'contradict international
standards on denial of impunity for serious crimes". I n
particular, the C o E stated that the Truth and
Friendship Commission should not a l low amnesties
for cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and
other grave human rights violations. Despite such
criticism, the Truth and Friendship Commission was
set up in August without appropriate changes to its
mandate.
a I n J u ly, an Appeals Court overturned the decision
by the ad hoc Human Rights Court in Jakarta to convict
1 2 mIlitary offiCials of charges arising from the
detention, torture and kil lIng of Muslim protesters i n
Tanjung Priok, Jakarta, in 1984. No o n e has been held to
account for these crimes.
a In September, two police officers were acquitted
by the Human Rights Court in Makassar and victims
were denied reparations. The officers were charged
with command responsibi lity for the killing of three
people and the torture of many others in Abepura,
Papua, in 2000. The initial i nvestigation was marred
by a llegations of witness Intimidation. The trial
suffered severe delays i n both the i nvestigation and
trial stages. The victims and their fam i l ies lodged an
appeal .
I nvestigations Into other human rights violations
were stalled. The report submitted in September 2004
by Komnas HAM to the Attorney General's Office
suggesting that security forces had committed crimes
against humanity in Wasior in June 2001 and Wamena in
Apri I 2003 were not acted upon during the year.

Freedom of expression
At least 19 prisoners of conscience were sentenced to
prison terms during the year and three others
sentenced in previous years remained in jail. They
included peaceful political and independence activists,
members of religious minorities, students and
journalists. Defamation suits were also used against
human rights activists, sending a chilling message to the
human rights communIty.
a In September Rebekka Zakaria, Eti Pangesti and
Ratna Bangun were each sentenced by the I ndramayu
District Court, West Java, to three years'
imprisonment for having violated the 2002 Child
Protection Act. The three women, a l l prisoners of
conSCience, were accused by a chapter of the
I ndonesian Counci l of Muslim Clerics of enticing
chIldren to participate in a Sunday school programme
and trying to convert them to Christianity. The trial
was marred by I slamists who made threats Inside and
outSide the courtroom to kill the accused. In
November the High Court confirmed the sentence.

At least one woman, Astini, and one man, Turmudi
bIn Kasturi, were executed by firing squad. Both were
convicted of murder.

Violence aga inst women
Women's organizations expressed concern about the
lack of implementation of the 2004 Law on Domestic
Violence. In November, the commission on violence
against women reported that the Law had not
contributed to reducing the high number of domestic
violence cases, and that the lack of clarity of the
definitions and regulations pertaining to the Law
hampered full enforcement by local police and judges.

Scores of political prisoners, including prisoners of
conscience, continued to serve prison sentences
imposed following unfair trials in previous years.
Hundreds more were arrested in 2005, mostly in
connection with civil unrest in areas with large
minority populations. l nternet journalists and
human rights defenders were a mong those detained
a rbitrarily without access to fa mily or lega l
representation, often initially in secret detention
centres. I ntimidation of the fa mil ies ofthose a rrested
persisted. Torture remained com monplace. At least
94 people were executed, including at least eight
who were under 18 at the time of their alleged
offence. Many sentences of flogging were imposed.
The true number of those executed or subjected to
corporal punishment was believed to be considerably
higher tha n the cases reported.
Background
The political stalemate of the previous year continued
until the election of a new president in June. Over 1 , 000
presidential candidates were excluded from the
election by the Council of Guardians, which reviews
laws and policies to ensure that they uphold Islamic
tenets and the Constitution. All 89 women candidates
were excluded on the basis of their gender under
discriminatory selection procedures known as
gozinesh. There were reports of arrests of people
demonstrating against the elections. Up to 10 people
were killed in separate pre-election bomb attacks i n
Ahvaz a n d Tehran, a n d s i x others were kil led in a bomb
attack in Ahvaz in October. The authorities faced armed
opposition from Kurdlsh and other groups.
The election as President of former Revolutionary
Guard Special Forces member Dr Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, who took office i n August, completed the
marginalization of pro-reform supporters from the
political process and led to a concentration of power in
the Office of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Sayed 'Ali
Khamenei. In October, the Supreme Leader delegated
some of his supervisory powers over the government to
the Expediency Counci I, headed by defeated
presidential candidate Hojjatoleslam AIiAkbar Hasheml
Rafsanjani.
Relations with the international community
remained strained over human rights and Iran's nuclear
Amnesty International Report 2006

programme, particularly after I ran announced i n
August that it was resuming uranium enrichment for
civilian purposes. I ran accused foreign governments,
particularly those of the USA and UK, of instigating
unrest in border areas; the UK accused I ran of aiding
anti-UK insurgency activities i n Iraq. The European
Union-Iran human rights dialogue was suspended
because of diplomatic tensions.
In December, the UN General Assembly passed a
resolution condemning the human rights situation
i n I ran.

Repression of minorities
Discriminatory laws and practices remained a source of
social and political unrest and of human rights
violations, particularly against Iran's ethniC and
religious minorities. In July the UN Special Rapporteur
on the right to adequate housing visited Iran. He found
discrimination In the distribution of resources, and in
access to and quality of hOUSing, water and sanitation
in areas populated by minorities.

Arabs
In April, at least 31 Arabs were killed and hundreds
injured during clashes with the police following
demonstrations in Ahvaz and elsewhere In Khuzestan
province. Hundreds of other people were detained. The
demonstrators were protesting against a letter
a llegedly written by a presidential adviser, who denied
its authenticity, which set out policies for the reduction
of the Arab population of Khuzestan. Waves of arrests
continued throughout the year, particularly following
bomb explosions in Ahvaz i n June and October and
attacks on oil Installations in September and October.
a At least 81 people were arrested in November
whi le attending an Arab cultural gathering called
Mahabis. Those arrested i ncluded Zahra Nasser-Torfi,
d irector of the Ahwaz a l-Amjad cultural centre, who
was reportedly tortured i n detention, including with
beatings and threats of execution, rape and other
sexual abuse, before being released on bail to
await trial.

A2eris
At the end of June, scores of ethniC Azeris partiCipating
i n an annual cultural gathering at Babek Castle in
Kalayber were arrested. At least 21 were later
sentenced to prison terms of between three months
and one year, some of which were suspended. Some
were also banned from entering Kalayber for 10 years.
a Abbas Usani, an Azeri butcher, was arrested during
the Babek Castle event. He was released on bail i n J uly
and was sentenced in August to one year's
imprisonment to be spent in internal exile after
conviction of "spreading propaganda" and "disturbing
public opinion". He was believed to have appealed
against his sentence.

Kurds
In J une, clashes between security forces and Kurds
celebrating events in Iraq led to injuries to police
officers and the arrest of dozens of demonstrators. In
July, after I ranian security forces shot dead a Kurdish
opposition activist, Shivan Qaderi, and reportedly
dragged his body through the streets behind a jeep,

1 41

I RA

thousands of Kurds took to the streets to protest.
Security forces reportedly killed up to 21 people,
injured scores more and arrested at least 190. In further
clashes In October and November, at least one person,
Shoresh Amiri, was killed, several people were injured
and others were arrested.
o Dr Roya Toloui, a women's rights activist, and two
journalists, Ajlal Oavami and Sa'id Sa'edi, were among
the Kurds arrested in August. All were released on bail
In October and were reported to be facing political
charges that can carry the death penalty.

Religious minorities

Members of I ran's religious minorities were detained
solely In connection with their faith.
a Hamid Pourmand, who had converted to
Christianity from Islam over 25 years previously, was
sentenced In February by a military court to three
years' Imprisonmen t on charges of deceiving the
Iranian armed forces about his religion and "acts
against national security". In May he was acquitted of
apostasy.
a At least 66 Baha'is were detained and two remained
held at the end of the year. Mehran Kawsari and Bahram
Mashhadi were sentenced to three years and one year in
prison respectively in connection with an open letter
sent to President Khatami in November 2004·

H u ma n rights defenders
The registration process for independen t non­
government al organization s remained a barrier to their
effective operation, and individual human rights
defenders remained at risk of reprisal for their work.
a I n J uly, Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer and co­
founder of the Centre for Defenders of Human Rights,
was detained. He was reportedly accused of releasing
"secret and classified national intelligence" in
connection with his work defending an espionage case.
He remained in detention at the end of the year with
limited access to hiS family and no access to his lawyer.
a Prisoner of conscience Akbar Ganji, an
investigative reporter who uncovered the involvement
of government officials in the murder of intellectuals
and Journalists in the 1990S, continued to serve a six­
year prison sentence imposed after he was convicted of
vaguely worded charges including "acting against
national security". Following a hunger strike in protest
at being denied independent medical treatment
outside prison, accompanied by considerable domestic
and international protests, he was temporarily
released for medical treatment in July. He was returned
to prison in September and placed in solitary
confinement for over six weeks. His wife said he had
been beaten by security forces in hospital.
Torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading
punish ments
Torture continued to be routine in many prisons and
detention centres. At least five people died in custody.
In several cases, torture or i l l-treatment may have been
a factor. Denial of medical treatment to put pressure on
political prisoners emerged as an increasingly common
practice.
1 42

In July a report by the judiciary detailed human rights
violations, including torture, of prisoners and
detainees. It stated that measures had been taken to
address the problems, but gave no detai ls.
a In September, Arezoo Siabi Shahrivar, a
photographer, was arrested along with up to 14 other
women, at a ceremony commemorating the 19BB
"prison massacre" in Evin prison, Tehran, in which
thousands of political prisoners were executed. In
detention she was suspended from the ceiling, beaten
with a wire cable and sexually abused.
a A man from Shiraz sentenced to 100 lashes in 2004
for homosexual activities alleged that he had been
tortured and threatened with death by security forces.
At least three amputations were carried out. It
remained common for courts to hand down sentences
of flogging.

Update: Zahra Kazemi
In November the Appeals Court upheld the acquittal of
an I n tell igence M inistry official accused of killing
Canadian-Iranian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi in
custody i n July 200). A new investigation into the killing
was announced.
Death penalty
At least 94 people were executed in 2005, including at
least eight aged under I B at the time of the crime. Scores
more were reported to have been sentenced to death,
including at least II who were under IB at the time of the
offence. The true figures were probably much higher.
Death sentences continued to be imposed for vaguely
worded offences such as "corruption on earth".
a In October, a woman was reportedly sentenced to
death by stoning, despite a moratorium on the use of
this punishment introduced in 2002.
In January, the UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child urged I ran to suspend immediately the execution
of people aged under IB at the time of the crime, and to
abolish the death penalty for people who commit
crimes before they are lB. Despite Iran's statement that
there was a moratorium on the use of the death penalty
against juvenile offenders, Iman Farrokhi was executed
on the very day that Iran's report was considered by the
Committee. He was 17 when he al legedly killed a soldier
in a fight.
Following domestic and international protests, the
death sentences of some women and of men aged
under IB at the time of their al leged offence were
suspended or lifted.
Freedom of expression and association
Freedom of expression and association remained
severely curtailed. Journalists and webloggers were
detained and imprisoned and some newspapers were
closed down. Relatives of detainees or those sought by
the authorities remained at risk of harassment or
intimidation.
Press Courts were reintroduced in October
comprising a panel of three judges and a jury selected
by the judiciary. Some journalists' organizations
criticized the composition of the juries.
Amnesty International Report 2006

a Mohammad Reza Nasab Abdolahi, a student
campaigner for human rights and a newspaper editor,
was sentenced in January to six months' imprisonment
and a fine for "insulting the country's leader and
making anti-government propaganda". He was released
in August. His pregnant wife, Najameh Oumidparvar,
was detained in March for 24 days after posting a
message on her weblog that her husband apparently
wrote before his arrest.

Women's rights
The UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women
visited Iran in January and February. She criticized the
arbitrary arrest, torture and ill-treatment of women,
including women human rights defenders, and cal led
on Iran to adopt a national action plan to promote and
protect human rights that would eliminate violence
against women. She also expressed particular concern
at discriminatory laws and failures in the
administration of justice which result in impunity for
perpetrators and perpetuate discrimination and
violence against women.
The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate
housing noted discrimination against women in
relation to housing and a lack of safe houses for women
who are victims of violence.

Both the US-led Multinational Force ( M N F) and I raqi
security forces com mitted grave human rights
violations, including torture and il l-treatment,
arbitra ry detention without cha rge or trial, and
excessive use of force resulting in civilian deaths.
Armed groups fighting against the M N F and the I raqi
government were responsible for grave human rights
abuses, including the deli berate killing of thousands
of civilians in bomb and other attacks, hostage­
taking and torture. Dozens of people were sentenced
to death by criminal courts and at least three were
executed. Former President Saddam Hussain and
seven others were brought to trial. Women and girls
continued to be ha rassed and lived in fea r as a result
of the continuing lack of security.
Background
Elections for the Transitional National Assembly (TNA),
Iraq's interim parliament, held on 30 January, saw a high
turn-out in the south and in Iraqi Kurdistan. However,
most Sunnis boycotted the polls, apparently in support
of calls by Sunni religious and political figures opposed to
holding elections while the MNF remained in Iraq; others
did not vote because they feared reprisals from armed
groups. A Shi'a alliance received the majority of votes
and won 140 of the 275 seats in the assembly. A Kurdish
alliance won 75 seats, and a coalition led by outgoing
Prime Minister Iyad 'Allawi won 40 seats.
After weeks of deadlock, an agreement between the
Shi'a and Kurdish alliances led to the formation of a
new government in May. It was headed by Ibrahim al­
Ja'fari, leader of the al-Da'wa Party and member of the
Shi'a alliance, and included several Sunnis. Jalal
Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), was appointed PreSident.
Further protracted negotiations occurred before the
Constitution Drafting Committee agreed a new draft
Constitution in late August, two weeks after the
deadline set under the Transitional Administrative Law.
On 15 October, the new Constitution was put to a
national referendum and approved overall by a three to
one margin, although it was rejected by a two to one
margin in two provinces with majority Sunni
populations, al-Anbar and Salahuddin. It was agreed
that the new parliament would establish a committee to
consider possible amendments.

Elections for the new Council of Representatives - a
275-seat parliament which is to hold office for a four­
year term - were held on 15 December and contested by
Sunni as well as Shra and Kurdish partIes. There was a
high turn-out, offiCIally estimated at 70 per cent, with
most votes cast along ethnic and religious lines. A new
government had yet to be formed by the end of the
year. Against thIs poiJtical backdrop, grave abuses,
including war crimes and crimes against humanity,
were committed by armed groups, the M N F and the
Iraqi security forces.

Abuses by armed groups
Armed groups fighting against the M N F and Iraqi
security forces were responsible for grave human
rights abuses. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians were
reportedly kil led or Injured in attacks by armed
groups. Some, including translators, drivers and
others employed by the M N F, were attacked
apparently because they were conSidered
"col laborators"; others, including civil servants,
government officials, judges and journa l ists, were
singled out because of their links to the I raqi
adminIstratio n. Many others were targeted because
they belonged to speCific religious and ethnic groups.
CivilIans were also kil led and injured in indiscrimin ate
car bombings and SUIcide attacks by armed groups
targettJng I raqi police and governmen t forces, and
m i i Jtary convoys and bases of the M N F.
Armed groups were also responsible for abducting
dozens of I raqis as well as foreign nationals and holding
them hostage. Many of the hostages were kil led. Most
were clvliJans.
a On 25 January, a judge, Oais Hashem al-Shamari,
the secretary of Iraq's Council of J udges, was shot dead
together WIth his son in an ambush by armed men in a
car. The judge and hiS son had just left home and were
driving In eastern Baghdad. The armed group Ansar al­
Sunna claimed responsibilIty for the killings.
a On 28 February, at least 1 1 8 people were kil led and
1 32 injured in a suicide car bomb attack near a police
station and a busy market in al-Hilla, south of Baghdad.
The victims included people queuing outside a health
clinic to receive medical certificates which would
enable them to apply for jobs in the army and police.
Many other victims were at the market across the road.
In a statement posted on the Internet a group called al­
Oa'ida of J ihad OrganIzation in the Land of Two Rivers
claImed responsibility for the attack.
a On 14 September, a suicide bomber drew scores of
people to his van with promises of work and then
detonated a bomb in al-'Uruba Square in al-Kadhimlya,
a predominantly Shra district of Baghdad. At least 1 1 4
Civilians, including children, were kil led and scores
Injured.
a On 26 November, four human rights defenders,
members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams - Tom
Fox, Norman Kember, James Loney and Harmeet Singh
Sooden - were abducted in Baghdad. An armed group,
Swords of the Truth, claimed responsibility and
demanded the release of all Iraqi prISoners. The four
men were still held at the end of the year.

1 44

Detention without charge or trial
Thousands of people were held without charge or trial
by the MNF. Most were Sunnis arrested in the so-cal led
Sunni Triangle where armed groups opposed to the
MNF and the Iraqi government were especially active.
Most were denied access to lawyers and families for the
first two months of detention.
US military forces continued to control four main
detention centres: Abu Ghraib Prison in Baghdad; Camp
Bucca in Um Oasr, near Basra in the south; Camp
Cropper near Baghdad International Airport; and Fort
Suse, near Suleimaniya in the north. At the end of
November, more than 14,000 detainees were being held
in these detention centres; more than J . 400 had been
held for more than a year. Among those held were nine
women detained in Camp Cropper.
a 'Ali 'Omar Ibrahim al-Mashhadani, a 36-year-old
cameraman, was detained by US forces on 8 August.
He was arrested after a search of his home in al­
Ramadi following a shooting in the city. His brother,
who was arrested with him and then released, said
that the soldiers arrested both of them after they saw
film material taken by 'AIi 'Omar I brahim al­
Mashhadani. At the end of the year 'Ali 'Omar Ibrahim
al-Mashhadani was sti ll held without charge or trial at
Camp Bucca.
Thousands of detainees were released including
some 500 security detainees who were released by the
MNF in October, a few days before the start of the holy
month of Ramadan.
a Two Palestinian students, Jayab Mahmood Hassan
Humeidat and Ahmad Badran Faris, both aged 22,
returned to their homes in the West Bank after they
were released at the end of August. They had been
detained without charge or trial by US forces for 28
months in Camp Bucca.
Torture and ill-treatment
There was eVidence of widespread torture and ill­
treatment by the Iraqi security forces. Methods of
torture included hanging by the arms, burning with
Cigarettes, beatings, the use of electric shocks on
different parts of the body, strangulation, the breaking
of limbs and sexual abuse. Torture and ill-treatment
were reported in secret detention centres, police
stations and offiCial detention centres in di fferent parts
of the country as well as in buildings in Baghdad under
the control of the Interior Ministry.
a In February, three alleged members of the Badr
Organization died in custody after being arrested by
I raqi police at a police checkpoint. The bodies of the
three men, Majbal 'Adnan Latif, his brother 'Ali 'Adnan
Latif, and 'Aidi Mahassin Lifteh, were found three days
later, bearing marks of beatings and electric shocks.
a In February, a 46-year-old housewife from Mosul,
Khalida Zakiya, was shown on the Iraqi TV programme
''Terrorism in the Grip of Justice" alleging that she had
supported an armed group. However, she later stated
that she had been coerced into making a false
confession. She reported that during her detention by
Interior Ministry forces she had been whipped with a
cable and threatened with sexual abuse.

a I n july, 12 men were detained by the Iraqi police in
Baghdad's al-'Amirya district. Nine of the 12 suffocated
to death after being confined in a police van. The Iraqi
authorities suggested that the 12 were members of an
armed group who had engaged in an exchange of fire
with US or I raqi forces. However, other sources claimed
they were a group of bricklayers who were arrested as
suspected insurgents and then tortured by police
commandos before being confined in a police van in
extremely high temperatures for up to 14 hours. Medical
staff at the Yarmouk hospital in Baghdad, where the
bodies of those who died were taken on JJ july, were
reported to have confirmed that some of them bore
signs of torture, including electric shocks.
a In November, US forces announced that they had
found 173 detainees confined secretly in a bUilding
controlled by the Interior Ministry. Many had been
tortured, ill-treated and were malnourished. Shortly
thereafter, the Iraqi government launched an
investigation into these and other allegations of torture.
There were also reports that the MNF tortured or ill­
treated detainees.
a In September, several members of the US National
Guard's 184th Infantry Regiment were sentenced to
prison terms in connection with torture or il l-treatment
of Iraqis. The detainees had reportedly been arrested in
March following an attack on a power plant near
Baghdad. According to media reports, an electric stun
gun had been used on handcuffed and blindfolded
detainees.

Death pena lty
Dozens of people were sentenced to death by Iraqi
criminal courtS during the year. The first executions
since Iraq re-imposed the death penalty in August 2004
were carried out in September. At the end of the year
dozens of people remained on death row.
a Ahmad al-jaf, jasim 'Abbas and 'Uday Dawud al­
Dulaimi, who were believed to be members of the
armed group Ansar al-Sunna, were sentenced to death
in May by a criminal court in the town of al-Kut, about
170km south-east of Baghdad. The three men were
found guilty of kidnapping, rape and murder. They were
executed in September by hanging.
Unlawful attacks
M N F forces used excessive force, resulting in civilian
casualties. There were reports that they failed to take
necessary precautions to minimize risk to civilians.
a I n August, US troops shot dead Walid Khaled, an
Iraqi sound engineer working for the Reuters news
agency, and wounded his colleague, Haidar Kadhem.
The soldiers fired at the car in which the men were
travelling to the scene of an earlier insurgent attack on
an Iraqi police convoy In the al-'Adel district in
Baghdad. A US offiCial later claimed that US soldiers had
taken "appropriate action" according to their rules of
engagement.
a On 16 October, some 70 people were kil led near al­
Ramadl in a US air raid. Local Iraqi police said that
about 20 of those killed were Civilians, including
children who had gathered around wreckage of a
Amnesty International Report 2006

military vehicle. US military offiCials initially said that
those killed were "terrorists". However, two days later
they reportedly stated that they would investigate
allegations that civilians had been killed.

Trial of Sad dam H ussa in and other
former officials
Former President Saddam Hussain was brought to trial
on 19 October together with seven others, including
former Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadhan and
Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, the former head of the
intell igence service (Mukhabarat). They were on trial
before the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal (SICT),
formerly the Iraqi Special Tribunal. They were accused
in connection with the executions of 148 people from
al-Dujail, a predominantly Shi'a vil lage, following an
assassination attempt against Saddam Hussain when he
visited the village in 1982.
The trial was held in Baghdad's heavily fortified
Green Zone amid concern for the safety of those
participating and was marred by procedural
irregularities. For example, the names of prosecution
witnesses were withheld from the defence and the
court's name and procedures were amended
immediately before the proceedings opened. The
defendants, all of whom could face death sentences i f
convicted, denied the charges a n d questioned the
legitimacy of the court.
On 20 October, defence lawyer Sa'dun al-janabi was
abducted from his office in Baghdad by armed men and
murdered. A second defence lawyer, 'Adil al-Zubeidi,
was killed in November when gunmen opened fire at
the car in which he was travelling. The trial was
continuing at the end of the year.
Violence against women
Women and girls continued to face threats, attacks and
harassment. Their freedoms were severely curtailed as
a result of the lack of security on the streets. Many
women and girls were under pressure to wear the hljab
or Islamic veil and change their behaviour. Women
were killed and abducted by armed groups.
a On 20 February, Ra'ida Mohammad al-Wazzan,
aged 35, a journalist and news presenter for al- 'Iraqiya,
the Iraqi state television channel, and her lo-year-old
son were abducted by gunmen. The boy was released
three days later but Ra'ida Mohammad al-Wazzan's
body was found on a street in Mosul on 25 February. She
had been shot in the head. She had previously been
threatened by armed men who demanded that she quit
her job.
Northern Iraq
Human rights abuses were also reported from areas of
northern Iraq controlled since 1991 by the Kurdlstan
Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK).
a On 7 September, security forces in Kalar, a town in
the PUK-controlled area, kil led one person and injured
some 30 others when they fired on protesters
demonstrating outside the governor's office against
fuel shortages and poor public services.

There were concerns a bout the treatment of people
with mental disabilities. Police ill-treatment and
a buses of power were reported. New counter­
terrorism legislation raised concerns a bout potential
violations of funda mental human rights. There were
continuing concerns a bout the effectiveness of
attempts to address discrimination and a bout the
preva lence of violence in the fa mily.
Background
The bill published In 2003 to incorporate the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court into I rish
law had sti II not been enacted by the end of the year.
In October the Irish Human Rights Commission
published its annual report. The report raised serious
concern about the Commission's lack of resources and
the "democratic deficit" in parliamentary procedures
for scrutinizing legislation with human rights
implications.

1 46

Treatment of people with mental disabil ities
The first annual report of the Inspector of Mental
Health Services, published i n J uly, found unacceptable
levels of care in some services, and inadequate
facilities and services for children.
Procedures for the compulsory detention of people
in mental health facilities, and independent tribunals
to review decisions, provided for under the Mental
Health Act (2001) had not come into force. Procedures
under 194s Iegislation continued to operate, in breach
of international standards in relation to the
deprivation of liberty.
Policing
The Garda Siochiina (Police) Act (200S) set out for the
first time in statutory form the functions of the police
(Garda) and provided for the establishment of a Code of
Ethics for the service. The Act also established an
independent Garda Ombudsman Commission to
investigate complaints against members of the police
service. However, it adopted a narrow definition of
serious cases which would automatically come under
the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman Commission.
In April the police service published an audit of its
compliance with international human rights standards.
The audit documented abuse of powers, ill-treatment,
institutional racism and unaccountability within the
service.
D The Tribunal of Inquiry into complaints against
Garda officers in the Donegal Division issued its
second report in J une, revealing systematic violations
of the rights of the McBrearty family at the centre of
the inquiry. The tribunal found gross negligence at
senior levels of the service amounting to criminal
negligence, and corruption and a lack of objectivity at
lower levels.
Cou nter-terrorism
There were mounting concerns that the government
had not satisfactorily investigated al legations that
Shannon airport may have been used as a transit point
in the transfer of terrorism suspects, with the
involvement of the USA or its agents, in circumstances
that put them at risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment (extraordinary rendition).
The Criminal J ustice (Terrorist Offences) Act (200S),
adopted to give effect to the European Union
Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism,
significantly expanded law enforcement powers. I ts
provisions contained such broad and vague definitions
that there were concerns that it could lead to violations
of the rights of association, peaceful assembly and
freedom of expression.
Places of detention
The annual report of the Inspector of Prisons and
Places of Detention published in July noted that prison
conditions fell below international standards, with
overcrowding and a lack of adequate sanitation
facilities. Mentally ill prisoners continued to be held in
prisons rather than in specialized mental health
facilities. A report published by the Probation and
Amnesty International Report 2006

ISR

Welfare Service highl ighted the unnecessary
incarceration of homeless people or people with
mental illness.

Asylu m-seekers and migra nts
A process of public consultation began on government
proposals for consolidating and reforming immigration
legislation. These included commitments to address
trafficking and to provide protection for migrant
women experiencing domestic violence. Proposals did
not address the inappropriate use of prisons for
holding immigration detainees.
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination expressed concern about the treatment
of asylum-seekers and the failure to prevent the
exploitation of migrant workers, and called on the
government to review its policy of dispersal of asylum­
seekers.
It urged the I rish government to incorporate the UN
Convention against Racism into Ireland's domestic
legislation.
Discrimination
The first National Action Plan Against Racism was
launched in January. However, there was concern that
it lacked effectIve accountability mechanisms and
failed to address institutional racism within
government bodies.
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination questioned the effectiveness of
government measures to improve access by the
Traveller community to economic and social rights, and
rejected the government's contention that Travellers
were not a distinct ethnic minority group.
The Committee urged the government to introduce in
criminal law a provision that committing an offence
with a racist motivation or aim constitutes an
aggravating circumstance, al lowing for a more severe
punishment; establish an effective monitoring
mechanism to carry out investigations into allegations
of racially motivated police misconduct; consider
expanding the scope of equality legislation so as to
cover the whole range of government functions and
activities; review its security procedures and practices
at entry points with a view to ensuring that they are
carried out in a non-discriminatory manner; and take
measures with regard to the special needs of women
belonging to minority and other groups at risk.
Women
There were concerns that the government had taken
insufficient measures to identify, combat and redress
violence against women.
In July, the UN Commi ttee on the E l imination of
Discrimination against Women expressed its concern
at the prevalence of violence against women and girls
in I reland; the low prosecution and conviction rates
of perpetrators; high withdrawal rates of complaints;
and inadequate funding for organizations that provide
support services to victims. It also criticized the
state's failure to address trafficking of women and
children.
Amnesty International Report 2006

The Committee was also critical o f the persistence of
traditional stereotypical views of the social roles and
responsibilities of women, reflected in the
Constitution, in women's educational choices and
employment patterns, and in women's low
participation in political and public life.

Children
Children continued to be detained in adult prisons. The
Ombudsman for Children, in her first annual report,
was concerned that the statutory exclusion of certain
groups of children, in particular those detained in
prisons and Garda stations, from her Office's
investigatory remit, conflicted with the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and could preclude her Office
from executing effectively its role and functions.
The report on clerical sex abuse in the d iocese of
Ferns (the Ferns Inquiry) published in October was
critical of Catholic Church authorities, the Garda and
the health authority in their handling of more than 100
allegations of child sexual abuse made between 1962
and 2002. It highlighted ongoing gaps in child
protection, and the need to place government
guidelines on mandatory reporting of child abuse on a
legislative basis.

Israel withdrew its settlers and troops from the Gaza
Strip and dismantled four small settlements in the
northern West Ban k. However, it continued to build
and expand illegal settlements and related
infrastructure, including a 600km fence/ wa ll, on
Palestinian land in the occupied West Ba nk. Military
blockades and restrictions imposed by Israel on the
movement of Palestinians within the Occupied
Territories continued to cause high u nemployment
and poverty a mong the Palestinian population.
1 47

ISR

There was much less violence between Israelis and
Palestinians, although attacks by both sides
continued. Some 1 90 Pa lestinians, including a round
50 children, were killed by Israeli forces, and 50
Israelis, including six children, were killed by
Palestinian armed groups. Israeli forces ca rried out
unlawful attacks and routinely used excessive force
against peaceful demonstrators protesting against
the destruction of Palestinian agricultural land and
the Israeli army's construction of the fence/ wa ll.
Israeli settlers frequently attacked Palesti nian
farmers, destroying orchards and preventing
cultivation of their land. Israeli soldiers a nd settlers
responsible for unlawful killings a nd other abuses
against Pa lestinians and their property generally
had impu nity. Thousands of Palestinians were
arrested by Israeli forces throughout the Occupied
Territories on suspicion of secu rity offences. Israeli
conscientious objectors continued to be imprisoned
for refusing to serve in the a rmy.
Background
Following negotiations between the Palestinian
Authority (PA), Egyptian mediators and the main
Palestinian armed groups early in the year, the latter
declared an open-ended tahadiyeh (quiet), a pledge not
to initiate attacks against Israel. The Israeli army
likeWise announced that it would refrain from attacking
Palestinian targets. Despite thiS, both sides carried out
new attacks, claiming these were in response to attacks
by the other. Nevertheless, the year saw a marked
reduction In attacks and killings by both sides.
The removal of Israeli settlers and troops from the
Gaza Strip under Prime Minister Sharon's
"disengagem ent plan" sharply divided the governing
Likud party. In November, Prime Minister Sharon
resigned from Likud and formed a new party, prompting
early elections, scheduled for March 2006.
Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups
committed acts that were part of a pattern of war
crimes and Crimes against humanity.
Kills and attacks by the army
Some 190 Palestinians, including around 50 children,
were killed by the Israeli army in the Occupied
Territories. Many were kil led unlawfully, in deliberate
and reckless shootings, shelling and air strikes in
densely populated residential areas, or as a result of
excessive use of force. Some were extrajudicially
executed and others died in armed clashes with Israeli
soldiers. Hundreds of others were injured.
Cl Seven children aged between 10 and 17 were killed
and five others seriously wounded in an Israeli air
strike as they were picking strawberries In the northern
Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya on 4 January. Those kil led
Included SIX members of the Ghaben family - Rajah,
Jaber, Mahmoud, Bassam, Hani and Mohammed - and
Jlbril al-Kaseeh.
Cl On 27 October, Karam Mohammed Abu Naji, '4,
Salah Said Abu Naji, 'S, and Rami Riyad Assaf, '7, were
killed when the Israeli army launched an air strike on a
car travelling near the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza

1 48

Strip. As well as the three child bystanders, all four
people in the car were kil led. Nineteen other
bystanders, including seven children, were injured.
Two members of a Palestinian armed group were
believed to be the intended target.
Cl On 3 November, 12-year-old Ahmed al-Khatib was
fatally wounded by Israeli soldiers during a raid in Jenin
refugee camp and died three days later. The army
stated that he had been playing with a toy gun and
soldiers had mistaken him for a gunman.

Kills and attacks by Palestinian
armed groups
Palestinian armed groups killed 4' Israeli civilians,
including six children, in suicide bombings, shootings
and mortar attacks in Israel and the Occupied
Territories. Most of the attacks were carried out by al­
Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of Fatah, and
Islamic Jihad. N i ne Israeli soldiers were also kil led by
Palestinian armed groups, most of them in the Occupied
Territories.
Cl On 12 July, Rachel Ben Abu and Nofar Horowitz
both aged 16, Julia Voloshin, 31, Anya Lifshitz, 50, a�d
Corporal t10she Maor, 21, were kil led in a suicide
bombing carried out by Islamic Jihad in a shopping mall

Cl Palestinian gunmen shot dead Oz Ben-Meir, 'S,
Matat Rosenfeld-Adler, 21, and Kineret Mandel, 23, at
the Gush Etzion Junction in the West Bank on 16
October. A 14-year-old boy, another civilian and a
soldier were also injured in the attack. AI-Aqsa Martyrs
Brigades clai med responsibility for the killings.
Attacks by Israeli settlers in the
Occupied Territories
Israeli settlers in the West Bank repeatedly attacked
Palestinians and their property. They destroyed crops,
cut down or burned olive trees, contaminated water
reservoirs and prevented farmers from cultivating their
land, in order to force them to leave. Such attacks
increased during the olive harvest months of October
and November.
Cl In March and April, Israeli settlers spread toxic
chemicals in fields around Palestinian vil lages in the
southern Hebron Hills and near Salfit. The chemicals
were spread in areas where Palestinian farmers graze
their sheep, effectively depriving them of their
livelihood. The farmers were forced to quarantine their
flocks and stop using the mi lk, cheese and meat during
the productive season.
Cl On 16 October some 75 acres of 01 ive groves
belonging to Palestinian villagers near Salem in the
northern West Bank were burned by Israeli settlers.
Much of the villagers' land was cut off from the village
by a settlers' road leading to the nearby Elon Moreh
settlement. For years, Israeli settlers from Elon Moreh
had prevented Palestinian villagers from accessing
their land under threat of attacks.
Israeli settlers also attacked Israeli and international
peace activists and human rights defenders who sought
to document their attacks on Palestinians.
Cl On 26 September settlers from the Havat Ma'on

ISR

settlement outpost assaulted Israeli peace activists and
a film crew. Ra'anan Alexanderovitch was severely
beaten and injured by a settler armed with an MI6
assault rifle, and some of the crew's equipment was
stolen by the attackers.
Israeli soldiers and police at times intervened to stop
settlers attacking Palestinians, often when Israeli or
International peace activists were present. However, in
most cases they failed to intervene and often
responded to settlers' attacks by Imposing further
restrictions on the local Palestinian population, as
demanded by the settlers.

Administration of justice and impunity
The Israeli army detained hundreds of Palestinians.
Many were released without charge but hundreds
were charged with security offences. Trials before
mil itary courts often did not meet international
standards of fairness, with al legations of torture and
i l l- treatment of detainees Inadequately i nvestigated.
Some 1,000 Palestinians were detained
administratively without charge or trial dunng the
year. Family visits for Palestinian detainees were
severely restricted and in many cases forbidden as
relatives were denied permits to enter Israel, where
thousands of Palestinians were Imprisoned.
In July Israel passed a discriminatory law denYing
Palestinian victims compensation for abuses inflicted
by Israeli forces.
Israeli soldiers, police and settlers who committed
unlawful killings, ill-treatment and other attacks against
Palestinians and their property commonly did so with
Impunity. I nvestigations were rare, as were prosecutions
of the perpetrators, which in most cases did not lead to
convictions. By contrast, Israel used all means at its
disposal, including assassinations, collective
punishment and other measures that violate
international law, against Palestinians who carried out
attacks against Israelis or who were suspected of direct
or indirect involvement in such attacks. Palestinians
convicted of killing Israelis were usually sentenced to life
imprisonment by Israeli military courts, whereas in the
exceptional cases when Israelis were convicted of killing
or abusing Palestinians, light sentences were imposed.
a In August, Israeli soldier Taysir Hayb was
sentenced to eight years' lmprisonment for the killing
of UK peace activist Tom Hurndal l ln the Gaza Strip in
200J, He was convicted of manslaughter, not murder, as
well as obstruction of justice, providing false
Information and unbecoming conduct.
a In November an Israeli army company commander
was acquitted of all charges in relation to the killing of a
1 3-year-old girl, Iman ai-Hams. She had been shot dead
by Israeli soldiers in October 2004 in Rafah in the
southern Gaza Strip while walking near a fortified Israeli
army tower opposite her school. According to an army
communication recording of the incident, the
commander had stated that "anything that's mobile, that
moves in the zone, even If it's a three-year-old, needs to
be killed". Neither the commander nor any other soldier
was charged with the girl's murder as the court accepted
that the commander had not breached regulations on
Amnesty International Report 2006

when to open fire. The court focused on whether he had
acted Improperly by repeatedly shooting at the child as
she lay Injured or dead.
a In September, Yehoshua Elitzur, an Israeli settler,
was convicted of killing Sayel Jabara, a 46-year-old
Palestinian, near the West Bank village of Salem in
September 2004. Even though Yehoshua Elitzur was
armed With an M I 6 assault nfle and shot dead an
unarmed man, the court contended that there was no
proof that he Intended to kill Sayel Jabara. It convicted
him of manslaughter, not murder. He remained free as
he had been released on bail within a day of his arrest
and did not appear in court for his verdict.

I mprisonment of conscientious objectors
Several Israelis who refused to serve In the army because
they opposed Israel's occupation of the Occupied
Territories and refused to serve there were imprisoned
for up to four months. They were prisoners of
conscience.
Expansion of settlements and construction
of the fence/ wall
While International attention focused on the Gaza
"disengagement plan", Israel continued to expand
i l legal Israeli settlements and stepped up construction
of a 600km fence/wall through the West Bank,
Including in and around East Jerusalem. The
construction compounded the military blockades and
other stringent restrictions imposed by the Israeli army
on the movement of the Palestinian population
throughout the Occupied Territories, including
measures which increasingly cut off East Jerusalem
from the rest of the West Bank.
Israel seized and destroyed large areas of Palestinian
land to build roads for Israeli settlers, military
checkpoints and the fence/wal l through the West Bank.
Palestinians were increasingly confined to restricted
areas and denied freedom of movement between towns
and villages within the Occupied Territories. Many
Palestinians were cut off from their farmland, their
main source of livelihood, and others were prevented
from accessing their workplaces, education and health
facilities, and other services.
Israeli government officials repeatedly reiterated
their determination to strengthen most of the Israeli
settlements in the West Bank, where some 450,000
Israeli settlers live, and to build new ones, notably in and
around East Jerusalem. The Israeli government took no
steps to fulfil its commitment to dismantle settlement
outposts established since 2001 In the West Bank. In
March former State Prosecutor Talia Sasson published a
report, commissioned by the government, which noted
that unauthorized settlement outposts continued to be
established and expanded by the authorities, contrary to
the government's promise to dismantle them.
Restrictions on movement and violations of
economic a nd social rights
Restrictions on the movement of people and goods
remained the primary cause of high unemployment
and poverty in the Occupied Territories, With about

1 49

ISR

50 per cent o f Palestinians living below the poverty
l ine and forced to depend on chanty. The restrictions
hindered the access of Pa lestinians to hospitals,
schools and jobs. Cases of malnutrition and other
health problems resulted from the extreme poverty.
With few exceptions, Palestinians were not allowed
to move between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and
had to obtain special permits from the Israeli army to
move between towns and vil lages within the West
Bank. Travel on main roads in the West Bank, which
were freely used by Israeli settlers living in il legal
settlements, was forbidden to Palestinians or
restricted. Such restrictions were increased in reprisal
for attacks by Palestinian armed groups and during
Jewish holidays.
Increasing restrictions were also imposed by the
Israeli army on the movement of Israeli and
international peace activists to prevent them from
participating in peaceful demonstrations and other
solidarity activities with Palestinian villagers in the
West Bank.
Durmg and after its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,
Israel closed the Gaza-Egypt border, the sole point of
exit and entry for Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip.
The border was allowed to reopen at the end of
November under the supervision of a European Union
force. Israel maintained control of the Gaza Strip's sea
and airspace, and of the passage of goods in and out of
the Gaza Strip.

Destruction of homes and properties
Although far less extensive than in previous years,
destruction of Palestinian homes and land by Israeli
forces continued. Large areas of agricultural land were
seized and destroyed, and thousands of trees uprooted,
to make way for the fence/wall and for settlers' roads
through the West Bank. Israeli settlers also destroyed
Palestinian farmland m order to open new roads to
connect recently established settlement outposts. Even
though these outposts contravened government policy,
the army rarely intervened to prevent such actions.
Scores of Palestinian homes were demolished by the
Israeli army and security forces in the West Bank,
including in and around East Jerusalem, on the grounds
that they were built without a building permit. The
Israeli authonties denied permission to Palestinians to
build on their own land in large areas of the West Bank,
and at the same time continued to approve the
construction and expansion of illegal Israeli
settlements on Palestinian land.
a On 5 April the Israeli army destroyed the Zaatreh
family home in the East Jerusalem suburb of 'Azariya to
make way for the fence/wall, which was built on the
ruins of the house. The demolition left 29 members of
the family homeless, including 16 children. Although
the land belongs to the family, they could not obtain a
building permit so their house was demolished.
a Dunng the week beginning 4 July the Israeli army
demolished some 35 stone and metal structures/shacks
in the village ofTana, near Nablus, in the northern West
Bank. Fourteen of the structures were home to the
villagers and the rest were used to store fodder or
1 50

shelter sheep and goats, which provide the main source
of livel ihood for the vil lage. A school, which had been
built in 2001 and had served the vil lage's children since
then, was also demolished, along with two water
reservoirs. The army took advantage of the absence of
the villagers, who live a semi-nomadic life and spend
the hottest months of July and August in nearby Beit
Furik, to destroy much of their habitat. The reason
given for the destruction was that the structures had
been built without a permit.

Violence and discrimination against women
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women examined Israel's report inJuly. It
expressed concern about laws governing personal
status which are based on religion and about the 2003
law which bars family unification for Israelis who marry
Palesti nians from the Occupied Territories. It called on
the Israeli government to intensify efforts to combat
trafficking in women and girls; to take measures to
improve the status of Israeli Arab women, especially in
the fields of education and health, and to eliminate
discrimination against Bedouin women; and to enforce
adherence to the minimum age of marriage.

Refugee rights were threatened by implementation
of a new i mmigration law, the failure to legislate
specifically to protect those seeking asylum, and
reports of plans by Italy to build detention centres for
migrants in Libya. The expulsion of more than 1 ,425
migra nts to Libya throughout the year took place in
defiance of international refugee law. Officials and
civilian personnel convicted of physical assault and
racial a buse at a detention centre for migra nts
received suspended prison sentences. The trials
proceeded of police officers charged with assault
and other offences in 2001 at the time of mass
demonstrations in Na ples and during the G8 Summit
in Genoa. Italy failed to take action to address the
impunity enjoyed by law enforcement officials,
including by setting up an independent police
complaints and accounta bility body, making torture
a specific crime under the penal code, or requiring
police officers to display prominently some form of
identification.
Refugee rights under threat
I taly still lacked a specific and comprehensive law on
asylum, despite being a party to the U N Refugee
Convention. In practice, asylum was regulated under
the 1990 immigration law, as amended in 2002 by the
Bossi-Fini law. the implementing rules of which came
into force on 21 April 2005. The law established
Identification Centres to detain asylum-seekers and
an accelerated asylum determination procedure for
detainees, raiSing concerns about access to asylum
procedures, the detention of asylum-seekers in
violation of international refugee law standards. and
violation of the principle of non-refoulement- that
those seeking asyl um should not be forCibly returned
to countries where they risked serious human rights
abuses.
There were fears that many of the thousands of
migrants and asylum-seekers arriving in Italy by boat.
mainly from Libya, were forCibly returned to countries
where they were at risk of human right violations. At
least 1.425 people were deported to Libya between
January and October.
a Between 13 and 21 March, 1,235 foreign nationals
arrived at the Italian Island of Lampedusa. A request on
14 March by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) for access to the detention centre on
Lampedusa was refused on security grounds. On 1 6
March t h e Minister o f the Interior informed parliament
Amnesty International Report 2006

that Libyan officials had been allowed Into the centre to
Identify people traffickers. The following day, I Bo
people were allegedly expelled, escorted on the flight
by Italian law enforcement officers, to the Libyan
capital, Tripoli. On 18 March, U N HCR expressed
concern that, if any Libyan asylum-seekers had been in
the centre during the visits by Libyan offiCials, such
viSits would have contravened basic refugee protection
prinCiples. On 14 April, the European Parliament
expressed concern at the expulSIOn of migrants from
Lampedusa between October 2004 and March 2005. On
10 May the European Court of Human Rights ordered
the I talian authorities to suspend the planned
expulsion of II migrants who arnved in Lampedusa in
March.
Thousands of foreign nationals without reSidence
rights were detained in Temporary Stay and Assistance
Centres (CPTA), amid reports from some of these
centres that law enforcement officers and supervisory
staff assaulted inmates. There were also reports of
overcrowded and unhygienic liVing conditiOns;
inadequate medical care and the excessive and abUSive
administration of sedatives; and difficulties for inmates
in accessing legal advice and asylum procedures.
Similar conditions were reported in the newly
established Identification Centres where hundreds of
asylum-seekers were held.

Updates
In July, a court in Lecce convicted 16 people charged in
connection with the physical assault and racial abuse of
inmates of the Regina Pacis CPTA in the Puglia region in
November 2002. The director of the centre, a Roman
Catholic priest, and two of the carabmien (military
police) who provided security at the centre were given
suspended sentences of 16 months' Imprisonment. The
other accused, six members of the administrative staff,
two doctors and five other carabinieri, also received
suspended sentences, of between nine and 16 months.

Detention by proxy
I ta ly's decision to build three detention facilities in
Libya - one in Gharyan, close to Tripoli, a second in
Sheba, in the desert, and a third in Kufra, close to
Libya's borders with Egypt, Sudan and Chad - was
unoffiCially reported during the year. There were
fears that the human rights of migrants could be at
serious risk. Libya had not ratified the UN Refugee
Convention or its Protocol, and did not acknowledge
the presence of refugees and asylum-seekers in the
country or recognize the offiCial status of the U N HCR.

Police brutality
Italy stil l failed to make torture, as defined in the U N
Convention against Torture, a speCific crime within its
penal code. It also took no steps to establish an
independent national human rights institution, or an
independent police complaints and accountability
body. PoliCing operations were not brought In line with
the European Code of Police EthiCS, for example by
requiring officers to display prominently some form of
identification, such as a service number, to ensure they
could be held accountable.

Updates: policing of 2001 demonstrations
Trials of police officers continued in relation to policing
operations around the mass demonstrations in Naples
I n March 2001 and during the G8 Summit in Genoa in
July 2001.
51 The trial of 31 police officers on charges ranging
from abduction to bodily harm and coercion in
connection with the Naples demonstration, which
began in December 2004, continued in 2005.
a In March public prosecutors in Genoa set out
evidence of verbal and physical abuse of detainees In
the Bolzaneto temporary detention faci lity through
which over 200 detainees passed during the G8 summit.
Detainees were reportedly slapped, kicked, punched
and spat on; subjected to threats, including of rape, and
to verbal abuse, including of an obscene sexual nature;
and deprived of food, water and sleep for lengthy
periods. On 16 April, a total of 45 police officers,
carabinien, prison guards and medical personnel were
committed for trial on various charges. The trial began
on I I October.
a On 6 April the trial began of 28 police officers,
Including several senior officers, Involved in an
overnight police raid on a school in Genoa during the
demonstrations in 2001. During the raid, nearly 100

assault and battery, falSifying and planting evidence,
and abUSing their powers as officers of the state. None
had been suspended from duty. Scores of other law
enforcement officers believed to have participated in
assaults could apparently not be identified.

I ll-treatment in prisons
Chronic overcrowding and understaffing persisted in
prisons, along with high rates of suicide and self-harm.
There were many reports of poor sanitary conditions
and Inadequate medical assistance. Infectious diseases
and mental health problems persisted.
Criminal proceedings, involving large numbers of
prison staff. were under way into alleged ill-treatment

Reports of police brutal ity continued. A nu mber of
police officers were charged and tried after unlawful
killings, but none was convicted. At least 1 68 people
were killed by the police, many in circumstances
suggesting they were extrajudicially executed.
Conditions of detention frequently a mounted to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. At least two
people were sentenced to death; there were no
executions.
Background
jamaica continued to suffer from increasing levels of
violence; 1,674 people were reportedly murdered
during 2005, an increase on previous years. At least 1 3
police officers were killed. I n May, three police officers
were kil led within hours of each other in apparently
coordinated attacks.
Unlawful killings and impunity
At least 168 people were allegedly killed by members of
the police, an i ncrease over the previous year.
For the Sixth consecutive year, no polIce or army
officers were convicted of unlawful killings committed
while on duty. Investigations into al leged extrajudicial
executions remained inadequate. Police officers often
failed to protect crime scenes, and statements from
officers were often taken only after long delays.
Numerous police officers charged with unlawful
killings fled from justice, including the officer charged
with the murder of lo-year-old Renee Lyons in 2003 in
Kingston.
a In February, six police officers were acquitted of
the 2001 murder of seven young men In Braeton despite
overwhelming evidence that the seven had been
extrajudicially executed. The judge ruled that the
prosecution had failed to present suffiCient evidence
for the case to continue.
a In August, six police officers were charged with the
murder while on duty of two elderly men kil led when
police officers opened fire on their taxi in the Flankers
area in October 2003- The trial had not taken place by
the end of 2005·
a In December, the trial of six police officers charged
with the murder of two men and two women in Crawle
In 2003 resulted in acquittals. In j uly, two police officers
were charged with intending to pervert the course of
justice and other offences in connection with the
killings. It was alleged that the officers had attempted
Amnesty International Report 2006

to alter the crime scene to make it appear that the
victims had fired at the police. The investigation was
not completed by the end of 2005.
a In December, three police officers were acquitted
of the murder of 15-year-old jason Smith in 2003 In
Kingston.
In October, a law was passed to establish a police
Civilian Oversight Authority. However, the law did not
mandate the Authority to play any major role in
investigating alleged unlawful killings by polIce but
related to matters such as the effiCient use of resources.
In November, the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights issued a report critical of jamaica's
handling of the case of Michael Gayle, who was
allegedly beaten to death by members of the security
forces in 1999. No one was ever charged with the kil ling.

Death penalty
New sentencing hearings were held following the 2004
decision by the judicial Committee of the Privy Council
that mandatory death sentences were
unconstitutional . At least four prisoners were re­
sentenced to death and at least 11 had their sentences
commuted to terms of imprisonment.
Throughout lOOS, high levels of crime led to calls for
the resumption of executions. There were discussions
between the government and the opposition regarding
changes to the Constitution to facilitate executions.
Torture and ill-treatment in detention
Conditions in prisons and other places of detention
were reported to be harsh and in many cases amounted
to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
In April, one prisoner and one guard were shot dead
and other prisoners beaten during an attempted escape
from the Tower Street Correctional Centre. A
government-appointed Board of I nquiry investigated
the incident and found numerous violations of
prisoners' human rights, including one prisoner beaten
to death by guards and another dying because he was
not given timely medical attention after being injured.
There were no reported criminal charges brought in
connection with the abuse of prisoners.
Violence against women
According to government figures, in the first eight
months of 2005 there were 835 reported sexual assaults
against women and girls, of which 67 per cent were
against girls, and 16 per cent were at gunpoint. Most
injuries to women were Inflicted by an intimate
partner. Rates of HIV infection among women and girls
were rising, and people living with HIV faced systematic
discrimination.
Routine investigations of sexual assaults were
reported to be inadequate, and despite the special
units set up to work with victims of sexual assault,
police investigations were often returned to the
regular constabulary.
Amendments to reform and update the Offences

renewed efforts by the government to secure a
permanent seat on the UN Security Council, increased
tensions in the east ASia region. The government was
criticized for its continued failure to apologize
adequately and provide full reparations for wartime
crimes against humanity such as forced sexual slavery,
and for the way Japanese history textbooks portray its
past aggressions.
The Diet (parliament) debated but did not adopt a Bill
first submitted in 2003 to establish a national human
rights commission.
The government indicated that it would accede to the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court by 2009.

Death pena lty
Kitagawa Susumu was executed in secret by hanging in
September, while the Diet was in recess. A former
police officer, Kitagawa Susumu was sentenced to
death in 1994 for the murder of two women, in 1983 and
1986. His appeal had been rejected by the Supreme
Court in 2000.
The japan Federation of Bar Associations held a joint
international conference against the death penalty in
December, reiterating calls for a moratorium. On his
appointment in October, the Mini ster of justice, Sugiura
Seiken, acknowledged the worldwide trend towards
abolition of the death penalty and announced that he
would not personally sign any execution order. He
immediately retracted this commitment.
Treatment of prisoners
A new Penal Facilities and Treatment of Prisoners Law
was adopted in May, replacing the 1908 law. It provides
for a monitoring body to inspect prisons, improved
access to the outside world for prisoners and human
rights education for prison staff. It does not, however,
cover conditions in pre-trial detention or for prisoners
sentenced to death.
a In November, two guards at Nagoya prison received
suspended sentences for killing a prisoner in 2001.
Otomaru Mikio was sentenced to threeyears in prison,
suspended for four years, for aiming water from a high­
pressure hose at a naked prisoner, causing internal
injuries. Takami Masahiro received a 14-month prison
term, suspended for three years, for assisting in the attack.

reparations. Survivors were also denied a remedy in the
japanese courts. In February the Supreme Court rejected
a compensation claim by seven Taiwanese survivors (the
case had begun with nine but two died). A Tokyo High
Court also rejected a case by Chinese survivors in March.
Courts continued to argue that compensation claims
were settled by post-war treaty arrangements. Contrary
to international law, some applied statutes of limitation.
In june a US federal appeals court rejected, for the second
time, a damages suit filed by 15 survivors. The court cited
japan's immunity from such lawsuits in the USA.

Trafficking in persons
Amendments to the Criminal Code increased
punishments for unlawfully detaining or buying
trafficked persons. Related amendments were made
to the Immigration Law and Criminal Procedure Code
but none adequately addressed the protection of
victims of trafficking. The government's commitment
to ratify the U N Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and
Children (the Palermo Protocol) was not fulfil led by
the end of 2005.
Restrictions on freedom of expression
The Tokyo High Court reinstated the convictions for
trespass against three people detained in 2004 for
distributing pamphlets within a residential military
compound, opposingjapanese involvement in Iraq.
They were fined between 100, 000 and 200,000 yen and
appealed to the Supreme Court.
Refugees
Revisions to the Immigration and Refugee Recognition
Law effective from May increased time limits for filing
asylum claims from 60 days to six months from arrival
in japan. Revisions also established an expert
committee to give confidential recommendations to
the Minister of justice on appeals against rejected
asylum claims. Appointed by the Ministry of justice,
most of the 18 members were former officials and only a
few were refugee law experts.
The number of people recognized as refugees under
the limited provisions of japan's refugee law rose to at
least 46. More than 40 others were granted special
permission to stay for humanitarian reasons. Some
individuals were released on condition they did not
take up employment, but without basic livel ihood

other publications that CrIticized the government .
Under the Public Assemblies Law, they reportedly

o Three men were charged in September with
belonging to the outlawed Islamist group Hizb al-Tahrir
al-Islaml (Islamic Liberation Party) and distributing
leaflets. They were arrested i n J uly, apparently whIle at
a conference on Islam In Amman. In all, 28 members
were reported to have been arrested during the year
and remained in detention, two of them for trying to
organize a demonstratIOn in a Palestinian refugee camp.
Abuses in the context of the 'war on terror'
There were persistent reports that Jordan permitted
the US government to maintain a secret detention and
interrogation centre on its territory. The Jordanian
authorities denied thiS.
Scores of people were arrested on suspiCion of
Involvement In terrorism. Most were detained
Incommunicado by the General I ntel ligence
Department (GI D), the main securIty service
responsible for the arrest of pol itical detainees. More
than a hundred people appeared before the SSC, whose
proceedings fall far short of international fair trial
standards and whose judges are invarIably mIhtary
officers, even when the accused are civIlians.
1 56

Dozens of securIty-related or political cases were
heard by the SSC in 2005. In many of these, defendants
reportedly told the court that they had been tortured to
extract "confessions". In no case known to AI did judges
instigate an independent investigation into allegations
of torture.
a Sheikh Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi was rearrested
in July, four days after he was released from Six months'
detention Without charge or trial, on suspicion of
contacting "terror" groups. At the end of the year he
was stil l held Incommunicado at an unknown location.
a AI was informed in 2005 by two Yemeni nationals
that they had been detained and tortured for several
days each by the G I D in October 2003 before being flown
out of Jordan in a military airplane to a secret detention
camp run by US offiCials. Muhammad Faraj Bashmilah
said he was arrested when he travelled to Amman from
I ndonesia to meet his mother. Salah Nasser Salim was
arrested in IndoneSia, where he lived, then flown to
Jordan and tortured by the GID, including by being hung
upside down and beaten on the soles of his feet.

Torture and ill-treatment
In June the government-funded National Centre for
Human Rights said it had received 250 reports of torture
between J une 2003 and December 2004. It also pOinted
to the difficulties faced by crimina l and SSC defendants
in proving torture allegations. However, in one case, 10
police officers were sentenced in March to prison terms
of up to 30 months after they were convicted of
involvement in the death of 'Abdal lah al-Mashaqbeh,
who died In September 2004 in Jweldeh prison.
Discrimination and violence aga inst women
Amendments to the Personal Status Law, which would
give women rights to divorce without their husband's
consent, remained pending before parliament.
Article 98 of the Penal Code continue d to be i nvoked
as a defence by men being tried for killing female
relatives. The Article allows for reduced sentences
where killings are committed in a "fit of rage" caused by
"unlawfu l" or "dangerous" acts on the part of the victim.
In July 2004 the Justice Ministry proposed raising the
minimum sentence for crimes committed In a "fit of
rage" to five years' Imprisonm ent, but no progress on
this was evident in 2005. At least five men who said they
had committed killings in defence of their family's
"honour" benefited from Article 98 dUrIng the year, and
at least 12 women and one man were reported to have
been victims of family killings.
Dozens of women were administrat ively detained
without charge or trial. Some of them, including victims
of rape, women who had become pregnant outSide
marriage and women accused of extramarital sexual
relations or of being prostitutes, were believed to be
held to protect them from their famIly and community
members. Some were detained after serving prison
sentences; others had not been convicted of any
offence. In the past, women have been kil led by
relatives after they were released from "protective"
custody, including In cases where their relatives had
signed a guarantee not to harm them.

In June, activists launched the Jordanian Coalition to
Help Women In Protective Custody, which the Interior
Minister promised to support.

Death pena lty
At least I I people were sentenced to death and 1 1 were
executed. On 16 November an Italian newspaper
quoted King 'Abdallah saying that "Jordan could soon
become the first country in the Middle East without
capital punishment:
Cl In May, Zuheir Ahmed al-Khatib was sentenced to
death for three murders including one for which
another man, Bilal Musa, was executed in 2000. Bilal
Musa had also been convicted of 10 other murders but
alleged at his trial that he was tortured while held
incommunicado by the Criminal Investigation
Department (CID). H is wife, who received a 15-year
prison sentence but subsequently died, had also
alleged that she was tortured. No judicial investigation
was conducted into their torture allegations. Zuheir
Ahmed al-Khatib was executed by hanging at Swaqa
prison on 8 November for two murders - his conviction
and sentence for the third murder had been overturned
on appeal In September.

Asylum-seekers and refugees from Uzbekistan were
at risk of detention a nd forcible return. At least eight
men were forcibly returned to Uzbekista n. An
opposition pa rty was closed down a nd some
members briefly deta ined. Aja iled opposition leader
was recom mended for ea rly release.
Background
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE) said the December 2005 presidential
election, which saw incumbent PreSident Nursultan
Nazarbaev win over 90 per cent of the votes, fell far
short of OSCE and Counci I of Europe standards. The
Amnesty International Report 2006

Constitutional Council had brought forward the
election date by a year in August, and opposition
parties and independent news media complained of
harassment and intimidation by the authorities.

Political imprisonment
Cl I n January a court ordered the closure of the
opposition Democratic Choice of Kazakstan (DVK)
party, In response to an application by the Prosecutor
General's office which accused it of " i nciting social
tension" and "extremism". Police reportedly broke up
a n unauthorized demonstration in Almaty organized
by the DVK and detained eight DVK members,
reportedly for using the slogan "Terror of the state
against its citizens" . Seven were subsequently brought
before a court.
Cl In November the Ministry of Justice recommended
the early release of Gal imzhan Zhakianov, a leading
DVK member. On 1 4 December, a court deCided to grant
him early release. He had been sentenced to seven
years' Imprisonment in 2002 for "abuse of office" and
finanCial Crimes, but the real reason for his
imprisonment appeared to be his peaceful opposition
activities.
Fear of forcible retu rn
Refugees from Uzbekistan were not effectively
protected and risked being forcibly returned to
Uzbekistan and subjected to serious human rights
violations there. Some had fled to Kazakstan after the
security forces fired indiSCriminately on a crowd in
Andizhan, Uzbeklstan, on 1 3 May, killing hundreds of
people. Others were suspected members of banned
IslamiC parties or movements. The Uzbekistani
authOrities have frequently targeted suspected
sympathizers of such organizations or Independent
Muslims in the name of national security.
Cl Lutfullo ShamsuddInov, a prominent human rights
defender, fled Uzbekistan with his wife and five
children. His eyewitness testimony of the events in
Andizhan, quoted by the international media, d iffered
from the offiCial account. Although recognized as a
refugee by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) on 27 May, he was arrested by the Kazakstanl
police on 4 July at the request of the Uzbekistani
authorities, who said that he faced charges of
"terrorism', a capital offence, and spreading
information to cause panic. Despite pressure from
Uzbekistan, the Kazakstani authorities eventually
handed him over to UNHCR, which flew him and his
family to another country.
Cl On 24 and 27 November, 10 Uzbekistani nationals
were allegedly detained by the National Security
Committee (KNB), the security services, and held
incommunicado in the southern city ofShymkent. They
were reportedly wanted for "partiCipatIOn In a banned
religious organization" and "attempting to overthrow the
constitutional order". According to reports, at least eight
of them were fOrcibly returned to Uzbeklstan early in the
morning of 29 November. One man escaped Into hiding In
Kazakstan, and the whereabouts of another were
unclear. Of the eight deportees, two were given access to

lawyers and their place o f detention i n Uzbekistan was
known, but the location of the remaining six was still
unclear at the end of 2005. Reportedly, four of the eight
men were holding asylum-seeker certificates issued by
the UNHCR Office in Kazakstan.

There was increased intimidation and harassment of
the media a nd journalists by the authorities.
Violence against women, including rape a nd
domestic violence, remained a serious concern. The
work of human rights defenders was obstructed.
Background
The protracted constitution-making process ended
after a referendum on 2[ November in which 57 per cent
of voters rejected the draft constitution. Campaigning
was marred by violence, with at least eight people
killed in Kisumu and Mombasa. Following the
referendum, President Kibaki sacked the entire
cabinet, announcing a new cabinet on 7 December.
The proliferation of illegal weapons remained a
serious concern. In july, the authorities burned 3,786
small arms recovered by police. According to police
estimates, over 20,000 crimes were committed in the
country annual ly using small arms.
In early june, four men charged with murder following
the bombing of a hotel In Kikambala near Mombasa in
November 2002 were acquitted after the trial judge ruled
there was no evidence to connect them to the murders.
One of them was rearrested and charged with illegal
possession of arms. His application for bail was rejected.
On 27 june, Nairobi's Chief Magistrate acquitted another
three men charged with conspiracy to commit murder in
the November 2002 hotel attack, saying that the
prosecution had failed to prove its case.
More than 300,000 people continued to be internally
displaced in Kenya. Conflict along borders and over
access to scarce resources such as water and grazing
lands, as well as inter-communal hostility aggravated
by political rivalry, were among the main causes of
internal displacement.
In March, Kenya ratified the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court (ICC). Kenya did not sign
the Article 98 exemption that would give US citizens on
Kenyan soil immunity from prosecution by the ICe.

1 58

Kenya presented its second periodic report for
consideration by the UN Human Rights Committee in
March, after an [8-year delay.

Attacks on freedom of the media
There was increased intimidation and harassment of
the media and journalists as the authorities took
aggressive measures to silence investigative or
critical voices.
a Criminal libel charges were brought against
Kamau Ngotho, an i nvestigative journal ist, arising
from an article about corruption published in the
Standard in january. Following a public outcry, the
charges were dropped.
a In September, David Ochami of the Kenya Times
was arrested and charged with "publishing alarming
information" for writing an article critical of the
President. H is trial started in November.
a The wife of the President went to the premise� of
the Nation Media Group on 2 May, accompanied by
bodyguards, al legedly to complain about criticisms of
her. She reportedly assaulted a cameraman, Clifford
Derrick Otieno, who was filming the scene. He
complained to police, but no further action was taken,
and the Attorney General terminated a private
prosecution that he initiated.
Violence against women
Women and girls continued to face widespread
violence and discrimination. However, data on the
prevalence of acts of violence against women,
including domestic violence and rape, was
inadequate. According to figures quoted in
parliament, police recorded 2, 300 rapes in 2004.
However, statistics from health facilities and non­
governmental organizations suggested that the
number of unreported rapes in Kenya could be as high
as [6,000 a year.
In April, parliament agreed to discuss a proposed
Sexual Offences Bill.
Human rights defenders and demonstrators
The work of human rights defenders was obstructed.
They were subjected to harassment and ill-treatment.
During protests and demonstrations, demonstrators
and their leaders were arrested and charged.
a Scores of anti-globalization activists were arrested
in early March in Mombasa. They were protesting
against unfair trade practices while officials from 33
countries met to discuss trade negotiations ahead of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Hong
Kong in December. The activists were charged with
"conducting an unlawful procession".
a Before the opening of parliament in March, police
in Nairobi used tear gas and water cannons to disperse
some 200 people demonstrating peacefully to demand
a referendum on the draft constitution. Seven people
were arrested and detained. Two of them, injured
during the arrest, were reportedly denied access to
medical care.
a At least one person was killed by the police in
further demonstrations over the draft constitution in

KEN

july. About 20 people were detained and charged with
"creating disturbance and malicious damage".
a On 10 August, 22 activists demonstrating against
irregular allocation of public land to private investors
in Kitale Town were arrested and detained. On 12
August, Father Gabriel Dolan, a well-known human
rights defender who had taken part in the
demonstration, was arrested when he visited those in
custody. Father Dolan was charged with "incitement to
violence, malicious damage of property by a rioting
assembly group and taking part in unlawful assembly".

Torture and unlawful killings
There were continuing reports of torture and unlawful
kil lings by state agents.
A survey commissioned by the Kenya Human Rights
Commission to establish the level of public awareness
of human rights disclosed that people were reluctant to
report torture.
In March, human rights groups condemned a
statement by the Minister for Internal Security calling
for police to shoot to kill anyone found with i l legal
firearms. Human rights defenders argued that while
they deplored the level of insecurity in the country,
shooting in such conditions would amount to unlawful
killing.
There were several reports of unlawful kills
perpetrated by law enforcement officials. Few such
cases were investigated or prosecuted, encouraging
impunity for such acts. No statistics were available on
the number of people killed by police.
Protection of refugees and asylum-seekers
Approximately 240,000 refugees and asylum-seekers
lived in Kenya. Refugees lived in designated refugee
camps - Dadaab had about 1 38,000 refugees,
predominantly from Soma lia, and Kakuma had about
87, 1 00 refugees, the majority from Sudan. There were
also substantial numbers from Ethiopia, Eritrea and
neighbouring countries i n the Great Lakes region. An
estimated 15,000 to 60,000 refugees were l iving
without the necessary documents in Nairobi and
other towns.
In April, the Minister for Immigration, Registration
of Persons and Refugees stated that non-citizens who
did not possess necessary registration documents
would be deported to their countries of origin. The
deadline for registration was fixed for 30 june, later
extended to 15 August 2005. Large numbers of people
turned up at the Office of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees in Nairobi in june in order to register an
asylum claim. Many would be at risk of serious human
rights violations in their countries of origin i f they
were arrested and deported. The process of refugee
status determination was still under way at the end of
the year.
In March, the authorities released former I raqi air
force pilot, Adel Mohammed AI-Dahas, after four years
in detention in a police cel l in Nairobi despite the fact
that he was granted refugee status in 200 J . By the end of
2005, his request for resettlement to a third country
had not yet been granted.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Death penalty
In March, the Minister of justice and Constitutional
Affairs declared at the UN Commission on Human
Rights that his government was committed to
abolishing the death penalty and that in the meantime
all death sentences would be commuted to life
imprisonment. At the end of the year, however, this
process had not been completed.
In April, the High Court in Kakamega freed four
Ugandans who had been on death row since 1995 after a
successful appeal against their death sentences. The
four were members of the February Eighteen
Movement, which allegedly aimed to overthrow the
former government in Kenya.
Impact of 'anti-terrorism' operations on
human rights
Human rights violations were committed during "anti­
terrorism" operations conducted since the 2002
bombing of a hotel near Mombasa that killed 15 people.
The violations included: the use of torture and other ill­
treatment during detention including physical abuse;
detention of suspects without charge in undisclosed
locations and without access to a lawyer or relatives;
the holding of suspects in degrading and unsanitary
conditions without access to medical care; harassment
of family members and arbitrary detention of relatives
to put pressure on suspects to hand themselves in; and
the failure of police to show warrants when arresting
individuals or conducting searches of property.

Access by independent monitors continued to be
restri cted.
Background
In March, North Korea declared itself a nuclear power.
In September. the fourth round of six-party talks in
Beijing (involving North Korea, South Korea, China.
Japan, Russia and the USA) reached a breakthrough
accord in which North Korea pledged to abandon its
nuclear programmes in exchange for aid and security
assurances. However, there was no further progress on
implementing the agreement.
Internationa l scrutiny
In April the UN Commission on Human Rights expressed
concern about the human rights situation in North
Korea, the third such resolution in three years.
In November, for the first time, the UN General
Assembly passed a resolution expressing concern
about the human rights situation in North Korea.
In August, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation
of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) reported that there was evidence of
torture, detention without trial, public executions and
capital punishment for political dissidents.
In J uly, the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women considered North Korea's
initial periodic report. The Committee expressed
concern about the government's lack of awareness of the
extent of domestic violence, the absence of legislation to
deal with violence against women, including domestic
Violence, and the lack of prevention and protection
measures for victims. The Committee also expressed
concern that the government had not given sufficient
information on the impact of the famine and natural
disasters on women and young girls. The Committee was
concerned that in such circumstances, they might
become vulnerable to trafficking and other forms of
exploitation, such as prostitution.
Denial of access
Information and access continued to be highly
controlled. Despite repeated requests, the

1 60

government continued to deny access to independent
human rights monitors including the UN Special
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the
DPRK and the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to
adequate food.

Death pena lty
There were renewed reports of executions of political
opponents in political prisons, and of executions of
people charged with economic crimes, such as stealing
food. Unconfirmed reports suggested that people
operating underground churches had been executed.
Cl In February, there were unconfirmed reports that
about 70 North Korean defectors had been executed
in publiC in January after being forcibly repatriated
from China.
a Video footage emerged showing two people being
shot in a public execution. The execution reportedly
took place on I March in Hoeryang, a north-east�rn city,
after a public trial of 1 1 people charged with trafficking
in people and aiding unauthorized visits to China. The
footage also showed an execution which reportedly
took place on 2 March in the nearby city of Yuson.
Torture and ill-treatment
Hundreds of North Koreans forcibly returned from
China faced detention, torture or ill-treatment, and up
to three years' imprisonment in appalling conditions.
Prisoners reportedly died from malnutrition in
labour camps for political prisoners and in detention
centres, which were severely overcrowded. Prisoners
charged with breaking prison rules had their food cut
even further.
Women in detention
Women detainees continued to be subjected to
degrading prison conditions. Prisons lacked baSic
facilities for women's needs. There were unconfirmed
reports that pregnant women detainees were forced to
undergo abortions after being forcibly returned from
China. Women detainees stated that during pre-trial
detention male guards humiliated them and touched
them inappropriately. Women who attempted to
protest were reportedly beaten. All women, including
those who were pregnant or elderly, were forced to
work from early morning to late at night in fields or
prison factories.
Freedom of expression
Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and
aSSOCiation persisted.
a I n J uly, 64-year-old Moon Sung-Jun was reportedly
arrested on suspicion of leading an underground
church in Shinuiju, North Pyongan province. At least 80
local reSidents, including eight of Moon Sung-Jun's
siblings were reportedly detained and questioned on
suspicion of attending the church.

diplomatic missions to seek permission to leave China.
At the end of 2005, more than 100 were awaiting
decisions in diplomatic missions.
North Korean women in China were reportedly
exploited sexually, including through forced marriages
and trafficking into the sex industry. The authorities In
Viet Nam, Laos and CambodIa reportedly increased
forcible repatriations of North Korean refugees who
were attempting to reach South Korea.
People assisting North Koreans in ChIna were
targeted by the North Korean authorities.
a I n March, Kang Gun, who had settled in South
Korea, was reportedly abducted by North Korean
agents from Longjing in Jilin province in China, where
he was helping North Koreans who had fled to China as
a result of the food crisis. He was apparently held in a
National Security Agency prison in Pyongyang.

The right to food
A national nutrition survey conducted by the
government, the World Food Programme (WFP) and
the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) was published in
March. It found that 7 per cent of children were
severely malnourished; 37 per cent were chronically
malnourished; 23-4 per cent were underweight; and one
in three mothers was malnourished and anaemic. The
study found that the plight of the most vulnerable had
been aggravated by an economic adjustment process
initiated in mid-2002 that led to steep increases in the
market prices of basic foods, and sharply lower
incomes for mill ions of factory workers made
redundant or employed part-time. Market prices of
cereals, which tripled in 2004, continued to rise.
In September the government called for more
development aid and an end to humanitarIan aid, citing
good agricultural harvests in 2005. I t also called for
WFP monitors to be expelled, raising concerns about
the monitoring of food aid. Reports in September
suggested that up to half of bilateral food aid supplied
by China and South Korea did not reach the intended
recipients.
At the government's request, the WFP shut down five
regional offices and 19 food factories in North Korea in
December.

Refugee recognition procedures did not ta ke i nto
accou nt the threats faced by asylum-seekers. A draft
bill to abolish the death pena lty was introduced. At
least 63 prisoners rema i ned u nder sentence of death.
At least eight prisoners of conscience sentenced
u nder the National Security Law (NSL) were released.
The NSL, which allowed the i mprisonment of
prisoners of conscience, remained in use. At least
200,000 irregular migrant workers faced detention
a nd deportation. Despite improved protections for
migra nt workers, poor working conditions and
discrimination in wages and access to justice
continued. At least 1 ,090 conscientious objectors
remained imprisoned for refusing to do military
service.
Refugees and asylum-seekers
Refugee recognition procedures lacked transparency
and failed to take into account threats faced by asylum­
seekers. Refugee status was granted to as few as 40
applicants between February 2001 - when asylum was
granted for the first time under the UN Refugee
Convention - and the end of 2005, 15 of them in 2005.
Detention poliCies for asylum-seekers were vague and
arbitrary.
In May new guidelines under the I mmigration Law
required that asylum-seekers who had not possessed
valid reSidence visas for over three years be detained
and fined before their applications were considered.
Applicants were not informed of the grounds for
decisions on their cases. They did not receive suffiCient
protection or support, including from qualified
interpreters, and were not a llowed to work.
a In March the authorities rejected asylum
applications made by nine Myanmar nationals in May
2000. I n April the men were ordered to leave the
country within five days. On appeal i n J u ly, they were
allowed to stay until April 2006. They were reportedly
active in opposition political activities in Myanmar and
South Korea that put them at risk of serious human
rights violations if they returned to Myanmar. Although
no interpreters were present during the I nterviews,
applicants' signatures had been added to the
transcripts of their testimonies. The lawyers
complained that transcripts of their interviews
appeared to have been either omitted or dIstorted.

Migrant workers
Basic rights of migrant workers appeared to be
strengthened after the Employment Permit System Act
came Into effect In August 2004. However, migrant
workers continued to face widespread discriminatio n in
wages and in access to Justice. Many worked in
dangerous conditions, were not paid regularly or did not
receive severance pay. In December, there were over
200,000 undocumented migrant workers liable to
Immediate detention pending deportation.
� In May, Anwar Hossain, head of the new Migrants
Trade Union that had not been recognized by the
government, was arrested by over 30 immigration and
police officers and reportedly assaulted. The day before
his arrest, he had criticized government poliCy towards
irregular migrant workers in a national newspaper. He
was still held at the Chonju I mmigration Detention
Centre at the end of 2005.
Death penalty
There were no executions. At least 63 prisoners
remained under sentence of death. A bill to abolish the
death penalty, proposed by 175 members of the 299member National Assembly in December 2004, was
introduced in the Legislation and judiciary Committee of
the National Assembly in February.
National Security law
Under a presidential amnesty in August, at least eight
prisoners of conscience sentenced under the NSL were
released. At least two long-term prisoners were serving
sentences imposed under the NSL.
<"'5J Kang Tae-woon, aged 75, sentenced to six years'
Imprisonment in August 2003 for espionage, was
reportedly in poor health. HiS sentence was reportedly
reduced by half in August.
The NSL, in force since 1948, allowed for long prison
sentences or the death penalty for non-violent political
activities, Including vaguely termed offences such as
"benefiting the enemy" or "anti-state" activities. Despite
growing support for repeal of the NSL, Including from
President Roh Moo-hyun and the National Human Rights
Commission, the government did not amend or repeal it.
Conscientious objectors
At least 1,090 conscientious objectors, most of them
jehovah's Witnesses, were in prison at the end of 2005
for their refusal to carry out compulsory military service.
The government gave no consideration to introducing an
alternative civilian service.
Update
Um Tae-hoon was released in june. He had been arrested
In February 2004 and sentenced to 18 months'
imprisonment in july 2004 for refusing to perform
military service because of his pacifist beliefs and

Political arrests and imprisonment
The authorities detained 14 people in May for
questioning about their links to the Ummah Party,
which was formed in january despite the ban on
political parties and apparently advocates pluralism
and peaceful political change. They were released but
reportedly charged with establishing a political party to
promote a change of government, punishable by up to
15 years' imprisonment. Their trial had not taken place
by the end of the year.
At least 29 prisoners continued to serve sentences
imposed in 1991 after manifestly unfair trials before
Martial Law and State Security Courts for
"collaborating" with Iraqi forces during their
occupation of Kuwait. Sentences ranged from 15 years
to life imprisonment.
Abuses in the context of the 'war on terror'
Gun battles in january between security forces and
Islamist armed groups left 12 people dead.
In February, the authorities detained at least 30
people for suspected l inks to al-Qa'ida and related
groups. Amer Khlaif al-Enezi, the al leged leader, died
in custody eight days after his arrest in unclear

circumstances; the Interior Minister later denied that
he had been tortured. Others were among 37 people
brought to trial in May, including II in absentia, on
terrorism-related charges. They were accused of
belonging to the Peninsula Lions Brigade, a llegedly
li nked to al-Oa'ida, calling for war against the state
and attempting to kill members of Kuwait's security
forces and other "friendly forces". Some defendants
said they had confessed under torture and showed the
court what they said were torture injuries. Following
repeated requests by defence lawyers, the court
appointed an independent medical commission to
probe the torture a llegations. On 27 December, six
were sentenced to death, one was sentenced to l i fe
imprisonment, others received prison terms of
between four months and IS years, and seven were
acquitted.
Twenty-four suspected militants arrested in previous
years were tried on charges of recruiting people to join
terrorist groups, including groups fighting US-led forces
in Iraq. One received an eight-year prison sentence, 19
received three-year terms and four were fined and
released.
Six of 12 Kuwaiti nationals held for over three years in
the US prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were
released and returned to Kuwait, where they were
detained. Nasser Najd al-Mutairi, aged 28, was
acquitted by the Lower Court on I s J une of belonging to
al-Oa'ida, seeking to take up arms against a friendly
state, and possessing weapons. The Appeals Court
overturned the verdict on 2 November and sentenced
him to five years' imprisonment. The other five were
being detained pending trial .

Abuse of migrant workers
M igrant workers, who constitute a large part of
Kuwait's workforce, protested against working
conditions, non-payment of wages, arbitrary pay cuts,
ill-treatment, unsatisfactory living conditions, and
non-renewal of residence permits. The authorities said
they were considering changes to the country's labour
laws to improve conditions for migrant workers. I n
October it was announced that a new contract
stipulating a minimum wage for domestic workers
would come into effect at the start of 2006.
Women migrant workers in domestic service were
especially vulnerable to abuse because of
discriminatory legislation and practices, and the
exclusion of domestic workers from the protection of
labour laws. They suffered gender-based violence,
including rape by employers or their aSSOCiates, and
had little recourse given the prevailing climate of
impunity for perpetrators of crimes against migrant
domestic workers.

Hundreds of people fled to Kyrgyzstan after security
forces reportedly fired on thousands of mainly
una rmed and peaceful demonstrators in
neighbouring Uzbekistan in May. Fou r Uzbekistani
men were forcibly returned to Uzbekistan in June,
and the Uzbekistani security forces pursued refugees
a nd asylum-seekers on Kyrgyzsta ni territory, in some
cases with the co-operation of the a uthorities in
Kyrgyzsta n. Many were una ble to access asyl um
procedures. Kyrgyzstani citizens a mong those who
fled Uzbekistan were not protected from being
pursued illegally in Kyrgyzsta n by the Uzbekistani
security forces.
Background
In February elections to a new unicameral parliament
sparked widespread protests amid a llegations of fraud
and vote-rigging. On 24 March oppOSItion supporters
stormed government buildings in the capital, Bishkek,
and a loose coalition of political groups took power.
President Askar Akaev formally resigned on 4 April
after talks in Moscow.
Feliks Kulov, leader of the opposition Ar-Namys
(Dignity) party and former Minister of National
Security, was released from prison - where he was
serving a 17-year sentence for abuse of office and
embezzlement after a n allegedly political trial - and
was asked by parliament to take charge of national
security and restore order. Kurmanbek Bakiev, a
leading opposition member and a former Prime
Minister, was named acting Prime Minister and
President by parliament. The old parliament
disbanded on 28 March and recognized the legitimacy
of the newly elected parl iament. In April the Supreme
Court overturned Feliks Kulov's convictions on
charges of embezzlement and corruption. I n
presidential elections o n 1 0 July, Kurmanbek Bakiev
was elected President. He appointed Feliks Kulov
Prime Minister.
A law enacted in August to outlaw extremism
appeared to threaten freedom of expression and, in
particular, freedom of the media because of its broad
definition of extremist activities and extremist materials.
Tensions increased in September and October. More
than 20 inmates were killed in widespread prison riots,
which were reportedly in response to harsh prison
conditions and collusion between prison authorities

1 63

and jailed criminal leaders. Tynychbek Akmatbaev, a
member of parliament (MP), two of his assistants, and
Ikmatullo Polotov, a senior prisons offiCial, were kil led
while viSiting one of these pnsons on 20 October.
Demonstrat ions In Bishkek led by the M P's brother,
Ryspek Akmatbaev, who was awai ting tria I on murder
charges in a separate case, accused Feliks Kulov of
complicity in the deaths. However, the demonstra tions
were called off a week later after President Bakiev
agreed to meet a delegation . On I November more
violence erupted when government forces tried to
regain control of pnsons left without guards and
administrators following the October riots.
A moratorium on executions was extended for
another year. Draft amendments to the Constitution
Included the permanent and ful l aboli    of the death
penalty.

Refugees from Uzbekistan at risk
Over 540 men, women and children crossed into
Kyrgyzstan in the early hours of 14 May following the
reported killings of hundreds of demonstra tors in
Andizhan, Uzbekistan , on 1 3 May (see Uzbekistan entry).
I nitially in a makeshi ft camp near the border, their
safety could not be guarantee d and the Office of the UN
High Commissio ner for Refugees (UN HCR) moved them
to a camp at Besh-Kan a on 4 June. However, Kyrgyzsta ni
officials allegedly handed over lists of their names and
home addresses to the Uzbekista ni security services,
who put pressure on relatives to persuade refugees to
return voluntan ly- including by transport the
relatives in buses to the camp - and reportedly
Infiltrated the camp. Uzbekista nl media reports
descnbed it as a "terrorist" camp run by "dangerous
criminals" , and the local populatio n reportedly
threatened to force the refugees out. On 29 July, UNHCR
airlifted 439 refugees to a holding centre in Romania,
pending resettleme nt.

Extraditions and threat of forcible return

Kyrgyzstan came under pressure from Uzbekistan to
extradite a large number of the refugees. Although
President Bakiev gave UNHCR guarantees of temporary
protection for an initial group of over 540 refugees, on 9
J une the authorities forcibly returned four of them to
Uzbekistan in contravention of their international
obligations. On 16 J une the Uzbekistan Prosecutor
General's Office said it was seeking the extradition of
131 refugees who were "direct participants in the acts of
terrorism [In Andlzhanr.
On 2 2 J une the Prosecutor General of Kyrgyzstan
reportedly described as "criminals" 29 refugees who
had been transferred from the Besh-Kana camp to
detention, indicating they woul d be returned to
Uzbekistan within a week. On 24 June he reportedly
called for the detention of a further 1 03 refugees. He
later said Kyrgyzstan would abide by its international
obligations to protect refugees, and that the 29 in
detention would not be sent back to Uzbekistan until
their refugee determination had been completed.
Fourteen of the 29 were evacuated to Romania for
resettlement i n July and a further I I of them were
resettled to other European countries in September.

1 64

The status of the other four was disputed. The
Uzbekistani authorities said that one had been
convicted of narcotics offences and the others were
wanted for the kill of the Andizhan city prosecutor
on 13 May. UNHCR recognized one as a refugee, a
decision rejected by the Kyrgyzstani authorities. The
Kyrgyzstani authorities initially did not al low the
other three to apply for asylum, and a court upheld
the men's appeal against this decision, referring the
cases back for reconsideration.

Lack of access to asylum procedures
Of the hundreds of people who fled Uzbekistan after
13 May, some were reportedly denied entry or were
forcibly returned to Uzbekistan. Others were said to
have stayed with relatives or friends, or lived without
proper registration, since effective opportuni ties to
legalize their presence in Kyrgyzstan did not exist.
Little or no information was readily accessible to them
on how to lodge an asylum claim. Although UNHCR
registered asylum claims independently, the
Kyrgyzstan authorities did not provide physical
protection from the Uzbekistani authorities.
a In late June, Bakhodir Sadikov, an asylum-seeker
from Uzbekistan hiding in Osh region, registered his
asylum claim with UNHCR but was detained on his way
from the office for having no registration papers. He
was on a list of criminal suspects published by the
Uzbekistani authorities in June. Two days later he was
reportedly in a transit prison with another Uzbekistani
asylum-seeker, Hadir Ulmas, who had also been hiding
in Osh. Both were believed to have been subsequently
sent back to Uzbekistan.

Fa ilure to protect nationals of Kyrgyzstan
As many as 50 Kyrgyzstani men, in Andizhan for
professional or private reasons, fled with the refugees
after 13 May. However, in Kyrgyzstan they were put in a
refugee camp; no notification was sent to their families'
'
and there was no record of their arrival in search of
protection or of their protection needs. The camp
authorities transferred them directly to a temporary
detention centre, where they were held for up to 1 5
days o n administrative charges.
Families reported that law enforcement officers
systematically extorted large sums of money to allow
them to visit their relatives in the camp or to have
relatives released from the camp or from detention.
The details of 37 of the Kyrgyzstani men were included
in the list of wanted criminal suspects published by the
Uzbekistani authorities in June. To avoid being seized
and forCibly transferred to Uzbekistan, those on the list
went into hiding.
n Relatives asked the local authorities in Osh for
information about the whereabouts of four young
men from Kyrgyzstan who went missing after the
Andlzhan events. Two days later a car with
Uzbekistani number plates came to thei r house after
dark, and well-bUilt men who presented no
identification papers or legal warrant, and who they
suspected were from the Uzbekistani security
services, questioned them about every member of the
household.

The internal armed conflict with predominantly
ethnic H mong rebel groups continued. The fate of
hundreds of H mong civilians who surrendered to the
authorities was not known. At least four prisoners of
conscience remained in detention a nd one long-term
political prisoner died in prison. Reports of torture
a nd ill-treatment continued. An increasing number of
death sentences were ha nded down, but no
executions were known to have been carried out. Two
people were sentenced to prison terms for refusing to
renounce their religion, and suppression of religious
practice continued in several provinces.
Background
Assessment of the human rights situation was
hampered by continuing restrictions on freedom of
expression and severe limitations on access by
independent observers and human rights monitors to
the country.
The UN Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women recommended i n
January that domestic violence a n d rape b e made
criminal offences in Laos.
In J une Laos ratified two International Labour
Organization (I LO) Conventions for ending child labour.
However, Laos still did not ratify the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which it had signed in December 2000.
Amnesty International Report 2006

The World Bank gave the final go-ahead to the Nam
Theun 2 dam project, despite continuing concerns
raised by environmental groups on its possible Impact
on the thousands of people needing resettlement and
the livelihoods of many others.
Opium poppy cultivation and opium production
continued to decline substantial ly. as Laos moved
towards the goal of becoming opium-free by the end of
2005. However, concerns arose that this had resulted in
an estimated 65,000 members of upland Lao
communities being displaced to areas where their basic
needs were not met.

Ethnic H mong conflict
Covert visits by international journalists to rebel areas
occasionally highlighted the plight of ethniC Hmong
rebels and their families in the decades-old internal
armed confliCt. Attacks by the Lao m i litary on rebel
groups and their families were reported.
Groups of ethniC Hmong civilians, Including women,
children and elderly people, surrendered to the
authorities throughout 2005 because they were unable
to find food in the jungle and lacked basic medical care.
It was unclear what became of them. In June a group of
173 surrendered to the authorities at Chong Thuang
village In Xieng Khouang province. The surrender was
witnessed by two US nationals from the US-based Fact
Finding Commission and two ethniC Hmong US nationals
supporting the Hmong. The four were subsequently
arrested and deported. The surrendering civilians were
taken away by soldiers and their fate and whereabouts
remained unknown. In October it was reported that two
individuals in Chong Thuang village were arrested and
tortured and another was unlawfully killed by Lao
military and police in connection with the surrender.
Despite a public statement by UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that the UN was ready to provide
humanitarian assistance to such groups, the authorities
made no requests, and UN agencies were not given
access.
In October, 242 Hmong people in around 43 families
surrendered In Bolikhamxay province. They reportedly
received virtually no humanitarian assistance. The
authorities denied that surrenders of people from ethniC
Hmong rebel groups had taken place, claiming that they
were local people not connected to rebel groups.
The internal conflict continued to cause hundreds of
ethniC H mong to flee to Thailand, where they JOined
other Hmong refugees. At the end of 2005 more than
6,000 Lao Hmong were living in Phetchabun province.
In February a long overdue report from Laos was
conSidered by the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination (CERD). The Committee reiterated
cal ls for the authorities to a llow UN agencies access to
areas where members of ethnic Hmong groups in conflict
with the authorities have taken refuge, and to provide
emergency humanitarian assistance.
Political i mprisonment
Prisoners of conscience Thongpaseuth Keuakoun and
Seng-aloun Phengphanh remained In detention In

Lao Students' Movement for Democracy arrested in
October 1 999 for attempting to hold a peaceful
demonstration in Vientiane and were reportedly
sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. The identity of
two other members of the group, Keochay and
Bouavanh Chanhmanivong, continued to be disputed
by the authorities; they were reportedly sentenced to
five years' imprisonment and due for release in October
2004. However, there was no confirmation of their
release. The fifth group member died in detention in
2001 following torture by prison guards.
Pangtong Chokbengboun, who was seriously i l l but
denied appropriate medical treatment by the
authorities, d ied in detention in March. His co­
detainee Sing Chanthakoumm ane remained in
detention in harsh conditions. Both men were
arrested in 1975 and detained without charge or trial
for 17 years for "re-education" before being sentenced
to life imprisonment a fter an unfair trial in 1992.

Freedom of religious practice
Despite the constitutional guarantee of freedom of
religion, several denominations faced varying degrees
of harassment and persecution, particularly
evangel ical Christian groups. There were reports of
Christians being subjected to harsh treatment and
forced to renounce their faith.
a Eleven men from the ethnic Bru minority were
arrested in Houeihoy Neua village, Muong Phine
district of Savannakhet Province, while taking part in
Easter celebrations in March. N i ne were released after
signing renunciations of their faith. They had
reportedly spent 48 hours in a rice plantation with their
hands tied and without food or water. Two others ­
Khamchanh, a former village chief and local Communist
Party member, and Vanthong - were subsequently
sentenced to three years' imprisonment on charges of
possessing I llegal weapons. The real reason for their
Imprisonment appeared to be their refusal to renounce
their faith.
Death penalty
Laos retained the death penalty for a wide range of
offences and an increasing number of death sentences
were Imposed. Twenty-six people, including one
woman, were sentenced to death for drug trafficking
offences, bringing the number of people on death row
to at least 60.
No executions were known to have taken place.

In July, the Prime Minister made derogatory
comments regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender ( LGBT) people and the Riga City Council
temporarily withdrew permission for a Gay Pride
march. A report published by the European
Committee for the Prevention ofTorture (CPT)
highlighted several worrying practices and made
recommendations for improvements.
Background
In J une, Latvia ratified the Council of Europe's
Framework Convention for the Protection of National
M inorities. However, the Latvian government's
definition of a minority in practice excluded most
members of the Russian-speaking community in Latvia
from qualifying as a minority.
LGBT rights under attack
On 20 July, the executive director of the Riga City Counci l,
t riks S kapars, withdrew permission for the gay and
lesbian community to hold a Gay Pride march on 23July.
t riks Skapars' decision came after the Prime Minister
stated on television that he could not "accept that a
parade of sexual minorities takes place in the middle of
our capital city next to the Dom Cathedral. This is not
acceptable. Latvia is a state based on Christian values.
We cannot advertise things which are not acceptable to
the majority of our society."
The organizers of the march subsequently made an
official complaint to the Riga administrative court
regarding the decision to ban the march. On 22 July the
administrative court decided to annul t riks S kapars'
decision to withdraw permission for the march. On 23
July the march went ahead as originally planned.
Organizers and news media covering the event
estimated that approximately 300 people participated
in the march. Meanwhile, over a thousand people had
gathered to stage a protest against the march. Some of
the protesters tried to block the march, while others
used tear gas and threw eggs at the marchers.
In July the European Commission's Employment,
Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities unit published its
2005 annual report on equality and non-discrimination.
According to the report, Latvia was the only country in
the European Union which had not fully transposed the
requirement of the Employment Equality Directive and
did not explicitly ban discrimination on grounds of
sexual orientation in employment.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Torture and ill-treatment
In May the CPT published a report based on findings
from a visit to Latvia in 2002. The report highlighted
several worrying practices and made recommendations
for improvement.
The CPT's delegation said that it had received a
conSiderable number of credible allegations of physical
ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies throughout
Latvia. Most of the allegations of ill-treatment related
to events at the time of detention. However, many of
the al legations also concerned ill-treatment during
police questioning. The forms of ill-treatment reported
to the CPT included "asphyxiation with a plastic bag,
strangulation, very severe beating, infliction of electric
shocks, submerging the head of the suspect in the water
of a lake." Some of this ill-treatment was so severe that
it could be considered to constitute torture.
The CPT also remarked on the poor conditions of
detention in police establishments. It stated that "the
situation was particularly bad at Daugavpils, Liepaja
and Ventspils Police headquarters, where persons were
being held 24 hours per day in overcrowded cells, which
were humid, dirty and poorly lit and ventilated." The
CPT further recommended that all those who were
deprived of their liberty by law enforcement
authorities, regardless of the circumstances, be
granted, from the very outset of their deprivation of
liberty, the right to notify a close relative or third party
of their choice about their situation. Concern was also
expressed about the fact that some people in police
custody needed urgent medical attention, but that this
had not been provided.

Former Prime Minister Rafiq al-H a riri a nd more than
30 other people were kil led in bom b attacks against
civilia ns. A UN inquiry suggested that senior
Lebanese a nd Syrian officials were implicated in the
attack on Rafiq al-Ha riri. Severa l people were
a rrested for their alleged connections with a banned
political party. Tens of prisoners, including some
sentenced after unfa i r trials in previous years, were
freed u nder an amnesty law in July. Palestinian
refugees resident in Leba non continued to face
discrimination a nd to be denied access to adequate
housing a nd certa in categories of employment. The
law continued to discriminate against women.
Protection against violence in the home was
inadequate; women migrants employed as domestic
workers were particula rly at risk of a buse. Mass
graves were exhumed in November and December.
Assassination of Rafiq al-Ha riri
Former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri and 22 others
were killed by a car bomb in Beirut on 14 February.
Rafiq al-Hariri's murder sparked popular protests
and the government resigned after losing a confidence
vote in parliament in February. Subsequent elections,
held between 29 May and 1 9 June, were won by the
Future Movement Block, led by Saad al-Hariri, son of
the assassinated former Prime Minister.
Speculation that the Syrian authorities were involved
in the assassination prompted new demands from
within Lebanon and internationally for Syria to
withdraw its military forces from Lebanon, in
accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1559 of
September 2004. I n May the UN confirmed that Syria
had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon.
UN investigation
The UN Security Council sent a fact-finding team, with
the agreement of the Lebanese government, to
investigate the killings. The team's findings led the UN
Security Council to establish the U N I nternational
Independent I nvestigation CommiSSion (UN I I IC).
Four former heads of Lebanese intell igence and
security services - General 'AIi al-Hajj (Internal
Security Forces), General Raymond Azar (Military
I ntel ligence), Brigadier General Jamil al-Sayyed
(Surete Generale) and Mustafa Hamdan (Presidential
Guard) - were arrested on 30 August and remained in

detention a t the end of the year. A n interim report by
U N I I I C published in October impl icated senior
officials of both the Lebanese and Syrian security
services in the assassination and a fifth former
Lebanese security official, Ghassan Tufeili, was
arrested in November after he was named in the
report. On 1 5 December, a second U N I I IC report
requested that Syria detain several suspects. It also
stated that Syria had hindered the investigation and
that further i nvestigation was necessary. On 15
December the UN Security Council endorsed a six­
month extension of the investigation, but did not vote
on the Lebanese authorities' request to establish an
international court to try suspects in the case.

Other politica lly motivated killings
Rafiq a l-Hariri's assassination was followed by 1 3 other
bombings of civilian targets in which 12 people were
killed and at least 100 injured. Among those targeted
were critics of Syria's military presence in Lebanon.
a Samir Qasir, an academic, journalist and well­
known critic of human rights abuses by the Lebanese
and Syrian governments, was killed by a car bomb on
2 J une in Beirut.
a George Hawi, former leader of the Lebanese
Communist Party, was killed by a car bomb in Beirut on
21 J une.
a Gibran Tueni, a journalist and politician well
known for his criticism of Syrian interference in
Lebanon, was killed with two others in a car bomb
explosion in Beirut on 12 December.
In November, six Lebanese men were reported to
have been charged with mounting attacks at the
behest of a Syrian intelligence officer who had been
based in Beirut. They had not been brought to trial by
the end of 2005.
Earlier, tens of Syrian nationals working in Lebanon
were reported to have been killed and others injured in
attacks by Lebanese, apparently in reaction to Rafiq al­
Hariri's assassination; it was not clear whether there
was an investigation or any prosecutions.
'Disa ppea ra  s'
A new joint Syrian-Lebanese committee was
established in May to investigate the fate of more than
600 Lebanese who "disappeared" during and after the
1975-1990 Lebanese civil war, apparently while in the
custody of Syrian forces. The findings of two previous
Lebanese investigations were never fully disclosed and
no perpetrators were ever prosecuted. Concerns about
the new committee's independence and powers
suggested that it would be no more effective.
A mass grave inside the Lebanese Ministry of Defence
compound at al-Yarze, reportedly containing 20 bodies,
was discovered in November. Another mass grave,
reportedly containing 28 bodies, was exhumed in
December at 'Anjar, in the Beqa' Valley, near the former
Syrian military intelligence headquarters in Lebanon.
During and after the Lebanese civil war, mass human
rights abuses were committed with impunity. Abuses
including killings of civilians; abductions and
"disappearances" of Lebanese, Palestinian, and foreign

1 68

nationals; and arbitrary detentions were carried out by
various armed militias and Syrian and Israeli
government forces. In 1992 the Lebanese government
stated that a total of 17,415 people "disappeared" during
the 1975-1990 civil war, but no criminal investigations
or prosecutions had been initiated by the end of 2005.

Arrests a nd releases
Samir Gea'gea and Jirjis al-Khouri, respectively the
leader and a member of the Lebanese Forces, were
freed under an amnesty law approved by parliament in
July. Both were serving life sentences, imposed after
unfair trials, for their alleged involvement in politically
motivated killings. They had been held in solitary
confinement since 1994 at the Ministry of Defence
Detention Centre in Beirut.
The amnesty law also resulted in the release of at
least 25 men detained for several years following
violent clashes with Lebanese army troops in 2000 in
the northern Dhinniyeh area. They had been charged
with involvement in "terrorism" and other security
offences. At the time of their release they were on trial
before the Justice Council in proceedings that did not
meet international standards. Some said they had been
tortured and coerced into making false confessions.
Ten detainees from Majdel 'Anjar arrested in
September 2004 were also released in the amnesty.
Several of the men, who had not been charged or tried,
were reported to have been tortured.
The authorities arrested 15 people in September for
their al leged involvement with Hizb al-Tahrir (Islamic
Liberation Party). All were released. Three - Sherif al­
Halaq, Muhammad al-Tayesh and Bassam al-Mun la ­
were convicted of membership of a banned
organization and were awaiting sentencing at the end
of the year.
Conditions in prisons and detention centres
The authorities continued to refuse the International
Committee of the Red Cross (lCRC) unfettered access to
all prisons despite a presidential decree in 2002
authorizing such access for the ICRC. There was
particular concern about lack of ICRC access to centres
operated by the Ministry of Defence where detainees
have been tortured and ill-treated.
H u man rights defenders
Many human rights groups operated freely but some
human rights defenders were harassed or faced threats
to their lives.
a Muhamad Mugraby, a lawyer and human rights
defender, was detained for 10 hours in February. He was
later charged with "slander of the military establishment"
for criticizing Lebanon's military court system in a speech
to the Mashrek Committee of the European Parliament in
November 200], He was due to appear before the

According to the UN, some 400,000 Palestinian
refugees were reSident in Lebanon. They remained
subject to wide-ranging restrictions on access to

housing, work and nghts at work despite the M inister of
Labour's decision in june to allow Palestinian refugees
to work in some sectors that had previously been
barred to them by law. However, Palestinian refugees
continued to be excluded from the medical, legal and
other professions regulated by professional syndicates.

Discri mination and violence against women
Women continued to be d iscriminated against and
inadequately protected from violence in the fam i ly.
Discrim inatory practices were permitted under
personal status laws, nationality laws and laws
contained in the Penal Code relating to violence I n
t h e family.
I n july, the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination agaInst Women recommended that
Lebanon withdraw its reservations to Articles 9 and 16
of the UN Women's Convention concerning nationality
and marriage rights and address inequalities which
allow chi ldren to obtain Lebanese national ity only
through their father and permit only men to divorce
their spouse.
Women migrants employed as domestic workers
faced multiple discrimination on grounds of their
nationality, gender and economic and legal status.
Their contracts effectively restricted exercise of their
rights to freedom of movement and association by
forbidding them from changing employers. They also
faced exploitation and abuse by employers, including
excessive hours of work and non-payment of wages.
Hundreds were reported to have suffered physical and
sexual abuse at the hands of employers.
The UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons
drew attention to the plight of migrant domestic
workers during a visit to Lebanon in September, stating
that they were denied basic human rights and were
inadequately protected by law. The Minister of Labour
said new legislation to improve conditions for migrant
workers would be proposed by October 2005. However,
no progress appeared to have been made on this by the
end of the year.

Sporadic outbreaks of violence continued to threaten
prospects of peace, Former rebel fighters who should
have been disa rmed and demobilized protested
violently when they did not receive benefits. Slow
progress in reforming the police, judiciary a nd the
criminal justice system resulted in systematic
violations of due process a nd vigilante violence
against criminal suspects, Laws establishing a n
Independent National Commission on H u m a n Rights
a nd a Truth and Reconciliation Commission were
adopted. Over 200,000 internally displaced people
and refugees returned to their homes, although
disputes over land a nd property a ppropriated duri ng
the wa r raised ethnic tensions, UN sanctions on the
trade in dia monds and timber were renewed. Those
responsible for human rights a buses during the
armed conflict continued to enjoy impunity. The U N
Secu rity Council gave peacekeeping forces in Liberia
powers to a rrest former head of state Cha rles Taylor
and transfer him to the Special Court for Sierra Leone
if he should return from Nigeria, where he continued
to receive asylum. Liberia made a commitment to
a bolish the death penalty. A new law on rape, which
initially proposed i m position ofthe death penalty for
gang rape, was a mended to provide a maximum
penalty of life imprisonment.
Background
I mplementation of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement remained on track. The registration of 1 . 3
million voters was completed i n May. Some members of
the Mandingo community were denied registration or
faced discrimInation i n establishIng their Libenan
nationality dunng the registration process.
I n the lead-up to presidential and parliamentary
elections i n October, the peacekeeping forces of the U N
M ission i n Libena (UNM I L) were increased In strength.
EI Ien johnson-Sirleaf emerged as victor in the
presidential ballot, after a second round of voting in
November. There were some protests at poll i ng
irregularities by supporters of a rival candidate,
football star George Weah. I nternational observers
considered the elections to have been free and fair.
The I nternational Contact Group on Libena, a
grouping of donor governments, proposed measures to
address corruption. In September the transitional
government signed up to a Governance and Economic
Management Assistance Programme, which ensures
that the revenue generated from the resources of
Liberia are used to impove the living standards of

1 69

LI B

Liberians. The programme required checks and
balances on government spending and a transparent
and functioning state bureaucracy.
The UNMIL human rights and protection section
focused on failures to observe due process by the
police, judiciary and prisons; provided support to the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission; and made
progress in drafting a National Human Rights Action
Plan to fulfil Liberia's obligations under International
human rights treaties.
Among the 103 international treaties Liberia acceded
to In September was the Second Optional Protocol to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.
A new law in June provided for the establishment of a
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate
human rights violations from 1979 to 200). Five men and
four women were selected as commissioners in October.
The return continued of refugees and people
internal ly displaced by the war; the total number was
estimated to be at least 300,000. However, there were
complaints that the return programme was poorly
organized although the situation improved later in the
year. No arrangements were made for hundreds of
thousands of refugees, who were not able to return in
time for the elections, to vote. Liberian refugees in
Ghana were reported to have been assaulted by the
Ghanaian police in November and to have fled their
refugee camp.

Incomplete demobilization
Incomplete demobilization and reintegration of former
combatants resulted in several violent incidents.
a Former combatants rioted several times over
failures to prOVide reintegration benefits or
resettlement al lowances - in january in Bong County
and on three occasions in May in N imba County.
The fragile peace process in Cote d'lvoire affected
UNMIL efforts to stabilize Liberia. Liberian children and
adults in border areas continued to be recruited by
armed groups, including for continuing conflict in Cote
d'lvoire. I llegal exploitation of natural resources also
continued. Former combatants occupied rubber
plantations and tapped rubber, claiming it was their only
means of survival. They were reportedly responsible for
killings and torture, including rape, against the civilian
inhabitants. UNMIL subsequently took action to remove
former combatants from the plantations.
By September close to 26,000 former combatants
had still not entered reintegration programmes. I n
September the UN Secretary-General announced a
US$18.5 million shortfall in international funding for
reintegration and rehabilitation. This was partially met
by funding made available later in the year.
Funding shortfalls contributed to delays in
restructuring the armed forces. Troops demonstrated
violently in June in response to late payment of their
salaries. The demobilization of both regular and
irregular armed forces was scheduled for completion
by the end of 2005, so that the vetting, recruiting and
training of a new 2,ooo-strong army by DynCorp, a
consultancy firm based in the USA. could begin.

1 70

Ethnic tensions
A commission of inquiry into four days of violence in
and around Monrovia in October 2004, in which some
20 people died and 200 were injured, reported its
findings in June. It concluded that ethnic tensions and
discrimination against the Mandingo population were
the primary cause of the violence. No action was taken
to implement the commission's recommendations for
further investigation and to bring those responsible to
justice.
Ethnic tensions and disputes over land and property
seized during the war remained a cause of concern for
Internally displaced people and refugees returning
home. In Lofa and Nimba Counties, the Mandingo
population said they had been driven from their homes
during the war and their property taken over by
members of the Lorma community.
Delayed reforms
The slow pace of reform of the criminal justice system
resulted in continued failures of the police and the
courts to respond effectively to crime. Communities
took justice into their own hands, and criminal suspects
were sometimes assaulted or killed where there were
suspicions of ineffective policing or of injustice or
corruption in the courts.
Police involvement was minimal in traditional
matters such as ritual killings, trials by ordeal or
Witchcraft, or vigilante action against people suspected
of being witches. Most such cases occurred in Grand
Bassa, Grand Gedeh and River Cess Counties. Ritual
killings - killings committed in the context of religious
beliefs, often in pursuit of political gain - sometimes
provoked popular protests. In Bong County in july, a
crowd destroyed the property of a person suspected of
performing ritual kil lings and shots were fired. The
unrest was brought under control by UNMIL forces.
Ritual killings reportedly increased in the period before
the elections.
During a visit to Liberia in july, the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights said that
strengthening the justice sector should be the highest
priority, a recommendation subsequently endorsed by
the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human
rights in Liberia.

Police
By the end of 2005, 1,800 police officers should have
been trained and deployed. Full deployment was not
achieved, especially in remote areas, because of
shortfalls in funding and lack of equipment. Training
was provided by the UN Civilian Police (CIVPOL). A
special police unit was set up to deal with violence
against women and children.

Judicia ry
judicial offiCials systematically failed to uphold the rule
of law. Ignorance of the law, poor court management,
bribery and lack of accountabi lity remained major
concerns. In January a Circuit Court judge in Grand
Gedeh County unfairly tried three men for murder and
sentenced them to death. The UNM I L human rights
section intervened and the case was subsequently
dismissed for lack of evidence. In September judges and
Amnesty International Report 2006

LI B

magistrates were deployed to courts around the
country. However, a shortage of judges remained,
linked closely to their poor conditions of service.

Prisons
Conditions in the majority of prisons and detention
centres remained well below minimum standards.
Delays in processing the cases of remand prisoners
through the courts resulted in overcrowding. A UN
corrections team, the I nternational Committee of the
Red Cross, the World Food Programme and other
partners provided prisoners with meals, blankets and
mattresses. By mid-2oo5, 28 corrections officers had
gone through a vetting and training process, and were
deployed throughout the country.

Juvenile justice
Standards set by the juvenile justice Procedure Code
were not observed. The police had a poor record of
investigating reports of sexual crimes against children,
and irregularities were reported in the handling of
cases in which children and juveniles were brought
before the courts.

Violence against women
A law on rape, sponsored by women's groups, was
debated in parliament in November and passed. The
law broadened the definition of rape and denied bail to
anyone charged with raping a minor. The law also
increased sentences for the most serious offences,
allowing life imprisonment to be imposed for the rape
of a minor and for gang rape.
U N M I L worked with civil society groups and the UN
Development Programme on a one-year campaign to
end violence against women, to start in early 2006.
Independent National Commission on
Human Rights
In March a law to establish an Independent National
Commission on Human Rights, provided for in the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, was passed by the
National Assembly. I ts members had been appointed by
the head of state before the law was passed. The
independent and effective functioning of the
Commission was hampered by conflicts of interest and
a lack of understanding of the Commission's mandate.
Civil society groups continued to call for the
reappointment of the commissioners in a transparent
process.
Impunity
No progress was made in creating an adequate
mechanism for prosecution before the domestic courts
of war crimes and crimes against humanity. People
suspected of such crimes were among those elected to
the National Assembly in October.
UN sanctions
Sanctions on the trade in diamonds and timber were
renewed by the UN Security Council in june to reinforce
measures against government corruption. Several
indiViduals who were subject to the travel ban and
freezing of assets by the UN won seats in the
parliamentary elections. They included jewel Howard,
Charles Taylor's wife, who was elected to the Senate i n
Amnesty International Report 2006

Bong County, and Edwin Snowe, a close associate of
Charles Taylor, who was elected to the House of
Representatives. The UN Sanctions Committee banned
the foreign travel of five men formerly associated with
warring factions for destabilizing the peace process.

Cha rles Taylor
In july, Liberia demanded that Nigeria provide a copy of
the agreement under which Charles Taylor had been
al lowed to leave Liberia and seek asylum in Nigeria in
August 2003. On 28 july, the leadership of the Mano
River Union countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone) stated that some of Charles Taylor's activities in
Nigeria breached the terms of his asylum.
In November the UN Security Council authorized
U N M I L to apprehend Charles Taylor and transfer him to
the jurisdiction of the Special Court for Sierra Leone i f

Background
Libya's relations with the USA and other Western
countries continued to improve. In October Libya and
the UK agreed a Memorandum of Understanding,
according to which Libya gave diplomatic assurances
that it would not torture Libyan nationals suspected of
terrorism by the UK if they were returned to Libya. I n
September the USA waived some defence export
restrictions on Libya to allow US companies to
participate in destroying Tripoli's chemical weapons'
stockpile and to refurbish eight transport planes.
Human rights reforms
The government continued the process of reform. The
People's Court, before which many political suspects
had received grossly unfair trials, was formally
abolIshed in January. The authorities said that suspects
would be tried before the ordinary criminal courts in
future. However, an ad hoc court was reportedly
establIshed in September to retry the case of 85 MB
members whose sentences had been overturned by the
Supreme Court. In August, Saif ai-Islam al-Gaddafi,
head of the AI-Gaddafi I nternational Foundation for
CharItable Associations (GI FCA) and son of Libya's head
of state, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Gaddafi, told AI-Jazeera
TV that Libya wished to establish an independent
judiciary after dispensing with revolutionary and
people's tribunals and that new legislation was being
prepared to create "a free environment that is suitable
for a normal political life in Libya".
In April, the authorities announced that a
committee had been established to investigate an
incident at Tripoli's Abu Selim Prison in June 1996
when a n undisclosed number of prisoners were kil led
or "disappeared'. Estimated figures for those kil led
ranged from tens to hundreds. AI cal led for the
commIttee to have ful l powers to investigate and to
recommend prosecutions of perpetrators and
compensation for victims or their fam i l ies, and for its
findings to be made public.
I n November the authOrIties, responding to the entry
on Libya in Amnesty International Report 2005, stated
that both Libyan law and the ConstItutional Declaration
contained human rights safeguards. They also denied
that the country held prisoners of conscience and said
that the existence of 57 "associations actively involved
in different walks of life' indicated that the rights to
freedom of opinion and expression were respected.
Political prisoners
Five prisoners of conscience held since 1998 were
released in September, a few weeks after Saif ai-Islam al­
Gaddafi told AI-JazeeraTV that 131 political prisoners
could soon be released. Ramadan Shaglouf, Tariq al­
Dernawi, Tawfiq al-Jehani, Ali Be'aou and Musa al-Ziwi
were all serving long prison terms for their alleged
membership of the banned Islamic Alliance Movement.
They reportedly pledged that they would not again
become involved in politiCS as a condition of their release.
Despite these releases, scores of other political
prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, continued
to be held.

1 72

a Fathi el-Jahmi remained in detention following his
arrest in March 2004. A prisoner of conscience, he was
detained after he criticized Libya's head of state and
called for political reform in international media
interviews. He was held by the Internal Security Agency
(JSA), reportedly at a special detention facility on the
outskirts of Tripoli.
a Abdurrazig al-Mansouri, a writer and journalist,
was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in October
for possessing an unlicensed pistol. The gun was
apparently found the day after he was arrested in
January at his home in Tobruk. The real reason for his
imprisonment was believed to be critical articles about
politiCS and human rights in Libya that he had published
on a website shortly before his arrest.
Among others who continued to be imprisoned were
the 85 members of the M B, whose retrial before an ad
hoc court was ongoing at the end of the year. The
sentences imposed on them in 2002, which included
two death sentences and long prison terms, were
overturned by the Supreme Court in September. Dozens
of members of other political groups, including the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, were still serving prison
sentences imposed after unfair trials in previous years.
Several new arrests were reported, including of long­
term government critics who returned to Libya after
apparently receiving official assurances that they
would not be arrested.
a Mahmoud Mohamed Boushima was detained in
Tripoli two weeks after he returned to Libya in July from
the UK, where he had been reSident since 1981. The
authorities denied him access to his family and did not
disclose the reasons or legal basis for his detention or
where he was being held, raising concern about his
safety and treatment. He was stil l held by the ISA at the
end of 2005.
a Kamel el-Kailani was detained by the ISA when he
flew to Tripoli from the UK in July. A dual UK-Libyan
national, he had reportedly been assured by Libyan
diplomats in London and by G I FCA that he would not be
arrested if he returned to Libya. He was stil l held at the
end of the year and the authorities had not disclosed
the reason or legal grounds for his detention.

Freedom of expression and association
restricted
The authorities maintained strict controls on freedom
of expression and there were no independent domestic
human rights organizations. The state-owned media
was closely controlled and legislation continued to
prohibit the formation of independent newspapers
outSide the existing political system. Journalists and
writers who criticized the authorities were arrested or
otherwise harassed.
a On 2 June, Dhai f al-Gazzal's mutilated body was
found near Benghazi 12 days after he was reported to
have been detained by two men who identified
themselves as ISA offiCials. He had been shot in the
head. In March, he had left his job as a journalist on
al-lahf al-akhdar(The Green March), the official
newspaper of the Revolutionary Committees,
apparently because of his concern about corruption,
Amnesty International Report 2006

LIT

but had continued to denounce corruption and cal l for
political reform, including on the I nternet. In July, the
authorities said that an official investigation into the
murder was in progress.

Death penalty
The death penalty continued to be used despite Colonel
al-Gaddafi's stated oppOSitIOn, but it was not clear how
many death sentences were passed or /:,xecutions
carried out. At least six foreigners, two Turkish and four
Egyptian nationals, were executed in July.
The death sentences imposed in May 2004 against
five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor were
overturned in December by the Supreme Court, which
ordered a retrial in a lower court. The six had been
sentenced after being convicted by the People's Court
of deliberately infecting 426 children with H IV while
working at a hospital in Benghazi. They alleged that
they were tortured in pre-trial detention. A case was
brought against eight police officers, a military doctor
and a translator, who were accused of being
responsible for the a lleged torture. All 10 were
acqUitted in June. The SIX medical workers remained In
detention awaiting trial at the end of the year. The
Bulgarian government and many others, Including AI.
had criticized deficiencies In the trial of the six.
Past 'disappeara  s'
No progress was made in establishing the fate or
whereabouts of prisoners who "disappeared" in
previOUS years although it was hoped that the Abu Selim
Investigation would result in clarification of some
cases. One case, that of Iranian-born Shi'a religiOUS
leader I mam Musa al-Sadr, who reportedly
"disappeared" while Visiting Libya in 1978, was the
subject of legal action In Lebanon, where he had been
reSident. A Lebanese examining magistrate called for
Colonel al-Gaddafi and other Libyan offiCials to appear
before his court in March, but they declined to do so.
Migrants a nd asylu m-seekers
Libya continued to treat asylum-seekers inhumanely
and deny them minimum protection. In August around
300 Eritreans were detained in the south-east of the
country, near the border with Sudan, without being
given access to lawyers or representatives of the UN
H igh Commissioner for Refugees.
In November the UN Committee on Economic, SOCial
and Cultural Rights expressed concern that Libya did
not have a law on asylum-seekers and refugees and that
the effective guarantee of their rights was "seriously
undermined".

Domestic violence
Lithuanian law did not speCifically define domestic
violence as a crime, although changes in the Criminal
Process Law which came into force late in 2004 allowed
the authOrities to remove a domestic offender from the
household and to keep the offender separate from the
victim or other family members.
During the year, the National Programme of
Prevention of Violence against Children and of Support
for Children for 2005-2007 was established. The
Programme aimed to reduce violence against children,
raise public awareness of the problem and increase
children's ability to recognize different forms of abuse
and so better protect themselves.
Trafficking of women a nd girls
According to a survey issued by the I n ternational
Organization for M igration (lOM), the number of
people being trafficked to work i n the sex trade
increased following Lithuania's entry into the
European Union (EU) i n 2004. About 2, 000 women and
girls were taken abroad i llegally. Nearly a quarter
ended up in the UK where about 1 5 lithuanian women
a month aged between 18 and 25 were sold, according
to Interpol.
The 10M survey also highlighted a marked i ncrease in
internal trafficking and a rise in the trafficking of
minors. Organizations working With trafficked women
and girls who had returned to Lithuania were believed
to be reaching only 10 per cent of those affected.
Trafficking-related convictions and sentences
increased in 2005, but the overal l effort to Investigate
and prosecute al legations of trafficking still remained
inadequate. Recent amendments to the Penal Code
raised the maximum punishment for trafficking in
human beings to 12 years' i mprisonment If victims
were adults and to 15 years if the Victims were
children.
On 24 May, the Lithuanian government adopted a
new Programme on Control and Prevention of

Investigations were opened into allegations that the
Macedonian authorities unlawfully transferred a
German national into US custody in Afghanista n.
Two people were i mprisoned after a "terrorism" trial
conducted in camera. The International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Tribunal) indicted
two former officials for wa r crimes committed in
2001 a nd decided to return fou r cases involving
former leaders of the Alba nian National Army (ANA)
to the Macedonian authorities for trial. Three former
officials were acquitted by domestic cou rts in
connection with the extrajudicial execution of seven
migra nts in 2002. Violence aga inst women remained
widespread but prosecutions were rare.
Background
Although the Albanian minority were increasingly
represented in the police force and municipal
authorities, reforms to tackle discrimination against
minority communitIes, agreed under the Ohrid
Agreement fol lowing the 2001 conflict, proceeded slowly.
Elections in March in Bo municipalities created in
August 2004 failed to guarantee universal and equal
suffrage or ensure the secrecy of the ballot. The
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
urged investigations of those suspected of electoral
offences. Many ethniC Albanian women were
reportedly denied the right to vote.

1 74

On 9 November Macedonia's 2004 application to join
the European Union (EU) was received positively,
although no date was set for talks at the London summit
on 15 December.
Unemployment and poverty levels remained high.
According to offiCial figures, about IB per cent of the
population was unemployed. The World Bank reported
in November that some 22 per cent of the population
lived in "absolute poverty".
In January a National Strategy for Roma was
launched. However, Romani women were denied
education, employment and health care rights because
they were not Macedonian citizens, according to
reports in July to the UN Committee on the Elimination
of Discrimination against Women.
The EU police force tasked with advising the
Macedonian police left the country on 15 December.

I ndictments for war crimes
On 14 March indictments were made public by the
Tribunal against former Minister of Internal Affairs Ljube
Boshkovski and Jovan Tarchulovski, a police officer, who
were transferred to the Tribunal's custody on 24 March
and 16 March respectively. Ljube Boshkovski was charged
with criminal responsibility for murder, destruction of
houses and cruel treatment in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian village of Ljuboten in August 2001.
In April the Tribunal's Chief Prosecutor informed the
Macedonian authorities that the remaining four cases, in
which the Tribunal had gained primacy over national
courts in a ruling on 4 October 2002, would be returned
to Macedonia for trial. On 20 June the Macedonian PubliC
Prosecutor was reported to be still awaiting a date from
the Tribunal for a joint review of war crimes cases under
the Tribunal's jurisdiction involving suspects who may
not have benefited from a 2002 amnesty. A March 2002
law amnestied those whose offences in the 2001 conflict
came under national jurisdiction. No review had taken
place by the end of 2005.
Political trials
The presence in a Skopje suburb of an armed group of
ethniC Albanians, including former ANA leader Agim
Krasniqi, continued despite negotiations in late 2004.
On 5 J une, four police officers were handcuffed, beaten
and detained for two hours after they went to arrest
Agim Krasniqi, indicted on seven criminal charges. He
voluntarily surrendered to the court in August, and
proceedings opened in October.
a In April, Rajmonda Malecka, a journalist from
Albania, was arrested after she visited Kondovo to
interview Agim Krasniqi. Her father, Bujar Malecka,
was also arrested. Video tapes allegedly showing the
ANA conducting exercises were found in their
possession. On 1 3 May they were convicted of
"preparation for terrorism" in a trial conducted in
camera at Skopje District Court, and each sentenced to
five years' imprisonment. On 23 September the Court of
Appeal annul led the conviction on the grounds that
the verdict was "unclear and incomprehensible" and
that no link had been established between the
activities of the defendants and the charge on which
Amnesty International Report 2006

MAC

they had been indicted. It returned the case for retrial
to the Skopje court, which on 8 November confirmed
the original verdict. There were concerns that the
prosecution was politically motivated and the trial
unfair.

The 'disappeared' and a bducted
There was little progress In discovering the fate of 20
missing people - 13 ethnic Macedonians, six ethnic
Albanians and one Bulgarian citizen - who
"disappeared" or were abducted during the
2001 conflict.
Cl Despite the appearance of former ANA
commander Daut Rexhepi " Leka" at a public election
meeting in Tetovo in February, he was not arrested
until September. An arrest warrant had been issued in
September 2004 in connection with the abducted
ethnic Macedonians. His trial began in October.
No indictments in connection with the "disappeared"
ethnic Albanians had been issued by the end of 2005.
Extrajudicial executions in Rashtanski Lozja
On 22 April, Skopje District Court acquitted three
former police commanders and a businessman charged
with killing one I ndian and six Pakistani nationals in
March 2002 in Rashtanski LozJa. The judge found
insufficient evidence that the seven migrants were
unlawfully kil led on the pretext that they were
international terrorists. Former Minister Ljube
Boshkovski, also indicted, remained in the Tribunal's
custody (see above).
The authorities had acknowledged in 2004 that the
seven had been extrajudicially executed, despite
earlier claims that they were Islamic militants
connected to ethnic Albanian insurgents and had fired
on the authorities.
Key witnesses, including two special police officers
among the original suspects arrested, withdrew in
court statements made during the initial pre-trial
investigation. Both the Macedonian Public Prosecutor
and the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan indicated they
would appeal against the acquittal.
'War on terror'
In November, state prosecutors in Germany opened
investigations into allegations that Lebanese-born
Khaled el-Masri, a German national, had been
unlawfully transferred into US custody in Afghanistan.
He was reportedly detained by Macedonian police
officers on 31 December 2003, repeatedly questioned
about IslamiC organizations, handed over on 24 January
2004 to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and ­
outSide any judicial process - flown to an airbase in
Afghanistan for further interrogation. He was sent to
Albania in May 2004. In December 2005 the US
authorities said he was one of five people detained on
the basis of mistaken Identl ty.

August 2004 he had been sentenced to 18 months'
Imprisonment for allegedly inciting religious and ethnic
hatred through his support for ecclesiastical control of
the Macedonian Orthodox Church by the Serbian
Orthodox Church. He was arrested on 26 July to serve
his sentence as a prisoner of conscience.

Violence agai nst women
In proceedings against a previously convicted trafficker
in March, mechanisms to protect witnesses were
ineffective. A witness protection law was Introduced I n
May. O n I November, a national referral mechanism
was launched that would provide assistance and
protection to those affected by trafficking.
Domestic violence against women remained
widespread but prosecutions were rare.
Cl Of lOO incidents reported to the Tetovo police by
August, criminal proceedings were brought in 10 cases,
only one of which resulted in a conviction.
Refugees and internally displaced people
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), 831 registered internally displaced people
remained after the 2001 conflict in Macedonia. Some
160 registered people who were unable to return to
their homes reportedly had their status withdrawn.
According to UN HCR, there were some 2, I 1 4 refugees
from Kosovo, predominantly Roma, Ashkali or
Egyptiani, 1 ,234 of whom were under "temporary
protection". Few were granted asylum, and some were
reportedly threatened with return to Kosovo. In May
the government opened discussions With the Kosovo
authorities on protocols for their voluntary return.

Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: sig ned
The food crisis intensified during 2005. Prison
conditions remained a significant concern. There
were instances where freedom of expression was
threatened. The government began investigations
into child prostitution.
Background
Following a split within the ruling United Democratic
Front (UDF), the PreSident left the UDF to form the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Opposition parties
were drawn into this conflict, distracting government
and legislators from national priOrities such as the
hunger crisis. This culminated in October in moves to
impeach the PreSident. The impeachment did not
proceed. This political insecurity appeared to fuel a
disturbmg tendency to crack down on critics of the
government.
Policing
Torture and i l l-treatment of suspects in police custody
were reported.
D On 6 June, 12-year-old Mabvuto Bakali, who was
detained on suspicion of theft, died in police custody
following severe beatings at Ngabu Police post. When
villagers confronted police, live ammunition was used
to disperse the crowd, killing 16-year-old Anock Sande.
A police investigation into the deaths had not been
completed by the end of the year.
Police arrested individuals critical of those in the
President's immediate Circle.
D In October, members of parliament instrumental i n
the impeachment process were arrested on charges o f
falsifymg documents i n what the President described as
"tit for tat" arrests.
Prisons
Conditions in prisons remained a serious concern.
According to offiCial figures, on average more than 14
people died every month in an average prison
population of 9,700 people.
The I n ternational Committee of the Red Cross
((CRC) considers that more than 15 deaths per month
i n a prison population of 10,000 i n sub-Saharan Africa
requires urgent remedial measures. Many of the
deaths were H IV-related, but many were treatable
and aVOidable. Overcrowding, poor d iet and poor
sani tary faci li ties in prisons exacerbated AI DS­
related condi tions and other i l lnesses. The prison
authorities continued to work within severe resource
constraints.

1 76

Freedom of expression
In March, twojournalists were arrested i n Blantyre in
connection with an article about the President's fear of
ghosts in The Nation newspaper and broadcast on BBC
World Service. They were transferred to the capital and
detained for two nights before being released without
charge by the I nspector General of Police.
Women's rights
Child prostitution remained widespread. Girls,
including many under the age of 1 3 which is the legal age
of consent, were "bought" from their parents for as
l ittle as US$3 on the promise of working as waitresses
and then in effect indentured in brothels. The Ministry
of Gender and Children's Affairs initiated
investigations.
Food
Malawi faced severe food shortages after an extremely
poor harvest. Despite repeated warnings by the World
Food Programme of an imminent food crisis, by the end
of the year food aid pledges for MalaWi still fell far short
of need. Concern was expressed by civil society and
faith-based groups that the continuing political feud
between the UDF and PreSident wa Mutharika's DPP
diverted attention and national resources from the
food criSiS.

Police reform
In May the independent Royal Commission of Inquiry
examining the conduct and management of the police
released its report. Acknowledging reports of
corruption and human rights violations by police, the
Commission called for legislative, procedural and
disciplinary reform. Recommendations included the
establishment of an independent police complaints
commission with investigatory powers, stronger
custodial safeguards and increased resources and
training.
The government agreed in principle to implement all
125 recommendations, but the full scope and timing of
the implementation process remained unclear at the
end of 2005.
a In November, three women of Chinese nationality
complained of being physically assaulted and stripped
while in police detention.
a In December, an inquiry was established after
circulation of a video clip showing a naked Malay
woman detainee being required by police to perform
squats while holding her ears.
Detention without trial under the ISA a nd
Emergency Ordinance
The ISA continued to al low for detention without trial
for up to two years, renewable indefinitely, of anyone
conSidered by the authorities to be a potential threat to
national security or public order.
ISA detainees were at risk of physical intimidation,
humiliation and intense psychological pressure, at
times amounting to torture, while held incommunicado
during an initial police investigation period of up to 60
days. Complaints of abuse by ISA detainees were not
effectively investigated.
a In a rare case, the High Court heard a Civil suit
lodged by Abdul Malek Hussin against police for
allegedly torturing him in ISA detention in 1998.
At least 71 al leged Islamist activists reportedly
remained in detention under the ISA at the end of 2005.
They included 65 detainees accused of aSSOCiation with
al-Qa'ida and Jemaah Islamiyah ( 1), as wel l as three
alleged members of the Malaysia Mujahidin Group
(Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia, KMM). At least 38 men
were also in ISA detention for alleged passport forgery
or other offences.
In March, the National Human Rights Commission
(Suhakam) urged the government to review the cases of
all lSA detainees, calling for them to be tried or
released.
a In March, five students detained in 2003 following
their arrest in Pakistan on suspicion of l inks to al-Qa'ida
and J I were released. They remained subjected to
restriction orders curtailing their freedom of
movement.
a In October, three alleged KMM supporters were
released. Two remained under restriction orders. The
three were among six detainees arrested in 2001 who
had detention orders extended in September.
In September opposition parties and civil society
groups called for the abolition of the Emergency
(Public Order and Prevention of Crime Ordinance)
Amnesty International Report 2006

Ordinance, which a l lows for detention Without trial
of those believed by police to be "hardened"
criminals.
At least 700 suspected criminals, including 105
minors aged between 14 and 21, were reportedly
detained under two-year renewable detention orders
at the Sempang Renggam detention centre. They were
held under the Emergency Ordinance or the Dangerous
Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act, which a lso
allows for detention Without trial.

Restrictive laws
Restrictive laws continued to be used to impose
unjustified curbs on the rights to freedom of
expression, association and assembly of opposition
figures, journalists, students and other members of civil
society.
a In April, a magistrate's court acquitted seven
students charged in 2001 with I l legal assembly under
the Police Act for staging a peaceful protest against
the ISA. The prosecution lodged an appeal . Under the
Universities and UniverSity Colleges Act (UCCA)
the students had been suspended from university
since 2001 .
a In October, at least 10 students were charged under
UCCA disciplinary rules for taking part in peaceful
protests against disputed campus elections. I n
November, riot police were called t o disperse a protest
outSide Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) against the
disciplinary actions.
Migrant workers, refugees a nd asylu m-seekers
In March the authOrities launched mass arrest and
deportation operations against people suspected of
being undocumented migrant workers. There were
periodiC reports of abuses and the authorities failed to
provide adequate medical care, food and clean water In
some detention centres and police cells. In May the
operations were scaled back.
Hundreds of migrant workers prosecuted under the
Immigration Act were imprisoned and caned. Failure to
ensure fair trial standards led to repeated miscarriages
of justice.
a In March, Mangal Bahadur Gurung, a Nepa l i
migrant worker, was conVicted, Imprisoned and
whipped under the ImmigratiOn Act. In July the courts,
given evidence of a valid work permit, set aside hiS
conviction and ordered hiS immediate release.
The authorities fai l   to distingUish consistently
between people seeking asylum (mostly from
Myanmar and Indonesia) and undocumented migrant
workers. Asylum-seekers and refugees were
therefore at risk of arrest, detention and forCible
return.
In July the authorities announced that recognized
refugees would be permitted to work, but
implementation of this policy remained slow.
a I n June, 68 Burmese refugees and asylum-seekers
were arrested after holding a peaceful pro-democracy
protest outSide the Myanmar embassy. Most were
charged with i l legal assembly and immigration
offences.

Freedom of religion: growing intolerance
While Islam is the official religion of multi-ethnic
Malaysia, the religious freedom of non-Malay ethnic
groups is constitutionally protected. Sharia (Islamic
law), which applies to ethnic Malays who by definition
must be Muslim, imposes criminal sanctions on those
who seek to follow other faiths (apostasy), and on those
found to hold heretical beliefs that "deviate" from Sunni
Islam. I n June the authorities labelled 22 religious sects
as "deviant".
In J uly a mob of unidentified men set fire to the
commune of the Sky Kingdom religious sect in
Terrenganu state, which calls for a peaceful synthesis of
all faiths. Following the attack, 58 sect members,
including women and children, were detained. Forty­
five people were subsequently charged with offences
under Sharia law, including practising "deviant" Islamic
beliefs. There were no prosecutions of those
responsible for the attack.
a I n July Kamariah Ali and Daud Mamat, both Malay
members of the Sky Kingdom religious sect arrested
after the attack on their commune, filed a petition to
test constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion.
Charged wi th apostasy under Sharia law, they were
released on bail before their petition was heard.
Death penalty and corporal punish ment
Death sentences were imposed, mostly for drug
trafficking offences. No executions were reported.
Caning, a cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment,
was carried out throughout 2005 as an additional
punishment to imprisonment. Hundreds of people
found gUIlty of breaches of the I mmigration Act were
among those caned.

Promises of wider political freedoms were
undermined by the mass a rrest of people attending
political gatherings and the continued imprisonment
of prisoners of conscience after unfair and politically
motivated trials. Flaws in the judicial system
persisted. Dozens of deta inees were subjected to
torture or il l·treatment, and complaints of violations
by secu rity personnel remained without prompt,
thorough or independent investigation.
Background
In June, parliament removed legal barriers to the
functioning of political parties for the first time in the
27-year presidency of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
In July, parliament passed a bill to establish a Human
Rights CommiSSion. Facing mounting concerns that the
Commission had been given insufficient powers,
President Gayoom indicated that it would be revised.
In September, Maldives signed the Optional Protocol
to the UN Convention against Torture.
International scrutiny of the human rights situation
continued. The International Committee of the Red
Cross visited detention centres in April and August. A
delegation of British lawyers, visiting Male in
September, found that defendants were denied
fundamental rights of defence, and that "the judiciary
and legal system lackledl the basic capacity,
competency and necessary independence to deliver a
fair trial".
Prisoners of conscience
August and succeeding months saw a wave of arrests of
opposition activists and human rights defenders.
a More than lOO political activists, including Ahmed
Abbas, Latheefa Umar, Ahmed Mohamed Fomy, Ali
Riyaz and Aminath Shareef, were arbitrarily and
unlawfully detained in August after they attended a
political gathering. They were held without charge or
trial for periods of up to several weeks, were denied
regular access to lawyers and families, and had no
recourse to the courts to challenge the legality of their
detention.
a Jennifer Latheef, a film maker and human rights
defender, was sentenced on 18 October to 10 years'
imprisonment on charges of terrorism, and was
removed to Maafushi prison. A former prisoner of
conSCience, she had been arrested in September 2003
after she was among thousands of mostly peaceful
protesters who demonstrated In the streets of Male at

the cover-up of a prIsoner's death. She was released In
December 2003 to await trial. Her trial was marked by
irregularities including an arbitrary dismissal of
defence witnesses. Although some acts of violence
occurred during the protest, the government provided
no substantive evidence to prove her involvement. Re­
detained in August 2004, she was reportedly assaulted
and sexually molested in custody, then held under
house arrest until late 2004. Her and other detainees'
complaints to the authorities of torture and ill­
treatment by security personnel remained without
Investigation.
a Naushad Waheed and Ahmed Ibrahlm Didi
remained under house arrest, serving long sentences
Imposed in 2002 after unfair political trials. Two of the
prisoners convicted with them, Fathimath N isreen and
Mohamed Zaki, were released in May and August
respectively.

Political trials
The government in 2004 acknowledged flaws in the
Judicial system and promised reform, but unfair
political trials continued in 2005.
a Prominent politician Mohamed Nasheed was
arrested during a peaceful protest In mid-August.
Charged with terrOrIsm and sedition, he was remanded
in custody until I November when he was transferred to
house arrest. Under international pressure, the
government allowed an international legal observer at
his trial , which started on 28 August.
a In October, four people were sentenced to
between 10 and II years' Imprisonment on charges of
Involvement in violence during the mass protests I n
September 200l Their trials appeared t o have fallen
short of internationally accepted fair trial standards.
Torture and il l-treatment
There were consistent reports that dozens of detainees
were beaten and otherwise ill-treated at the time of
their arrest. These reports were not investigated.
Imran Zahir, a photojournalist and human rights
defender, was arrested on 4 September while taking
photographs of police dismantling loudspeakers at a
public gathering of the opposition Maldivian
Democratic Party. Officers pushed him into a police van
and beat him severely. He was accused of assault,
reportedly on the basis of a complaint made after his
arrest, but was released without charge in early
October.

Asylum-seekers continued to be detained in
contravention of international law a nd su bjected to
procedures which fell short of international
sta ndards. Harsh conditions, ill-treatment and
brutality by law enforcement officials were reported
from detention centres holding asylu m-seekers.
Asylum and immigration
The policy of mandatory detention for up to 18 months
of irregu lar migrants continued throughout 2005.
Although the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) has stated that no country should justify
using detention as a form of deterrence against
irregu lar migration, the Maltese government
confirmed its commitment to continue this practice in
a policy paper issued in January.
The government explored options for returning
irregular migrants to Libya; the Libyan authorIties
claimed to have stopped 40,000 people migrating from
their territory in 2005. During the year several dozen
people drowned while trying to reach Malta by sea;
untold numbers more were feared to have also been
lost at sea.
On 1 3 january, individuals housed In the Hal-San
Detention Centre held a demonstration to protest at the
conditions at the centre, the length of their detention
and the lack of information about the progress of their
applications for refugee status and humanitarian
protection. Eyewitnesses reported that soldiers attacked
the peaceful protesters in a violent assault. Twenty-six
people were taken to hospital, several with serIOUS
Injuries. On 12 December, the Maltese Board of InqUiry
published the results of its investigation into the events
at the Hal-Safi Detention Centre. The inqUiry found that
members of the armed forces applied excessive force ­
"exaggerated and out of proportion In the
circumstances· - in their attempts to force the protesters
back into the detention centre. There were reports that
members of the armed forces beat migrants after they
had been subdued and were lying on the ground.
In November, the government enacted an
amendment to Article 10 of the Refugees Act which
would al low Malta to deport asylum-seekers while their
appeal against the rejection of their application for
asylum was stil l pending.
Prohi bition on torture
On 25 August, the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture (CPT) published a report on Malta

Amnesty International Report 2006

1 79

MAU

following a VISit to the country in January 2004. The
delegation was particularly concerned about certain
physical conditions in detention facilities, such as a
lack of appropriat e heating and clothing for people
detained at the centres. The temperature in the Hal-Safi
Detention Centre was reported to drop as low as 6°C
during winter nights.
The CPT delegation reported allegation s of
dehberate physical ill-treatme nt of foreign nationals,
Including kicks, punches and blows with batons. The
report noted that cases of self-mutila tion, suicide
attempts, hunger strikes, vandalism and violence were
relatively common and that none of the detention
facilities visited had its own health care staff. Medical
members of the CPT's delegation observed that the
situation had a detrimenta l impact on the physical and
psychological state of health of the detainees.

Women's rights
In late 2005, the government passed the Domestic
Violence Act (2005), which defines domestic violence as
"any act of violence, even if only verbal, perpetrated by
a household member upon another household
member". The act contains some important protective
measures, such as the inclusion of harassment, both
physical and verbal, as a crime and terms providing for
restraining orders physically restricting the
perpetrator from the areas where the victim lives and
works. However the bill excludes stalking as a crime.
Under the provisions of the new bill, charges may be
filed by anyone - not just the victim - but the victim
may ask the court to dismiss the proceedings, leaving
the door open for the abuser to put pressure on the
victim to drop the charges.
The act contains provisions for a court to issue
Treatment Orders requiring perpetrators of violence to
undergo treatment for their behaviour. Prior to thiS, it
was estimated that on average, less than 5 per cent of
men responSible for abuse sought help voluntarily to
correct their behaviour. The act also calls for the
establishment of a Commission on Domestic Violence
to give expert advice to the government about domestic
violence issues.

Dozens of people, including prisoners of conscience,
were detained during the yea r. Scores of people
arrested in connection with alleged plots to
overthrow the government in previous years were
sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment after a n
unfair trial. All were released under a general
amnesty announced in September following a coup
the previous month that toppled the President. There
were reports of tortu re, none of which appeared to
have been independently investigated. The practice
of slavery persisted.
Background
In August a bloodless military coup headed by Colonel Ely
Quid Mohamed Vall deposed PreSident Maaouyia Ould
Taya while he was in Saudi Arabia. President Taya had
been in office since 1984. The coup was welcomed by most
Mauritanians but was condemned by the international
community, including the UN and the African Union (AU).
A Military Council for Justice and Democracy led by the
new PreSident issued a charter for governing the country.
An interim government was formed charged with
organizing legislative and presidential elections within
two years. In September President Vall granted a general
amnesty for political prisoners.
Prisoners of conscience
Dozens of political prisoners, including prisoners of
conscience. were detained. Some were held for months
before being provisionally released. Others were
detained incommunicado at an unknown location in
the capital. Nouakchott. Several arrests appeared to be
part of a campaign of intimidation against religious
figures and the opposition.
a Jemil Ould Mansour and two other prisoners were
provisionally released from Nouakchott central prison
in February. They were prisoners of conscience,
detained solely for their religious beliefs and peaceful
political activities. They had been detained in
November 2004 and held incommunicado for 14 days at
an unknown place on charges of "complicity in
fabncation and forgery of documents that might cause
a disturbance of public order and prejudice internal
and external security". They were then transferred to
Nouakchott civil prison.
a Cheick Mohamed El Hacen Ould Dedew and 20
other people, who were arrested between Apri I and
Amnesty International Report 2006

MAU

July, were provisionally released in August after a court
dismissed the case against them. They were held
Incommunicado at an unknown location In Nouakchott.
The police stated that the 21 men were accused of
"planning acts of terrorism" and of being in contact with
a group allied to al-Oa'lda.
Another group of 21 political detainees, including
Abdallahi Quid Eminou and two Algerian nationals,
were still detained at the end of the year. The solicitor
general appealed against a court decision to release
them.

Unfair trial
I n February about 100 civilians and military officers,
including 50 tried in absentia, were convicted of
threatening the security of the state in connection with
a failed coup in June 2003 and alleged coup plots in
August and September 2004. They were sentenced to
various terms of imprisonment ranging from 18 months
to life. They were among 195 defendants whose trial
began in November 2004 before the criminal court in
Quad Naga. The rest were acquitted, including former
President Mohamed Khouna Quid Haidalla, leader of
the Rally of Democratic Forces, and Ahmed Quid
Daddah.
The trial fell short of international standards.
Defence lawyers did not have access to their clients'
files before trial and faced serious intimidation by the
President of the court. The prosecution case was based
mainly on statements obtained by torture, which were
admitted as evidence by the court without any scrutiny
of the torture allegations.
Torture a nd i ll-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment continued to be widespread
and systematic in police stations as well as during
arrests. Detainees were reportedly tied in
excruciating positions and subjected to the "jaguar"
technique, which involves suspending the victim from
a metal bar and beating the soles of the feet. Several
detainees tried in Quad Naga (see above) said they
had been tortured, i ncluding by the "jaguar"
technique.
a Mahfould Quid Hamed Quid Idoumou, who was
arrested in May, was reportedly kept in handcuffs and
leg irons for 25 days at a police training centre. Qther
detainees who were arrested between April and J une
were held naked and were beaten during
interrogation.

Recog nition of human rights organizations
Several Mauritanian non-governmental organizations
(NGQs), including SQS Esclaves and the Mauritanian
Human Rights Association, were offiCially recognized in
J une. Although recognized by international human
rights bodies, including the African Commission on
Human and Peoples' Rights, these and several other
NGQs had remained il legal for years under Mauritanian
law and had operated with great difficulty.
Slavery
Although slavery was offiCially abolished in 1981,
further evidence emerged about the persistence of this
practice. Those denouncing slavery remained at risk of
harassment.
a In March, Mohamed Lemine Quid Mahmoudi, a
freelance journalist, was arrested after investigating a
case of domestic slavery in Mederdra, south-west
Mauritania. He was arrested with two other people,
including the wife of an opposition senator, when he
was transcribing the story of Jabhallah M int Mohamed,
who had recently fled an estate in Abokak, 20km from
Mederdra, where she had been all her life. Mohamed
Lemine Quid Mahmoudi was accused of harming
national security and Mauritania's economic and
diplomatic interests by publishing "false information".
All three were released provisionally after a month.

Death penalty: a bol iti on i st for all crimes
International Criminal Court: ratified
UN Women's Convention and its Optional Protocol:
ratified

President Fox's government mainta ined that it was
committed to the implementation of international
human rig hts treaties a nd standards. Nevertheless,
domestically there was little advance in ending
human rights violations and impunity, particularly at
state level. A National Human Rights Progra mme
was initiated but appea red to have little impact.
Proposed reforms to the Constitution and criminal
justice system did not progress. Presidential a nd
congressional elections scheduled for 2006
increasingly dominated the political agenda, as did
concerns over public secu rity and violent crime. There
were continuing reports of arbitrary arrest, ill·
treatment and torture. The number of young women
murdered in Ciudad Juarez rose again a nd the
response to violence agai nst women remained
inadequate. The judicial system continued to be a
key source of human rights violations, fa iling to
protect the rights of victims of crime a nd suspects. Its
fa ilings had a disproportionate impact on the
poorest a nd most disadvantaged sectors of society. A
number of journalists were kil led or threatened.
Human rights defenders working in local
communities faced threats and attacks. Efforts to
hold those responsible for past human rights
violations accounta ble failed. Many members of the
most socially excluded communities, particula rly
indigenous peoples, continued to suffer
discrimination a nd limited access to economic, social
and cultural rights.
Background
Mexico ratified the Rome Statute of the International
Crimmal Court and resisted pressure to sign an
unlawful bilateral immunity agreement with the USA. It
also ratified the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture and submitted a number of
overdue reports to UN thematic mechanisms. The
government also played a positive role in promoting
UN reform to strengthen human rights protection.
In April the Attorney General of the Republic resigned
amid increasing political pressure in the wake of
Congress' decision to allow the prosecution of the Mayor
of Mexico City, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The
mdlctment of Andres Lopez Obrador, the presidential
candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution
(Partido de la Revolucion Democratica, PRO) would have
led to his disqualification from the presidential elections.
The prosecution, which was abandoned in May, had been
widely perceived as politically motivated.

According to reports, at least 440 undocumented
migrants died while trying to cross the border into the
USA. The USA proposed that a border wall be
constructed. This raised concerns that more migrants
would attempt to cross in the most dangerous desert
regions, resulting in increased fatalities.

Judicial reform
Congress amended the Constitution and the Military
Penal Code, abolishing the death penalty for all crimes.
Important reforms were also initiated regarding
juvenile justice. However, Congress failed to agree
other major human rights reforms.
In response to the failure to secure changes at
federal level, some states proposed changes to their
local justice systems, but by the end of the year it was
unclear what the effects of these initiatives were.
No action was taken to limit the application of
military justice to ensure that military personnel
accused of committing human rights violations are
investigated and tried in the civi l judicial system.
A National Human Rights Programme was initiated.
However, it did not receive new resources and lacked
an effective national plan. An evaluation committee
was established in November involving some human
rights organizations.
A new representative was assigned to the Office of
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico
City. Despite a number of valuable projects, there were
few advances in the implementation of
recommendations proposed by the UN Office.
Impunity
Little progress was made in bringing to justice those
responsible for grave human rights violations
committed during the "dirty war" in the 1960s, 1970S
and 1980s. Despite four years of work, only seven arrest
warrants against former state officials were executed.
In the hundreds of other cases, either the Special
Prosecutor did not file charges, or charges were
rejected by the courts.
In July, in breach of international law, the Supreme
Court ruled that genocide committed before 2001 was
bound by the statute of limitations. This led to the
collapse of the prosecution of nine people for the
murder of students in a 1971 protest known as
"Corpus Cristi".
The prosecution of former head of state Luis
Echeverria and former interior minister Mario Moya,
for genocide in relation to the same case, also collapsed
when a federal judge ruled there was insufficient
eVidence to file charges. In September a judge also
rejected charges, including genocide, against the
former president and seven others in relation to the
murder of students in demonstrations in Tlatelolco,
Mexico City, in 1968. At the end of the year, a ruling by
the Supreme Court was awaited on the appeal against
this decision filed by the Special Prosecutor.
Violence against women
Women and young girls, particularly from the poorest
sectors of society, continued to suffer discrimination
Amnesty International Report 2006

M EX

and violence in the home and community. Official
statistics indicated that nearly half of all women over
the age of 1 5 had suffered some form of violence during
the previous year. Efforts by the authorities to prevent
and punish such crimes were frequently inadequate,
despite increasing public awareness of the problem.
The Supreme Court ruled that marital rape was a crime.
The pattern of killings of women and girls in Ciudad
Juarez, Chihuahua state, continued with at least 28
murders. Although the state authorities appeared to be
more committed to tackling the crimes, offiCials
responsible for failings in the original investigations
were not held to account and there was little progress
in bringing to justice those responsible for past
abductions and murders both in Ciudad Juarez and the
city of Chihuahua. The Special Federal Prosecutor's
Office in Ciudad Juarez failed to guarantee
accountability and the post remained vacant at the end
of the year. The Commission for the Prevention and
Eradication of Violence against Women in Ciudad
J uarez and the National Human Rights Commission both
issued reports containing serious criticisms of federal
and state efforts to secure justice for the women of
Ciudad Juarez.
a Seven-year-old Airis Estrella Enrfquez Pando and
lo-year-old Anahf Orozco Lorenzo were brutally
murdered in Ciudad Juarez in May. Separate suspects
were detained for both crimes and were on trial at the
end of the year.
a In June the body of Minerva Torres was formally
identified by her family, after being kept by the
authorities for two years despite clear evidence as to
her identity. M inerva Torres was 18 years old when she
was abducted in Chihuahua city in 200), The family filed
charges against state authorities for i llegal
concealment of a body.

Public secu rity
High levels of violence related to drug crime and
kidnapping kept public security high on the political
agenda. The government extended the military's
involvement in policing functions in a number of states
with the initiative "Secure Mexico", leading to more
than 5,000 arrests.
a In May, three young men and a federal police agent
were reportedly unlawfully killed in Reynosa,
Tamaulipas state, by members of the Federal
Preventive Police, a police force primarily made up of
military personnel. Police reportedly opened fire on
the victims' vehicles without provocation or warning.
Families were denied information about the offiCial
investigation which was repeatedly delayed.
Unfair justice system a nd discrimination
A number of factors contributed to undermining the
right to a fair trial, including a failure to ensure
immediate access to defence counsel and a lack of
effective oversight of the prosecution service and
judicial police. I n May the recently founded National
Council to Prevent Discrimination published a national
survey i l lustrating the patterns of discrimination faced
by socially disadvantaged groups.
Amnesty International Report 2006

a In September Felipe Arreaga, a human rights
defender and prisoner of conscience known for his
environmental activism, was acquitted of murder
charges after his defence demonstrated that the
prosecution case had been fabricated as a reprisal for
his activism.
a Nicolasa Ramos was released from prison in Baja
California on appeal for lack of evidence. She had
served nearly three years in prison on the basis of
reportedly fabricated criminal charges of stealing
water from the local authority on behalf of the long­
standing squatter community of Maclovio Rojas,
Tijuana.
a In June human rights defender and gay activist
Octavio Acuna was murdered in Oueretaro. He and his
partner had filed a complaint against local police
officers for discrimination in 2004 and had complained
of homophobic harassment prior to the murder. Despite
thiS, official investigators reportedly ignored evidence
that the killing was motivated by homophobia.

Arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment
Reports of arbitrary detention and torture remained
common. The authorities failed to investigate many
reports of arbitrary detention or torture. The National
Human Rights Commission issued a report highlighting
the widespread practice of torture across the country.
a I n June, Teodoro Perez Perez, an indigenous Tzotzi l
man from Yabteclum, was al legedly tortured by
members of the Chiapas State Police. They reportedly
beat him, threw hot water on his chest, forced him to
undress and threatened him with rape. He was released
the following morning without charge. He was
reportedly threatened after fi ling a complaint.
a At least 12 people were convicted of involvement in
violent demonstrations in Guadalajara, Jalisco state, in
May 2004, many reportedly on the basis of evidence
extracted under torture. The state authorities refused
to investigate well-founded a llegations of torture or
reports of irregularities in the presentation of
prosecution evidence and police conduct.
a In June excessive force was reportedly used
against protesters in Cancun resulting in 34 detentions
and a number of injuries. The authorities failed to
investigate complaints of i l l-treatment and torture.
Journalists and human rights defenders
At least four journalists were killed, apparently in
reprisal for their work exposing corruption and
organized crime. Many others were harassed,
threatened and assaulted. The government promised to
assign a special prosecutor to investigate cases. Human
rights defenders working in local communities also
faced intimidation, threats and judicial harassment.
a Obti lia Eugenio Manuel, a human rights defender in
Ayutla de los Libres, Guerrero state, received death
threats against herself and her family. She had
highlighted abuses committed by the military in the
region, including the reported rape of two indigenous
women in 2002. The federal authorities provided some
protection but the state authorities reportedly failed to
conduct an effective investigation.

Economic, social and cultural rights
Denial of rights to basic services remained a primary
concern in many poor sectors of society, particu larly
indigenous communities. The impact of government
programmes to alleviate poverty and marginalization
remained limited.
In Chiapas and Guerrero, two of the states with the
largest indigenous populations, there were insufficient
health care professionals available to meet the
minimum needs of the population.
Access to clean water was an increasing concern,
reportedly giving rise to 413 community conflicts across
the country.

Oaxaca
There was a crisis in the rule of law and the protection
of human rights. In an apparent attempt to deter
opposition, the new state government executed several
questionable old arrest warrants, mounted politically
motivated prosecutions and undermined freedom of
expression.
a Agustin Sosa, a grassroots political activist, was
charged and remanded in custody, initially accused of
murder. Despite winning federal appeals on the
grounds of insufficient evidence, local prosecutors
brought further unfounded charges. National and
international concern at the worsening human rights
situation in the state led to his release along with the
majority of other detained activists.
a Staff of the opposition newspaper Noticias were
harassed and threatened during the year, particularly
by members of a trade union linked to the local
governing party. The state authorities failed to take
steps to investigate or punish threats against staff and
attacks on the newspaper's premises. I n October the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights granted
precautionary measures in favour of the director and
staff of Noticias.

Moldova Action Plan was signed with the European
Union, setting objectives for further moves towards
European integration.

Torture a nd ill-treatment in custody
On 30 June parliament amended the Criminal Code to
make torture a criminal offence. Poor conditions of
detention and ill-treatment in pre-trial detention
facilities continued to be reported.
Cl Stela Draghici, who is registered blind, was
transferred from a temporary detention centre
operated by the police Department for Combating
Organized CrIme in Chisinau to a detention centre in
Beltsy, a northern town. No a llowances were made for
her disability in either faci lity, for example in assisting
her to the shower or toilets, resulting in bullying by
other inmates. Repeated appeals by lawyers for an
improvement to her detention conditions were
ignored.
Cl Mikhail Kaldarar, Vasilii Kodrian, Anna Kodrian and
Vyacheslav Pleshko were detained without charge or
trial in the weeks following an armed police raid in the
town ofYedintsy on 18 July to investigate a multiple
murder in Chisinau. More than 30 Romani men and boys
were al legedly arrested and beaten to force them to
confess and to incriminate others. Mikhail Kaldarar was
arrested on 18 July and detained for more than six
weeks despite an order for his release by an appeal
court in Beltsy on 25J uly. Vasilii Kodrian was arrested
on 5 August and detained without charge for over a
month, allegedly because his son was a suspect. His
wife, Anna, was arrested on 1 8 August and briefly
detained. Vyacheslav Pleshko was arrested In Ukraine
by Ukrainian and Moldovan police in late J uly or early
August, forCibly returned to Moldova without any
extradition proceedings, and detained at a temporary
holding facility in Yedintsy until 4 September. All four
were released without charge.
In a resolution adopted on 4 October, the
ParlIamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called
on Moldova to continue the reform of law enforcement
agencies and to considerably improve conditions of
detention.
Freedom of expression
The threat of heavy fines for "moral damage" or
"insulting the honour and dignity" of an individual
(Article 16, Civil Code) was used in defamation cases
brought against journalists and the media for
publishing criticisms of politicians and offiCials.
Cl In April, lurie Rosca, head of the Christian­
Democrat People's Party and Deputy Speaker of
Parliament, sued the Timpul de dimineara and jurnal de
Chisinau newspapers under Article 16 for 50,000 and
62,000 euros respectively in damages. They had
published articles criticizing him.
A I n October the European Court of Human Rights
ruled that there had been a violation of the rIght to
freedom of expression in the case of Julieta Savitchi , a
correspondent of the 8asapress news agency. She had
Amnesty International Report 2006

been prosecuted for defamation for publishing an
article about corruption in the traffic police.

Opposition politicians prosecuted
In its 4 October resolution, the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe called for an investigation into
the high number of court cases against leading
opposition figures.
Cl Mihail Formuzal, Mayor of Ceadar Lunga in the
Gagauz autonomous region, Chair of the opposition
People's Republican Party, and a rival contestant to a
ruling party incumbent for the regional governorship,
faced criminal charges twice. In July he was tried for
al leged abuse of office and acquitted. In October he was
charged with misuse of funds.
Cl Georghe Straisteanu, a former member of
parliament, founder of the first private television
company in Moldova, and a well-known critic of
government attacks on media freedoms, was detained
with an employee on 22 July. He was charged With a
series of large-scale thefts from cars, punishable by up
to 25 years' imprisonment (Article 195, Criminal Code).
HiS employee testified for the prosecution after
allegedly being tortured. Acquitted and released on
18 August by the Central District Court of Chisinau,
Georghe Straisteanu was reported to have been
immediately redetained by police officers in defiance
of a further court order on 19 August for his release. He
remained in pre-trial detention until 17 November
when he was released on bail on condition that he
remain at his place of residence. At the end of 2005, the
car thefts trial was stil l pending.
Death penalty
Moldova took further steps towards abolition of the
death penalty in law. In September the Constitutional
Court approved two amendments to the provision In
the Constitution that had previously allowed for the
death penalty in certain cases. Parliament was due to
take a final decision in 2006.
Violence against women
In May, Moldova signed a Council of Europe declaration
agreed by member states at a summit meeting In
Warsaw that included a commitment to fight domestic
and other forms of Violence against women and
children. Also in May, Moldova signed the Council of
Europe Convention on Action agaInst Trafficking In
Human Beings. On 20 October the Moldovan parliament
adopted a law on trafficking.
Although Moldova reportedly increased the number of
convictions for trafficking in human beings, protection
for the victims of trafficking remained inadequate and
the government did not implement a 1998 witness
protection law. The main destinations were Cyprus,
Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, according
to a local human rights organization, La Strada. In most
cases women were trafficked for sexual explOitation, but
also sometimes for forced labour. Trafficked women
were mainly seeking work abroad because of
unemployment and domestic violence. Increasing
numbers of children and men were trafficked.

The Equ ity a nd Reconciliation Commission
completed its work and submitted its report to King
Mohamed VI. It recom mended that compensation be
paid to more than 9,000 people who had suffered
human rights a buses between 1 956 a nd 1 999, but it
was not permitted to name perpetrators. New
al legations surfaced a bout Morocco's role in the US­
led "war on terror". Eight Sahrawi human rights
defenders were imprisoned after protests which
originated in Western Sahara a nd to which police
responded with excessive force. At least 13 migra nts
were shot dead at the border between Morocco a nd
the Spa nish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. The
Polisario Front released the last of the Moroccans it
had held as prisoners ofwar; some had been held for
almost 20 years.
Background
From May until December, the territory of Western
Sahara, particularly the town of Laayoune, was rocked
by a series of demonstrations. In many of them,
demonstrators expressed their support for the
Polisario Front, which calls for an independent state in
the territory and had set up a self-proclaimed
government-in-exile in refugee camps in south­
western Algeria, or called for independence from
Morocco. The continuing deadlock in attempts to
Amnesty International Report 2006

resolve the dispute between Morocco and the Polisano
Front over Western Sahara appeared to have been a
major factor behind the protests.

Equ ity and Reconciliation Commission
The groundbreaking CommiSSion, the first truth
commission in the Middle East and North Africa region,
completed its work in November and reported its
findings to King Mohamed VI. Since it was inaugurated
in January 2004 with a remit to inquire into grave
human rights violations committed between 1956 and
1999, the Commission had received information from
more than 16,000 people. Many had appeared in person
before the Commission. Several dozen had spoken
about their experiences at seven televised hearings
held in six regions of Morocco. A planned hearing in
Laayoune, Western Sahara, was cancelled without
official explanation. AI co-operated with the
Commission, providing it with hundreds of documents
from its archives, including details of several hundred
cases of "disappearance" and arbitrary detention.
The Commission placed particular emphasis on
finding ways of providing reparations. It ruled that over
9,000 individuals should receive finanCial
compensation, and recommended assistance for those
in need of medical attention or rehabilitation as a result
of the violations they had suffered. The Commission
also made a series of proposals for institutional and
legislative reform.
The Commission's final report announced that it had
resolved 742 "disappearance" cases and that 66
outstanding cases would be investigated further by a
follow-up committee. The Commission indicated,
however, that it had often not obtained the testimonies
and documents it had requested from state offiCials,
who were under no compulsion to co-operate with it.
Many families of the "disappeared" were consequently
disappointed.
Under its statute, the Commission was precluded
from assigning responsibility to individuals for
violations and, in its final report, made no proposals for
suspected perpetrators to be brought to account.
Impunity for past crimes remained a seriOUS concern,
particularly since some alleged perpetrators continued
to be members, or even high-ranking offiCials, of the
security forces. The independent Moroccan Human
Rights Association, one of the Commission's main
critics on this issue, organized its own public hearings,
in which some victims named individuals they held
responsible for violations against them.
Abuses in the context of the 'war on terror'
New allegations surfaced about Morocco's role in the
US-led 'war on terror". In December a Council of
Europe investigator said that he believed some
prisoners previously held by the USA in Europe had
been moved to North Africa, pOSSibly Morocco, a month
earlier. Morocco denied the claim. However, the
al legation echoed previous reports that the USA had
sent detainees to Morocco for interrogation.
a I nformation emerged about the case of Benyam
Mohammed al-Habashi, an Ethiopian national. He was

behest of US authorities. before being taken to

Dozens of suspected Islamist activists were arrested

brought the total number of those arrested since bomb
attacks in Casablanca in May 2003 to over 3.000 and the
total of those prosecuted to over 1 . 500. according to
official statements. Many of those prosecuted were
sentenced to prison terms on charges based on a broad
and unspecific definition of terrorism. At least four
were sentenced to death.

Protests in Western Sahara
Popular protests which rocked Western Sahara.
particularly Laayoune. from May until December were
met with a police response that Included excessive use
of force. Scores of people. mostly demonstrators but
also including police. were injured. Hundreds of people
were arrested. Two men died allegedly after being
beaten by police on arrest.
fj Hamdi Lembarki. aged in his thirties. died on 30
October as a result of a head injury. according to an

officers had arrested him during a demonstration in
Laayoune. taken him to a nearby wall. surrounded him
and repeatedly beat him with batons on the head and
other parts of hiS body. An investigation was launched
by the authorities into his death.
Dozens of those held in custody alleged that they
were tortured or i l l-treated. either to force them to sign
confessions. to intimidate them from protesting further
or to punish them for their pro-independence stance.
In July the Justice Ministry told AI that all complaints it
received were treated seriously and that. on the basis
of three complaints. investigations had been opened
into allegations of torture and ill-treatment.
Dozens of people were charged with inciting or
participating In violence in the demonstrations. Over
20 were later convicted and some were sentenced to
several years in prison. Among those sentenced were
seven long-standing human rights defenders who were
mOnitoring and disseminating information on the
crackdown by the security forces. Two al leged that they
had been tortured during questioning. An eighth human
rights defender was detained awaiting trial at the end
of the year. All eight were possible prisoners of
conscience.
Freedom of expression
ContinUing restrictions on freedom of expression were
reported. particularly on issues related to the
monarchy and the Western Sahara dispute. Several
Journalists from Independent newspapers and
magazines. such as Tel Ouel. were sentenced to
suspended prison terms or heavy fines in this regard. In

an unprecedented move. the Moroccan authorities
blocked access to the Internet sites of several
international assoCiations advocating independence
for Western Sahara.
a AIi Lmrabet. a journalist and former prisoner of
conscience. was banned from working as a journalist
for 10 years in April and given a heavy fine after he was
convicted of violating both the Penal Code and Press
Code. The case arose from a report he wrote after
becoming the first Moroccan journalist to VISit the
refugee camps run by the PolisariO Front in south­
western Algeria. He stated that the Sahrawls there were
refugees. not held as captives as the Moroccan
authorities had long contended. This led to hiS being
accused of defaming the spokesperson of a Moroccan
organizatio n that campaigns for the "release" of the
Sahrawis in the camps.

Legal reform
Torture
Legal safeguards against torture were strengthened. A
law defining torture as a criminal offence. punishable
by long prison terms. was approved by parliament in
October. At the international level. Morocco
recognized the competence of the UN Committee
against Torture to investigate complaints submitted
by indiViduals.

Women's rights

introduction of the reformed Family Code in 2004. I n

more element of discriminat ion was to be removed.
declaring that the 1958 Citizenship Act would be
reformed to al low children of Moroccan mothers and
foreign spouses to be eligible for Moroccan citizenship
on the same basis as children of Moroccan fathers With
foreign spouses.

Refugees and migrants
Thousands of migrants. many of them from countries in
west and central Africa and including an unknown
number of refugees and asylum-seekers. sought to gain
access to countries of the European Union from
Morocco. Many congregated close to the Spanish
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla and made efforts to gain
entry to the enclaves by various means. including by
climbing over border fences. This came to a criSIS pOint
between late August and early October when both
Spanish and Moroccan security forces resorted to
excessive and. in some cases. lethal force against the
migrants. At least 13 were kil led as a result. some being
shot dead while they were reportedly scaling fences but
posing no risk to the lives of security force personnel or
others. Moroccan offiCials told AI in October that
judicial authOrities were investigating the deaths of
people whose bodies were found on the Moroccan side
of the border.
From September Moroccan authOrities forCibly
removed hundreds of migrants from their informal
camps close to the enclaves. They arrested some and
transported others to remote desert areas close to
Morocco's border with Algeria. where they were

dumped without adequate water, food or shelter,
reportedly resulting in further deaths. Hundreds of
migrants and dozens of asylum-seekers were
subsequently held in military bases without access to
legal counsel and other rights guaranteed to them
under Moroccan law, such as the right to appeal against
their custody. Many of the migrants were then
repatriated, while the asylum-seekers had their claims
assessed by representatives of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees after being denied access to
them for several weeks.

Pol isario camps
In August, the Polisario Front released the last
prisoners of war that it was holding in its camps i n
south-western Algeria. Some 404 prisoners were
handed into the care of the I nternational Committee of
the Red Cross and repatriated to Morocco; some had
been held for almost 20 years.
In November the Polisario Front committed to a total
ban on the use of anti-personnel mines by signing the
Deed of Commitment of Geneva Call, an international
humanitarian organization dedicated to engaging
armed non-state actors to respect humanitarian norms.
Those responsible for human rights abuses i n the
camps in previous years continued to enjoy impunity.
The Polisario Front took no steps to address this legacy.

Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: not signed

Over 800,000 people needed food aid as a result of
prolonged drought. Some 200,000 people were still
unable to access anti-retroviral drugs and other
treatment for H IV infection. High death rates from
AI DS-related illnesses seriously affected economic
and social development. Police officers were charged
with extrajudicial executions, ill·treatmentof
suspects and extortion, a nd were imprisoned to await
trial. However, others accused of using excessive force
against protesters were not subject to independent
investigation or brought to justice. Violence between
supporters of ruling a nd opposition parties led to
deaths a nd the destruction of homes. Restrictions on
freedom ofthe press remained, a nd journa lists faced
harassment a nd assault.
Background
Armando Guebuza was sworn in as the new President in
February. He pledged to consolidate national unity, to
promote human rights and democracy, and to fight
poverty, corruption and crime. In March, the new
government launched a five-year programme aimed at
good governance, transparency in public services
management, and public security.
The judiciary remained seriously understaffed, with
just over 1 ,000 offiCials, including 1 84judges, serving a
population of nearly 19 m i llion. As a result. people
often took justice into their own hands.
Steps to combat drug trafficking, acts of terrorism
and other organized crime included the deployment of
special police anti-terrorist brigades in all airports from
July. However, efforts to curb rising crime were
undermined by the deaths each year of around 1,000
police officers from AI DS-related i l lnesses.
E fforts to combat corruption included the upgrading
i n September of the Anti-Corruption Unit to a Central
Office for Combating Corruption, with increased
staffing and resources. The Anti-Corruption Unit, an
investigation unit independent of the police, had
proved its effectiveness in the Investigation and
subsequent prosecution of several high-profile cases.
In December Mozambique ratified the Protocol to the
African Charter on Human and People's Rights on the
Rights of Women in Africa and the protocol establishing
the African Court of J ustice.
Food shortages and HIV infection
Poverty remained widespread, with over half the
population reported to be living on less than one US

dollar a day. Over 800,000 people were affected by
food shortages and in need of food aid. Severe drought
In central and south Mozambique caused widespread
crop failures and Inflated prices.
The rate of HIV Infection among people aged
between 15 and 49 was 15.6 per cent, the National
Statistics Institute announced in june. Only one per
cent of children with H IV had access to anti-retroviral
or other drugs.

Police abuses
There were fewer allegations of police torture of
detainees than in previous years. Some action was
taken to discipline or prosecute police officers,
particularly in Manica province. There, following an
investigation by the provincial Procurator in
November, 14 police officers were charged with
various offences, Including the assault and
extrajudicial execution of suspects, extortion and
theft. At least five extrajudiCial executions occurred
In the first half of 2005. The officers were imprisoned
to await trial. According to reports, one was charged
with attempted murder for trying to shoot the
Procurator during an interrogation session. The trial,
set for December, was postponed and had not started
by the end of 2005.
a After a robbery at a national electricity premises in
Chlmoio in April and an exchange of fire with the police,
two suspects were reportedly captured and kil led in
police custody. Four police officers were arrested in
August and subsequently charged with stealing
proceeds from the robbery that had been recovered but
later went missing. In November, two of them were also
charged with the killing of the suspects.
a In August officers of the Rapid I ntervention Police
and the public order police harassed and beat people in
the Munhava area of Beira, a stronghold of the
Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) party,
a llegedly for not carrYing identity cards.
a In June municipal police officers in Maputo
assaulted and briefly detained two photojournalists
who took pictures for the Zambeze newspaper of
officers chasing street vendors and seizing their goods.
The police commander later apologized publicly and
promised to punish those responsible.
The force used by the police to break up protests
appeared to be excessive, and no investigations were
conducted into whether force and firearms were
appropriately used.
a I n july the Rapid Intervention Police and other
police units used tear gas to disperse a peaceful
demonstration in the Xipamanine market in Maputo
against the removal of unauthorized traders.
a In September the police beat and opened fire on
vendors in the limpopo market in Xai-Xai, Gaxa
province, who were marching to the municipal offices
to complain about conditions in the market. Two
people were arrested for throwing stones at the
police.
a Rapid I n tervention Police officers reportedly
assaulted striking students who set up barricades at the
Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo to protest at

1 90

new scholarship regulations. Eleven students were said
to have required medical treatment for fractures and
other injuries.

Political violence
Politically motivated violence erupted in Mocimboa da
Praia, Cabo Delgado province, between supporters of
the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(Frelimo) and the Mozambique National Resistance­
Electoral Union (RUE) over disputed municipal
elections won by Frelimo In May. RUE accused Frehmo
of rigging the elections and in September installed a
parallel local authority, prompting three days of
violence. Twelve people, including a police officer,
were killed; 47 were injured; and nearly 200 houses
were burned in Mocimboa da Praia and the nearby
town of Muindumbe. Thirty-six people were
subsequently arrested. There was no offiCial Inquiry
into the incident. The Mozambican Human Rights
League concluded that both parties had been
responsible for the violence.
Press freedoms restricted
journalists faced harassment and offiCial impediments
to their work.
a In March the news media were denied access to a
trial for criminal libel, an offence punishab le by up to
one year's imprison ment. The accused were Teodoro de
Abreu, former editor of the Demos newspaper, and
Momad Assi Satar, the author of an open letter to the
Attorney General and in prison Since being convicte d of
the murder in 2000 of Carlos Cardoso, a journalis t
investiga ting fraud and corruptio n. The open letter,
published by Demos in August 2004, said the Attorney
General was complici t in delaying investiga tions into
al legations that the son of former PreSident joaquim
Chissano was impl icated in the murder. In March the
libel trial was suspende d in response to a defence
complain t that the Attorney General was represented
in court by one of his subordin ates. It had not resumed
by the end of 2005.
a In August journalis t Isaias Natal said that he had
been threatened with death by a Frelimo offiCial in
Sofala province after the Zambeze newspaper
published an article about the defection of two Frelimo
members to another party.

Over 1 ,1 00 political prisoners were a rrested or
remained imprisoned. They included hundreds of
prisoners of conscience, held for peaceful political
opposition activities. At least 250 political prisoners
were released. The army continued to commit serious
human rights violations, includ forced labour,
against ethnic minority civi lians during counter­
insurgency activities. The I nternational Labour
Organization (I LO), other UN agencies and
international aid organizations faced increasing
restrictions on their ability to assist vul nerable
populations.
Background
The National Convention, reconvened in 2004 by the
ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to
draft a constitution, met in February and December.
The National League for Democracy (NLD) and several
other political parties did not participate, although
some ceasefire groups did. The SPDC selected all the
delegates, whose freedom of movement and speech
were restricted.
The Karen National Union (KNU), an armed
opposition group, and the government failed to agree a
ceasefire amid continued fighting in the Kayin State.
Conflict persisted between the Shan State Army-South
(SSA-South) and government forces in the Shan State.
The SPDC demanded that some armed groups in the
state, which had agreed ceasefires, give up their
weapons. Other sma ller, ethnically based armed
opposition groups continued to engage SPDC forces In
the Chin and Kayah States.
All N LD offices except its headquarters In Yangon,
the capital, remained offiCially closed on SPDC orders.
In May bombs in Yangon kil led an unknown number
of people.
Political i mprisonment
Over 1 , 100 people arrested for political reasons
remained in prison. The N LD and other opposition
political parties faced severe restrictions, harassment
and intimidation.
a Daw Aung San Suu KYI, N LD General Secretary, and
U Tin 00, NLD Vice Chairman, remained under house
arrest and incommunicado.
Following arrest, political prisoners were denied
access to relatives and i n some cases their lawyers.
a In February, U Khun Htun 00, a member of
parliament (MP)-elect from the Shan Nationalities
Amnesty International Report 2006

League for Democracy, and other Shan political
representatives were arrested, reportedly because of
their discussions about the National Convention. In
November, they were sentenced in a secret trial to
between 70 and 106 years' imprisonment for treason.
Some had been denied access to their families since
their arrest. One of the group, 82-year-old U Shwe Ohn,
was held under house arrest.
Often lengthy prison sentences were Imposed on
scores of indiViduals convicted In political trials,
including for the possession of published materials that
had been authOrIZed by the state censor, or on
trumped-up criminal charges.
a Three NLD M Ps-elect, U Kyaw San, U Kyaw Khln and
U Saw Hlaing, arrested in February and March, were
sentenced to seven, 14 and 12-year prison terms
respectively - U Saw H laing for distributing political
leaflets. U Kyaw Khin and U Kyaw San had been
released i n late 2004 and early 2005 from earlier prison
sentences.
a U Kyaw MIn, a National Democratic Party for
Human Rights MP-elect and member of the Committee
to Convene People's Parliament, was sentenced to 47
years' imprisonment, and his wife, son and two
daughters to 17 years' imprisonment, reportedly for
living in Yangon without offiCial permission.
a NLD local officials and members were sentenced to
prison terms of up to 10 years for possessing political
leaflets and a video of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visiting
party members.
a U Sao 00 Kya, a Shan political representative
related to U Khun Htun 00, was arrested I n August and
sentenced to 13 years' Imprisonment for reportedly
infringing tour guide regulations.
I ndividuals who took action to end forced labour
were imprisoned for their legitimate activities.
a U Aye Myint, a lawyer, was released from prison in
January after serving a sentence imposed in part for
contacting the I LO about forced labour. He was re­
arrested in September and sentenced to seven years'
imprisonment in October under legislatIOn penalizing
the circulation of false information. He had helped
farmers lodge an official complaint to the I LO about
land confiscations by the local authorities.

Releases
Some 50 political prisoners were released In January
and more than 200 i n July.
a Those released included Dr Khin Zaw Win, a dentist
and NLD member arrested in 1 994; Seln Hla 00, an N LD
M P-elect arrested in 1994; and Ohn Kyaing, journalist
and N LD M P-elect arrested in 1990.
a At least seven prisoners, who were held under
administrative detention laws after their sentences
expired, were released. Among them were student
leaders Ko Ko GYI and Zaw MIn, arrested In 1991, and
Democracy Party leaders U Htwe Myint and U Thu Wal.

Torture and il l-treatment
Reports of torture i n pre-trial detention and prisons
persisted.
a An unknown number of former Military
I ntelligence personnel, some of whom were reportedly

191

MYA

tortured during interrogation, received lengthy terms
of imprisonment following their convictions on
corruption and other charges during the year. They had
been detaIned after Prime M inister General Khin Nyunt
was deposed and arrested in October 2004. He was
reportedly sentenced for corruption in July to 44 years'
Imprisonment. The sentence was suspended but he was
restricted under house arrest.
a Prisoners who took part in a hunger strike over
conditions in Insein Prison in May were reportedly
beaten and held In cells deSIgned for military dogs.
Prison conditions remaIned harsh and political
prisoners were denied proper medical treatment.
a Four political prisoners reportedly died in
custody, including Ko Aung Hlaing Win, an NW Youth
WIng member. It was feared that torture or
inadequate health care might have contributed to
some of the deaths.
a U Win Tin, a journalist and N LD leader arrested in
1989, was one of three prisoners of conscience who
remaIned Imprisoned despite serious multiple health
problems. In January and February respectively,
detention orders were extended by a year on Dr Than
Nyein and Dr May Win Myint, NW MPs-elect arrested
in 1997, sentenced to prison terms, and held under
admInIstrative detention orders after completing their
sentences I n 2004·

Ethnic minorities
Members of ethniC minorities, including the Karen,
Mon, Shan and Rohingya, continued to be subjected to
forced labour and other violations at the hands of the
military, especially in counter-insurgency areas in the
Mon, Shan, Kayah and Kayin States, and in Bago and
Tanintharyi Divisions. Hundreds of thousands of
civilIans In these areas were still displaced from their
homes, mostly because of counter-insurgency
activities. They were generally cut off from
International aid organizations and UN agencies,
restricting their access to health care and food. Several
thousand civilians in northern Kayin State and eastern
Bago Division were reportedly displaced as a result of
SPDC efforts to break up imputed links with the KNU.
Government troops continued land confiscations,
extortion and restrictions on freedom of movement in
the Shan State, and abducted civilians for portering and
other forced labour in the Mon State. The RohIngyas, a
Muslim ethnIC minority in Rakhine State, were
increasingly forced to do sentry duty and to maintain
roads, military camps and farms.

the UN General Assembly adopted a similar resolution.
The Special Rapporteur and the UN Secretary-General's
Special Envoy continued to be denied access to the
country by the SPDC. The UN Security Council held a
closed session to discuss the situation in December.
In February senior I LO officials visited Myanmar but
were not permitted to meet Senior General Than Shwe.
In June the Committee on the Application of Standards
of the International Labour Conference meeting
recalled its 2000 resolution instructing all members
and international organizations to ensure that their
relations with the SPDC did not promote forced labour
'
foreign direct investment, or relations with state or
military-owned enterprises. Mass rallies organized by
SPDC-supported groups in mid-year called for the SPDC
to withdraw from the I LO. In October the I LO reported
the SPDC's stated intention to withdraw from the I LO
and the 21 death threats received by its Liaison Office
in Yangon. I n November the ILO Governing Body
expressed grave concern about the degradation of the
situation in Myanmar.
In August the World Food Programme reported that
about 40 per cent of children were malnourished
despite Myanmar's rich resources. The SPDC imp sed
increased restrictions on the activities and access to
vulnerable populations of UN and international aid
organizations, including the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, the UN Development Programme and the
I LO. In August the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria announced that it would
withdraw its programme by the end of 2005 partly
because of these difficulties.

The discovery of several mass graves nea r the
Angolan border led to renewed calls for a truth and
reconciliation commission. After President
Hifikepunye Pohamba took office, there were fewer
insta  s of government hate speech. Violence
against women and children remained pervasive.
Background
In March President Pohamba succeeded Samuel
Nujoma, who had been head of state since
i ndependence in 1990. Former President Nujoma
remained the President of the ruling party, SWAPO.
Mass graves
A series of mass graves, believed to contain the remains
of SWAPO members from the 1966-89 liberation war,
were uncovered in the north of the country. Whi le
opposition and civil society groups called for a truth
and reconcil iation commission, the government
maintained that those who had information about such
graves should come forward because the policy of
national reconciliation would protect them from
recrimination. SWAPO has rejected calls for a truth and
reconciliation commission since independence.
Hate speech
There was less official hate speech after President
Pohamba took office. However, former President
Nujoma and Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and
I mmigration Teopolina Mushelenga did verbally attack
gays and lesbians. Regular verbal attacks on minorities
had been a hallmark of former President Nujoma's rule.
Trial of Caprivi detainees
Most of the 120 people on trial i n connection with a
separatist uprising in the Caprivi region in 1999 spent
their sixth year in detention. The trial, which started in
2004 after years of procedural delays, was postponed
for much of 2005 after a prosecuting lawyer was kil led
and two of her colleagues seriously injured in a car
accident in March. Police officers accused of torturing
suspects detained in the wake of the uprising have yet
to face any formal charges or disciplinary action.
Violence agai nst women and children
A high level of violence against women and children
was evident from police bulletins, although no offiCial
figures were released. The particularly brutal murder of

The human rights situation deteriorated sharply
after King Gya nendra seized direct power and
decla red a state of emergency. Civil liberties were
u ndermined, with thousands of politically motivated
arrests, strict media censorship and harassment of
human rights defenders. The security forces ­
operating with impunity - unlawfully a rrested,
tortured a nd killed civilians and suspected
Communist Pa rty of Nepal (CPN) (Maoist) cadres.
CPN (Maoist) forces a bducted civilians a nd
com mitted u nlawful killings and torture. Thousands
of people were displaced by the conflict, while
strikes, insecu rity a nd displacement prevented many
people from enjoying their economic and social
rights. Women a nd children were particularly
vulnerable to violence a nd human rights violations.
Background
On I February King Gyanendra seized power, taking
direct control of government, declaring a state of
emergency and suspending fundamental human rights.
Strict media censorship was imposed and freedom of
information was severely restricted. Human rights
defenders were threatened and arrested. Political
parties and civil society organizations staged pro­
democracy protests and many participants were beaten
or arrested. Although the state of emergency was li fted
at the end of April, fundamental rights were not fully
restored and human rights organizations and the media
faced continued restrictions. Demonstrations for the
restoration of human rights and democracy continued
throughout the year.
Some countries, including I ndia, the UK and the USA,
suspended most military assistance to Nepal i n
response t o the King's takeover, although some "non­
lethal" supplies were resumed once the state of
emergency was lifted.
Fighting between the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA)
and the CPN (Maoist) escalated i n the first half of the

1 93

NEP

year, WIth large numbers of people killed, including
many civilians. On 3 September, the CPN (Maoist)
announced a unilateral three-mon th ceasefire, which
was later extended until the end of the year. The main
politIcal partIes formed a pro-democracy all iance and
engaged in dialogue with the CPN (Maoist). In
November the political parties and the CPN (Maoist)
announced a 12-point agreement that established a
framework for co-operatio n, with the shared aim of
holding electIons for a constituent assembly.
It was estImated that as many as 200,000 people
remained displaced by the conflict, many of whom were
living in severe poverty.
Under significant internationa l pressure during the
March-Apri l session of the UN Commission on Human
RIghts (CHR), Nepal signed a memorandum of
understand with the UN High Commission er for
Human Rights providing for the establishmen t of an
office in Nepal. The new office began work in May but
was not fully staffed until November. The CHR adopted
a resolution in April that called on all parties to the
conflict to respect human rights and internation al
humanitarIa n law, condemned abuses committed by
the CPN (Maoist) and urged the governmen t to take
speCIfic measures to abIde by its internation al
oblIgations.

Political arrests
Following the King's takeover, thousands of political
activists, human rights defenders, students, trade
unionists and journalists were arrested. Many were
held in preventive detention under the Public Security
Act (PSA) and some were reportedly tortured. The
leaders of Nepal's main political parties were placed
under house arrest. Although the majority of these
prisoners of conscience were released by April,
political arrests continued throughout the year.
People suspected of involvement with the CPN
(Maoist) were also arrested. They were held in
preventive detention under the Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities Ordinance (TADO). Many were
held in RNA barracks and were reportedly tortured.
In February King Gyanendra established a powerful
Royal Commission on Corruption Control (RCCC),
prompting fears that it would be used to discredit
political opponents. In Apri l, in a case that was widely
seen as politically motivated, the RCCC sentenced
former PrIme Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to two
years' ImprISonment for mIsappropriating funds.
a Student leader Gagan Thapa was arrested on 26
Apri l. The Supreme Court ordered his release but he
was immediately rearrested under a 90-day detention
order. He was released on 25 May after another
Supreme Court intervention. He was arrested again in
J u ly, accused of shouting anti-monarchist slogans at a
demonstration. In August he was charged with
sedition before the Special Court in Kathmandu but
released on bail.
Rule of law undermined
The securIty forces operated with impunity and
disregard for the rule of law. Judges and lawyers faced

1 94

intimidation and harassment by the security forces,
and military and civilian authorities obstructed judicial
processes. I n particular, many people freed by the
courts were immediately rearrested.
a On 19 September, " detainees suspected of
involvement in CPN (Maoist) activity were rearrested
by members of the security forces from the premises of
the Kanchanpur District Court following a Supreme
Court order for their release. This was the third time
security forces had arrested the group despite repeated
court orders for their release on the grounds that the
government had not provided sufficient evidence to
justify their preventive detention. The detainees were
considered to be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.

'Village defence forces'
The emergence of "village defence forces" - civilian
militias apparently supported by the state - led to an
increase in civilian casualties and significantly
worsened the human rights situation. Vigilante
attacks also threatened to exacerbate ethnic and
communal tensions. Some villagers reported being
pressured into joining the militias, including by being
beaten or accused as Maoist sympathizers if they
refused. M i l i tias were frequently accused of harassing
women during home searches and while conducting
guard duties. I t was reported that the government
provided funds and training for "village defence
forces" and there were joint militaryl"village defence
force" patrols. CPN (Maoist) forces attacked people
suspected of participating in "VIllage defence force"
activities.
A In February the abduction of two local men in
Kapi lvastu district by the CPN (Maoist) and the
subsequent killing of one of them sparked massive
violence led by "village defence forces" operating
reportedly with the support of the state and security
forces. Between 17 and 23 February, 31 people were
reportedly kil led, two women and one young girl raped,
and 708 houses burned down in the district. Eleven
other people were reportedly victims of revenge
kills by the CPN (Maoist).
Unlawful killings
Security forces were reportedly responsible for
extrajudicial executions of civilians and suspected CPN
(Maoist) members in their custody, as well as unlawful
killings of armed Maoists who could have been taken
Into custody.
Extrajudicial executions were most commonly
reported during search operations in vil lages when
local people were taken into custody, interrogated and
beaten, then taken to a secluded place and shot. Most
such killings were reported outside Kathmandu. Some
people were killed by security forces for providing
food, shelter or money to the CPN (Maoist), even
though they may have done so under duress.
Torture and ill-treatment
There were frequent reports of torture and ill­
treatment by security forces, particularly to extract
confessions and information.
Amnesty International Report 2006

NEP

In September the UN Special Rapporteur on torture
visited Nepal and concluded that torture and i 1 1 treatment were systematically practised b y t h e police,
armed police and RNA to extract confessions and
obtain intelligence. In November the UN Committee
against Torture expressed grave concern at reports of
the widespread use of torture and i l l-treatment by law
enforcement personnel and at the prevai ling climate of
impunity for torture.

Human rights defenders
The human rights community was directly targeted in
the crackdown that accompanied the state of
emergency. Scores of human rights activists were
arrested, and many faced harassment by the security
forces and the civil authorities. In an apparent effort to
limit human rights monitoring, a number of human
rights defenders were prevented from leaving
Kathmandu in February and March. Some human rights
defenders left the country fearing for their safety. Even
after the lifting of the state of emergency, human rights
defenders continued to face harassment and
obstruction.
a Krishna Pahadi, founding chairman of the Human
Rights and Peace Society and former chair of AI Nepal,
was arrested in Kathmandu on 9 February for planning
a demonstration. He was held under the PSA for five
months.
The National Human Rights Commission ( N H RC),
which had since i ts inception faced serious
obstruction, was prevented from carrying out many of
its core functions following the King's takeover. In
violation of its mandate, some N H RC staff and
Commissioners were prevented from travelling
outside Kathmandu and from visiting detainees. When
the sitting Commissioners' terms expired in May, the
statutory procedure for appointing Commissioners
was changed by Royal Ordinance and new
Commissioners were appointed, a lthough the existing
Chairman remained in place. There was widespread
concern that the process used to appoint new
Commissioners jeopardized the independence and
credibility of the N H RC.
In November the government adopted a code of
conduct to regulate the activities of non­
governmental organizations (NGOs) which placed
sweeping restrictions on freedom of expression and
association. There was widespread concern that the
code of conduct could be used to suppress legitimate
dissent by civil society. However, in December the
Supreme Court issued a stay order on the code of
conduct.
The media were particular targets for suppression,
with the introduction of censorship in February, a ban
on news broadcasting by FM radio stations and the
arrest and harassment of journalists. On 9 October the
government promulgated a severely restrictive Media
Ordinance that further contravened the right to
freedom of expression.
a On 27 November police raided Radio Sagarmatha
and terminated broadcasting, seized broadcasting
equipment and detained staff.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Abuses by the CPN (Maoist)
CPN (Maoist) forces carried out indiscriminate attacks
and attacks on civilians. They also abducted, tortured
and kil led civilians accused of "spying" and other
crimes. Captured soldiers, their families and those who
had left the CPN (Maoist) movement were killed in
particularly brutal ways.
a On 15 April , CPN (Maoist) cadres surrounded
Bargadwa vil lage, Nawalparasi district, and rounded up
villagers. They then reportedly separated all the boys
and men aged between 14 and 40 and killed 10 men and
one boy.
a Ula Singh, aged 23 from Mahendranagar,
Kanchanpur district, was reportedly abducted by CPN
(Maoist) cadres from her home on 29 April , allegedly on
suspicion of spying.
a Six family members of soldiers, including three
women and a one-year-old child, were abducted by
Maoists in Kailali district in mid-June. Their bodies,
reportedly badly mutilated, were found two days later.
Children
Children faced human rights abuses from both sides of
the conflict. There were reports of children being
detained and tortured by security forces, as well as
being abducted and recruited by the CPN (Maoist).
Children were also killed in indiscriminate attacks and
were particularly at risk from improvised explosive
devices planted by the CPN (Maoist) in civilian areas.
Many children died from poverty and disease,
exacerbated by the conflict.
Many schools were forcibly closed by the CPN
(Maoist) and thousands of schoolchildren abducted for
"political education" sessions. While most of the
abducted children returned home after a few days, a
few did not and may have been recruited into CPN
(Maoist) forces.
a On 20 February, in Kapilvastu district, an I I -year­
old girl was raped by three members of an anti-Maoist
militia amid widespread violence led by vigilante
groups. Her family was reportedly too frightened to
seek justice.
a Five children were killed and three injured on
22 April when an explosive device left by Maoists at a
public tap exploded in Dalsing, Rukum.
Women
There were many reported incidents of trafficking, rape
and other sexual violence as a result of the conflict,
which also exacerbated existing discrimination against
women. Widows and single women were particularly at
risk of violence and harassment from parties to the
conflict, as well as from within their families and
communities. The breakdown in local government and
law enforcement, and scarcity of shelter and other
support services for women, meant there was little
recourse for survivors of domestic violence.
Nepali women mobilized to claim their rights.
Conflict widows worked to support each other and
called for an end to the violence, while wives and
mothers of those who had "disappeared" a t the hands of
the security forces demanded accountability.

Economic, social and cultura l rights
The impact of the conflict severely reduced people's
ability to enjoy their economic, social and cultural
rights.
Frequent strikes (bandhs) imposed by the CPN
(Maoist), which stopped all trade and traffic, had a
severe effect on people's livelihoods and ability to
travel.
Both the Maoists and the RNA disrupted the work of
NGOs in deprived rural areas, exacerbating food
shortages and preventing access to medical care.

There were concerns a bout the treatment of asylum­
seekers and migra nts a nd about the extension of
counter-terrorism legislation.
Migration issues
a On 26 january, the Royal Dutch Constabulary (RDC)
failed to intervene in the expulsion from the USA of a
Syrian man, Abd-al Rahman al Musa, so that he could
file an asylum request. Subsequently, Abd-al Rahman al
Musa was detained upon his arrival in Syria. In the wake
of this case, the RDC announced that it would amend its
policy and respond to non-governmental organizations
and lawyers intervening to prevent re{oulementof
asylum-seekers in future.
a On 27 October, there was a fire in the temporary
detention centre at Schiphol Airport in which 11 irregular
migrants (people who did not have legal permission to
remain in the country) perished. Approximately 350
people were being held in the complex when the fire
broke out. The centre, which held both prisoners and
irregular migrants, had caught fire on two previous
occasions, the first being shortly before it was opened in
2003 and the second in 2004. According to some reports,
previous recommendations by fire prevention offiCials
had not been implemented. Survivors said that there was
a delayed reaction by centre staff to cries for help from
the detainees. On 27 October, the Safety Investigation
Council launched an investigation into the fire. While the
nature and extent of the investigation were not made
public, the Safety Investigation Council indicated the
investigation should be concluded Within a year. The
National Agency for Correctional Institutions was
charged with collating all relevant materials for use by
the Safety Investigation Council. Additionally, the
Forensic Science Service was also conducting its own
investigation on behalf of the Public Prosecution Service.
Counter-terrorism
In january, the government announced the
introduction of new counter-terrorism measures,
including the criminalization of "incitement to
terrorism". The measures were announced shortly after
the murder in November 2004 of film maker Theo van
Gogh by Mohammed B., a member of the Hofstad
Network, which was conSidered a "terrorist group" by
the Dutch government.
The draft proposal on counter-terrorism measures
would also crlminalize glorifying, condoning,
trivializing and denying other serious crimes, including

1 96

NIC

war crimes, crimes against humanIty and genocide. The
draft legislation stated that in order to be found guilty,
a person must have known or reasonably expected that
their utterance(s) could seriously disturb public order.
Although the draft bill was circulated to advisory
bodies in July, it had not been submitted to parliament
by the end of the year.
A separate draft bill, introduced in parliament in
June, included measures raising the maximum period of
pre-trial detention for terrorist offences.
In December, the Hague Court of Appeal overturned
a decision of the District Court and permitted the
extradition to the USA of Mohammed A., a Dutch
national of Egyptian origin accused of crimes
involving fraudulent phone cards which may have
been used to facil itate contact between members of
al-Oa'ida. His lawyers argued against extradition,
fearing he would be treated as a n enemy combatant if
he were extradited to the USA. The Court of Appeal
a llowed the extradition after receiving the assurance
of the USA that he would be prosecuted "before a
Federal Court in accordance with the full panoply of
rights and protections that wou ld otherwise be
provided to a defendant facing Simi lar charges". The
USA further guaranteed Mohammed A. would not face
prosecution by a military commission, be criminally
prosecuted in any tribunal or court other than a US
Federal Court, and that he would not be treated or
designated as an enemy combatant.

Violence agai nst women remained a serious concern.
People suffering from health problems reportedly
linked to the use of pesticides on banana pla ntations
sought redress from multinational companies and
state support. Excessive use of force by police was
reported.
Background
Civil unrest and political tensions intensified in 2005.
There were efforts to strip the executive of powers and
corruption scandals implicating government officials at
the highest levels. Large-scale demonstrations took
place In several towns against the rising cost of fuel,
food and public transport.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Violence against women
H igh levels of violence against women and the
inadequate response by the authorities remained a
major concern. According to press reports, 25 women
and girls were killed between January and August as a
resul t of domestic or sexual violence.
a Xiomara Obregon Hondoy was shot dead by her
partner on 12 April. She had reported his violent and
abUSive behaviour on a number of occasions to the
authorities but they had failed to take appropriate
action to protect her.
Right to health: state a nd corporate
accounta bility
Banana workers formerly employed by US
multinational companies intenSified their struggle for
compensation for health problems. They a lleged that
these were caused by the pesticides used on the
banana plantations during the 1960s, 1 970S and early
1980s. Health problems reported included skin and
breast cancer; l iver, pancreas and kidney problems;
nervous disorders; and miscarriages. About 22,000
former workers and family members were estimated
to be affected. By the end of 2005, over 1 , 000 former
banana workers had reportedly died from pesticide
related diseases. There were protests at the
government's failure to comply with a March 2004
agreement in which commitments were made
regarding medical and legal assistance for those
affected. A new agreement was signed in August.
setting out a legislative agenda to address the
workers' demands, in particular around access to
health care.
At the end of the year, court orders against several
multinational companies in Nicaragua and the USA
were sti l l awaiting implementation or were the subject
of appeals by the companies.
I ndigenous peoples
In June the I nter-American Court of Human Rights ruled
in favour of the indigenous group Yabti Tasba Masraka
Nanih Asia Takanka (YATAMA) on the grounds that their
right to judicial guarantees had been violated, leading
to their exclusion from participating in the 2000
municipal elections.
In May the Awas Tingni indigenous community
sought the intervention of the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights with a new request for additional
reparations. The Nicaraguan government had failed to
comply with the Court's 2001 ruling ordering Nicaragua
to provide reparations to the Awas Tingni indigenous
community and demarcate and title their lands. The
case had been brought after the state granted an
exploration licence to a foreign-based logging company
in 1994 in the community's ancestral territory without
its consent and in breach of national and regional
legislation.
Excessive use of force by police
According to press reports, police officers used
excessive force against protesters during at least two
demonstrations. In February, three people who had

Faso and Mali food shortages were reported.

Arbitrary a rrests
Leaders of civil society organizations were arbitrarily
detained.
a In March, five leaders of the anti-poverty
Fairness/Equality Coalition against the High Cost of
Living were arrested. They included Kassoum Issa
Secretary of the national teachers' trade union, N� uhou
Arzika, Moustapha Kadi, Morou Amadou and journalist
Moussa Tchangari. All five were charged with "plotting
against state security" after the coalition called for a
general strike against a new tax on basic goods such as
flour and milk. They were provisionally released 10
days later and by the end of the year no further legal
action against them was known to have been taken.
a In MaY, l Iguilas Weila, President of the anti-slavery
organization Timidria, and five other people working
with him were arrested and charged with "attempted
fraud". They were accused of seeking to defraud
international lenders by soliciting funds to organize a
ceremony marking the liberation of slaves. The six men
were provisionally released in June and by the end of
the year no further legal action was known to have
been taken against them. The arrests took place against
a background of attempts by the authorities to muzzle
Timidria and prevent it from denouncing slavery, a
practice punishable in law in Niger since 2003.

N iger suffered devastating food shortages because
of repeated cycles of droughts and an invasion of
desert locusts in 2004. Several leaders of civil society
were a rbitrarily detained.
Famine and belated international response
Serious food shortages were compounded by years of
drought and an invasion of desert locusts in 2004, the
worst in more than a decade, which wiped out much of
the country's cereal production. Although several non­
governmental organizations (NGOs) had been warning
about the risk of famine in Niger since late 2004,
international donors, including the UN and the
European Union, did not react quickly to calls for
urgent food aid. In J une, thousands of people
demonstrated in the capital, N iamey, to demand the
distribution of free rations. Their demand was refused
by the authorities who said that they could not
distribute for free the little food they had. In July,
following renewed calls from NGOs, the international
community, including UN agencies, began to send
emergency food aid, which slightly improved
the situation.
The UN estimated that the famine put in danger the
lives of 3-5 million of Niger's 12 mil lion inhabitants. No
offiCial figures were released for how many people died
as a result of the food shortages. The famine in Niger
had a knock-on effect in neighbouring countries: in
Benin and Nigeria, rising prices and a plague of crop-

Death sentences continued to be ha nded down, but
no executions were carried out. While one
government commission recommended a
moratorium on the death penalty or its a bolition,
others called for its continued use agai nst juveniles
a nd, reportedly, the execution of death row prisoners
to decongest the prisons. The security forces in the
Niger Delta killed people and razed communities
with impunity to prevent disruption to oil production
a nd in response to community protests. Violence
against women, including in the fa mily, was still
widespread. Although some states introduced
legislation on violence in the home, the federal
government did not review discriminatory laws or
a mend national law to comply with the Protocol to
the African Charter on Human a nd Peoples' Rights
on the Rights of Women in Africa. Outrage over six
extrajudicial executions by the police in Abuja, the
capital, prompted investigation and the prosecution
of suspect officers. However, few human rights
a buses were investigated or their perpetrators held
to account. The findings of a judicial commission of
inquiry into human rights violations between 1 966
a nd 1 999 were finally made public, but the
government did not annou   plans to implement its
recommendations. Human rights defenders a nd
journalists continued to face harassment and
unlawful detention. Over 3,000 people were made
homeless without adequate prior notice, alternative
accommodation or compensation in a mass forced
eviction. Killings increased throughout the country in
violence between and within political pa rties.
Death penalty
No executions were carried out. However, at least four
death sentences were handed down by Sharia (Islamic
law) courts in northern Nigeria. Appellate courts
overturned one death sentence passed by Sharia
courts.
Trials by Sharia courts - since 1999 empowered
across northern Nigeria under new Sharia penal
legislation to impose floggings and the death penalty on
Muslims for zina (sexually related offences) - were in
general grossly unfair. They frequently denied the poor
and vulnerable basic rights of defence such as the right
to a lawyer.
a Two men in Katsina State were arrested and
charged with "sodomy" in June, and faced death by
stoning i f convicted. On 6 December a Sharia court
acquitted the two men for lack of evidence.
Amnesty International Report 2006

a On 24 May the Bauchi State Sharia Court of Appeal
upheld an appeal filed by Umar Tori after he was
sentenced to death by stoning for zina, and ordered his
retrial before the Upper Sharia Court in Kobi. He had
been convicted by the Upper Sharia Court in Alkalere
on 29 December 2004·
a On 10 November the Upper Sharia Court of Yankab a
district, Kano State, sentenced two men to death by
hanging for murder under the state Sharia Law of 2000.
The government did not make public its response to
recommendations for a moratorium on the death
penalty by the National Study Group on the Death
Penalty, which submitted its report in October 2004. I n
July a committee o f the National Political Reform
Conference. whose representatives met from February
onwards to debate a new Constitution, recommended
that minors should be executed when they committed
"heinous offences such as armed robbery and cultism".
A presidential committee set up in March 2004 to
review death row prisoners reportedly recommended
that they could be executed to decongest Nigeria's
prisons. I n March the UN Special Rapporteur on
freedom of religion or belief, during a fact-finding
mission to Nigeria, raised human rights concerns about
the introduction of legal systems and a mandatory
death penalty based on religion. The UN Special
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions, whose mandate includes the death penalty,
also visited Nigeria in June and July.

I njustice, oil and violence
The exploration and production of oil continued to
result in deprivation, injustice and violence in the oil­
producing Niger Delta region. The proliferation of small
arms - reportedly part-financed by oil thefts - and the
government's inadequate disarmament programmes
compounded the violence. The security forces razed
communities and killed and injured people with
impunity. Community activists who protested in pursuit
of rights and resources, sometimes against oil
companies, faced violence and arbitrary detention. The
security forces often responded with disproportionate,
including lethal , force. Whole communities were
targeted for allegedly hindering oil production or
harbouring criminal groups.
Oil spills and gas flaring continued to contribute to
environmental degradation and affect health and
livelihoods. I n a historic judgment, all oil companies
were ordered to stop gas flaring by the H igh Court in
Benin state on 14 November, on the grounds that it
contravened human rights including the right to l ife.
However, access to justice for the victims of most
human rights abuses remained out of reach because of
expensive and lengthy litigation processes.
a On 4 February soldiers fired tear gas and later live
ammunition to disperse as many as 300 protesters at
the Chevron Nigeria-operated Escravos oil terminal in
Delta State. One demonstrator, fisherman Bawo
Ajeboghuku, was shot and later died, and at least 30
others were injured. The protesters from the Ugborodo
community said that Chevron Nigeria had not provided
the jobs and development projects promised in return

for a "non-disruptive operating environment" i n a 2002
agreement between the company and the community.
No thorough or independent investigation was known
to have been conducted by the federal government or
Chevron NigerIa.
a On 19 February soldiers Invaded the community of
Odioma in Bayelsa State, killing at least 17 people and
razing about 80 per cent of the buildings. Two women
were reportedly raped and community leaders said
they were beaten and forced to eat sand. The purpose
of the raId was to arrest leaders of an armed vigilante
group allegedly responsibl e for killing 12 people in
January. The findings of a state-level judicial
commissIon of inquiry was not made publiC .

Violence against women
Women were raped and subjected to other forms of
sexual violence by government agents as well as
partners, employers and others. In some communitie s,
female genital mutilation and forced marriages were
stil l practIsed. The numbers of women killed, injured,
raped and beaten by their partners remained high.
Despite the lack of official statistics, nearly two-thirds
of women in certain groups in Lagos State, for example,
were estImated to be victims of violence in the home.
Discriminatory laws and practIces, dismissive attitudes
within the polIce, an inaccessible justice system and the
lack of shelters for victims contributed to violence
against women being widely tolerated and
underreported.
a "Folake" was remanded in prison after accusing her
former employer of rape. Although medical
examinatIon supported her case, she was charged with
slander. The material evidence of the crime, handed
over to the police, was later said to have disappeared.
The alleged perpetrator was not brought to j ustice.
By the end of 2005, national law had not been
amended in line with the Protocol to the African
Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of
Women in Africa, which had been ratified by Nigeria in
December 2004. A committee set up to review
dIscriminatory legislation had its first meeting at the
end of 2005.
The first state-level laws on domestic violence were
passed by state legislators in Ebonyi State and Cross
River State. In Lagos State, a draft domestic violence
law made slow progress, despite pressure from human
rights organizations.
Impunity
Protests at police ki llings of five Igbo traders and one
female companion, a llegedly suspected of being
armed robbers, on 8 J une I n Abuja prompted an
investigation and the prosecution of eight officers on
murder charges. However, in most cases, the security
forces continued to commit human rights violations
with impunity.
Where abuses were the subject of commissions of
Inquiry, the findings were generally not made public.
The report of investigations into human rights
violations between 1966 and 1999 by the Human Rights
Violations I nvestigation Commission, known as the
200

Oputa Panel, was published by civi l society
organizations before it was made available to members
of the National Political Reform Conference.

Charles Taylor
Resolutions by the European Parliament in February
and by the US House of Representatives in July called
on the Nigerian government to hand over former
Liberian President Charles Taylor to the Special Court
for Sierra Leone to face charges of crimes against
humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of
international law. The government neither handed
over Charles Taylor nor brought charges against him in
the Nigerian courts.
In November a federal High Court ruled admissible
a legal chal lenge to the Nigerian government's
decision to grant asylum to Charles Taylor in 2003- The
case had been brought in 2004 by two Nigerian
nationals who had had l imbs amputated by an armed
group backed by the Liberian government during the
conflict in Sierra Leone.
Journalists under threat
Newspaper editors and journalists were harassed by
the security police, and sometimes detained
incommunicado for several days, after criticizing the
federal government, exposing corruption, or reporting
the activities of secessionist or armed opposition
groups. Activists faced arrest and violence when trying
to investigate oil spills and human rights violations in
the Niger Delta.
a On 2 May police arrested Omo-Ojo Orobosa,
publisher of the weekly Midwest Herald, in Lagos, and
detained him incommunicado and without charge until
13 May at an interrogation centre. He appeared to have
been detained because his paper had reported
allegations that relatives of President Obasanjo would
benefit from the sale of government-owned flats.
a On I and 2 August, three men were arrested and
detained without charge until 4 August. The reason for
their arrest appeared to be that they were printing
materials for the international Campaign Against
Impunity coal ition of human rights groups, and had
copies of the I nterpol arrest warrant for Charles Taylor.
a On 1 1 October, Owei Kobina Sikpi, publisher of the
Weekly Starnewspaper, was arrested and charged with
"false publication" after an article in his paper accused
the Governor of Rivers State of money laundering.
Following a visit to Nigeria in May, the UN Special
Representative on human rights defenders said that the
return to civilian rule in 1999 had given human rights
defenders greater freedom to operate, but that access
to official information and to sensitive sites - of forced
evictions, oil spills or intercommunal violence, for
example - remained too restricted.
Forced evictions
In a number of mass forced evictions, thousands of
people were made homeless without adequate notice,
compensation or the provision of alternative housing.
a During three days in April approximately 3,000
residents were evicted from Makoko in Lagos. The

Dozens of people were a rbitrarily a rrested and
deta ined in the context of the "war on terror" . Severa l
of them "disappeared" a nd some were handed over to
US custody. "Disappearances" were also reported
from Balochistan province. Blasphemy laws continued
to be used to persecute members of religious
minorities. The state took no action to prevent
"honour" crimes orto punish perpetrators. The
Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, which provides
protection for children within the justice system, was
temporarily reinstated. At least 241 people were
sentenced to death a nd 31 were executed.
Background
The government vacil lated between seeking to control
and appeasing religious groups and parties. In March, it
reintroduced a "religious column" in national
passports, in breach of earlier promises to minority
groups. In J uly, following bomb attacks in the UK by
men of Pakistani origin, at least 900 members of
religious groups and religious school students were
arrested. Most were released within weeks but some
continued to be held under preventive detention
legislation. The government announced that a l l foreign
students of religiOUS schools would be expelled and
that such schools needed to register. However, after
protests by religious groups, these directions were not
ful ly implemented. In July, the Hasba (accountability)
Bill was passed in the North West Frontier Province. It
provided for an ombudsman empowered to "reform
society in accordance with I s lam". The Supreme Court,
in August, declared sections of the bi 1 1
unconstitutional. I n the tribal areas o n the border with
Afghanistan, civil ians suffered abuses during an
ongoing security operation.
A draft bill to establish a national human rights
commission was presented in May but was not passed
by the end of 2005.
Arbitrary a rrests and 'disappearances'
Dozens of suspects, Pakistanis as wel l as foreign men,
women and children, were arbitrarily arrested on
suspicion of terrorist activities and of contact with al­
Oa'ida. Several "disappeared" in custody and some
were handed over to US custody, apparently without
legal process.
a Abu Faraj AI Libbi, a Libyan national a l leged to be
the operational commander of al-Oa'ida, was

202

arrested on 2 May in Mardan, near the border with
Afghanistan. The Interior Minister stated that he
would be tried i n an anti-terrorism court for
attempting to assassinate the PreSident. He was held
incommunicado at an undisclosed location. At the
end of May AI Libbi was handed over to US custody,
apparently without legal process. By the end of the
year, nothing was known of his whereabouts or the
whereabouts of more than 12 other suspects arrested
in connection with him.
The non-governmental Human Rights Commission of
Pakistan investigating the situation in Balochistan
province found evidence of arbitrary arrests and
detention, extrajudicial executions, torture and
"disappearances" committed by security and
intelligence agencies. On 9 December, 18 labour union
leaders from Balochistan "disappeared" in Karachi
where they had gone to negotiate with the management
of their company. Their whereabouts remained unknown.
a Several members of the Balochistan Student
Organization (BSO) "disappeared" during 2005. BSO
chairman Dr Imdad Baloch was arrested on 25 March
along with five others in Karachi. He and three others
were released on bai l two months later facing
politically motivated criminal charges. He reported that
they had been tortured and held blindfolded, in iron
shackles and threatened with death if they did not give
up politiCS. The other two remained in custody.

Failure to protect minorities
The state failed to protect members of religious
minorities from abuse by private individuals. At least 72
people were charged and arrested under blasphemy
laws, including laws that make it a criminal offence for
members of the Ahmadiyya community to practise their
faith. Among the accused were 39 Muslims, 26 Ahmadis,
four Hindus and three Christians.
a In October, eight Ahmadis were shot dead and 22
i njured in their mosque by men shooting from a passing
motorbike. Eighteen men arrested shortly afterwards
were released without charge.
a Mohammad Younus Shaikh was sentenced to life
imprisonment in August on charges of blasphemy for
writing about religious matters in a book. He was held
in solitary confinement in Karachi Central Prison after
fellow prisoners threatened him. No action was taken
against those threatening violence.
Violence against women
"Honour" killings and mutilations of girls and women,
and to a lesser extent of boys and men, continued.
Successful prosecutions for "honour" killings were rare.
Legal changes introduced in late 2004 failed to curb the
authority of the victim's heirs to forgive the
perpetrators, a llowing them to escape conviction.

further threats. In March the Lahore H igh Court
reversed the August 2002 trial court's decision to
sentence six men to death. It commuted the death
sentence imposed on one to l i fe imprisonment and
acquitted and released five. On a request by
Mukhtaran Mai, who feared for her l i fe, the Punjab
government held the five for three months in
preventive detention. In june, a review board ordered
their release. The Supreme Court took up the appeal
against the acquittals and ordered all the original
accused to be held in judicial custody. The appeal was
pending at the end of 2005. Mukhtaran Mai, who had
been invited to the USA to speak on women's rights,
was prevented in june from leaving the country and
placed under virtual house arrest.
Women's rights activists were under increased
threat. Police tore the clothes and pulled the hair of
women activists participating in a mixed gender
marathon in Lahore in May. About 40 were detained
until evening.

Children's rights
In February, the Supreme Court suspended the Lahore
High Court judgment of December 2004 which had
revoked the juvenile justice System Ordinance, 2000
OjSO), as unconstitutional. The JjSO provides protection
for children in the criminal justice system. This latest
decision meant that the jjSO was reinstated, but only
temporarily, pending a still awaited decision on the
constitutionality of the law by the Supreme Court.
In several cases courts rejected applications for
cases to be retried in juvenile courts.
a The Lahore High Court in February dismissed a
petition that Muhammad Hayat was a juvenile at the
time of a murder for which he was sentenced to death in
1995, arguing that he had not raised the point in earlier
hearings. His brother asserted that they had been
ignorant of legal safeguards for juveniles.
The JjSO, although formally extended to the tribal
areas, was not implemented there. In the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas, dozens of children, some
under the age of five, were imprisoned on three-year
sentences under the collective responsibility clause of
the Frontier Crimes Regulation for crimes allegedly
committed by members of their families.

In the tribal areas two men were executed by firing
squad immediately after a tribal council - which has no
powers to adjudicate criminal cases - convicted them
of murder. They had had no legal counsel and no
chance to appeal.

Earthquake relief
A massive earthquake hit northern Pakistan in October
leaving some 73,000 people dead and two million
people in need of relief and rehabilitation.
International humanitarian assistance was inadequate,
coordination between relief agencies lacking and
distribution hampered by difficulties of access.
Adequate health care, including trauma counselling,
shelter and protection against exploitation including
trafficking was lacking, particularly for injured and
orphaned children and homeless women.

Inter-factional violence within the Palestinian
Authority (PA) a nd its security forces, a nd between
political factions a nd armed groups, caused a further
deterioration in secu rity in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Armed confrontations, attacks a nd a bductions
by Palestinian a rmed groups increased, a nd scores of
Palestinians were kil led a mid growing lawlessness.
Killings of I sraelis by Palestinian armed groups
diminished significantly compa red to previous years.
I mpunity remained widespread as PA security forces
were u na ble or u nwilling to prevent killings a nd
attacks or to a pprehend the perpetrators. Members

PAL

of PA security forces also participated in attacks,
a bductions a nd other a buses. Five Palestinians
convicted of murder were executed, ending a three­
year de facto moratorium on executions.
Background
After the election in January of President Mahmoud
Abbas, Palestinia n armed groups agreed to an indefinite
tahadiyeh (quiet), dUrIng which they would refrain from
attacking Israelis, and the Israeli authorities announced
a suspension of offensive attacks against Palestinian s in
the Occupied Territories. Attacks by both sides continued
nonethele ss, but to a lesser extent than in previous years
of the Palestinian intifada (uprisIng) that began in 2000.
In 2005, Israeli forces killed some 190 Palestinian s, many
of them unlawfully and including some 50 children (see
Israel and the Occupied Territories entry). Palestinian
armed groups killed 50 Israelis, most of them civilians
and Including six children, both in the Occupied
Territories and inside Israel. Most attacks against Israelis
were claimed by the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades (an
offshoot of Fatah) and IslamicJihad . Hundreds of
PalestInian s and Israelis were injured in attacks by both
sides. Palestinian armed groups also launched mortar
attacks from the Gaza Strip towards nearby Israeli towns.
In August and September Israel removed all its 8,000
settlers and all its troops from the Gaza Strip. However,
the IsraelI army retained control of the airspace,
territorial waters and land borders of the Gaza Strip.
Israel imposed a closure at the Rafah crossing between
the Gaza Strip and Egypt, the only point for Palestinians
to leave or enter the Gaza Strip, from September to
November.
Blockades and stringent restrictions imposed by the
IsraelI army throughout the West Bank continued to
hInder or prevent Palestinians' access to their
agricultural land, workplaces and education and health
facilities. The Israeli army also carried out frequent
raids into Palestinian towns and villages and stepped
up its construction of a 600km fence/wa l l and major
checkpoints throughout the West Bank, includIng in the
East Jerusalem area, cutting off towns and villages from
one another. Such restrictions continued to prevent
economic recovery and caused high unemployment
and extreme poverty in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where more than half of Palestinians were obliged to
rely on international aid for subsistence.
Municipal elections, which began the previous year,
were held in several locations in the West Bank and
Gaza StrIp. Parliamentary elections, scheduled for July,
were postponed to January 2006.
I ncreased lawlessness and impunity
The PA took some steps to reform its security services,
which had been repeatedly targeted and largely
destroyed by the Israeli army in previous years. In
April President Abbas replaced some security forces'
chiefs, but the securIty and judicial institutions
remained dysfunctional, beset by factional fighting
and power struggles, and unable or unwilling to
restore law and order. Rare attempts by security
forces to confront political and criminal armed groups

204

invariably resulted in armed clashes, with the security
forces often being forced to retreat. Several PA
officials were attacked by armed groups. I n other
cases PA security forces' members participated in
attacks and abuses alongside armed groups. Some
armed groups and security forces' members used the
call for PA reforms and accountabi lity to justify their
own attacks and abuses. The Israeli army continued to
prevent PA security forces from operating in much of
the West Bank, including by refusing to a l low them to
be present or to carry weapons in many areas. Faced
with PA security forces and judicial institutions
perceived as powerless or unwi l l to address their
grievances, many people sought the protection or
mediation of armed groups to resolve their problems.
The prol iferation of armed groups, the absence of the
rule of law and systematic impunity compounded the
atmosphere of insecurity. Scores of bystanders,
Including children, were killed and injured in clashes
between armed groups and securi ty forces, and by
reckless use by Palestinian armed groups of weapons
and explosive devices. Palestinian mortars aimed at
nearby Israeli towns often missed their targets and
landed in Palestinian residential areas in the Gaza Strip.
Armed groups continued to use children to carry out
attacks and transport explosives or weapons. Several
Palestinian children were arrested by the Israeli army
for their alleged involvement in such activities. The
main armed groups reportedly disavowed the use of
children and some blamed such abuses on local cells
acting on their own initiative.
a On 2 October, two bystanders, a PA police chief and
a security forces' member were killed during armed
clashes between PA forces and Hamas gunmen in Gaza
City and in an attack by a previously unknown armed
group, the Popular Army, in the southern Gaza Strip
town of Khan Younis. Armed clashes broke out when PA
security forces attempted to enforce a PA-imposed ban
on armed groups carrying weapons in populated areas.
Several bystanders and dozens of Hamas supporters
and PA security forces' members were also wounded in
the clashes.

Abductions
More than 20 Palestinians and foreign nationals,
including journalists and aid workers, were abducted in
the Gaza Strip by Palestinian armed groups. I n many
cases the groups demanded jobs or protested against
PA poliCies or actions. Those abducted were generally
released unharmed within hours.
a Two staff members of the UN Development
Programme (UNDP) were abducted in Gaza City on
29 July by relatives of a senior member of the PA
Intelligence, who had been abducted the previous day
by gunmen affiliated to Fatah. The three were
released unharmed by their respective kidnappers a
few hours later.
a On 8 August gunmen abducted three staff members
of the UN Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) in Khan
Younis. The three were released after a few hours. The
gunmen demanded the release of a Fatah official
detained the previous day by PA security forces.

Well over 100 Palestinians were killed in political inter­

Death penalty
In June President Abbas authorized the execution of
four prisoners who had been convicted of murder
between 1995 and 2000. These were the first executions
to be carried out by the PA since August 2002. A fifth
execution was carried out in July. At the end of June.

detainees continued to be held for prolonged periods
without trial or beyond expiry of their sentences.

Law a nd order problems continued to impact on the
enjoyment of fu ndamental rights a nd access to basic
services. Police proved unable or u nwilling to prevent
or effectively investigate most i ncidents of violence
in the home a nd general community. Public
confidence in the police was further undermined by
numerous allegations of police a buses, including
torture. Women a nd children were particula rly
vulnerable to violence.
Background
Celebrations in September to mark 30 years of
independence were tempered by concerns over the
development challenges facing the country. Access to
basic services remained poor. literacy rates were low.
and corruption was endemic. The H IV /A I DS epidemic
posed a major threat to growth and stabi lity.

law and order problems
Although police reported a decrease in the crime rate
relative to 2004, the number of reported crimes, including
rapes and murders, remained high. Port Moresby and the
Western Highlands were worst affected. The resultant
fear, especially among women, restricted freedom of
movement and limited access to basic services.
Police were general ly ineffective in addressing crime
and often cited resource constraints for their failure to
Investigate complaints properly. Escapes from police
custody and prisons were common. In January and
February alone, 131 prISoners escaped in three separate
mass breakouts.
Conflict over land and resources often fuelled
violence. Tribal fighting was reported in at least six
provinces and resulted in deaths, destruction of
property and displacement.
I n response to growing concern over the use of
il legal firearms, many originating from police, military
and corrective services armounes, the government
conducted a public awareness campaign and held a
summit in June. A report recommending a series of
legislative and policy reforms was presented to
government in November.
Australian police deployed under a 2004 bilateral
agreement were withdrawn in May when the Supreme
Court ruled that laws granting them immunity from
prosecution were unconstitutional. Plans were agreed
for a smaller contingent to return with a more limited
mandate.
Violations by the police
I n response to reports that police continued to use
excessive force during arrests, and engaged in torture,
including rape, against suspects, both the Internal
Security Minister and Police Commissioner conceded
that police brutality occurred. The M inister promised
reform, while the Commissioner cited figures
demonstrating that officers were disciplined when
complaints could be substantiated. Nonetheless, there
was little public confidence in existing accountability
mechanisms, which lacked independence and
transparency and had failed to deter police violence.
a In November at least one person was killed and at
least 18 students were injured when police opened fire
on students at a school near Porgera. Police were
reportedly at the school to arrest the headmaster when
students began to throw stones. A criminal
investigation into the shootings was initiated.
a No police officers were known to have faced
criminal proceedings for their role in the rape and
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of women and
girls arrested during a raid on Three Mile Guest House
in Port Moresby in March 2004.
Violence agai nst women
I n formation gathered from women's organizations,
hospitals and police indicated that domestic violence
206

and rape were widespread. Counselling and health care
facilities for victims of violence, particularly outside
major towns, were generally non-existent. The
widespread violence exacerbated women's
vulnerabi lity to H I V/A I DS.
Weaknesses in the formal justice sector and male­
dominated "traditional" justice mechanisms severely
limited women's access to redress. Only a small
percentage of cases of violence against women
progressed through the formal justice system. Most
incidents, including gang-rapes, were not reported or
investigated and many were resolved privately with the
payment of compensation to the victim's family.

subsequently released and a judiCial investigation was
opened into the incident.
\":] Two Roman Catholic nuns -Juana Antonia Barua
and Clara Nimia Insaurralde - and a community leader,
Jose Bord6n, received death threats in August. The
threats were apparently linked to their work in
Naranjito, San Pedro Department, promoting peasant
farmers' rights and environmental concerns.
In June the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
ruled in favour of the Yakye Axa indigenous community,
which had been expelled from its ancestral lands. The
Court ordered the Paraguayan state to demarcate the
ancestral territory of the Yakye Axa community and
hand it back within three years.

Abuses aga inst children
The UN Special Rapporteur on the sale of chi ldren,
child prostitution and child pornography, who had
visited Paraguay in 2004, cal led for more intensive
efforts to protect children, including stronger
legi slation, action against police corruption, cross­
border co-operation, the segregation of young people
from adults in prisons, programmes to reduce poverty
and social exclusion, and the eradication of the
practice of using children to perform domestic tasks
in exchange for board, lodging or a basic education.
In the area near the border with Brazil and Argentina
the government set up a new office to combat the
sexual exploitation of chi ldren, including sex
trafficking.
\":] The case of a servant girl who had reportedly been
phySically and sexually abused by her employer from
the age of 12 was one of the few cases of child abuse to
reach the courts. However, although legal complaints
were filed in 2002, no judge had been appointed to hear
the case by the end of 2005 .
Prison conditions and ill-treatment
Reports indicated that prisons were grossly
overcrowded, with inadequate sanitation, medical
facilities and education and rehabilitation activities.
There were reports that inmates, including juveniles,
were ill-treated.
\":] In May, 30 juveniles held in the regional
penitentiary of Ciudad del Este began a hunger strike
in protest a t an al leged assault by a prison guard on a
17-year-old inmate. After police restored order, a
forensic doctor reported that two juveniles had
sustained injuries.
UN Human Rights Committee
In October the UN Human Rights Committee made a
number of recommendations including that the
authorities take appropriate measures to combat
domestic violence and ensure that those responsible
are brought to trial and receive an appropriate
punishment. It also called for the conscription of child
soldiers to be eradicated and for all complaints of i 11 treatment a n d deaths of conscripts t o b e investigated

Some of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's
recommendations were implemented, but progress
on bringing perpetrators to justice remained slow.
Human rights defenders, prosecutors a nd witnesses
were subjected to threats and attacks. Military and
police officers accused of torture a nd ill-treatment
continued to be charged with lesser offences. There
were concerns a bout access to health care, especially
for low-income fa mil ies.
Background
2005 saw social unrest and increasing demands for
better living and working conditions. A 30-day state of
emergency was declared in Apurimac department after
a group of former army reservists calling for the
resignation of PreSident Toledo seized a police station
in Andahuaylas. Four police officers held as hostages
and one reservist were reportedly killed. There were
reports of violent clashes with security forces and the
possible use of excessive force by police and military
during protests against mining projects in Piura and
Huaraz departments.
Small cells of the armed opposition group Shining
Path (Sendero Luminoso) reportedly continued to
operate in some areas in Hual laga, Huanuco
department, Ayacucho department, and Satipo, Junin
department. Shining Path's leaders, who had been tried
in military courts in the 1990s, were put on trial again,
this time in civil courts.
In November, former PreSident Alberto Fujimori,
who was accused of human rights violations, was
detained while in Chile pending an extradition request
from the Peruvian authorities.
Draft legislation to reform the military and police
justice systems failed to comply with a 2004 ruling by
207

PER

the Constitutional Court. The draft law did not define
the term offences "committed in the line of duty' or
I ntegrate military and police courts Into the civilian
judicial system.
A permanent Human Rights Ombudsman was
appointed by Congress, four years after the last
permanent post-holder left office.
In December, the first ever National Human Rights
Plan was agreed. However, there were concerns that
the plan, which covers the period 2006 to 2010, does
not address discrimination on the basis of sexual
identity or orientation.

Past human rights violations
The government failed to fulfil the commitment made
in 2001 to comply with recommendations of the lnter­
American Commission on Human Rights regarding 1 65
cases of human rights violations. The recommendations
Included establishing the truth, bringing those
responsible to justice and compensating victims and
their relatives.
Congress passed legislation establishing a
Comprehensive Reparations Plan and a single register
of people whose human rights had been violated during
the internal armed conflict. President Alejandro Toledo
made a commitment to fund collective reparations and
to consider individual reparations. Remembrance
events and memorials were organized to mark the
second anniversary of the publication of the Final
Report of the Truth and Reconcil iation Commission
(TRC). I nvestigations were opened into 26 of the 59
cases of human rights Violations documented by the
TRC and the Ombudsman's Office. Some trials began
during 2005, but no cases had been resolved by the end
of the year. There were concerns that detention orders
against military and police officers accused of past
human rights violations were not being enforced. Some
of these cases continued to be tried in military courts.
In some cases, the M inistry of Defence had reportedly
not co-operated with civilian courts investigating
military officers accused of past violations.

Threats and intimidation
Local human rights organizations registered 46 cases
of threats and intimidation of human rights defenders,
witnesses, victims and their relatives, judges,
prosecutors and forensic experts involved in the
Investigation and trial of past human rights violations
documented by the TRC. According to an
Ombudsman's report, those who were threatened and
i ntimidated had been provided with inadequate or no
protection at a l l .

The legacy of the counter-insurgency
Three prisoners of conscience were released, but
there were concerns that dozens of prisoners of
conscience and possible prisoners of conscience
unfairly charged with terrorism-related offences
remained in jail.

Torture a nd ill-treatment
There were reports of torture and ill-treatment of
detainees by members of the police and of military
officers and conscripts by higher-ranking officers.
208

Legislation introduced in 1 998 to criminalize torture
remained largely ineffective and suspected
perpetrators continued to be charged with lesser
offences.

Prison conditions
In February, the government stated that the national
prison system was in crisis because of overcrowding,
inadequate infrastructure and insufficient staff to
guarantee security. The government announced
increased funding, up to 400 new prison staff, the
opening of a new prison and construction of two more
in Lima department, and the enlargement of other
centres in lca and Piura departments.
Following sustained national and international
pressure, all inmates at Challapalca prison, located
more than 4,600m above sea level in an extremely
isolated area, were transferred to other prisons.
Violence aga inst women
The Ombudsman expressed concern that the legislation
prohibiting violence against women was still not being
implemented by some police officers and judges and
that only a small number of perpetrators had been
convicted. Delays in the investigation and trial of these
cases was also a concern.
Women's organizations expressed concerns about
the lack of resources provided to the Human Rights
Prosecutor's Office investigating forced sterilizations
under the former government of Alberto Fujimori.
Economic, social and cultura l rights
The World Health Organization reported that maternity
and child mortality rates remained high. Despite legal
provisions on the right to health and measures taken in
recent years to improve access to free maternity and
child health care for people on low income, there were
concerns that this was not reaching people in the most
vulnerable communities.
According to a report by the Ombudsman, more than
25 per cent of people lacked adequate access to
drinking water; in rural areas this rose to 38 per cent.

REPUBLIC OFTHE PH ILIPPIN ES
Head of state and government: Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo

Death penalty: retentionist
International Criminal Court: signed
UN Women's Convention and its Optional Protocol:
ratified

Scores of leftist activists were killed by unidentified
assa ila nts, often reportedly linked to the a rmed
forces. Peace ta lks between the government and
armed groups - M uslim separatists in Mindanao and
communist rebels - made limited or no progress.
Arbitrary a rrests, u nlawful killings, torture and
"disa ppea rances" were reported in the context of
military cou nter-insurgency operations. Armed
groups were responsible for a buses including
hostage-ta king. Complaints procedures,
investigations and criminal prosecutions of
suspected perpetrators of human rights violations
were often ineffective. Cri minal suspects in custody,
i ncluding women a nd children, were at risk of torture
or il l·treatment by police. Death sentences were
imposed but no executions were carried out.
Background
I n june, al legations that President Arroyo was linked to
vote-rigging and corruption during the 2004 elections
heightened political tensions. I n j u ly, amid calls for
mass publiC protests, 10 members of her Cabinet
resigned. President Arroyo denied the allegations and,
responding to the crisis, called for constitutional
reforms including change from a presidential to a
federal parliamentary system. In September an
opposition motion to impeach the President was
defeated in Congress.
Communist i nsurgency and the peace process
Peace talks between the government and the National
Democratic Front (NDF), representing the Communist
Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the
New People's Army (NPA), remained suspended. In
order to resume talks, the NDF called on the
government to work for the removal of the NPA's
designation as a "Foreign Terrorist Organization" by the
USA and its allies. With the peace process stalled, the
joint Monitoring Commission (jMC), set up to examine
complaints of human rights abuses and breaches of
humanitarian laws by both sides, failed to make
significant progress. Previous government pledges to
release listed political prisoners remained only
partially implemented. At least 251 political prisoners
detained within the context of anti-insurgency
operations were reported sti l l held.
N PA attacks on government targets and clashes
between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and
N PA units continued throughout 2005. Suspected N PA

members and their supporters were subjected to
arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and
"disappearances".
a In March, Angelina Bisuna Ipong, a 60-year-old
woman, was abducted by armed men wearing face
masks in M isamis Occldental province, M indanao.
Blindfolded and transferred between military camps,
she was held incommunicado for eight days. She
complained of torture and ill-treatment during
interrogation, including sexual abuse and physical
assaults. She was charged after reportedly being forced
to admit being a senior regional CPP leader.
a In April , four farmers in Compostela Valley
province, Mindanao - Adreano and joseph Otida,
Malaquias Sampan and Joshua Bustillo - were arrested
by the AFP and reportedly accused of being N PA
members. Their complaints of torture during military
detention included being punched, kicked in the face,
chest and abdomen, and hit with rifles and stones.
a I n j une, Elmer Osila, a senior N PA member, was
arrested by soldiers at a checkpoint in Albay province,
Luzon. He reported being tortured during
interrogation, including by suffocation with a plastic
bag and electric shocks. Three days after his arrest,
investigators from the Philippine Commission on
Human Rights recorded marks conSIStent with torture
on his body.

Increased killings of leftist activists
The number of attacks on leftist activists and
community workers rose sharply, with at least 66 fatal
shootings reported during 2005. Most of the attacks
were carried out by unidentified assailants on
motorcycles, at times wearing face masks, who were
often described as "vigilantes" or hired killers allegedly
linked to AFP members.
As wel l as suspected CPP-NPA members, those most
at risk included members of legal leftist political
parties, including Bayan Muna (People First) and
Anakpawis (Toiling Masses), other human rights and
community activists, priests, church workers and
lawyers regarded by the authorities as sympathetic to
the broader communist movement. Increased killings
in particular provinces were reportedly linked to the
public label ling of leftist groups as N PA "front"
organizations by local AFP commanders.
A climate of impunity shielding the perpetrators of
such killings deepened as ineffective investigations
failed to lead to the prosecution of those responsible.
I n many cases witnesses were reportedly too
frightened to testify.
a In March, Felidito Dacut, a lawyer and a Bayan
Muna regional coordinator, was shot dead by two
unidentified men on a motorbike in Tacloban City,
Leyte.
a In May, Reverend Edison Lapuz, a Church minister
and a Bayan Muna member, was shot dead by
unidentified men in San Isidro, Leyte. He had
participated in a fact-finding mission into the killing
of Felidito Dacut.
At least 25 alleged "disappearances" of leftists and
others were a Iso reported.

Mindanao peace process
Despite periodic breaches, the ceasefire agreement
between the government and the Muslim secessionist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MI LF), monitored by
military observers from Malaysia and Brunei, was
maintained in M indanao. I ntermittent informal peace
talks continued.
In August, the M I LF boycotted local elections for the
five-province Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao
(ARM M), set up in 1996 following a peace agreement
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
Former M N LF members and members of the Muslim
separatist armed group Abu Sayyaf were reportedly
involved in periodic clashes with the AFP Fighting on
jolo island in February led to the displacement of over
25,000 civilians.
Reports indicated that Abu Sayaff and renegade
M N LF and M ILF members were involved in kidnappings
for ransom.
Administration of justice
Public confidence in the ability of the authorities to
conduct prompt, thorough and impartial investigations
of human rights violations and other crimes, and to
deliver justice, remained fragile.
I mplementation of fair trial and custodial
safeguards remained weak, and criminal suspects
were at risk of ill-treatment or torture by the
Phil ippine National Police (PNP) during extended
periods of " investigative" detention. I ntimidation,
aggravated by a lack of effective witness protection
programmes, undermined the ability of victims of
human rights abuses to gai n redress, especially when
they were members of poor or marginalized
communities.
Lack of confidence in the criminal justice system
contributed to an apparent public tolerance of killings
of suspected criminals, including al leged petty thieves
and street-children, by unidentified "vigilantes"
a llegedly linked to municipal authorities and the PNP.
More than 90 such killings were reported in Cebu city
and at least 100 in Davao city.
journalists were also at risk of armed attacks with at
least seven killed by unidentified assailants, reportedly
because of their work. In November, in a rare
conviction, a policeman was found guilty and given a
life sentence for murdering a radio broadcaster in 2002.
Despite an array of legislative and procedural
safeguards, minors in detention continued to be at risk
of physical or sexual abuse and poor prison conditions.
Children were at times detained with adults in
overcrowded facilities and exposed to abuse from
other pnsoners.
I nhumane prison conditions also affected adult male
and female prisoners and incidents of excessive use of
force by the authorities were reported.
a In March, 26 prisoners, mostly members of Muslim
armed groups, were killed as police stormed the Bagong
Diwa pnson, Bicutan, after an escape attempt and
prison revolt. Prisoners were reportedly shot after
attempting to surrender. Three prison wardens and a
police officer were also killed.

Death pena lty
Amid continuing concerns about failures to uphold fair
trial standards, death sentences were imposed
throughout 2005. A total of 1,214 inmates were under
sentence of death at the end of 2005. No executions
took place as PreSident Arroyo continued to issue a
series of reprieves for prisoners whose sentences had
been confirmed by the Supreme Court and were facing
imminent execution. Bills calling for the repeal of death
penalty legislation were conSidered by Congressional
committees.
Despite continuing reviews of their sentences by the
lower courts, at least 22 young offenders remained
under sentence of death for offences committed when
they were under the age of 18, even though the law
makes clear that child offenders cannot be sentenced
to death or executed.

Racism and intolerance towards minorities was
reported in both the private and public spheres. No
action was taken aga inst public figu res whose
statements appeared to incite intolerance. Police
reportedly used excessive force agai nst non-violent
demonstrators.
Background
2005 was a year of significant political changes. After
general elections in September and a presidential
election in October, the Law and justice party (Prawo i
Sprawiedliwosc, PiS) came to power. Before the
elections, the PiS criticized gay rights campaigners and
expressed support for the death penalty. Following
Lech Kaczynski's election as President, the European
Commission issued a formal warning to Poland, saying
Amnesty International Report 2006

PO R

that it could lose its European Union (EU) voting rights
if the President continued to oppose gay rights and
sought to introduce the death penalty.
One of the first decisions of the new government was
to abolish the Office for Gender Equality, making
Poland the only EU country without a statutory equality
watchdog.

Identity-based discri mination
Members of sexual minorities continued to face
discrimination and restrictions on their right to
freedom of expression and assembly. In june, Lech
Kaczynski, then mayor of Warsaw, refused for the
second year to authorize the Equality Parade, holding
that such an event would be 'sexual ly obscene" and
offensive to other people's religious feelings. An
improvised parade still took place on 10 june, gathering
more than 2,500 participants. Less than a week later,
the mayor authorized the so-called Normality Parade,
allowing an extremist homophobic grouping known as
All Polish Youth (Mlodziei Wszechpolska) to mobilize
on the streets of Warsaw.
In November the mayor of Poznan banned a gay
parade, ostensibly because of security concerns.
However, the parade's organizers claimed that the
Poznan municipality had earlier indicated that there
were no reasons to ban the parade, and that the mayor
had given in to the demands of the conservative
political parties Law and justice and the League of
Polish Families (Liga Polskich Rodzin). An unauthorized
parade which took place on 19 November was met with
physical attacks and verbal abuse from members of All
Polish Youth. As a protest, demonstrations in support
of tolerance and equality took place throughout Poland
on 27 November. In December an administrative court
in Poznan annulled the authorities' decision to ban the
parade.
There was no action against public statements
inciting intolerance against sexual minorities, such as
that made by a then Member of the European
Parliament from the League of Polish Families: "After
the elections, we will illegalize all homosexual
organizations and we will attack paedophiles who are
statistically the most numerous among them."
Racism
I n its third report on Poland, released in june, the
European Commission against Racism and I ntolerance
(ECR!) expressed concern that the authorities rarely
investigated and prosecuted cases of racial hatred, and
allowed anti-Semitic material to freely circulate on the
market. ECRI pointed out that in investigating violent
attacks against ethnic minorities, such as Roma or
migrants, the police often did not take into account the
racist motivation of crimes, which resulted in a lighter
sentence for the perpetrator, if convicted. Moreover,
there was still no comprehensive body of legislation
prohibiting racial discrimination in all fields of life.

Reports of ill-treatment by police officers continued
to give rise to concern a bout Portugal's fa ilure to
comply with international law and standards. Law
enforcement training in the use of force and firearms
and operational guidelines reportedly continued to
be insufficient. At least 33 women were reported to
have been kil led as a result of violence against
women in the family.
Pol icing concerns
Ill-treatment by police officers continued to be
reported, including one case in which a man
subsequently died in police custody.
D In March, jose Reis was arrested for caUSing a
publiC disturbance in the city of Lagos. A witness
reported seeing six or seven policemen beating him at
the time of his arrest. He was taken to the local police
station at around 4am, and was found hanging in his
cell, dead, at 5.20am. The coroner's report concluded
his death was suiCide, but the judiciary Police and the
General I nspectorate of the Internal Administration
(IGA!), the Interior Ministry's police oversight body,
opened investigations into the circumstances of his
death.
Training and operational guidelines for the police,
including in the use of force and firearms, reportedly
remained inadequate. Officers reportedly received
initial training in the use of firearms, and could then
have further training only once every three to four
years.
At least three people died as a result of lethal force
during the year, again raising long-standing concerns
about the possible unnecessary or disproportionate
use of force.
D In March an unnamed 48-year-old man was shot
dead by a member of the Republican National Guard
(Guarda Nacional Republicana, G N R). An officer
reportedly fired shots at the man's vehicle after he
allegedly stole petrol, tried to get away and hit an
officer with his car, causing him minor injuries. An
investigation into the killing was opened, but the
officer concerned was not suspended from duty.
D Also in March, joao Martins, aged 17, was fatally
wounded when a GNR officer fired at his car during a
police chase. The bullet passed through the car, hitting
him in the chest. No offiCial investigation was known to
have been carried out into the killing.

Violence against women in the family remained a major
concern, despite Portugal's record since 1990 of
specific legislation, amendments to the penal codes
and national plans against domestic violence to
prevent and punish acts of violence against women,
and to provide support and redress to the victims.
Thirty-three women were reported to have been

agents of prominent independen ce activist Fihberto
Ojeda Rios In September. A member of the nationalist
group ·Los Macheteros· (Cane Cutters) accused of

Up to 6,000 members of a Qatari tribe were
arbitrarily deprived of Qatari nationality. Women
faced discrimination under a range of laws a nd
practices. At least 1 9 people remained under
sentence of death.
Background
A new Constitution, which came into force in june,
provides for hereditary rule by the AI-Thani family
through the male line and contains various human
rights guarantees, including some that continued to
be ignored in practice.
One man was kil led and at least 12 people were

the AI-Murra tribe were deprived of Oatari nationality
between October 2004 and june 2005 on grounds,
believed to be spurious, that they were nationals of
other countries. Some were reportedly forced to leave
Oatar to seek resettlement in neighbouring countries,
or detained to induce them to do so, despite guarantees
in the new Constitution against the deportation of
Oatari nationals.

religion". In practice, however, women remained
subject to gender discrimination under a range of laws
and practices, such as laws concerning marriage
contracts that favour men. Women must also obtain
approval from their husband or guardian before
travel ling, and children of Oatari women who marry
foreign nationals do not qualify for Oatari citizenship,
unlike children born to Oatari fathers and foreign
mothers.
a Hamda Fahad Jassem Ali AI-Thani, a member of the
ruling fami ly, was reportedly confined to her home in
Doha because her father disapproved of her choice of
husband, and ill-treated. She was al legedly abducted
from Egypt and forcibly returned to Oatar by Oatari
security officials in November 2002. She was detained
in secret in Doha for five months until April 2003, and
then transferred to the offices of the state's Special

The situation in mental health institutions remained

institutions were not investigated effectively a nd

and transgender ( LGBn community experienced
discrimination a nd intolerance.
Background
The European Commission noted in October that
Romania had made progress towards greater respect
for human rights in an attempt to meet the criteria for
membership of the European Union, accession to which
is scheduled for 2007. The Commission said that steps
had been taken to ensure the independence of the
judiciary, guarantee greater media freedom and
promote the rights of the child. It said further efforts
were needed to combat ill-treatment in police custody,
prevent trafficking in human beings and ensure the
effective integration of the Roma minority with regard
to their economic and social rights.
Roma and racism
Discrimination against Roma continued despite
Romania's commitment to the Decade of Roma Inclusion,
a campaign to eliminate marginalization of Roma that
started in 2005. According to the Open Society
Foundation, which works to promote human rights, 75
per cent of Romanians do not want to live near Roma.
In July, the European Court of Human Rights ruled on
the Hlldllreni case, an incident in 1 993 when three Roma
were killed and more than 170 others were forced to
abandon their homes in the town of Hlldllreni and flee
after a night of racial violence. Following a row
between three Roma men and another villager, in
which one ethnic Romanian was killed, a crowd of
Romanians and ethnic Hungarians had vandalized 1 4
Romani houses beyond repair. Following the attack, the
concerned Roma families were forced to live in
degrading conditions as the government failed to
provide them with adequate remedies.
The European Court of Human Rights found Romania
in violation of numerous provisions of the European
Convention on Human Rights, including the right to a
fair hearing, the right to respect for family and private
life, and the right not to be discriminated against. The
Court obliged Romania to pay compensation to the
Roma affected by the 1993 attacks.

In August a court in Romania moved to comply with
the ruling, orderIng the seizure of property from
perpetrators of the Hadareni attacks to finance
compensation for the victims. After police arrived in
Hadarenl to execute the court ruling, there was an
outpourIng of racist speech directed at Roma by the
media and politicians.
There was an Increase In raCist remarks In the
Romanian media. The Mayor of the southern city of
CraiOva was fined twice by the National Council for
Combating DIscrImination for expressing racist views in
public. Although he was made to resign as vlce­
president of the Social Democrats, a national political
party, he remained the Mayor of Craiova.
The procedural rules for the government's National
Council for Combating Discrimination, did not allow for
a speedy, Independent investigation of complaints that
would provide effective and proportionate remedies
for victims of discrimination. Public debate to change
the rules to make the work of the Council more effective
was ongoing.
A draft law on national minorIties adopted by the
government In May was rejected by parliament In
October. The law aimed to prevent discrimination
against all minorIties In Romania, and guarantee the
rIght to cultural autonomy, religious freedom, freedom
of expression, and the right to use minorIty languages.
The law was supported by the Hungarian and Romani
minorities in Romania.

Concerns a bout mental health care
Following the tragedy In POIana Mare psychiatrIC
hospital In 2004 when 17 patients died of malnutrItion
and hypothermia, the prosecutor i nitiated CrIminal
investigations Into the events. Having found "no causal
link" between the deaths and the Involvement of staff,
the prosecutor closed the investigations In February
2005. After campaigning by local and international
human rIghts organizations, the Investigation was
reportedly reopened in August. I n November the
Minister of Health announced a plan to close down
POIana Mare hospital and transfer ItS patients to more
appropriate and centrally located institutions.
In February the UN Special Rapporteur on the right of
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of physical and mental health released a
report on Romania. He stressed that "the enjoyment of
the rIght to mental health care remains more of an
aspiration rather than a reality for many people with
mental disabilities in Romania." The Rapporteur
recommended that an independent mental health
commissioner be established urgently.

cases the authorities said that the children either
inflicted the Injuries on themselves or had the Injuries
prior to their arrest. Such claims contradicted the
victims' statements.

lGBT community under attack
Although homosexuali ty was decrIminalized in 200 1 ,
reportedly more than 4 0 per cent of the population
continued to believe that homosexual s should be
removed from the country. The GayFest parade on 28
May was opposed by the Orthodox Church and the local
authorities. The municipal authOrIties of Bucharest,
who initially agreed to provide logistical support for the
march, later withdrew this offer. They said they could
not provide enough cover to keep people safe and that
the time of the parade was inappropriate. Authorization
for the parade was finally granted after the President of
Romania intervened in an emergency meeting with the
Mayor of Bucharest. The parade subsequen tly passed
without incident.
In February the non-gover nmental organizatio ns
(NGOs) Accept and the Centre for Legal Resources won
a case against the state-owned airline TAROM which
il legally excluded a homosexua l couple from a
Valentine's Day sale. The National Council for
Combating Discrimina    declared that TAROM had
been "restricting the free access, under equal
conditions , to public services and places" and ordered
TAROM to pay a US$180 fine, which it did Without delay.
Following the decision, the NGOs filed an
administra tive complaint against the fine, which they
believed was nominal and not sufficient to have a
dissuasive effect against further such actions. HaVing
lost the administr ative appeal , the NGOs were
preparIng a court appeal at the end of the year.

Inadequate investigations of ill-treatment

Hostility towa rds human rights defenders increased
and some were prosecuted for their peaceful exercise
of the right to freedom of expression. Racist attacks,
some ofthem fatal, continued, despite a small
increase in convictions for racially motivated crimes.
Domestic violence was widespread a nd the state
failed to provide adequate protection. Prisoners
conducted mass protests a bout ill-treatment in prison
colonies. Serious human rights abuses including
"disappea rances" a nd abductions, torture, killings and
a rbitrary detention continued in the context of the
conflict in Chechnya. lmpunity remained the norm for
those committing human rights violations. People
seeking justice faced intimidation and death threats;
some were killed or "disappeared".
Background
There were mass protests across the country at the
beginning of the year against social welfare reform. I n
September the U N Committee o n the Rights o f the Child
highlighted a wide range of concerns relating to
children in Russia. In November the Federal Migration
Service announced their intention in 2006 to grant
amnesties and give work permits to around I million
migrant workers from former Soviet countries working
in Russia without official permission. In Chechnya,
separatist leader Asian Maskhadov was kil led in the
vil lage ofTolstoi-Yurt on 8 March, during an operation
by federal security forces. According to official
i nformation, these forces had attempted to detain him
but he had refused to surrender. Chechen
parliamentary elections were held in November in
which the pro-Kremlin United Russia party gained over
60 per cent of the vote. A Council of Europe
representative stated that the elections took place in
an "atmosphere of fear" and Russian and international
human rights groups declared that free and fair
elections had not been possible given the security
situation and the c limate of impunity in Chechnya.
Conflict in the North Caucasus
Serious human rights violations, including war crimes.
continued to be committed in Chechnya by Chechen
and federal forces. Chechen security forces under the
command of Ramzan Kadyrov, the First Deputy Prime
Minister of Chechnya, and divisions of federal forces

staffed b y ethnic Chechens were increasingly
implicated in arbitrary detention, torture and
"disappearances" in Chechnya. High-level officials,
including the President of Chechnya, Alu Alkhanov,
were reported to have admitted to the involvement of
federal and Chechen forces in "disappearances" In
Chechnya. People were also held incommunicado.
sometimes in unacknowledged detention centres.
Relatives of "disappeared" people demonstrated in
Chechnya for information about the fate of their loved
ones. Reportedly. women continued to be subjected to
gender-based violence, including rape and threats of
rape. by members of the federal and Chechen security
forces. Chechen armed opposition groups reportedly
committed war crimes including direct attacks on
Civilians.
There was violence and unrest in other North
Caucasus republics, increasingly accompanied by
reports of human rights abuses such as arbitrary
detention, torture. "disappearances" and abductions.
Over 30,000 people remained internally displaced by
the Chechen conflict in neighbouring regions of the
north Caucasus, in particular in I ngushetia and
Dagestan. Conditions in camps inushetia varied but
were generally cramped and unsuitable. There
remained other displaced populations in the North
Caucasus from other conflicts.
a In June, 11 men "disappeared" and at least one, 77year-old Magomaz Magomazov, was reportedly killed
during a raid, allegedly by the Vostok (East) battalion of
the RUSSian federal forces, on the village of
Borozdinovskaia, Chechnya. The raid prompted a mass
exodus over the border to neighbouring Dagestan of
around 1 , 000 villagers. One member of the Vostok
battalion was convicted of "exceeding official
authority", and given a three-year suspended sentence
in October.
a In March security forces carried out a passport
check in a district of Nazran, I ngushetia. The following
day a group of armed men in camouflage and wearing
masks reportedly returned to the district and searched
the family home o f Vakha Matuev and took him away.
His wife told AI in September that the authorities in
Ingushetia had not opened a criminal investigation and
that she had not received any information as to the
whereabouts of her husband.
a Adam Gorchkhanov was reportedly detained at his
home in the Republic of I ngushetia on 23 May by
unidentified security services and taken away. He was
reportedly detained in a pre-trial detention centre and
the headquarters of the Regional Organized Crime
Squad in Vladikavkaz. North Ossetia, before being
transferred to a hospital in Vladikavkaz with a serious
head injury. He died in hospital on 30 May 2005. His
medical certificate gave the cause of death as having
"jumped from the third floor". According to a relative,
by September there had been no further investigation
into Adam Gorchkhanov's death as the cause of death

Impunity

AI was aware of only two conviction s during 2005 for
serious human rights violations committed i n
Chechnya. The majority of investigati ons into alleged
violations were meffective and the prosecutio n of the
handful of cases that came to court was flawed.
Applicants to the European Court of Human Rights
faced serious reprisals including intimidation . death
threats. killing and "disappearan ce".
a In March a court in the Chechen capital. Grozny.
found Sergei Lapin. a member of a special federal police
unit (OM ON). guilty of torturing Zelimkhan Murdalov.
and sentenced him to 1 1 years' imprisonmen t.
Zelimkhan Murdalov had been detamed by police
officers in Grozny in January 2001 and subsequently
"disappeared". In November a criminal case was
opened against the OMON Unit commander and his
deputy who were implicated i n Zelimkhan Murdalov's
torture and "disappearance". together with Sergei
Lapm. The whereabouts and fate of Zelimkhan
Murdalov remained unknown.
A In May. a court in Rostov-on-Don found four
members of a special Russian military intelligence unit
not guilty for a second time of the murder of six
CIVilians from Dai Village. Chechnya. Although the four
admitted to the killings. the court ruled that their
actions were not punishable as they had been following
orders. This decision. like the prevIous acquittal in April
2004. was widely critiCized and subsequently quashed
by the M i litary Collegiate of the Russian Supreme Court
m August 2005. A third trial started in November.

Council of Europe
In February the European Court of Human Rights
released its judgments in the first Six cases from the
Chechen Republic to reach the Court. The Court ruled
that in these cases the Russian government had
violated the right to l i fe. the prohibition of torture. the
rights to an effective remedy and the peaceful
enjoyment of possessions. The cases brought by the
European Human Rights Advocacy Centre concerned
the Russian federal forces' indiscriminate aerial
bombing of a Civilian convoy of refugees f1eemg Grozny
m October 1999; the "disappearance" and subsequent
extrajudicial execution of five indiViduals m Grozny in
January 2000; and the indiscriminate aerial and
artil lery bombardment of the village of Katyr-Yurt in
February 2000.
In June. the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe (PACE) examined Russia's progress in honouring
the obligations and commitments i t undertook on
joining the Council of Europe in 1996. PACE passed a
resolution which stated that while RUSSia had made
progress i n some areas of human rights. there had been
very l i ttle progress in relation to the obligation to bring
to justice those responsible for human rights violations.
notably in relation to events i n Chechnya. The
resolution called on the Russian authorities to "take
effective action to put an immediate end to the ongoing
'disappearances'. torture. arbitrary detentions.
incommunicado detention in i l legal and secret
detention facilities. and unlawful kil l i ngs" reported in
Chechnya. The resolution also highlighted the lack of
progress on the commitment formally to abolish the
death penalty and to withdraw Russian troops from
Moldova.

Violence against women
According to the RUSSian governmental newspaper
Rossiiskaia Gazeta up to 80 per cent of a l l violent
crimes in RUSSia were committed in the private sphere.
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remained
concerned that women were the main victims of such
Violence. While no offiCial statistics were available
independent research showed that about 70 per ce t of
married women had been subjected to some form of
Violence from their husbands. There were no measures
under RUSSian law which speCifically addressed
Violence against women in the family. The Ministry for
Health and Social Development stated that there were
23 state-run crisis centres for women in the RUSSian
Federation. However. women's human rights
organizations were concerned that government
support for ensls centres and hotlines was on the
decline. According to these organizations. there was
only one shelter place for every 9 mill ion women in
Russia.

Issues, m particular on Chechnya, were harassed,
prosecuted and in some cases subjected to arbitrary
detention and "disappearance". In some cases the
prosecution of activists under anti-extremism and anti­
racial hatred laws amounted to a violation of the right
to the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression. The
human rights organization Russian Chechen Friendship
Society (RCFS) was subjected to administrative
harassment from the tax authonties and the
registration department of the Ministry of Justice.

Possible prisoners of conscience
o In March a Moscow court found Yun Samodurov,
d irector of the Andrei Sakharov Museum and Public
Centre i n Moscow, and Ludmila Vasilovskaia, curator at
the centre, gUilty of charges relating to mcitement to
national and religious enmity, and fined them. A third
defendant, artist Anna Mikhalchuk, was found not
gUilty of similar charges. The three had organized an
exhibition called "Caution, Religion ! " m January 2003,
in which artists exhibited artwork using religious
symbols.
a In November Stanislav Dmitnevskii, Executive
Director of the RCFS and edltor-m-chlef of the
Pravo-zashchita (Rights Defence) newspaper, went on
trial on charges of mCltement to racial hatred, for hiS
decision to publish articles written by a former
Chechen separatist leader and his envoy. However,
both articles were critical of Russian government policy
rather than expressmg any criticism of ethnic Russians,
and contained calls for a peaceful resolutIOn to the
Chechen confliCt. The charges are punishable by up to
five years' Imprisonment.

I nvestigation into murder of Galina Starovoitova
I n J une the St Petersburg City Court convicted two men
of the 1999 murder of Duma Deputy and leader of the
Democratic RUSSia Party, Galina Starovoitova, and the
attempted murder of her assistant, Ruslan Linkov.
However, the person who ordered the murder had not
been Identified or prosecuted. The verdict recognized
the political character of the killing. Galina
Starovoitova had been an outspoken critic of
corruption and an advocate of human rights.

Legislation and non-governmental organizations
In June an amendment to the tax code came into force
mcreasmg the list of areas for which grants could be
given tax free, to Include the defence of human nghts,
which was welcomed by human nghts groups. However,
a draft law on civil society organizations was passed by
the State Duma at the end of the year which raised
serious concerns about freedom of association. The
draft law provided for much greater scrutiny of the
activities and funding of NGOs by the authorities. The
proposals threatened to open the door to arbitrary
decisions by the authorities, potentially compromlsmg
the independence of civil society organizations.

Racism, xenophobia a nd intolerance
Foreign nationals from all around the world, including
asylum-seekers, refugees, students and migrant
workers, were victims of racially motivated physical
assaults, some of which were fatal. The Sova
Information-Analytical Centre reported that there were
Amnesty International Report 2006

a t least 2 8 murders and 365 assaults across the country
which had been motivated by racial hatred. Citizens of
the RUSSian Federation were also targeted, m particular
Chechens and other North Caucasus ethnic groups, Jews,
Roma and practising Muslims. In some cases a lack of
trust in the police prevented victims from reporting the
attack. Meskhetians living in Krasnodar Territory
continued to be refused RUSSian citizenship on grounds
of ethnicity, resulting in discrimination m almost every
aspect of dally life. Anti-racist protest marches and
mitiatives took place in cities notorious for attacks,
includmg Voronezh, St Petersburg, Tiumen and Moscow.
a Peruvian student Enrique Arturo Angelis Urtado
was beaten and stabbed to death m October m the city
of Voronezh, and two other students were badly
injured. A number of people were detamed in
connection with the attack.
a There were suspected arson attacks and robberies
on Roma homes in the town of Iskltim, Novoslblrsk
region, and Roma were subjected to threats and
assaults. The Novoslbirsk regIOnal procuracy stated
that it was investigating the incidents.
a In October a jury m St Petersburg started to hear
eVidence i n the case of Khursheda Sultonova, a nme­
year-old Tajlk girl who was killed in February 2004. Seven
people, aged between 14 and 21 when the cnme was
committed, faced charges of hooliganism, punishable by
seven years' imprisonment, and one youth, aged 14 when
the crime was committed, faced charges of murder of a
person in a helpless state, motivated by racial hatred, as
well as hooliganism and robbery.

Fa ir trial concerns
In May former associates of the 011 and gas company
YUKOS Mikhali Khodorkovskli and Pia ton Lebedev were
found gui l ty of charges including tax evasion and fraud
and sentenced to nine years' impnsonment. The
convictions followed an investigation and tnal that
mcluded violations of fair tnal standards. Many
believed the prosecutions to be pol itically motivated.
The cases highlighted senous problems in Russia's
criminal justice system relating to the i ndependence of
the JudiCiary; access to effective legal counsel;
conditions of detention; and the use of torture and
I l l-treatment m order to extract confeSSions. The
prosecution and conviction of Mlkhail Khodorkovskll
was seen as having a chilling effect on freedom of
expression and political pluralism in RUSSia.
Arbitrary detention, torture and
conditions of detention
Violations of Russian and mternational law relating to
detention, including arbitrary detention and torture,
were reported. Conditions m some overcrowded pre­
trial detention facilities were so poor that they
amounted to cruel, inhuman or degradmg treatment.
Prisoners serving l i fe sentences l ived m conditions that
amounted to I l l-treatment and m some cases pOSSibly
torture. Pnsoners m regions mcluding Kursk,
Ulyanovsk, Smolensk and Mordovla conducted
organized protests, includmg hunger stnkes and mass
self-harm, against conditions and i l l-treatment.

Tatarstan ruled on the legality of the two men's

UN Women's Convention: ratified
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: not

Human rights organizations were prevented from
working freely a nd activists were ha rassed and
attacked. Journa lists continued to face intimidation.
Trials continued of people suspected of involvement
in the 1 994 genocide: some 3 6,000 of the more than
80,000 detainees awaiting trial were provisionally
released in August. There were concerns about the
fairness of some of the trials.
Background
During the first half of the year, Rwanda deployed
peacekeeping troops in Sudan. In mid-1005, several
prominent figures from various countries visited Kigali
to pay tribute to the recovery of Rwanda after the
genocide. Their statements were accompanied by new
financial pledges. The UK announced plans in
November to provide up to US$83 mil lion to assist the
government in the areas of education, land reform and
health. However, the international depiction of
Rwanda contrasted greatly with the human rights
situation on the ground.
Rwanda's relations with neighbouring Burundi,
Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) improved slightly, despite the government's
continued support for armed opposition groups
operating in eastern ORe. Rwanda also continued to be
responsible for arms trafficking to the ORe. Several
multilateral meetings indicated that an unofficial
agreement was emerging between leaders of the region
to control, at least on a temporary basis, the activities
of armed groups responsible for numerous human
rights abuses.
Human rights work ha mpered
The humanitarian responsibi lity to prevent a
recurrence of genocide or any other acts of ethnic
hostility or Violence was given by the authorities as
the principal motive for putting into effect measures
that suppressed indiViduals or bodies critical of
government policy. A politically motivated report
endorsed by parliament in 2004 adversely affected the
work of human rights organizations. The
parliamentary commission report had accused several
institutions, including national and international
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
individuals, of supporting genocide or disseminating
its principal tenets. Following the report several
members of civil society, including staff of human
Amnesty International Report 2006

RWA

rights organizations such as the League for the
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights i n Rwanda
and the League for the Protection of Human Rights in
the Great Lakes region, were forced to flee the
country for fear of being persecuted or arbitrarily
arrested.
During the year the Senate began disseminating a
questionnaire to Rwandans and international
organizations asking them to denounce any foreign
individual or organization suspected of promoting
"divisionism" or an "ideology of genocide". This, along
with other government measures, continued to create a
climate in which any criticisms or opposition were
discredited.
Some human rights organizations were only able to
work in extremely difficult conditions and under close
scrutiny by the authorities. Their freedom was also
affected by the law relating to non-profit
associations, which stipu lates that all NGOs in
Rwanda must obtain an annual "certificate of
registration" renewable from the Ministry of Local
Government, Good Governance, Community
Development and SOCial Affairs (Ministere de
I'Administration Loca le, Bonne Gouvernance,
Developpement Communautaire et Affaires Sociales,
M I NALOC). This certificate is granted on the baSis of
the organization's mission statement and annual
report. The process al lows the authorities to monitor
the activities of NGOs and control their publications.
A M I NALOC offiCial told AI representatives that a
Batwa association had its application rejected because
it said it represented the Batwa community and
therefore breached the law against "divisionism". In
light of such rulings, some organizations censored
themselves to obtain a certificate.
Human rights organizations were often told that they
could not obtain certification because of slow
administrative processes, even though other groups
were successful within days.
The acquisition of a certificate did not ensure that
human rights organizations could work
independently. If they intended to address sensitive
issues, they had to go through another process of
authorization at the m inisterial or local level. A local
human rights organization working on land issues in
the province of Kibungo d id not receive the necessary
authorization from the provincial authorities, even
though M I NALOC had issued it with a certificate of
registration. The issue of land sharing remained one
of the most sensitive i n Kibungo. Similar d i fficulties
were reported by an international NGO working in the
same field.

Freedom of expression under attack
Despite the declaration by the Minister of Information
in November that the press was free to work in Rwanda,
journalists continued to face intimidation and
harassment for articles criticizing government policy.
a On 7 September, Jean Leonard Ruganbage, a
journalist for Umuco, an independent newspaper, was
detained because of his investigation into the justice
system and the gacaca, a community-based system of
Amnesty International Report 2006

tribunals established by the government in 2002 to try
people suspected of crimes during the 1994 genocide
(see below).
a Bonaventure Bizumuremyi, editor of Umuco, was
detained several times after September and his
newspaper seized. He had published articles that
criticized the governing party Rwandan Patriotic Front
(Front Patriotique Rwandais) for coercing local
co-operatives to fund it.
Human rights activists who spoke out faced physical
and verbal attacks, and anonymous telephone calls
accusing them of being "traitors". As a result, some
were intimidated into silence, a phenomenon that was
becoming increasingly widespread.

Genocide trials
At the beginning of 2005, more than 80,000 detainees
awaited trial for their alleged participation in the 1994
genocide. The authorities had predicted that it would
take several decades to process all the cases given the
capacity of the judicial system. In August, 36,000 of the
detainees were provisionally released on the grounds
that they had confessed their involvement in the
genocide. The decision to release some detainees was
made in part to relieve the overcrowded conditions in
the prison system, and in part to try detainees before
gacaca tribunals where they would have to provide
further information on the crimes of other perpetrators.
The gacaca system offiCially began in 2005 to gather
information on crimes committed between I October
1990 and 31 December 1994. The department of gacaca
jurisdiction declared that more than 760,000 people
could be prosecuted (one in four of the adult
population) and that the process should be completed
by 2007. This intention to process cases as quickly as
possible increased suspicion about the fairness of the
gacaca system. Some decisions made by gacaca
tribunals cast doubt on their impartiality.
a Guy Theunis, a Belgian Catholic priest, was
arrested on 6 September at Kigali Airport for his
al leged role in the 1 994 genocide and was taken before
a gacaca court within five days. He was accused of
inciting ethnic hatred and masterminding killi ngs in a
church in Kigali. After weeks of d iplomatic
negotiations with the Belgian authorities, Guy Theunis
was transferred to Belgium on 20 November and the
Belgian judicial authorities began i nvestigating
charges brought against him i n Rwanda.
There was widespread distrust of the gacaca system.
Some Rwandans feared being exposed for their
involvement in the genocide by the gacaca tribunals.
Others feared that the tribunals could be used by
individuals to resolve personal conflicts or to make
economic gain.
Refugees
Thousands of Rwandans fled to neighbouring
countries, apparently for reasons including fear of the
gacaca system, suspicion of the authorities and
rumours of politically motivated "disappearances". In
April, on the I nh anniversary of the genOCide,
thousands of Rwandans fled to Burundi and Uganda. At
219

SAU

the end of the year, more than 7,000 Rwandans
remained in exile in Burundi (see Burundi entry).

I nternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
Trials of prominent genocide suspects continued
before the I nternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
( l CTR), which held 60 detainees at the end of 2005·
Five trials involving 20 defendants continued from
previous years, and five new trials involving seven
defendants began in 2005. Two judgments were given:
one defendant received a six-year prison sentence and
another received life imprisonment.
One suspect surrendered himself to the I CTR in
Tanzania and was later transferred to the Hague for
detention pending his trial on charges of genocide,
conspiracy to commit genocide and complicity in
genocide. Another suspect was arrested in Gabon. I n
addition t o the same crimes, he was charged with direct
and public incitement to commit genocide and
persecution as a crime against humanity.
The lerR continued to work under a UN Security
Council deadline to finish trials by the end of 2008 and
appeals by 2010. The Tribunal may transfer some case
files to the Rwandan authorities to meet this deadline.
The ICTR's President estimated that 65-70 cases would
have been completed by 2008.
Update: Augustin Cyiza and leonard H itimana
Augustin Cyiza, a former military officer and a
prominent member of civil society, and Leonard
Hitimana, a member of parliament, were among
opposition activists who "disappeared" in 2003 in the
run-up to elections. The authorities continued to state
that the men left the country to join the Democratic
Liberation Forces of Rwanda (Forces Democratiques de
Liberation du Rwanda), an armed group operating in
the ORe. No investigation into their "disappearance"
was opened and the authorities continued to ignore
requests for information from the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights and the I nter­
ParlIamentary Union. It appears that the two men were
abducted and killed in Rwanda.

Killings by security forces and armed groups
escalated, exacerbating the already grim human
rights situation. Scores of people were arrested for
suspected links with armed opposition groups but
little information was availa ble a bout their legal
status or conditions in detention. Women remained
subject to extensive discrimination in law a nd
practice, and inadequately protected against
violence in the home, but there were some signs of
reform. Migrant workers also faced d iscri mination
and a buse. At least 86 men a nd two women were
executed, a I most ha If ofthem foreign nationa Is.
Background
Crown Prince Abdullah became King and Head of State
following King Fahd's death on I August and named
Prince Sultan, the Defence Minister, as the new Crown
Prince. The accession of King Abdullah raised hopes of
political reform, including in the area of women's
rights, but progress was slow.
In April, the government announced plans to reform
the judicial system, introduce specialized labour,
commercial and criminal courts, and establish a
Supreme Court. I n September, the government created
a national human rights commission to "protect human
rights and spread awareness about them . . . in keeping
with the provisions of Islamic law".
Saudi Arabia's first-ever municipal elections were

The other half are filled by government appointees.
Women were excluded from the elections, provoking
much controversy. Women's rights activists called on
the government to appoint women to some of the
unelected seats.
Armed clashes and killings
Armed men al legedly aligned to al-Qa'ida engaged in
armed confrontations with security forces in which
scores of people from both sides were kil led. Such
clashes occurred in Riyadh, al-Madina, al-Dammam and
elsewhere as the government intensified a "campaign
for fighting terrorism" announced by the Interior
Ministry in February.
a In early Apri l, security forces were reported to
have kil led 15 armed men and injured others in fighting
at al-Ras, near Riyadh. Among the dead were men

whose names appeared on a list of 26 wanted men

member of the security forces.
a In September, according to reports, five armed
men were killed and others were injured when
government forces, two of whom were also kil led,
stormed a house in al-Dammam.

Abuses in the context of the 'war on terror'
The government took various measures to counter the
activities of groups suspected of links to al-Oa'ida. I t
hosted an international counter-terrorism conference
in February which recogntzed that human rIghts abuses
were one cause of terrorism and recommended that
speCific codes of conduct be devised to assist law
enforcement agencies in combating terrorism while
respecting human rights. Later, King Abdul lah renewed
his call for members of armed groups to surrender to
the authorities.
Government forces arrested scores of suspected
Islamists but disclosed little information about those
detained, not even their names. The Interior Ministry
reportedly stated that many of those arrested would be
tried. However, the secrecy that surrounds the criminal
justice system meant that no trials were reported.
There was concern that those prosecuted would not
receive fair trials.
Some of those arrested were among those named in a
new list of 36 "most wanted" suspects, many of them
foreign nationals, issued by the government in J une.
They included Faiz Ayoub, who reportedly handed
himself in to the authOrities on I July.
Among others arrested were at least five Chadian
nationals who were detained in June, and Mohamed al­
'Amerl and four people believed to be Saudi Arabian
nationals who were reportedly detained in al-Madina
on 25July.
Other security suspects were returned to or received
from other countries. In February and March, 27 Yemeni
nationals were deported to Yemen, where they may
have been detained, while Yemeni authorities returned
25 Saudi Arabian nationals to Saudi Arabia on 28 March.
Further exchanges of such prisoners between the two
countries, and between Saudi Arabia and other
countries, were believed to have occurred, but few
details were available.

returned in February to the USA where he was tried and
convicted of conspiring to assassinate US President
George W. Bush and other offences. He had been
arrested in Saudi Arabia i n J une 2003 and alleged that he
was tortured and ill-treated while held Incommuntcado
for two months and that US offiCials were aware of this.
He also said that US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
offiCials had participated In his Interrogation In Saudi
Arabia and threatened him with transferral to
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or trial In Saudi Arabia where he
would not have the right to representation by a lawyer.

Women's rights
Women remained subject to discrimination in law and
practice and were not adequately protected against
domestic and family violence. However, the
government expressed commitment to improving the
status of women and was reported in March to be
preparing legislation to grant women the right to
become permanent members of the Shura (Consultative
Council).
The Ministry of Labour a nnounced that it wished
to increase the number of women I n paid
employment. However, i t said this wou ld only
happen with consideration of "the need of the
woman for work, the need of the society for her
work, the approval of her legal guardian" and issues
of "decency", i ncluding dress, and that a woman's
work should not be at the expense of her fami l y l i fe
or " lead to social or moral problems". Women's rights
activists said it was such constrai nts that resulted i n
no more than 5 per cent of Saudi Arabian women
being in paid employment.
The exclusion of women from partiCipation In the
municipal elections was widely Criticized by women's
rights activists. The government said that there were
not enough qualified women to admintster women­
only registration centres and that not all women had
identification cards needed for voting. In response to
the critiCisms, the Head of the Elections Committee said
that he expected that women would participate in
future elections.

the practice of forCing women to marry against their

November 2004, was also released following a pardon
by the King.
Migrant workers
In August, the government announced plans to reform
the country's labour law to improve protection of
foreign workers' rights. It warned employers and
employment agencies that they could be punished,
including with prison terms, if they mistreated workers.
The authOrities said that new guidelines would be given

Background
Following the Decemb r 2004 peace agreement. which
ended two decades of conflict m Casamance,
reconstruction work and demining began in the region.
This al lowed refugees. former fighters and displaced
farmers to return home. In February negotiations
began on the implementation of the peace agreement
but were hampered by divisions within rival factions of

Idrissa Seck in July (see below) and repeated
Intimidation of journalists and political opponents.
President Wade faced mcreasing waves of protests
from civil society groups and some political parties.
Arrest of Idrissa Seck
In July former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck was arrested
and charged with threatening state security, an
accusation that appeared to be politically motivated
and unfounded. He was then charged with
embezzlement of funds. He remained in prison and
some of his defence rights were initially not respected,
mcludmg the right to meet hiS lawyers m private.
Several other people were bnefly arrested or
interrogated in connection with this case.
Threats to freedom of expression
Journalists and political opponents continued to be
harassed and intimidated in an attempt to restrict
freedom of expression.
f-j In May, Abdourahlm Agne, the leader of the
opposition Reform Party, was detamed and charged With
inciting the population to insurrection after he urged
people to follow Ukraine's example and hold peaceful
protests to drive President Wade out of office.
Abdourahim Agne was proviSionally released in June.
a In October, police shut down Sud FM, one of the
major private radiO stations, and detained about 20
staff after the station broadcast an interview with
Salif Sadio, a military leader of the M FDC in which he

The Minister of I n formation said the action had been
taken because the interview might "threaten the security
of state". All the Sud FMstaff were released a few hours
later and the radio broadcast signals re-established.

Impunity
Despite public commitments by the authorities, no
steps were taken to end impunity for human rights
perpetrators. In January parliament passed a law that
provides an amnesty for "politically motivated"
offences committed between I January 1983 and 3 1
December 2004.

However, in December the Tribuna l's Chief
Prosecutor reported that co-<>peration had
deteriorated. The Prime Minister of Kosovo was
indicted a nd surrendered to the Tribunal in March.
Domestic trials and retrials of Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians accused of wa r crimes continued. In Serbia
trials continued of former officials accused of
complicity in previous political crimes. Police torture
a nd ill-treatment continued. Roma were deprived of
many basic rights. Trafficking of women and girls for
forced prostitution remained a serious concern.
Background
Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) continued to operate with
separate governments and legal systems. On 3 October
the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers authorized
the European Council to start talks with the Union of
SCG. These started on 7 November aimed at a
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. In
October, a revised criminal code and a law on the police
and on the Protector of Citizens (ombudsperson) were
introduced, but legislative reform remained slow. The
EU, through the Venice Commission, set out conditions
for the Montenegrin independence referendum planned
for April 2006.
The UN I nterim Mission in Kosovo (UN M I K)
continued to administer Kosovo. Some further
competencies were transferred to the Provisional
Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), and measures
were taken towards decentralization. The presence of
uniformed opposition groups was reported. The Self­
Determination Movement organized non-violent
demonstrations against U N M I K in which at least 186
people were arrested; some were reportedly i l l-treated
by the police. In October, the UN Secretary-General
appointed a Special Envoy to Kosovo to conduct talks
on the future status of the province.
War crimes: international prosecutions
The trial by the Tribunal of former President Slobodan
Milosevic, accused of responsibility for war crimes in
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and Kosovo,
continued. In June the prosecution presented the court
with footage of members of a Serb paramilitary unit
(the "Scorpions") executing six Bosniak prisoners from
Srebrenica on Mount Treskavica in BiH in July 1995. The
"Scorpions" were alleged to be under the control of the
Serbian authorities when the crimes were committed.
In December, the Tribunal amended the indictment
against Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic to include
further charges related to this incident. Proceedings
also opened on 20 December at the Belgrade war crimes
court against five members of the "Scorpions" in
relation to these executions.
The Serbian authorities failed to seek out and arrest
suspects indicted by the Tribunal. However, under
pressure from the EU and the US government, they
adopted a policy of "encouraging" voluntary surrender
and affording suspects offiCial support.
I n January, former commander of the Pristina Corps
Vladimir Lazarevic surrendered to the Serbian
authorities; he was transferred to the custody of the
224

Tribunal. He had been indicted along with three other
former senior officers and government officials for
individual criminal responsibi lity and for command
responsibility for crimes against humanity and
violations of the laws or customs of war in Kosovo in
1999. Two others - Sreten Lukic, former police general
in Kosovo and later assistant Serbian I nterior Minister,
and Nebojsa Pavkovic. former commander of the
Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia voluntarily surrendered in April and May. The fourth
man, Vlastimir Djordevic, former Assistant Minister of
the Interior, was believed to remain at large in Russia.
Between February and April, eight suspects indicted
by the Tribunal for charges including war crimes,
crimes against humanity and genocide in connection
with the war in BiH, surrendered to the Serbian
authorities and were transferred to the Tribunal. They
included former Bosnian Serb Army officers Drago
Nikolic, Vinko Pandurevic, Ljubomir Borovcanin and
Vujadin Popovic, all of whom were indicted in
connection with the killing of more than 8 , 000
Bosniak civilians in Srebenica in J uly 1 995 (see Bosnia
and Herzegovina entry).
In October Tribunal Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte
reported "complete satisfaction with Belgrade's
co-operation" for the first time. However, neither
Radovan Karadiic nor Ratko Mladic had surrendered by
the end of the year. In December she reported that
co-operation had deteriorated.
Ramush Haradinaj, former prime minister of Kosovo
and Kosova Liberation Army (KLA) commander, resigned
in March and surrendered to the Tribunal. He was
indicted, with Lahi Brahimaj and Idriz Balaj, on 37 counts
of crimes against humanity and war crimes against the
Serb, Roma, Ashkali and "Egyptian" populations.
On 5 May, Beqa Beqaj was convicted and sentenced
to four months' imprisonment for contempt of the
Tribunal in connection with the intimidation of
witnesses in the Limaj case. I n November, in the same
case, Haradin Bala was convicted of torture, cruel

blood. There was grave concern at the failure of
U N M I K and the PISG to respect and fulfil their right to
health; despite international calls for their urgent
relocation, they had not been moved by the end of
the year.
Trafficking of women and girls for
forced prostitution
An Administrative Directive implementing the 2001
trafficking regulation promulgated in February failed to
guarantee trafficked women and girls an automatic
right to protection and assistance. A trafficking action
plan published in May failed to fully meet AI's 2004
recommendations on protecting the human rights of
trafficked women and girls.
Arrests of groups of suspected traffickers were
reported in March and May.
o In May a senior member of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees was convicted and
sentenced for sexual exploitation of minors under 16
years, but charges related to trafficking were dropped.

Trials continued before the Special Court for Sierra
leone. The N igerian government refused to surrender
former Liberian President Cha rles Taylor to the
Specia l Court for Sierra Leone to be tried on charges
of crimes against huma nity and wa r crimes
committed during the a rmed conflict in Sierra leone.
The trials before nationa I cou rts of former
combatants charged with murder and other offences
in 2002 continued. Weaknesses, such as staff
shortages, remained in the j udicial sector. The acting
editor of the leading newspaper For Di Peop/e died
after a severe beating, a mid fears that a member of
parliament had been involved in his death. The Truth
and Reconciliation Commission's 2004 report was
distributed as part of a nationwide program me to
raise awareness of human rights, including of women
a nd children. However, a recommendation by the
Commission to a bolish the death pena lty was not
implemented.
Background
The security situation remained generally stable. The
government assumed further responsibilities for
maintaining security and consolidating the peace, and
extended its authOrity. Some 9,500 police officers
were deployed throughout the country, and
international military adVisers supported
strengthening of the army.
Sierra Leone remained one of the poorest countries
in the world, with 70 per cent of the population living
on less than US$I a day and high illiteracy rates. There
was little progress in addressing other factors
Amnesty International Report 2006

contributing to human rights violations, particularly
widespread poverty, severe youth unemployment and
the lack of basic services.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights visited
Sierra Leone in J uly, primarily to support the
establishment of the National Human Rights
Commission. Later in July Parliament approved the law
setting up the National Human Rights CommiSSion,
which was to start functioning from early 2006.
An August UN Security Council resolution replaced
the UN peacekeeping office in Sierra Leone (UNAMS I L)
with a peace building office, the UN Integrated Office In
Sierra Leone (UNIOS I L), to focus on human rights and
the rule of law from January 2006. The human rights
section of UNAMS I L held a national conference In
December to formulate a human rights action plan for
the new mission.

The Special Cou rt for Sierra Leone
Former liberian President Charles Taylor continued to
enjoy impunity despite international pressure,
including from the European Parliament and the US
Congress, for Nigeria to surrender him to the Special
Court for Sierra Leone to face charges of crimes against
humanity, war crimes and other serious Violations of
international law. The Campaign Against I mpunity, a
coalition of international human rights organizations,
was formed to press the Nigerian government and
other African Union member states for Charles Taylor's
surrender to the Special Court.
PreSident Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria maintained
his refusal to surrender Charles Taylor, on the grounds
that it would disrupt Liberia's tranSition. In July
member states of the Mano River Union - Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone - ca lled for N igeria to review
the terms under which Charles Taylor had been granted
asylum In 2003, as he was allegedly breaking a
commitment not to interfere in Liberian politics. I n
November the federal High Court In Nigeria ruled that
two Nigerian victims of torture had legal standing to
challenge the asylum given to Charles Taylor.
The Special Court established a second trial chamber
In January, enabling a third trial to start In March. Three
trials involving nine suspects indicted in 2003
continued throughout the year. In April the second trial
chamber ordered the prosecution of a defence lawyer
for allegedly revealing the Identity of, and threatening,
a protected witness. I n July the prosecution closed its
case In the trial of three members of pro-government
Civil Defence Force (CDF) militias, and in October the
first trial chamber unanimously dismissed a motion for
acquittal. I n November the trial began of three
members of the former armed oppOSition
Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The trial of three
members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council
(AFRC) had not concluded by the end of 2005. Reports
of the death of Johnny Paul Koroma, the former AFRC
Chairman, were not confirmed, and he remained at
large.
The Special Court remained without suffiCient
guarantees of international funding to enable It to
continue operating effectively until the end of 2006.

H igh Court treason trials
At the beginning of 2005, 57 former RUF and AFRC
members and 31 former West Side boys, renegade
soldiers, were on trial before the High Court in the
capital, Freetown. They were charged with treason for
allegedly overthrowing or seeking to overthrow an
elected government by force. One of the accused, the
daughter of former RUF leader Foday Sankoh, died in
prISon in 2005. There were repeated adjournments of
the trials.
Nine former members of the RUF and AFRC and one
civilian, sentenced to death for treason in December
2004, planned to lodge an appeal but did not have
access to lawyers. The charges related to an armed
attack In January 2003 on a military armoury in
Freetown In an apparent attempt to overthrow the
government.
Other former combatants were held in safe custody
for periods mid-year, reportedly because they were
testifying for the prosecution in the trials. Three former
RUF members spent a month in July and August in the
custody of the criminal investigation police.
Truth and Reconciliation Commission
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission distributed
its report, published in 2004, which contributed to
raising awareness of human rights concerns it
highlighted. Key recommendations included the
abolition of the death penalty, a moratorium on
executions pending abolition, and commutation of
pending death sentences.
I nspired by the example set by the Special Court for
Sierra Leone, where the maximum sentence was a term
of life impnsonment, civil society groups organized
events throughout the year to raise concern about the
death penalty.
The government's response to the report, published
mid-year, made no commitment to abolish the death
penalty, however. In November, a non-governmental
follow-up committee presented a draft law to
Parliament to adopt the Commission's
recommendations as law.
Protracted justice reforms
Reform of the justice sector was slow. There were
Improvements to infrastructure with the building of
court houses and prisons. Shortage of legal staff
resulted in delays in the finalization of draft laws to
protect women's human rights, including laws on
marriage, succession, inheritance and sexual offences
drafted by the Law Reform Commission. The Law
Reform Commission carried out consultations on
domestic VIOlence legislation, for a draft bill to be
presented to Parliament in 2006.
In the formal legal system, court adjournments and
long delays in trials remained common. There was
little opportunity for convicted prisoners to lodge
appeals. Some legal aid was available In d istrict towns
but not In Freetown. Local courts, in which lay judges
administered customary law, were functioning.
However, chiefs and local court offiCials often gave
rulings and adjudications in cases outSide their
228

jurisdiction, contributing to the denial of justice to a
large proportion of the population. The Attorney
General's Office provided training to local court
offiCials during the year.

Press freedom under attack
Journalists and editors were targeted, giving rise to
fears of a concerted attack on press freedoms.
a Paul Kamara, former editor of For Dj People, was
released from prison on appeal in November after
serving 13 months of two concurrent two-year prison
terms in the Central Prison, Freetown. He was
convicted of seditious libel in 2004, after the paper
claimed that a 1967 commission of inquiry had
"convicted" PreSident Kabbah, then a ministerial
offiCial, of fraud.
a In May, Sidney Pratt and Dennls Jones, journalIsts
for the Trumpet newspaper, were arrested by police
and accused of seditious libel. They were subsequently
released without charge.
a On 10 May, Harry Yansaneh, acting editor of For Di
People, was assaulted on the newspaper's premises by
a group of men. He was hospitalized but died from his
injuries in July. The coroner's inquest found that the
death was caused by the assault. Eight people,
including a senior government offiCial, were arrested
and charged with involuntary manslaughter. They were
released on bail to await trial, which had not started by
the end of 2005. There were concerns about
government interference in the case after the Attorney
General had the initial charges withdrawn because of a
procedural error by the coroner.

Freedom of expression a nd assembly continued to be
curbed. Thirty-six men were held without charge or
trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Death
sentences were imposed and eight people were
executed. Jehovah's Witnesses continued to be
imprisoned for conscientious objection to military
service. Criminal offenders were sentenced to caning.
Background
The ruling People's Action Party (PAP), in power since
1959, maintained a dominating hold over political life
and wider society. Official statements encouraging a
more participatory, inclusive society were countered in
practice by an array of laws restricting rights to
freedom of expression, association and assembly.
Restrictions on freedom of expression
and assembly
The threat of potentially ruinous Civil defamation suits
against opponents of the PAP continued to inhibit
political life.
CS! In March, the leader of the opposition Singapore
Democratic Party, Chee Soon juan, was unable to pay
damages of 500,000 Singapore dollars (approximately
US$306,000) awarded against him in defamation suits
lodged in 2001 by two PAP leaders. He was at risk of
being declared bankrupt and therefore unable to stand
for election.
El In September, the High Court rejected a second
application to be discharged from bankruptcy lodged
by former leader of the opposition Workers' Party, j. B.
jeyaretnam. Declared bankrupt after a series
defamation SUitS by PAP leaders and others, he was
expelled from Parliament in 2001 and remained unable
to stand for election.
The threat of prosecution, and uncertainty over the
boundaries of permissible public debate, contributed
to a climate of self-censorship.
CS! In March, government censors required fil m maker
Martyn See to remove a documentary on Chee Soon
j uan from Singapore's international fil m festival. He
was then subjected to a criminal investigation and
required to surrender equipment and material. No
charges had been fi led by the end of the year.
CS! In May, the authorities threatened to sue a
Singaporean student in the USA who criticized the
government's scholarship system on hiS personal
Internet blog.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Restrictions on freedom of assembly also Inhibited
peaceful CIVil society activity. I n August, riot police
ordered the dispersal of a group of four people
holding a si lent protest outSide a government bUilding
to urge greater offiCial accountability. A High Court
Judge subsequently dismissed their petition that the
dispersal violated their constitutional right to
peaceful protest.
CS! In September police questioned local activists who
had set up placards protesting at delays In opening a
train station. No charges were filed.
a In March, the authorities banned a weekend
concert by a local AIDS support group, stating that the
event, organized by a Christian gay organization, was
against the public interest.

Detention without trial
At least 36 men remained in detention without charge
or trial under the ISA. Seventeen other former ISA
detainees were reportedly under orders restricting
their freedom of movement and association. The
authorities claimed the men were Involved With
Islamist groups, includingjemaah Islamlah, held
responSible for planning or carrYing out bomb attacks
In the region.
Death pena lty
Eight people were executed. Singapore was believed to
have the highest rate of executions per capita in the
world.
The hanging in May of Shanmugam s/o Murugesu,
sentenced to death in 2004 for possession of just over
Ikg of cannabis, sparked unprecedented public
discussion. From April to August, local activists
organized a public forum, petitions, vigils and other
events to campaign against the death penalty. The
authorities refused to allow an AI representative to
address the public forum in May, while in August police
banned the use of Shanmugam's face on posters on the
grounds that it would "glorify" an executed convict.
CS! In December Australian Van Tuong Nguyen,
convicted in 2004 of smuggling herOin, was executed.
Conscientious objectors
At least two conscientious objectors to military service
were imprisoned in 2005, and 12 others continued to
serve prISon sentences. All were members of the
banned jehovah's Witnesses religious group. There was
no alternative to military service In practice for
conscientious objectors in Singapore.

Orgovanova, the senior offiCial for Roma affairs, was
told by the mayor that the Sarkozi family had been
offered compensation to leave the vil lage, which It
had initially accepted and later declined. AI was
unable to confirm this.

Ban on affirmative action
There were continu reports of d iscri mi nation
against Roma in both public and private sectors;
concerns included the lack of access to education
a nd housing for Roma.
Discrimination against Roma
In january. the government produced Its comments on
the Concluding Observations of the UN Human Rights
Committee, which had been published in 200) and
which expressed concern about diScriminatIOn against
Slovakla's 500.000 Roma in the fields of education,
employment. housing. health, SOCial care and access to
services. Among other issues the government
addressed the placement in special schools of Roma
children. In the context of Roma chi ldren often failing
school entry tests, the government stated that they
"come to school without pre-school education and
suffiCient knowledge of Slovak, lack basic hygiene and
cultural and working ski lls, have limited concentration,
patience and perseverance, and have underdeveloped
fine motor coordination, different experience and
knowledge of the world, and different I nterests and felt
needs." The government reported that it would prepare
differential school tests for Roma children from a
SOCially disadvantaged environment by the end of 2005.
In April, the government offiCial in charge of Roma
affairs, Klara Orgovanova, announced the adoption of a
National Action Plan for a "Decade of Roma Inclusion
2005-2015" . The main areas of diScriminatIOn targeted
in the National Action Plan are education, employment,
health and housing.

Housing rights
In March, the UN Committee on Elimination of RaCial
Discrimination found that Slovakia had discriminated
against a group of Roma with regard to hOUSing rights.
The case was brought by 27 Slovak citizens of Roma
origin from Dobsina, and followed a decision not to
proceed With a previously announced project to set up
low-cost housing for the Roma population in Dobsina,
after an anti-Roma petition was received from certain
politiCians with nationalist agendas. The Committee
stated that once a policy towards realization of the
right to hOUSing had been adopted by the authorities,
ItS revocation and replacement with a weaker measure
amounted to a Violation of the Convention on the
EliminatIOn of All Forms of RaCial DIScrimination.

In October, the Constitutional Court declared
unconstitutional any affirmative action for ethnic
minorities, such as Roma. The Court ruled that such
action clashed with the Slovak constitution, as it
"violated full equality before law".
In practice, the deCision appeared to ban special
measures, including those deSigned to improve access
to education and employment for members of ethniC
minOrities. Under its international human rights
obligations, Slovakia may be required to take special
measures to redress historical discrimination and the
conditions that cause or help to perpetuate
discrimination.

Forced sterilizations
A new comprehensive Public Health Law, including
provisions on sterilizations, informed consent and
access to medical records, entered into force on
I january. The law was drafted after civil society
organizations highlighted substantial gaps in the
previous legislation, which did not accord suffiCient
protection against forced sterllizations of women.
Citing thiS new law, the UN Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women declined to
conduct an Inquiry into allegations of forced sterilizatlons
of Romani women submitted by the European Roma
Rights Centre. The Committee nevertheless expressed
concern about possible individual cases of forced
sterilizations in Slovakia and recommended that the
Slovak authorities pursue the issue.
A case against Slovakia brought by three alleged
victims of forced sterilization was heard by the
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The
deCISion was pending at the end of 2005.
AI wins case against Slovak police
In june, the Supreme Court announced that the police
had not acted in line with the law when, in june 2004,
they prevented )o AI activists from gathering in front of
the Belarus Embassy in Bratislava to protest against the
detentIOn of prisoner of conSCience Professor Yury
Bandazhevsky. Although AI notified the authorities of
the demonstration in accordance With existing
regulations, the police prevented demonstrators from
entering the street where the Belarus Embassy is
located. The Supreme Court deCided that only the
mUnicipality, not the police, has the legal power to
prevent people exercising the right to assemble. The
police can only intervene if publiC order IS disturbed or
other il legal acts are linked to the event.

There was continued concern a bout the status of
thousands of people whose names were removed
from the registry of permanent residents in 1 992
(known as the "erased"). Members of Romani
communities faced discrimination including in
access to education.
The 'erased'
The Slovenian authorities failed to resolve the status of
the so-called "erased" - some 18,305 individuals
unlawfully removed from the Slovenlan registry of
permanent reSidents in 1992. The "erased" were mainly
people from other former Yugoslav republics who had
been living in Slovenia but had not acquired Slovenian
citizenship after Slovenia became independent. The
Slovenian authorities failed to ensure that the "erased"
had ful l access to economic and social rights, including
access to work, health care and, in some cases,
education.
Although the Slovenian Constitutional Court had
ruled In 1999 and 2003 that the removal of these
individuals from the registry of permanent reSidents
was unlawful, approximately 6,000 of the "erased" still
did not have Slovenian citizenship or a permanent
reSidence permit at the end of 2005.
Following the 2003 Constitutional Court decision,
the Slovenian Ministry of i nterior had issued
approximately 4, 100 decrees retroactively restoring the
status of permanent reSidents to the individuals
concerned. However, the Slovenian authorities
stopped issuing such decrees in July 2004 and no new
steps were taken to implement the Constitutional Court
deCISIOn and to restore the rights of the "erased".
Many of the "erased" continued to live In Slovenia
"Il legally" as foreign nationals or stateless persons;
others were forced to leave the country. Many of the

12,000 who had managed to obtain Slovenian
citizenship or permanent residency - In many cases
after years of bureaucratic and legal struggle ­
continued to suffer from the ongoing consequences of
their past unregulated status and had no access to full
reparation, including compensation.

Lack of access to education for Romani
children
The Slovenian authorities failed to fully Integrate
Romani children into the education system and
tolerated or promoted the creatIOn of speCial classes
for Romani children in certain primary schools. In some
cases the children in the special classes were taught a
reduced or simplified curriculum.
Concern was expressed in July by the UN Human
Rights Committee that members of Romani
communities continued to suffer prejudice and
discrimination, including in access to education.
Cl In March, after protests by parents of non-Romani
children against the " large share" of Romani pupils
attending the Brsljin primary school, the Slovenlan
Minister of Education and Sport proposed to create at
that school speCial separate classes In certain subjects
for Romani children. This proposal was subsequently
retracted following protests by Romani parents and

Reconstruction a nd development efforts continued
following five years of a rmed conflict that ended in
2003. Potentially divisive ethnic and regional
differences remained to be addressed. In
prosecutions for serious conflict-related crimes, at
least 1 0 people were convicted, i ncluding the former
leader ofthe Guada lcanal Liberation Front. Other
former militants continued to awa it trial on remand,
some after nearly two a nd a half years in pre-trial
detention.
Post<onflict developments
Progress was reported on the reconstruction of
infrastructure and key institutions affected by the
confliCt. However, significant development challenges
remained, as more than 80 per cent of the population
was stil l dependent on subsistence agriculture and
fishing, with limited access to health and education
services. The marked disparity in development between
the capita!. Honiara, and the provinces stirred tensions,
as did reported corruption among political leaders.
With the continued presence of the Regional
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMS!) the
security situation reportedly remained stable.
However, in May a report by the Pacific Islands Forum
found that entrenched provincialism and strong
animosities between ethniC groups persisted. The
report recommended establishing both a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission and a commission of
inquiry to investigate land issues and the underlying
causes of ethnic confliCt. Neither institution had been
established by the end of 2005, although there were
other community reconciliation initiatives. Concerns
remained that proposed constitutional reforms
designed to Introduce a federal system of government
could lead to further fragmentation.

During the year, t h e High Court convicted at least 10
people for their role in the violence and acquitted four.
Among those convicted was Harold Keke, former leader
of the Guadalcanal Liberation Front, who, with two
others, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 2002
murder of Augustine Geve, a former priest and
government minister.
In two other murder trials, the court held that,
despite possible eVidence of threats and intimidation,
the defence of duress was not available to former
mi litia members who had voluntarily joined militant
groups.
Mil itia members convicted in at least one trial lodged
appeals on the grounds that they had been induced to
make admissions as part of the peace process, without
understanding that their statements would be used as
evidence against them in criminal proceedings.
In October police used tear gas to quel l a prison riot
that reportedly started when suspects awaiting trial for
conflict-related offences believed their appeal for
amnesty had not been delivered.

Violence aga inst women
In March the Christian Care Centre, the country's first
purpose-built shelter for victims of family violence,
opened near Honiara. In September, Centre staff and
police officers received training on gender-based
Violence from the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre. However,
a national policy on violence against women, including
a coordinated, properly resourced inter-agency
approach, was still outstanding. Women who
experienced violence, particularly outSide major town
centres, were left without effective protection, health
services or redress.
As the courts worked through their case backlog, a
few historical cases of sexual assault came to trial. I n
May, former Deputy Police Commissioner Wilfred
Akao was convicted and sentenced to two years'
imprisonment for abducting and assaulting a woman
in Honiara in 1996. Another man was sentenced to
four and a half years on three counts of raping the
same woman.

Trials relating to the conflict
Although arrests relating to the conflict were stil l being
made in December, most outstanding cases had
proceeded to trial or were awaiting trial. In such cases,
there were concerns about the length of time some
detainees had been in custody. The courts deCided that
more than two years in pre-trial detention was
reasonable in the circumstances.

Thousands of civilians escaping human rig hts abuses
fled the country or were displaced. There was no ru le
of law in the south. Journalists were arrested a nd
human rights defenders threatened in several areas.
Violence agai nst women was widespread. In
Somaliland, there were a rbitrary detentions a nd
unfair political trials and reports of torture. A 1 6year-old girl imprisoned for espionage was released.
Background
Tra nsitional Federal Government
In january, the Kenya-based Transitional Federal
Parliament approved the appointment of a cabinet of
ministers and assistant ministers by the Prime Minister,
who had been appointed by the President of the
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in November
2004. The five-year TFG and other federal institutions
were not, however, functional in Somalia by the end of
2005. This was the result of an internal division
between, on the one hand, President Abdullahi Yusuf
Ahmed and his associated clan-based factions, who
mostly relocated from Kenya to jowhar town in central
Somalia, and, on the other hand, faction leaders who
had returned to their base in the capital, Mogadishu.
Open fighting between the two groupings was narrowly
averted. The UN Secretary-General cal led again in
October for a comprehensive ceasefire agreement.
An African Union peace-support force, proposed in
2004 at the conclusion of a two-year peace and
reconciliation conference in Kenya, was not deployed
for security reasons, and there was very little
demobilization of faction militias as required by the
Transitional Federal Charter (the interim Constitution).
There were continuing periodic outbursts of faction
fighting and clan-mil itia violence in most of the central
and southern regions. Police General Yusuf Ahmed
Sarinle was assassinated in Mogadishu in january,
apparently for supporting the TFG. Generally,
humanitarian access was severely impeded,
humanitarian supplies were often looted, and
employees of UN agencies and international aid
organizations were at risk of being killed or kidnapped
for ransom.
Several warlords and others who were al leged to
have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity
or gross human rights violations, either under the preAmnesty International Report 2006

1 9 9 1 Siad Barre government o r during the subsequent
civi l wars, were appointed as ministers in the TFG or to
other federal posts and continued to benefit from
impunity.
The international community suspended
commencement of reconstruction aid to SomalIa until
the TFG was united and functional, although the UN and
World Bank began a joint needs assessment. A
humanitarian emergency affected up to a million
people in need of urgent assistance.

Somaliland
The self-declared Somali land Republic in the north­
west continued to press its demand for International
recognition after 14 years of de facto independence. It
remained the only part of the former Somali Republic to
have a government and functioning administration. I ts
dispute with neighbouring Puntland over the contested
Sool and Sanaag border regions remained unresolved,
but 36 "prisoners of war" on both sides who had been
captured in 2004 were exchanged in December.
Parliamentary elections were held in September.
President Dahir Riyaale Kahin's ruling United
Democratic People's Party gained 33 seats, while the
opposition Unity (Kulmiye) and justice and Welfare
parties gained 28 and 21 seats respectively.
UN arms embargo
I n October the UN Security Council condemned
increasingly serious violations of its 1992 international
arms embargo on Somalia. The report by a panel of
experts identified violations by the governments of
Ethiopia and Yemen and a third unnamed government,
and also by certain Somali warlords and businesspeople
In the fishing, charcoal and drugs industries. The
monitoring group's report expressed concern that these
Illegal flows of smal l weapons to the TFG and opposition
factions contributed to general insecurity and problems
In establishing the transitional government.
Justice and rule of law
There was no rule of law or justice system in the central
and southern regions of Somalia, apart from a number
of IslamiC (Sharia) courts, which did not follow
recognized international standards of fair trial.
Cl I n September, jama Aden Dheere, a pro-TFG
faction-leader, was detained in jowhar for political
reasons and allegedly ill-treated.
In SomalI land there were cases of unfair political
trials and detention without tria l .
Cl I n january, Zamzam Ahmed Dualeh, aged 1 6 , was
pardoned and allowed to return home to Puntland
under the care of the UN Independent Expert on human
rights in Somalia. She had been convicted in 2004 of
espionage and sentenced to five years' imprisonment
after a grossly unfair trial . The Somali land authorities
continued to reject her al legations of rape and torture
by police officers.
Cl In September, dozens of people, including MuslIm
teachers, were arrested after a shoot-out between an
armed group and police. They were accused of being
part of an I slamist group linked to al-Oa'ida who were

al legedly planning to attack government officials and
foreigners. They were detained without charge or trial
at the end of the year. Some were allegedly tortured.
a Twenty-nine elders of the Ogaden clan from
Ethiopia who had been detained in November 2003
and convicted of armed conspiracy as alleged
members of the Ogaden National liberation Front
(ON LF), which was in conflict with the Ethiopian
government, were acquitted on appeal by the
Supreme Court i n 2005. However, they remained in
detention in poor hea lth in Hargeisa prison where two
died in late 2005.

Minority rights
Members of minorities continued to be subjected to
social discrimination and abuses, including murder and
rape, by clan members acting with impunity. Minority
rights issues were debated publicly and minorities were
al located 31 seats in the TranSitional Federal
Parliament.
In Somali land in May, dozens of minority rights
activists and supporters were briefly detained at a
demonstration in Hargeisa at the trial of a police
officer, who was given a prison sentence for killing
Khadar Aden Osman of the Gaboye minority.

Journalists
Several journalists in Somalia (including Puntland) and
also in Somali land were threatened or detained, and
two were killed. In August at a conference on Freedom
and Rights of Journalists held in Mogadishu, despite
death threats to the organizers, a National Union of
Somali Journalists was established.
a A British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
journalist, Kate Peyton, was assassinated in Mogadishu
in February.
a In February, HornAfrik radio station In Mogadishu
was bombed and a HornAfrikjournalist, Duniya
Muhyadin Nur, was killed by faction mi litias at a
roadblock in June.
a I n Puntland, Abdi Farah Nur, editor of the Shacab
newspaper which had been banned by the Puntland
authorities, was briefly detained in June in Garowe, his
third arrest in the year.

Refugees and internally d isplaced people
Refugees continued to flee from faction-fighting,
kidnappings, threats to human rights defenders and
other human rights abuses. Conditions of 400,000
people in internal displacement camps were extremely
poor. There were scores of deaths at sea of people
trying to reach Yemen from Puntland in trafficking
operations.

H u man rights defenders
Despite death threats, Somali human rights
organizations continued to monitor and report on
human rights violations, and to campaign for better
protection of human rights, including the
establishment of an independent National Human
Rights Commission for Somalia, and Similar human
rights commissions in Somali land and Puntland.
Somaliland human rights defenders criticized prison
conditions in Hargeisa, Berbera and Burao.
a A prominent peace activist, Abdulqadir Yahya AIi,
director of the Centre for Research and Dialogue, was
assassinated in Mogadishu in J uly by unidentified
assailants.
The UN I ndependent Expert on human rights in
Somalia reiterated concerns about human rights
violations and welcomed the increasingly visible role
played by civil society in promoting human rights.

Death penalty
Eight men, including one tried in his absence, were
sentenced to death in Somaliland in November for the
murders of two British aid workers in 2003 and a
Kenyan aid worker in 2004. They were alleged to be
members of a group li nked to al-Oa'ida. Their appeals
were pending at the end of the year.

There were incidents of police use of excessive force
against demonstrators and ill-treatment of a rrested
suspects. The cond uct of presiding magistrates and
police investigators u ndermined the right to fa ir
trial in several cases involving social movement
protesters. Department of Home Affa irs practices
denied the majority of asylum-seekers access to
refugee status determination procedu res.
Conditions in prison fell below international
sta ndards, largely as a resu lt of acute overcrowding.
Although an i ncreased number of people clinically
needing a ntiretroviral therapy for H IV/AI DS
received treatment, the majority stil l had no access
to treatment at public facilities. There was an
increase in reported rapes a nd concern at delays i n
lega l reforms affecting access t o justice for
survivors.
Background
Deputy President Jacob Zuma resigned under pressure
in J une, following the conviction on corruption
charges of Schabir Shaik, his financial adviser. In
November Jacob Zuma was indicted on corruption
charges. These developments brought into the open
differences within the ruling African National Congress
(ANC) and between the ANC and its All iance partners.
With local government elections pending, ANC­
dominated councils were increasingly targets of public
protests for corrupt practices and their failure to
deliver improvements in living standards. There was
concern that municipal authorities misused their
powers under the 1993 Gatherings Act in an attempt to
suppress demonstrations by groups critical of their
performance.
H u m a n rights violations by police
Police responded to the wave of public protests in most
cases without resorting to the use of excessive force.
However, there were incidents in which they misused
rubber bullets - the weapon of "last resort" under
South African Police Service (SAPS) regulations - in
their response to demonstrations in the Cape Town and
Durban areas, in Delmas, Oueenstown and
Johannesburg. There was also misuse of pepper spray,
in particular by members of the Municipal Police
Services in Cape Town where they used it to break up
peaceful protests against local government authorities,
and against criminal suspects under arrest.
a On 1 2 July unarmed members of the Treatment
Action Campaign (TAC), who were involved i n a
Amnesty International Report 2006

protest over t h e slow rol l -out of antiretroviral
treatment, were baton-charged, tear-gassed and shot
at with rubber bullets by police. The majorIty of the
protesters were H I V-positive women. The police did
not warn protesters before they forcibly dispersed
them from the Frontier Hospital in the Eastern Cape.
Fi fty-four people were seriously injured. The National
Commissioner of Police ordered a departmental
investigation and the retraining of the police unit
involved. The TAC lodged a complaint with the
Independent Complai nts Directorate (lCD) which was
still investigating the incident at the end of the year.
a On 26 May, three Free State police officers were
charged in the Harrismith regional court with mUider
and 16 counts of assault with intent to cause grievous
bodily harm in connection with the fatal shooting of
17-year-old Teboho Mkhonza and the wounding of
scores of other demonstrators on 30 August 2004.

Unfair trials
a Fi fty-one supporters of the Landless People's
Movement (LPM) remained on trial in the Lenasia
Magistrate's Court on a charge of breaching the
Electoral Act by taking part in a demonstration on
election day in April 2004. In J une the magistrate
rejected a defence application for her recusal
(withdrawal from the case) on the grounds of bias
after she made comments in open court that she had
to report to the Minister of J ustice about the trial. AI
representatives attending trial proceedings in August
observed that the magistrate behaved in a hostile
manner towards the accused. On 29 November the
magistrate rejected a defence application for the
dismissal of the charges. The magistrate did not give
reasons for the rul. The proceedings were
postponed until March .2006.
I n November in the Pro tea Magistrate's Court, the
presiding magistrate dismissed charges against a
police officer in connection with the a lleged torture of
two LPM activists in April 2004. The magistrate, in
acquitting the accused, reportedly attacked the
complainants' organization as "disrespectful " of the
government and also accused the complainants of
being motivated by a desire to ·undermine state
authority".
a In February, 1 3 officials and supporters of the
Greater Harrismith Concerned Residents' Association
from Intabazwe were charged with public violence
and sedition in connection with a demonstration in
August 2004. Five defendants were subjected to bail
conditions which restricted their public polI tical
activities. On 10 February police a llegedly arrested
and assaulted Malefu Molaba, a local resident, while
questioning her about the whereabouts of one of the
accused, Neo Motaung. She lodged a complaint a t
Harrismith police station. I n J une, another accused,
Sam Radebe, was al legedly assaulted and threatened
by the police I nvestigating Officer. He laid a charge
against the police officer at the Harrismith police
station. In August the state withdrew the sedition
charge and the court postponed the trial on the
remaining charge until J anuary 2006.

Prisoners' rights
On 15 December the Jali Commission of I nquiry handed
ItS report to the PreSIdent after a four-year inquiry into
corruption and violence in prisons; the report had not
been made pub I ic by the end of the year.
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
visited the country in September and expressed alarm
at the "rate of overcrowding in detention faci lities". The
overcrowdmg, in some cases by over 300 per cent of
capacity, and the resulting poor prison conditions led
the J udIcIal I nspectorate of Prisons to recommend that
mimmum sentence legislation be al lowed to lapse. The
UN delegates noted, in respect of prisoners awaiting
trial or sentence, a "lack of adequate facilities so
blatant that they fall short of international guarantees".
The Civil Society Prison Reform Initiative urged
Parliament in November to support the development of
rehabilitatIOn programmes and non-custodial
alternatives to imprisonment.
In November a non-governmental organization, the
A I DS Law Project, began legal proceedings against the
Head of Westvi lie Correctional Centre, Durban, on
behalf of 20 prisoners who were urgently in need of
antiretroviral treatment but were effectively denied
access to it because of the al leged failure by the
Department of Hea l th to equip prison hospitals for
this task. The problem had not been resolved by the
end of the year.
On 25 May the Constitutional Court confirmed the
validity of the 1997 Criminal Law Amendment Act
provisions which enabled the replacement of all death
sentences. Forty of the original 465 prisoners who were
under sentence of death at the time of the abolition of
the death penalty in 1995 were sti l l awaiting
replacement sentences at the time of a further
Constitutional Court hearing in October.
Violations of refugee rights
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the courts, the
South African Human Rights Commission and non­
governmental organizations criticized the Department
of Home Affairs (DHA) for fai l to address
organizational issues and arbitrary practices which
prevented the majority of asylum-seekers from
obtaining access to refugee status determination
procedures and documentation in a timely manner. The
closure in April of the Johannesburg area Refugee
Reception Office (RRO) exacerbated the crisis. The
effective denial of access to documentation left
asylum-seekers at risk of arbitrary arrest, detention in
police stations and in the Lindela Holding Facility, and
deportation. It also meant that they were denied the
right to work legally and to obtain health care or access
to education. In August, the Minister of Home Affairs
confirmed the government's determination to tackle
these problems.
In October the report of the Ministerial Committee of
I nquiry into deaths at the Lindela Holding Facility
recommended urgent steps to address failures in the
health care system and overcrowding at the faCil ity.
Lindela, which was run by a private company on behalf
of the DHA, handled over 4,000 people per month
236

awaiting deportation. I t s clinic was found t o have
insufficient skilled staff and medicines and no
emergency care procedures. On 28 October the
M inister of Home Affairs stated that a new health care
facility would be established.
a On I March asylum-seekers, frustrated with
repeatedly queuing outside the Cape Town RRO,
pushed their way into the office and refused to leave
the premises. They were kicked and hit with batons by
officials, according to witnesses and the testimony of
the asylum-seekers. The Minister of Home Affairs
concluded, on the basis of an inquiry into the incident,
that "no excessive force was used" and that one of the
officials had been threatened with a knife by an asylum­
seeker. The Minister instructed that changes should be
made in the system for managing applications.
a On 10 May, the Johannesburg High Court ordered
the DHA to facilitate access to asylum determination
procedures for 14 Ethiopians wrongly arrested and
detained at Lindela. I n October lawyers secured the
release from Lindela of a recognized refugee who was
due to be deported to Rwanda.
a In a case brought by the Somali Refugee Forum, the
Pretoria High Court on 11 November ordered the
Minister and the DHA urgently to implement specific
measures, including the reopening of the Johannesburg
RRO, to ensure asylum-seekers had access without
delay to asylum procedures. The government was
ordered to file a report before 28 February 2006 on the
extent of its compliance with the court order.

Access to health care for those living
with H IV/AIDS
In July the Department of Health's HIV and Syphilis
Antenatal Sero-prevalence Survey stated that between
5· 7 and 6.2 million South Africans had been infected
with H I V by 2004. It noted an increase in prevalence
among women attending antenatal clinics, the highest
rates being at 38.5 per cent of women aged between 25
and 29. A report of the South African Human Sciences
Research Council in November concluded from its
household survey that women were disproportionately
infected, particularly women aged between 15 and 24,
who had an H I V incidence rate eight times higher than
men of the same age.
By the end of the year there were 229 "accredited"
public health facilities providing treatment. However,
the World Health Organization expressed concern at
the slow progress in the roll-out of the antiretroviral
treatment programme and at offiCial statements that
alternative therapies alone could prolong the lives of
those living with H IV/A I DS. In September the
Department of Health reported that 86,000 people had
access to antiretroviral treatment in public sector
facilities, although this was stil l less than 20 per cent of
those estimated to need thiS treatment. About 10 per
cent of children needing treatment were receiving it.
Obstacles to access to treatment included severe
shortages of skilled medical staff. The JOint Civil Society
Monitoring Forum reported in November that
additional obstacles included "under-spending" of
HIV /AIDS budgets by provincial departments of health,
Amnesty International Report 2006

SPA

a scarcity of appropriate drugs and treatment
programmes for H IV-positive children, and a lack of
national political leadership.

Violence agai nst women
Police statistics for the year April 2004 to March 2005
recorded 55, 1 1 4 reported rapes, an increase of 4.5 per
cent over the previous year. Nationally, 40.8 per cent of
the reported rapes were committed against minors and
children.
In the period 2004/2005 the National Prosecuting
Authority continued to develop dedicated sexual
offences courts. The conviction rate in rape cases heard
in these courts was at least 62 per cent, about 20 per
cent higher than in the ordinary courts, which heard the
bulk of cases.
Organizations involved in assisting survivors of
sexual violence expressed concern at the continuing
delays in the finalization of the Sexual Offences Bill,
introduced in parliament in 2003 but referred back to
the Department of Justice in early 2004.
a On 6 December, former Deputy President Jacob
Zuma was charged in the Johannesburg Magistrate's
Court with the rape of a 3 1 -year-old woman. He was
released on bail and the trial postponed until
February 2006.
a On 8 December,  dile Ntumbukana was
convicted of the rape and murder of Lorna M lofana, a
member of the TAC executive committee in Khayelitsha,
Cape Town, in December 200). She was beaten to death
after tel ling him that she was HIV positive.
a At the end of the year a Free State police officer
was still on trial for the repeated rape of a woman
detainee in custody at Smith field police station; the
woman became pregnant as a result.
Two rulings by the Constitutional Court strengthened
the protection of women's rights.
a On 13 J une the Court ruled that a woman, referred
to as N. K., who had been raped by three police officers
while on duty, could sue the Minister of Safety and
Security for damages. The Court held that in
"committing the crime, the policemen not only did not
protect the applicant, they infringed her rights to
dignity and security of the person. In so doing, their
employer's Ithe Minister's1 obligation (and theirs) to
prevent crime was not met".
a On 7 November the Court upheld the
constitutionality of Section 8 in the Domestic Violence
Act which allows a court issuing a protection order to
authorize a warrant of arrest in the absence and
without the knowledge of the respondent.
Impunity
I n September the Constitutional Court confirmed the
State's right to re-indict Or Wouter Basson, the former
head of the military's covert chemical and biological
warfare programme in the 1980s. The charges related to
conspiracies to murder "enemies" of the then
government outside the borders of the country. The
charges had been quashed in 1999 by the trial judge.
In November the Butterworth Circuit Court
sentenced two former members of the Security Police,
Amnesty I nternational Report 2006

Pumelele Gumengu and Aron Tyani, to 20 years'
imprisonment each for the murder of an ANC
supporter, Sthembele Zokwe, in January 1988. They
were also convicted of the attempted murder of
Sthembele Zokwe in 1 987. On 27 March 2000 the
Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission had rejected their applications for
amnesty on the grounds that they had failed to make
ful l disclosure, as required under the legislation, in
relation to both incidents.

Discri mination and sexual identity
On I December the Constitutional Court ruled that the
definition of marriage under the common law was
inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid to the
extent that it does not permit same-sex couples to
enjoy the same rights accorded to heterosexual
couples. Section 30 (I) of the 1961 Marriage Act was
invalid also to the extent that It omits the gender­
neutral term "or spouse". The effect of the ruling was
suspended for 12 months to a llow Parliament to correct
the defects.

SPA

force or ill-treatment by the Spanish and Moroccan
secu rity forces. Conditions in some detention centres
for minors were so poor as to a mount to
"institutional ill-treatment".
Background
The Basque armed group Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA)
claimed responsibility for 24 attacks on business and
tourist Interests in Spain during 2005. I n most cases, it
used small explosive deVices, causing minor injuries
and damage to property. At least 42 people were mjured
at a convention centre in Madrid on 9 February,
includmg at least five police officers, when a car bomb
exploded hours before a scheduled visit by KingJ uan
Carlos I and Queen Sofia. ETA had given a 30-minute
warning by telephone to a newspaper. On 25 May, a car
bomb planted by ETA in a Madrid street left 52 people
mjured. On 21 November a mass trial of 56 defendants
(initiated in 1998 by judge Baltasar Garz6n) opened
before the National Crimmal Court. The defendants
were accused of bemg members of groups that
provided finanCial, informationa l, political and other
support to ETA.
On 17 May the lower chamber of parl iament
authorized the government to open talks with ETA
i f It abandoned its armed struggle.
On 7 February a programme was launched to grant
amnesty to up to 800, 000 undocumented migrants.
Under regulations introduced in December 2004,
migrants who could prove they were in Spain before
August 2004, and who had a job contract and no
criminal record, had three months to sign up as
taxpayers and obtain rights of residence.
On 30 June parliament passed a law al lowing same­
sex marriages. The new law also gave all married same­
sex couples the rights of inheritance previously al lowed
only to married men and women, and the right to adopt
children.
On 9 November the Council of Europe's
Commissioner for Human Rights presented the report
on his March visit to Spain. He criticized the restriction
that prevented lawyers interviewing some prisoners in
private and the mechanisms for compensating victims
of torture or ill-treatment.
In December Spain ratified the Optional Protocol to
the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
which it had signed in April.
Violence against women
In January a law on gender-based violence, adopted in
December 2004, came into force. The law sought to
bring together in a single instrument measures to
prevent, assist and protect victims of violence as well
as measures to prosecute, investigate and punish any
offence committed. The law ensured the right for
victims who lodge formal complaints to receive
comprehensive assistance, including legal aid and
access to health services and hOUSing. For the first time,
the law recognized that there are certain groups of
women who are at greater risk of suffering gender­
based violence.
238

In June, 17 courts dedicated solely to cases of gender­
based violence began hearing cases, with an additional
433 courts empowered to hear domestic abuse cases.
However, while strengthening protections against
violence in the family, implementation of the new law
was not as effective as had been hoped, resulting in an
additional burden placed on the victim to actively
pursue their formal complaint and demand formal
measures for their own protection be set in motion.
Further, only 5 per cent of women who suffered gender­
based violence registered complaints, and many of
those faced indifference by government authorities or
suffered insensitive interrogations discouraging them
from pursuing their case.
Survivors of domestic violence continued to
experience conSiderable obstacles in obtaining
assistance, protection and justice. Prejudice and
discriminatory practices in public institutions and a
lack of coordination between responsible government
bodies increased the impediments for the most
vulnerable groups, particularly undocumented migrant
women, Roma women, and women with disabi lities,
mental disorders or addictions.
During 2005 the Ministry of the Interior introduced a
protocol that provided, in conjunction with the Law on
Aliens, that the immigration authorities should proceed
with administrative sanctions and expulsion
proceedings in the case of female irregular migrants
who had sought protection as victims of gender-based
violence after their claims were registered. In
November, AI asked for the protocol to be withdrawn
on the grounds that it constituted unlawful
discrimination.

Killing and i ll-treatment of migrants
People fleeing violence, injustice and deprivation who
succeeded in crossing Spain's southern borders in
North Africa, the Canary Islands and AndalUSia
continued to face obstacles in accessing asylum
processes. Asylum-seekers were denied the necessary
guidance and legal support. In Ceuta and Melilla,
migrants were held in overcrowded holding centres
and many were unlawfully returned to Morocco.
Harassment of migrants in unofficial camps in
Morocco and moves to raise the height of perimeter
fencing around Ceuta and Melilla prompted mass
attempts to cross the border into Spanish territory from
late August. At least 13 migrants died and scores were
injured, many of them reportedly as a result of
excessive force or ill-treatment by Spanish and
Moroccan security forces. Despite PreSident Zapatero's
announcement of a joint investigation by the
authorities in both countries, this appeared not to have
started by the end of 2005.
In late September, Spanish authorities deployed 480
additional soldiers to guard the borders. During that
same period, nearly 2,000 migrants and asylum­
seekers who succeeded in entering Ceuta and Melilla
were held in temporary holding facil ities. Others were
unlawfully expelled. In October, the Moroccan
authorities reportedly bussed hundreds of men, women
and children to the border with Algeria. In that same
Amnesty International Report 2006

SPA

month, the International aid organization Medeclns
Sans Frontieres reported finding more than 500
migrants, some handcuffed together, abandoned in the
desert by the Moroccan authorities without food or
water.
a Ayukabangjoseph Abunaw, aged 3 1 , was reportedly
killed when forces of the Civil Guard fired rubber
bullets at close range at several hundred migrants
climbing over perimeter fencing at Melilla at about 3am
on 29 August. EyeWitnesses said that Civil Guard
officers beat Ayukabangjoseph Abunaw with rifle butts
and dragged him back into Moroccan territory. He
reportedly died several hours later. Medecins Sans
Frontieres, in a preliminary examination, found a
bruise on his chest typical of injuries caused by rubber
bullets. According to an autopsy by the Moroccan
authorities, the cause of death was internal bleeding
from an injury to the liver.
a Four men from sub-Saharan Africa died and several
others were seriously injured during the night of 28
September when several hundred people were
confronted by Spanish and Moroccan security forces as
they climbed razor-wire fencing around Ceuta.
According to reports, two bodies on the Spanish side
and two on the Moroccan Side all had bullet wounds.
The Civil Guard said bullets in the bodies on Spanish
territory were not of the type used by their forces.
A On 28 December 2004, several people were il legally
expelled, including asylum-seekers who had already
entered Spain, one of whom was a 15-year-old minor
from Guinea Conakry who suffered abuse. I n May 2005
the I nterior Ministry admitted that the minor had been
summarily expelled because he was found between the
two fences In Ceuta.

Use of tasers: death in custody
In February the Civi l Guard stated that taser guns and
other electro-shock weapons were not in offiCial use.
The I nterior Ministry said in April that no such weapon
had been acquired, but conceded that "there [were[ no
speCific rules regulating the possible abuses of this type
of weapon" .
However, such weapons were reported to have
been imported and used by the Civil Guard Special
Intervention Unit, and local police forces in the
Canary I slands, Espartinas (Sevi lle) and Alcala de
Xivert (CasteIl6n). One detainee a l legedly died as a
resu lt of excessive force that included Inappropriate
use of a taser.
a juan Martinez Galdeano died while detained by
the Civil Guard in Roquetas de Mar (Almeria) on 24
jUly. An interna l investigation reported that closed
circuit television footage showed that a baton and a
taser had been used to restrain him. An autopsy
revealed a causal link between the detainee's death
from "acute respiratory or cardlo-resplratory
insuffiCiency" and hiS treatment in detention. He had
cuffs on both hands and feet, and hiS body bore
numerous injuries consistent With being struck by a
baton. Two officers were Indicted on charges
including causing death by negligence and inhuman
and degrading treatment.

Il l-treatment of minors in detention
Concerns about the conditions in detention centres for
minors were raised In a report of the national
Ombudsperson. The decrepit and unhealthy state of
many centres did not comply with national law and
regulations on the imprisonment of children. The
Educational Centre for Child Offenders In Melilla was
recommended for immediate closure in the report. It had
a dilapidated structure, small and poorly lit cells, and
only one small outdoor courtyard. Conditions in child
detention facilities around Madrid were little better.
They were overcrowded, had poor sanitary facilities and
lacked basic furniture such as beds and tables.
In April the Ombudsperson for the Autonomous
Community of the Canary Islands condemned
"institutional i ll-treatment" of minors in the Canary
Islands. In june the first assistant to the national
Ombudsperson requested the immediate closure of the
detention centre in Galdar on Gran Canaria, where
conditions were particularly insanitary. The same
recommendation was made by the Council of Europe's
Commissioner for Human Rights.

The ceasefire between the government and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LITE) remained in
place despite numerous violations and a
deteriorating relationship between the two pa rties.
Escalating political killi ngs, child recruitment,
a bductions a nd armed clashes created a climate of
fear in the east, spreading to the north by the end of
the year, while a nationwide state of emergency was
in place for much of 2005. Hundreds of thousands of
people remained displaced. Violence against women
was reported, including from displaced people's
camps. There were threats to reintroduce the death
penalty and numerous reports of torture in police
custody.
Background
The year began with massive efforts to provide
emergency relief to the I million people displaced by
the tsunami. However, initial co-operation gave way
to wrangling, as the LITE accused the government of
discriminating against the north and east in the
distribution of aid and a llegations emerged that
various parties were obstructing and diverting aid. In
January the government declared a state of
emergency and a coastal buffer zone in which
rebui lding was not permitted, resu lting in thousands
of coastal communities being relocated inland.
Despite growing violence in the east, hopes for a
return to peace negotiations rose as, in May, the
government and the LITE reached an agreement to
jointly manage the distribution of tsunami aid. In June
the People's Liberation Front (Janatha Vimukthi
Peramuna, jVP) withdrew from the government
coalition in protest at the agreement. Following a
petition lodged by the jVP in july, the Supreme Court
put a stay order on some elements of the agreement,
effectively blocking its implementation and resulting in
a further deterioration in the relationship between the
LITE and the government.
There was an escalation of violence and insecurity in
the east and north throughout 2005, with a large
number of killings and frequent ambushes and
skirmishes, involving the LITE, a breakaway LITE
faction led by Colonel Karuna, and the Sri Lankan Army.
On 12 August the foreign minister, Lakshman
Kadirgamar, was assassinated, reportedly by the LITE.
In response the government announced a state of
240

emergency and asked the LITE to discuss the ceasefire
agreement. However, the talks did not take place.
Presidential elections on 17 November brought to
power the former Prime Minister, Mahinda Rajapakse.

Politically motivated killings
There were large numbers of politically motivated
killings, primarily in the east but increasingly also in the
north. The majority were apparently committed by the
LITE, which assassinated civil ians, members of rival
paramilitary groups and security force personnel.
Members of the breakaway Karuna faction also killed
civilians and LITE cadres. The LITE accused the security
forces of supporting the Karuna faction. The security
forces were reportedly responsible for a number of
extrajudicial executions of civilians.
In addition to targeted assassinations, there were
numerous attacks on security force posts, LITE offices
and other sensitive targets. The high level of violence
created an atmosphere of fear and insecurity for
civilians.
A number of high-profile individuals were
assassinated. Foreign M inister Lakshman Kadirgamar
was killed in Colombo on 12 August, reportedly by the
LITE. Ariyanayagam Chandra Nehru, a member of the
North East Secretariat on Human Rights (NESOHR) and
a former Tamil National Al liance (TNA) member of
parliament, and Kaushalyan, the LITE political head for
Batticaloa and Ampara, were killed during an ambush
on 7 February, reportedly by the Karuna faction. joseph
Pararajasingam, a member of parliament and of the
NESOHR, was shot dead by unknown assailants on 24
December in Batticaloa.
In December, during a visit to Sri Lanka, the UN
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or
arbitrary executions stated that extrajudicial kills
were 'violating the right to life of a large number of Sri
Lankans from all ethnic groups, and by undermining the
peace process, putting at risk the lives of many more."
a Dharmeratnam Sivaram, a Tamil journalist close to
the LITE, was abducted and killed in Colombo on 28
April . He had been gagged and shot in the head.
a Kanapathy Rajadurai, Principal of jaffna Central
College, was shot and killed on 12 October in jaffna
town. He was reportedly kil led by the LITE.
Internally displaced people
At the beginning of 2005, an estimated I million people
were displaced by the tsunami and by September
approximately 450,000 of these remained displaced,
living in temporary shelters.
In response to the tsunami the government
established a coastal buffer zone, set at 100 metres from
the average high water line in the south and west, and
200 metres in the north and east. It was announced that
no rebuilding was permitted in this buffer zone apart
from certain exceptions (including tourist facilities) and
that communities who had lived in the buffer zone would
be relocated inland. By the middle of 2005 most of these
communities remained in temporary shelters awaiting
land to be identified for relocation. Coastal communities
expressed concern that the forced relocation would

SRI

erode their livelihoods and way of life. In addition, the
large-scale relocation that followed the tsunami
Increased existing ethnic conflicts over land. Concerns
were also raised that people displaced by the tsunami
were treated differently on the basis of their ethnicity
and regional location.
Approximately 350,000 people remained displaced
by the conflict. These Internally displaced persons
(I DPs) had been unable to return home following the
2002 ceasefire for a number of reasons, including high­
securIty zones, lack of available land for resettlement
and landmines. Many were living in government-run
camps in very cramped conditions with little privacy.
Concern was expressed by the National Human Rights
Commission in April at the lack of support and solutions
available for people displaced by the conflict in
comparison with people displaced by the tsunami.
However, there were some indications that the focus on
displacement following the tsunami helped to increase
support for conflict l OPs.

Child soldiers
Following a short lull after the tsunami, reports of child
recruitment by the LTIE rose, peaking i n j u ly, when 97
cases were reported to the UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF). Although a small number of children were
released by the LTIE during 2005, the LTIE failed to live
up to its commitments under the Action Plan for
Children Affected by War to end recruitment and
comprehensively release the children within its ranks.
In the face of these challenges, UN ICEF began a review
of the Action Plan.
It was reported mid-year that the LTIE was forcing all
Vil lagers within its terrttory between the ages of 15 and

certain crimes. However, in july, the justice Ministry
and Attorney General recommended that the death
penalty be implemented in the case of three men
convicted of the rape and murder of Rita John. These
death sentences were not carried out by the end of the
year.
In july, the Commissioner General of Prisons
reported that there were approximately 100 prIsoners
on death row.

Violence aga inst women
I nCidents of sexual and domestic violence were
reported throughout 2005, including sexual and
domestic violence against women lIving in tsunami l O P
camps. Women's groups expressed concern that the
facilities in these camps did not provide security and
made women vulnerable to violence. High levels of
domestic violence were reported in some camps.

Tortu re by police
Despite the announcement by the National Police
Commission (NPC) in August 2004 that addressing
torture by police would be its top priority, during 2005
there were numerous reports of torture in police
custody, sometimes resulting in deaths. There was little
attempt to prosecute police officers responsible for
torture or to prOVide compensation for torture victims.

Grave a buses of human rights by government forces,
government-allied militias and a rmed political
groups continued in Darfur, western Sudan. Both
government-allied forces a nd, at times, armed
political groups attacked humanita ria n workers a nd
other civilians. Suspected sympathizers of armed
political groups in Da rfur were a rbitrarily detained,
as were human rig hts activists a nd members of
political groups throughout northern Sudan. The new
Government of National Unity, formed in July
following a comprehensive peace agreement in
January, lifted the state of emergency, in force since
1 989, except in eastern Sudan a nd Da rfur. A new
Interim Constitution, in effect from J uly,
incorporated many positive human rights provisions
but reta ined the death pena lty, including for mi nors,
a nd failed to remove immunity from prosecution for
senior officials responsible for wa r crimes or crimes
against humanity. Hundreds of political prisoners
continued to be held arbitrarily in Khartoum.
Arbitrary a rrests, incommunicado detention, torture
and restrictions on freedom of expression persisted,
aimed in particular at human rights defenders,
student activists and internally displaced people in
and around Khartoum.
Background
There was continuing conflict in Darfur. The
government agreed a Declaration of Principles to
resolve the conflict with two armed political groups in
july, but the ceasefire was widely breached and a
lasting settlement remained remote. African Union
(AU) forces deployed in the region were still not at full
strength.
The I nternational Criminal Court (lCC), based on a
referral by the UN Security Council, began to
investigate the situation in Darfur, but by the end of
2005 had not been granted access to Sudan. Sudan
established a national court for conflict-related crimes
in Darfur, claiming this would obviate the need for the
ICe. However, the authorities failed to investigate or
prosecute more than a few of those suspected of crimes
against humanity and war crimes in Darfur. The AU did
not enter Into a co-operation agreement with the ICe,
and the Security Council did not take any further action
to Implement Resolution 1593 (see below).
A Comprehensive Peace Agreement, ending decades
of civil war between the north and south, was signed on
9 January. The peace held, a lthough certain southern
242

militias excluded from the peace agreement continued
to fight. The presence of the Ugandan armed political
group the Lord's Resistance Army increased in south
Sudan, as did the number of attacks it mounted against
civilians and, occasionally, humanitarian workers.
More than three million internally displaced people
(I DPs) and half a million refugees were expected to
return to the south.
On 24 March the UN Security Council established the
UN Mission in Sudan (UNM IS), with the task of
supporting the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and
providing support to the AU mission in Darfur.
The death in late july of John Garang de Mabior, head
of the government of South Sudan and first Vice­
President in the new Government of National Unity,
resulted in widespread rioting in Khartoum and juba.
He was succeeded by Salva Kiir. As many as 130 people
died in the violence and over 1 , 500 people were
arrested in Khartoum.
In the east, where unrest continued to simmer, two
armed pol itical groups, the Beja Congress and the Free
Lions, merged in February to form the Eastern Front.

Darfur
War crimes and crimes against humanity continued to
be committed by the government and government­
aligned nomadic militias known as the janjawid. War
crimes were also committed by armed political groups
opposed to the government. Civi lians were kil led and
injured by government troops, who sometimes bombed
villages from the air, by janjawid militias and in attacks
by armed political groups. Women and girls continued
to be sexually assaulted and abducted by government­
aligned militias and, occasionally, government forces.
After a major government offensive in january,
violence declined until April, then stabilized before
rising again in late August. Government human rights
violations against human rights activists continued.
Abuses by armed political groups increased as their
command structures broke down as a result of growing
factionalism and in-fighting. Such groups also
increasingly harassed humanitarian workers.
Peacekeeping troops of the AU Mission in Sudan (AM IS)
suffered attacks, including kidnappings, by
government-backed mil itias and some factions of the
armed political groups.
a On 7 April more than 350 militiamen attacked and
destroyed the village of Khor Abeche in south Darfur.
An unknown number of unarmed civilians were kil led
or injured.
a On 30 May the authorities briefly detained Paul
Foreman, head of the international non­
governmental organization (NGO) Medecins Sans
Frontieres-Holland. They charged him with crimes
against the state for publishing an allegedly false
report on rape in Darfur, and sought to compel him to
disclose the names of confidential sources.
a On 29 September, three members of the
national NGO, the Sudan Social Development
Organization, were abducted from Zam Zam IDP camp,
north Darfur, by the Sudan Liberation Army, an armed
political group.
Amnesty International Report 2006

Torture was widespread. In particular, suspected
supporters of armed political groups and people within
IDP camps were arbitrarily detained and tortured.
a On 14 March, military intelligence arrested Bakheet
Alhaj from Sanya Afondu IDP camp. He was reportedly
held in a hole in the ground for 13 days, flogged and
beaten with gun butts. On 7 April he was remanded in
custody to await trial.

I nterna lly displaced people
More than 1.8 million people remained forcibly
displaced internal ly, and 220,000 refugees were stil l in
Chad. I DPs travelled from rural areas to settlements
around towns and vil lages in Darfur fleeing attacks.
Even within IDP camps, security was jeopardized by
Janjawid militias and government forces.
a On 19 May police shot dead three people and
mjured 10 others in Kalma IDP camp in Nyala, south
Darfur. The next day there were violent clashes
between police and people living in the camp.
On 25 May the security forces attacked lam lam
I DP camp near El Fasher town m north Darfur. They
reportedly fired mdlscriminately, killing Mohamed
Adam Khatlr and mjUrlng seven others.
a On 28 September, Janjawid militia forces attacked
the I D P camp of Aro Sharow, killing 35 people and
wounding 10, which forced over 4,000 to flee.

I nternational initiatives on Darfur
A UN-appointed commission of inquiry reported in
January that crimes against humanity and war crimes
had been committed in Darfur by government and
government-aligned mil itia, and that the Sudanese
justice system was unable and unwilling to address the
situation.
On 31 March the UN Security Council passed
Resolution 1593, referring the situation m Darfur to the
ICe. The resolution required Sudan and all other parties
to the conflict to co-operate with the court. However,
as a result of US pressure, a provision was inserted in
the resolution to exempt nationals of states not party
to the Rome Statute of the ICC (other than Sudan) from
the jurisdiction of the ICe.
The African Commission on Human and Peoples'
Rights did not make public the report of its July 2004
missIOn to Sudan, apparently because it was waiting for
the Sudanese government to respond, despite the
government's prevIous failure to co-operate on this
Issue.

Arbitrary arrests, torture and use of force
Freedom of expression continued to be repressed, with
widespread arbitrary arrests, incommunicado
detention and torture. Promment among the victims
were political activists, human rights defenders,
student leaders and IDPs m and around Khartoum.
Members ofthe political opposition
a Following demonstrations m Port Sudan m which
more than 20 people were reportedly kil led, 17
members of the political wmg of the Beja Congress were
detained in January and February. They were released
without charge in May and June.
a Supporters of the Popular Congress party arrested
in September 2004 remained imprisoned. The
Amnesty International Report 2006

government did not make public the findmgs of
inquiries promised after the deaths of two Popular
Congress student activists m 2004, reportedly as a
result of being beaten after arrest.
a The Umma National Party headquarters in
Omdurman was raided and temporarily closed in April .
On 15 April, three student members of the party - Idriss
Mohamed Idriss, Abu Bakr Dafallah Musa and Omar
Dafallah Musa - were arrested by the security forces
near AI Kalaklah central market, Khartoum, and
reportedly badly beaten. They had been putting up
posters. They were charged with causmg a public
disturbance and denied bai l.

Human rights defenders
Human rights defenders and their organizations
continued to face harassment and repressIOn.
a The government initiated legal proceedmgs against
one of the country's leading human rights groups, the
Sudan Organisation Against Torture (SOAT), in an
apparent attempt to silence it. The Bureau of Crimes
Agamst the State reportedly began proceedmgs for
spreading false information at the end of August, but
did not inform the organization. Its members, charged
with disclosing military information, propagating false
news and public order offences, could face more than
five years' imprisonment.
a Prominent human rights activist Mudawi Ibrahlm
was arrested on 24 January, went on hunger strike and
was detained without charge until 3 March. On 8 May he
was again arrested while leaving Sudan to receive a
Front Line Defenders award from the President of
I reland. After considerable international pressure, he
was released uncharged on 17 May.
Adil Abdallah Nasr a l-Dm, the Director of a
branch of the non-governmental Sudan Social
Development Organization in lalengel, west Darfur,
was released on 19 April . He had been arrested m
September 2004 and detamed without charge or trial
for four months, first in a n unofficial detention centre
near Kober prison in Khartoum and then for two
months in Debek prison, north of Khartoum. He was
reported to have been regularly beaten and tied up
durmg his detention.

Students
Many student activists were arrested and beaten by
police and other security forces. At least one was shot
dead by police.
a On 11 April, Nagmeldin Gafar Adam Eisa, a student
activist at Dillmg University m Kordofan, died a fter
being shot by the police on university premises during a
protest against the conduct of student union elections.
Police fired tear gas and live ammunition at the
demonstrating students.
Cl On 19 April students demonstrating at El Fasher
University in favour of UN Security Council Resolution
1593, were attacked by police and other security forces
usmg tear gas and stun grenades and firing shots in the
air. Four students were arrested, charged With public
order offences, tried and acquitted. Another
demonstration at the university, on 21 April, culminated

of police firing gunshots to disperse the crowd. Police

reportedly refused to a llow the seriously injured
student, who was accompanied by AU personnel,
passage to a hospital.

Restrictions on freedom of the press
Newspapers continued to be heavily censored,
particularly in relation to Darfur. The news media were
instructed not to comment on UN Security Council
Resolution 1593. Several newspapers were suspended
temporarily or permanently after publishing articles
considered CrItical of the authorities. Journalists were
harassed.
a In June the Khartoum Monitorwas notified that its
licence had been revoked by the High Court in 200). The
newspaper had successful ly appealed against the
closure at the time, but the National Security Services
had appealed to have that decision overturned on four
separate occasions without informing the newspaper.
a On 9 May the authorities briefly suspended
al- Wifaq daily newspaper and fined the publication
8 million Sudanese pounds (about US$J.500) for
publIshing articles deemed blasphemous. The capital
charge of blasphemy was brought against the editor,
Mohamed Taha Mohamed Ahmed, but withdrawn soon
afterwards.
Displaced people in and a round Khartoum
The government forcibly relocated large numbers of
l O Ps living in and around Khartoum. Many had fled
conflict and extreme deprivation in the south and
Darfur; others were from marginalized communities
throughout Sudan. The involuntary relocations
sometimes led to violent clashes and mass arrests.
Despite promises in July by the Governor of Khartoum
State to consult With donors and UN agencies before
relocatIng camps, settlements and groups of people,
forcible relocation without warning continued.
a On 18 May fighting broke out between lOPs and
police over the proposed relocation of the Soba Aradi
l OP camp. Fourteen police officers and up to 30 l O Ps
were killed. On 24 May police arrested large numbers of
lOPs. Mohammed Daw al Beit and three others arrested
reportedly died in police custody.
a On 17 August armed police surrounded the Shikan
lOP camp located in Omdurman, Khartoum. They
arrived with lorries and emptied the entire camp of its
residents. The majority of residents were moved to
Fatah I I I camp, where basic services were lacking.
Those relocated reported abuses by security forces
during the relocation.

inside homes. At least 20 people were kil led. A simi lar
protest in Kassal a town reportedly resulted in arrests
and the beating of two students by the security forces.
Two investigations were set up, but their findings were
not made public.
a The Eastern Front, an armed political group,
abducted three ruling party politicians on 24 May. They
were released in early September.

Over a quarter of the population faced severe food

Constitution was adopted amid continuing political
tensions. Victims of forced evictions were still u nable
to access their rights. Reported rapes a nd other
forms of sexual abuse of women and girls i ncreased,
but the government proposed legislative reforms to
improve access to justice. Reports of torture, ill­
treatment a nd misuse of lethal force by members of

for the victims. limitations on freedoms of assembly
and association included the suppression of
demonstrations by force. Three people were u nder
sentence of death. A draft law proposed creating 1 4
new death penalty offences.
Legal a nd constitutional developments
In June a new Constitution was adopted by parliament.
Civil society organizations expressed concern at
obstacles to public involvement i n the drafting and
adoption of the Constitution and at provisions
entrenching the King's extensive powers and limiting
the exercise of certai n rights.
On 26 July the King assented to the new
Constitution, which was then publ ished in the
Government Gazette as law. However, the King failed
to issue a decree repealing the Proclamation of 12
April 1973, which vested all legislative, executive and
judicial powers in the King and banned political
parties. Government officials claimed that the
Constitution was not yet I n force. In a test case heard
In the High Court in December, lawyers representing
members of the I ndustrial Court argued that the

The operations of the Judicial Services Commission
were revived, and on Its advice the King appointed three

government refused to accept a petition from the
Dlamini clan of KaMkhweli for the unconditional

return of Chief Mtfuso, in exile In South Africa, as
required under the Court ruling.

Violence aga inst women a nd girls
I n November a draft Sexual O ffences and Domestic
Violence Bill was issued in response to increasing
concerns about sexual violence against women and
young children. The B i l l sought to redefine the crime
of rape, criminal ize marital rape, and i ntroduce
protection for "vulnerable witnesses· as well as new
civil law remedies for those at risk of domestic
violence. However, i t also proposed 1 4 new capital
offences.
In October police offiCials confirmed an Increase
since 2002 in reported rapes of women and children
below 12 years of age. Over half the 544 rape cases
reported to police by July involved minors under 1 8
years a n d young children. The Swaziland Action Group
Against Abuse (SWAGAA), a non-governmental
organization, dealt with an average of 2 1 cases of rape
and sexual abuse a month in the first 10 months of the
year. Perpetrators included family members and
teachers. The Commissioner of Police established the
Domestic Violence and Child Sexual Abuse unit in an
attempt to Improve police response to these crimes.
The new Constitution guaranteed women equality
under the law, except in the "cultural" sphere.
However, in a separate clause, which failed to fully
protect women's rights, a woman could "not be
compelled to undergo or uphold any custom to which
she is i n conscience opposed".
Access to hea Ith ca re
An H I V prevalence rate of 42.6 per cent was reported
among women attending antenatal clinics. The U N
Programme o n H I V/ A I DS (UNAIDS) a n d the M inistry of
Health and Social Welfare reported that 56 per cent of
pregnant women aged 25 to 29 were H IV-positive. I n
March, 8, 373 people were receiving antiretrovlral
therapy, 23 per cent of those estimated to need it,
according to the World Health Organization and
UNAIDS. The drug treatment was free, but shortages
were reported at certain hospitals. Access to
voluntary counse l l i ng and testing i mproved.
There were concerns that the proposal In the Sexual
Offences and Domestic Violence Bill, to provide a
mandatory death penalty for "intentionally" transmitting
HIV through "unprotected sex With another person",
would increase the stigma associated With H I V/AIDS and
discourage people from learning their status.

Torture and misuse of lethal force
a In January the Prime Minister released the
Coroner's report into the death in custody of
Madlenkhosi Ngubeni on 22 May 2004. The Coroner
concluded that he had been tortured, possibly by
suffocation methods, by the police, who had also
negligently failed to obtain urgent medical care. The
Coroner also recommended that police officers who
had tortured him and other detainees be investigated
for possible prosecution, and that measures were
taken to Improve police professionalism. I n
November, in response t o a civil claim for damages
Instituted by Madlenkhosi Ngubeni's family, the
government denied in court papers any responsibi lity
for his death.
There were further reports of torture, beatings and
the misuse of lethal force by the police against crime
suspects and political activists, and by game rangers,
who have Immunity from prosecution under the Game
Amendment Act, against members of rural communities
accused of Il legal hunting.
a Zwelithlnl Mamba and Andreas Tsabedze, charged
with contravening the Game Amendment Act, alleged
in the Mbabane Magistrate's court that they had been
severely caned and beaten by game rangers when they
were arrested in Mli lwane Game Park in July.
Cl Steven Thwala, arrested on 17 August and
convicted a week later of assaulting a police officer,
alleged in court that he had been handcuffed and
subjected to suffocation torture. He Instituted a civil
action against the police for the assault.
a Police investigating petrol bombings of three
police officers' homes arrested supporters of banned
organizations. Mabandla Gama, a member of the
Swaziland Youth Congress (SWAYOCO), was questioned
at Mbabane police station on the evening of 2
November. After returning home later that night, he
was reportedly taken again from his Nkwalini home by
six plain-clothes officers, and beaten and interrogated
for several hours before being left at a bus station. He
required treatment in hospital for his injuries.
a On 24 May, Charles Mabuza was shot dead by police
who had come to his home to arrest his brother,
Mfanzile Mabuza, for il legal possession of a pistol.
Mfanzile Mabuza and a police officer, Sergeant
Mfanasibili Dlamini, died in an exchange of gunfire.
I nitially the police said Charles Mabuza had been shot
dead by his brother, and arranged a hasty official post­
mortem without the presence of a family
representative. After intervention by the family's
lawyer, a second post-mortem was conducted by an
Independent forensIc pathologist. The physical and
ballistiC evidence confirmed that Charles Mabuza died
from injuries caused by high velocity gunshot
consistent with that used in a police-issue R4/R5 assault
rifle. No criminal or disciplinary steps against any
police officer had been taken by the end of 2005.
a In December the Siteki Magistrate's Court ordered
the police to take detainee Mdudusi Mamba to hospital
for examination and treatment after he complained in
court that he had been subjected to suffocation torture
and beaten while suspended. He was charged with
246

treason and attempted murder in connection with
petrol bombings of government infrastructure, and
remanded in custody.

Freedom of assembly attacked
a In August, Roland Rudd and Lynn Dingani
Mazibuko, members of the Swaziland Agricultural and
Plantation Workers Union, were acquitted of charges
under the Arms and Ammunition Act in connection with
a trade union demonstration in August 2003- Another
accused, Alex Langwenya (see below), had been
acquitted in December 2004.
Police used excessive force against unarmed
demonstrators in a number of incidents.
a On 8 September police fired tear gas without
sufficient warning at university students, i njuri ng at
least 10, including Khumbuzile Nkambule, who was
hit in the face by a tear gas canister. The students had
gathered outside the government's Cabinet Offices to
protest at drastic reductions in the number of
student scholarships. Khumbuzile Nkambule and
others required hospital treatment. On 12 September
the Deputy Commissioner of Police announced an
inquiry by the police Complaints and Discipline Unit.
No results were announced by the end of 2005. The
student complainants expressed concern that no
inquiry had been conducted by an independent body.
Demonstrations by opposition organizations were
broken up by police on the grounds that they remained
prohibited under the 1973 Proclamation.
a On I October tear gas and rubber bullets were used
to disperse a SWAYOCO rally in the Manzini area. Police
arrested seven SWAYOCO offiCials and members,
Including its president Alex Langwenya, who was
beaten with batons. On 3 October, Alex Langwenya and
Six others were charged wi th mal icious damage to
property. After several court appearances, they were
released on bail and the case was remanded but no trial
date was set.
Death pena lty
No new death sentences were imposed. Three
prisoners remained under sentence of death awaiting
the outcome of clemency appeals.
The new Constitution retained the death penalty but
stated that the punishment could not be mandatory.
However, the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence
Bill proposed 14 new offences carrying a mandatory
death penalty.

Decisions by the Swedish authorities to deport
foreign nationals were criticized by international
human rights bodies. Asylum-<ietermination
procedures continued to fall below international
sta ndards.
I nternational scrutiny
In May the UN CommIttee against Torture concluded
that the Swedish authorities' decIsion to deport a
BangladeshI woman and her daughter to Bangladesh
would amount to a breach of Sweden's obligation not to
forcIbly return a person to another state where they
would be at risk of torture. The woman and her then
four-year-old daughter had applied for asylum i n
Sweden in 2000. The Committee noted that the Swedish
authorities had not contested the fact that she had been
persecuted, detained and tortured, Including by being
raped. However, the Swedish immIgration authorities
considered that she had been raped by indivIdual
pohce officers, and had thus concluded that the
culprits' actIons were not sufficient to establish the
responsibi lity of the BangladeshI authorities.
In November, the European Court of Human Rights
held unanimously that the deportation of four
members of a Syrian family to SYria would amount to a
violation of their right to life and of the prohibition of
inhuman or degrading treatment. The case concerned a
Syrian national and his family who had been refused
asylum in Sweden on several occasions. In 2003 the
princIpal applicant had been convicted in absentia by a
Syrian court of complicity in a murder, and sentenced
to death. Citing AI and other sources the European
Court of Human Rights stressed that the death penalty
was enforced for serious crimes i n SYria. In spIte of thIS,
the Swedish authOrities had considered that, upon hIs
return to Syria, his case would be reopened and a
retrial granted and had thus concluded that the family
were not i n need of protection.
'War on terror' deportations
In May the UN Committee against Torture concluded
that the Swedish government's expulsion of Ahmed
Hussein Mustafa Kami l Agiza from Sweden to Egypt i n
2001 breached the prohibition o f refoulement. The
Committee conSidered that the Swedish government
knew, or should have known, at the time of the
complainant's removal that the Egyptian authorities
resorted to consistent and widespread use of torture
against detainees and that the risk of such treatment
Amnesty International Report 2006

was partIcularly high in the case of detainees held for
pol itical and security reasons.
The CommIttee noted that the dIplomatIC assurances
procured by the Swedish government provided no
mechanism for their enforcement, and concluded that
they did not suffice to protect against the manifest risk
of torture. The Committee recalled that the prohibition
of refoulement was absolute, even in the context of
counter-terrorism measures. The CommIttee further
stated that the Swedish government had also breached
ItS obligations under the Convention by neither
disclOSing to the Committee relevant informatIon nor
presenting its concerns to the Committee for an
appropriate procedural deciSion.
The parliamentary ConstItutional Committee
concluded In September that the SwedIsh government
should not have accepted the Egyptian authorities'
diplomatic assurances, and that therefore it should not
have expelled Muhammad Muhammad Suleiman
Ibrahim EI-Zari and Ahmed Husseln Mustafa Kam i l
Agiza t o Egypt i n December 2001 . Hanan Attla, Ahmed
Hussein Mustafa Kamil Agiza's WIfe, and her five
children were granted refugee status according to the
UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

Refugees a nd asylu m-seekers
The Swedish authorities continued to conSider a
broad range of asylum appl ications to be "manifestly
unfounded", i ncluding those from Romani appl icants.
The accelerated asylum-determination procedures
fell far short of international standards for refugee
protectIon. The asylum applicants were not gIven a
ful l asylum interview and were, among other things,
dented access to legal aId. In addItIon, those whose
claims had been rejected could be forCIbly returned to
their home countries or a third country pending
appeal against an initial rejection of theIr claim.
Violence against women
In March, the government decided to establish a
commission to investigate why certain municipalities
had action plans for addressing violence against
women while others did not. The commIssion was also
to consider ways in which to make the municipahties
assume responSIbIlity for supporting women who had
been subjected to violence, includ i ng women with
speCIal needs. The results of the commIssion's work
were to be announced in June 2006.
Prison conditions
Overcrowding i n remand detention continued to be of
concern despite several measures taken by the SwedIsh
authorities to i mprove the situation. Reports of
detainees haVing to share cells intended for single
occupancy continued. The number of complaints
receIved by the JustIce Ombudsman regarding the
treatment of detainees was higher than i n recent years.

Allegations of ill-treatment, use of excessive force
a nd racist a buse by police officers continued. A
federal a mendment to the asylum law was proposed
which would violate the UN Refugee Convention by
limiting asylum-seekers' access to a n effective
asylum and appeals procedures. Although important
steps were taken by the legislature and police in
several cantons, domestic violence against women
remained a significant problem.
Police racism, ill-treatment and use of
excessive force
The UN Committee against Torture (CAT) and the
Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights
published their recommendations on Switzerland in
May and June respectively. Both recommended the
creation of an independent regional (cantonal) appeal
commissIOn that could examine complaints against
police forces. CAT also recommended that victims and
their families should be informed of their right to
pursue compensatIOn and that procedures should be
made more transparent. In this regard CAT requested
Information about what steps SWitzerland had taken to
compensate the families of two people who had died
during forcible deportation. The Commissioner
proposed that an observer should be present during
deportations of foreign nationals and insisted that
private security agencies should not be permitted to
manage deportations.
Following protests by a large number of international
and national institutions and organizations, the
government prohibited the use of electro-shock
weapons, including tasers, during forced deportations
of foreign citizens.
Some cantons took significant steps to prevent
human rights violations and introduced high human
rights standards i n poliCing.
Asylum
I n December, parliament proposed an amendment to
the federal asylum law, limiting access to an effective
asylum and appeal procedure for people who did not
have identity documents. It also proposed l imiting
access to social wel fare for rejected asylum-seekers,
even if they could not leave Switzerland immediately.
ThiS amendment, i f approved, risked exacerbating the
criminalization and inhuman treatment of asylum­
seekers whose appl ications for asylum have been
rejected. Asylum-seekers have consistently
248

complained about abuse and inhuman treatment by
cantonal migration offices and cantonal police corps.
In the canton of Soloth urn, for example, asylum­
seekers whose appl ications were rejected were
unable to access social welfare services until the
Federal court ruled that this practice was
unconstitutional.

Violence aga inst women
Domestic Violence remained prevalent throughout
Switzerland, despite the fact that the Swiss Penal Code
allows for the prosecution of crimes of domestic
violence, including rape, without an offiCial complaint
from the victim. Other aspects of domestic legislation
regarding Violence i n the home varied between
cantons.
A new federal law concerning foreign nationals gave
rise to concerns as it failed to protect victims of
domestic violence who were claSSified as non­
nationals. They had a right to stay in SWitzerland
independently of continued marriage or cohabitation
only if certain conditions were fulfilled, such as if they
had been reSident in Switzerland for at least three years
and had important personal reasons to remain in the
country. There were also concerns about the impact of
this law on non-nationals who were victims or
witnesses in cases of human trafficking, as the law did
not give these indiViduals the right to stay in
Switzerland. Cantons were, however, free to give them
permission to stay on humanitarian grounds.

Background
Syria became increasingly isolated after the
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Raftq
al-Hariri in Beirut on 14 February. I n May the UN
conftrmed that Syria had withdrawn its forces from
Lebanon. The state of emergency imposed in 1962
remained in force. The Association Agreement between
Syria and the European Union, which was initial led in
October 2004 and contains a human rights clause,
remained frozen at the final approval stage.
Releases of political prisoners
Up to 312 political prisoners, Including prisoners of
conscience, were ordered to be released on 30 March
under a presidential amnesty. Most were Kurds who
had been detained following violent disturbances in
north-eastern Syria in March 2004.
Some 190 political prisoners, including prisoners of
conscience, were released under a presidential amnesty
on 2 November. They included: 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Khayyir,
arrested in February 1992 and sentenced after an unfair
trial before the Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in
August 1995 to 22 years' imprisonment for membership of
the Party for Communist Action; Haythem al-Hamwi,
Muhammed Shehada, Yahya ShurbaJee and Mu'atez
Murad, community activists from Darya arrested in May
2003 and sentenced to between three and four years'
imprisonment after unfair trials before Field Military
Courts; and Mus'ab al-Hariri, who was arrested on 24July
2002, aged 14 or 15, shortly after he and his mother
returned to Syria after living In exile In Saudi Arabia.
Mus'ab al-Harirl had been sentenced by the SSSC on 19
June 2005 to six years' Imprisonment for alleged
membership of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Imprisonment for political reasons
Scores of people were arrested dUring the year for
political reasons, including tens of prISoners of
conscience. At least several hundred people, including
prisoners of conscience, remained imprisoned for
political reasons. Scores were brought to trial before
the SSSC and Military Courts, all of which suffer from a
gross lack of independence and Impartiality. Many of
those facing trial were suspected members or affiliates
of banned political parties such as the Kurdish
Democratic Union Party, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hizb
al-Tahrir, and the pro-Iraqi Arab Socialist Democratic
Ba'th Party.
Prisoners of conscience included:
a Six men, who were arrested in 2001 and sentenced
to up to 10 years' imprisonment after unfair trials in
2002 for their involvement in the "Damascus Spring"
pro-reform movement, remained in prison.
a Former "Damascus Spring" detainee Kamal al­
Labwani, who was released in September 2004 after
three years' ImprISonment, was rearrested on 8
November upon arrival In Damascus after several
months in Europe and the USA. Charges against him,
which related to his peaceful activities promoting
democracy and human rights, Included "weakening
national morale", "inciting strife" and "belonging to a
secret organization".
Amnesty International Report 2006

"':l 'All al-'Abdul lah was arrested on 15 May, a week
after he read a statement on behalf of the exiled Muslim
Brotherhood leader at the unauthorized Jamal al-Atassi
Forum. The Forum was then closed down by the
authorities. He was charged with "promoting an i llegal
organization". He was released under the presidential
amnesty on 2 November.
a Riad Drar was arrested on 4 June after he made a
speech at the funeral of IslamiC scholar Sheikh
Muhammad Ma'shuq al-Khiznawi. He faced charges
before the SSSC of "Inciting sectarian strife", a charge
commonly used against people promoting the rights of
SYrian Kurds. He remained held In solitary
confinement.

'War on terror' detentions a nd torture
Scores of Syrians remained in detention and were being
tried before the SSSC for al leged membership of a Salafi
Islamist organization and for alleged plans to carry out
acts of terrorism, including in Iraq. The detainees
Included 16 men from al-'Otaybe, who were arrested In
April 2004, and 24 men from Oatana, aged between 17
and 25, who were arrested I n J uly 2004. They were
reportedly tortured and ill-treated dUring long periods
of incommunicado detention. There were widespread
concerns that the arrests and trials were attempts by
the authorities to portray the country as under threat
from terrorism.
According to unconfirmed media reports emanating
from government sources, in 2005 the Syrian
authorllies arrested up to 1,500 people allegedly
seeking to fight alongside anti-US forces in I raq. Many
were reportedly returned to their country of origin.
Saudi Arabian media and human rights activists stated
from July that Saudi nationals had been detained and
tortured in Syria, from October 2003, before being
returned to Saudi Arabia.
Pregnant sisters Heba al-Khaled, 17, and Rola al­
Khaled, 20, and Nadia al-Satour and her baby, were
arrested on 3 September and held hostage by the
authOrities to put pressure on their husbands, alleged
Islamist militants, to give themselves up. They were
ftrst detained in the town of Hama, then transferred to
the Palestine Branch of Military Intell igence in
Damascus where they remained at the end of the year.
a Muhammad Haydar Zammar, a German national of
Syrian origin, remained detained incommunicado, at an
unknown location and Without charge, for a fourth
year, apparently on account of al leged links to al­
Oa'ida. The US security forces were reported ly involved
in his arrest and interrogation in Morocco In 200 1 , and
in his secret transfer to Syria one or two weeks later. He
was reportedly interrogated in Syria in November 2002
by agents of German intelligence and criminal
Investigation agencies.
In August and October, information was released
dUring an inquiry in Canada on the actions of
Canadian offiCials in relation to Syrian/Canadian
national Maher Arar. I t Indicated that, l i ke him, at
least three other Canadian nationals of Arab Origin
had been detained, interrogated and tortured in Syria

forced to sign statements without being permitted to

Cl Ahmed Abou EI-Maati was detained for 11 weeks
after he arrived in Syria on 12 November 2001. He
al leged that during this time he was beaten with electric
cables, burned with cigarettes and had ice-cold water
poured over him. He was then transferred to Egypt
where he suffered further torture.
a 'Abdullah Almalki said he was beaten on the soles
of his feet, hung In a tyre and beaten, and suspended by
his hands from a metal frame and beaten while
detained at the Palestine Branch of Military
Intelligence in Damascus for 22 months from May 2002.
a Muayyed Nureddin said he was beaten repeatedly
on the soles of his feet with a cable and had cold water
poured on him while detained in Syria from 1 1
December 2003 t o 13 January 2004·

H u man rights defenders under threat
SYrian human rights defenders became increasingly
active, but faced arrest and harassment. Several
unauthorized human rights organizations were
operating. At least 10 human rights defenders were
forbidden from travelling outside the country.
a Nizar Ristnawl, a founding member of the
unauthorized Arab Organization for Human Rights­
Syria (AOHR-S), was arrested on 18 April. He remained
in detention on unknown charges at the end of the year.
a Muhammad Ra'dun, head of the AOHR-S, was
arrested on 22 May in connection with statements he
had made about human rights in Syria. He was charged
with "spreading false news" and "involvement in an
I l legal organization of an International nature". He was
released under a presidential amnesty on 2 November.
'Disappearances'
The government provided no information about
thousands of Syrians, Lebanese and other nationals who
"disappeared" in the custody of Syrian forces in previous
years. These included some 17,000 people, mostly
Islamists who "disappeared" after they were detained in
the late 1970S and early 1980s, and hundreds of
Lebanese and Palestinians who were detained in Syria
or abducted from Lebanon by Syrian forces or Lebanese
and Palestinian militias. In September, however, the
government named one judge and two generals as its
representatives on a joint Syrian-Lebanese committee
intended to address the "disappearances" issue. Local
human rights groups welcomed this but questioned the
lack of independence and the limited powers of the
committee.
Torture and ill-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment of political and criminal
detainees continued to be widely reported, particularly
during incommunicado, pre-trial detention. At least
two deaths as a result of such treatment were reported.
a Ahmad 'Ali al-Masalma, a Muslim Brotherhood
member, died at the end of March, two weeks after he
was released from four weeks in detention. He was
250

arrested on his return from 26 years' exile in Saudi
Arabia. He was allegedly tortured in detention and
denied essential medication.
a Sheikh Muhammad Ma'shuq al-Khiznawi, an
Islamic religious leader and outspoken figure within the
Kurdish community, died on 30 May, 20 days after he
"disappeared", apparently in the custody of Military
I ntell igence agents. His nose and teeth were broken
and there was a wound on his forehead.
a Seraj Khalbous became seriously ill probably as a
result of torture while detained incommunicado in
September at al-Mezze and al-Fayha Political Security
Branches in Damascus. He was beaten, stamped on,
struck with large sticks, threatened with anal rape,
subjected to extreme cold, sleep deprivation and
humiliation, and witnessed others being tortured with
electric shocks. He was released on 25 October.
Most allegations of torture were not investigated.
However, in June it was reported that two senior offiCials
at the Ma'dan Court building in Raqqa were each
sentenced to two months in prison for torturing Amna
al-'Allush in March 2002 to force her to "confess" to a
murder. Despite this, Amna al-'Al lush continued serving
the 12-year prison sentence she received in April 2004.

Discrimination aga inst Kurds
Syrian Kurds continued to suffer from identity-based
discrimination, including restrictions on the use of the
Kurdish language and culture. Tens of thousands of
Syrian Kurds remained effectively stateless. As a result,
they were denied ful l access to education, employment,
health and other rights enjoyed by Syrian nationals, as
well as the right to have a nationality and passport. I n
June, a t i t s first meeting for 1 0 years, the ruling Ba'th
Party Congress ordered a review of a 1962 census which
could result in stateless Kurds obtaining Syrian
citizenship.
Discrimination and violence against women
Women remained subject to discrimination under a
range of laws including in the areas of marriage,
divorce, the family, inheritance and nationality. They
were also inadequately protected against domestic and
other forms of violence. For example, men who commit
rape can escape possible punishment if they marry the
victim, and men who murder a female relative on
grounds of her alleged "adultery" or "extra-marital
sexual relations" can also escape punishment or be
treated more leniently than other murderers.
The scale of violence against women remained poorly
documented and few cases were publicized during the
year.
a At her wedding party in al-Suweida in August, Huda
Abu 'Assali, a Druze, was reportedly killed by her father
and brother for having married a Kurdish man while
away from home at university in Damascus. No
prosecution was known to have been brought.
Death penalty
The death penalty remained in force for a wide range of
crimes but the authorities disclosed little information
about its use. I t was not known how many people were

sentenced to death or executed In 2005. However, the
government informed the UN Human Rights Committee
(HRC) that 27 executions were carried out during 2002
and 2003, although it was unclear whether this was the
total or it excluded executions carried out after trials
before the SSSC or military courts. In an interview
published in August, former Defence Minister Mustafa
Tlas claimed that he had authorized the hanging of 1 50
political opponents a week throughout the 1980S and
that he had signed execution orders for thousands of
detainees whose families were not notified.

UN Human Rights Committee
The H RC, commenting on Syria's third periodic report,
criticized the government's failure to implement human
rights reforms recommended by the H RC i n 200 1 . It
expressed concern about the continuing state of
emergency; restrictions on freedom of expression and
other basic rights; discrimination and violence against
women; the targeting of human rights defenders; and
Syria's use of the death penalty.

Migrant workers
Large numbers of migrant workers continued to live in
Inhuman conditions In dormitOries, with limited freedom
of movement. Several protests were reported of migrant
workers complaining about poor hVlng conditIOns, lack
of freedom of movement outside dormitories and
payment below the official minimum wage.

hired by a company involved in the construction of
Kaohsiung mass transit railway protested against their

protests they reportedly set fire to company property.
a In August, at least four Filipino migrant labourers
working at a chemical factory In Malliao Yunhn County
who were involved in a strike over deductions from

least one was carned onto the plane semi-conscIOUS
and in need of medical attention. The four were
accompanied by two more FilipinO col leagues who
were al legedly beaten by company security guards

Legislation
Significant laws addressing human rights were passed
in January, including the Aboriginal Basic Law and the
Sexual Harassment Prevention Act. A law addressing
freedom of expression - The Organic Law of the
National Communications Commission - was passed in
October.

The government was reported to be drafting legal
amendments to remove ma ndatory death pena lty

death pena lty remained as a discretionary
punishment for murder, kidnapping leading to
murder a nd other serious crimes. Three men were

journalists faced i ncreasing intimidation, including
criminal prosecutions, by the authorities. Five
Afghan refugees were forcibly returned to
Afghanista n.
Background
The ruling People's Democratic Party won a large
majority in parliamentary elections in February. The
leaders of two opposition parties were banned from
standing on the grounds that criminal cases had been
opened against them, even though no trial had taken
place. The Organization for Security and Co-operation
In Europe (OSCE) observed the elections and concluded
that they "failed to meet many of the key OSCE
commitments for democratic elections".
In September, durrng his visit to Tajikistan, the UN
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and
lawyers raised concern about the lack of independence
of the judiciary.
Torture, ill-treatment and impunity
There were continuing reports of torture and ill­
treatment by law enforcement officers. I t appeared
that in most cases no investigation was conducted and
the perpetrators enjoyed impunity.
The UN Human Rights Committee (HRC), after
considerrng Tajikistan's first report to the Committee,
raised concern about the "widespread use of ill­
treatment and torture by investigation and other
offiCials to obtain information, testimony or self­
incriminating evidence from suspects, witnesses or
arrested persons·. It also reported on "poor conditions
and overcrowding" in places of detention and the
"limited access" to penitentiary institutions by civi l
society and international bodies.
Death penalty
Relatives of people executed before the moratorium on
death sentences and executions took effect in 2004
continued to have no right to know where their loved
ones were buried. The HRC urged the authorities to
"take urgent measures to inform families of the burial
sites". I t also issued rulings on the cases of three former
death row prisoners. In all cases it found serious
252

violations of the International Covenant o n Civil and
Political Rights and urged Tajikistan to provide
appropriate compensation. In the case o f Valijon
Khalilov, for example, who was executed on 2 July 2001,
the HRC ruled that the execution was "in violation of
the right to a fair trial". It said Tajikistan was obliged to
provide Valijon Khal ilov's mother with an appropriate
remedy, including to inform her of the location of her
son's grave.

Refugees
Five Afghan refugees - a mother and her four children ­
were forcibly returned to Afghanistan in September, in
violation ofTajikistan's obligations as a party to the 1951
Refugee Convention and other human rights treaties. In
2004 they had applied for resettlement; three were
subsequently accepted by Canada. In early 2005 the
Refugee Status Determination Commission ofTajikistan
annulled the mother's refugee status; her appeal
against the decision was sti l l pending before Dushanbe
city court when the five were detained and then
deported.
Trafficking of human beings
Trafficking of human beings remained a grave concern.
The HRC urged Tajikistan to "redouble its efforts" in
tackling trafficking and "rigorously review the activities
of responsible governmental agencies to ensure that no
State actors are involved".

United Front (CUF) and other opposition candidates.
The CCM won 206 of the 232 parliamentary seats.

Zanzibar elections
Elections in semi-autonomous Zanzibar for the
Zanzibar President, parliament and local councils were
held in October. Amani Abeid Karume, the CCM
candidate, was re-elected as President, defeating the
CUF candidate. The CCM won 30 seats m the parliament,
as agamst 1 9 for the CUF.
The CUF al leged that numerous human rIghts abuses,
including beatings and arbitrary arrests of their
supporters, were carried out by security forces and
pro-CCM youth militias (known as "Janjaweed") dUrIng
the voter registration process m early 2005.
Later there were violent clashes between CCM and
CUF supporters i n the weeks before the October
elections, with scores of people injured. Police shot
and wounded eight opposition supporters at a
reportedly peaceful rally which took place on 9
October despite a ban.
For three days after the poll, CUF supporters al leging
election fraud - some throwing stones and burning
tyres, others protesting peacefully - confronted the
security forces, who used tear gas and water-cannon to
disperse protesters. Dozens of people were arrested,
and two protesters reportedly died. Some detainees
were charged with criminal offences but none had been
tried by the end of the year.
There were al legations of widespread beatings and
looting by the securIty forces targeting CUF supporters
on Pemba island, includmg a reported shootmg.
In November, several CUF leaders were brIefly
detamed.
Violence against women
Female genital mutilation continued to be practised m
many mainland areas, although the practice is il legal
for girls under 18 years. There were no prosecutions
reported.
Human rights defenders
ChrIStopher Kidanka, an official of the Legal and Human
Rights Centre, and Mpoki Bukuku, a photographer of
the Citizen newspaper, were among dozens of people

Violence continued in the Muslim-majority southern
provinces. Unidentified Muslim armed groups
bombed, beheaded or shot Muslim and Buddhist
civilia ns and members ofthe security forces. The
authorities arbitrarily detained people a nd failed to
investigate human rights abuses. Human rights
defenders in the south were subjected to surveillance,
harassment a nd anonymous death threats. Those in
other regions also faced a buses. Torture a nd ill­
treatment continued to be reported. Some 1 ,000
people remained under sentence of death. No
executions were known to have taken place. Migrant
workers continued to be denied basic labour rights.
Background
In February Prime MinisterThaksin Shinawatra's party,
Thai Rak Thai, won a majority of parliamentary seats
and formed a one-party government.
The violence m the south continued; more than 1 . 100
people died between January 2004 and the end of 2005.
In July a new Emergency Decree empowered the Prime
Minister to declare a state of emergency. Also in J uly
the UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern
about the new Emergency Decree; about persistent
a llegations of extrajudiCial killmgs and ill-treatment by
the police and army, particularly m the south during
2004; and about reports of the widespread use of
torture and i ll-treatment of detamees by law
enforcement officials.
legal developments
The Prime Minister used the new Emergency Decree,
enacted by the Cabinet on 15 July, one day after a major
attack by msurgents on Yala town, to declare a state of
emergency in Yala, Narathlwat and Pattani provinces. It
replaced the 1914 Martial Law Act previously m force
there and was renewed in October for a further three
months. The Emergency Decree's provisions include:
detention without charge or trial for up to 30 days; the
use of unofficial detention centres; press censorship;
and legal immunity from prosecution for law
enforcement officers.
Violence in the south
Violence m Songkla, Pattam, Yala, and Narathiwat
provinces m the far south contInued, characterized by
bombings, beheadings and "drive-by" shootings of
MuslIm and Buddhist civIlians and members of the
security forces. The armed groups responsible did not

THA

identify themselves and did not publicly state their
demands, nor did they indicate any willingness to
negotiate With the government. However, from August
onwards, anonymous leaflets were found threatening
anyone who opened their businesses on Fridays.
Anonymous notes were also found at the scene of
several attacks by armed groups which stated that the
killings were In revenge for the security forces' arrestIng
and killing "innocent people". The victims of the violence
included members of the security forces and militias,
civilian government offiCials, Buddhist and Muslim
civilIans, and members of Muslim armed groups.
The authOrIties' response to the violence was marked
by arbitrary detentions and lack of investigations into
human rights abuses. In February the government
established the National Reconciliation Commission
(NRC), chaired by former Prime Minister Anand
Panyarachun, to help resolve the violence. In April the
N RC made public two reports by government­
appoInted commissions investigating the security
forces' Violent suppression of a demonstration in Tak
Bai in October 2004 and the military siege of Krue Se
Mosque in April 2004. In October the N RC said that the
government verged on "administrative bankruptcy" In
the south because of its inability to protect people.

Human rights violations
Several Muslim political detainees were held
continuously in heavy shackles in Yala Prison. An
unknown number of detainees were held at the Yala
PolIce TrainIng Centre under the provisions of the
Emergency Decree; they were not permitted full access
to legal counsel or to their families.
a Reports emerged in August In Narathiwat Province
that the authorities had established a blacklist of
people thought to be members of or sympathetic to
armed OppOSI    groups. Scores of young Muslim men
were coerced into reporting to the provincial
government to clear their names; some were required
to attend a residential camp in what amounted to
arbitrary detention. None were known to have been
charged with any offence.
The government failed to conduct proper

Abuses by armed opposition groups
Armed opposition groups killed Buddhist villagers,
Muslim members of government-sponsored volunteer
militias, Buddhist monks and civilian local government
employees. Between January 2004 and September
2005, 60 teachers, prinCipals, and employees of the
school system were shot dead by unidentified armed
groups.
a In April Ma Rike Samae and his uncle Mat Samae,
both Muslim volunteer militia members, were shot
dead while they patrolled their village in Narathiwat
province at night.

a I n October armed insurgents attacked a Buddhist
temple in Pattani Province, beheading a Buddhist monk
and kill two boys.

I mpu nity
Almost 200 people were killed or died from ill­
treatment during the violent suppression of attacks by
armed groups in April 2004 and a demonstration In Tak
Bai in October 2004. No members of the security forces
responsible were brought to justice.
The trial of five police officers accused of an assault
on and theft from Muslim lawyer and human rights
defender Somchai Neelapaijit in 2004 continued
throughout 2005; his whereabouts remained unknown.
Human rights defenders
In the south, human rights defenders, including
students, lawyers and academics, were subjected to
surveillance, harassment, and anonymous death
threats. Those in other regions also faced abuses.
a In June Phra Supoj Suvacano, a Buddhist monk at a
forest temple in Fang District, Chiang Mai Province, was
hacked to death. He had been working to protect an
area belonging to a Buddhist foundation from
influential local land developers attempting to
encroach on the land. The Ministry of Justice
Department of Special Investigations conducted an
investigation but no one was brought to justice for his
murder.
Refugees and migrant workers
Refugees from Myanmar continued to arrive in
Thailand, fleeing forced labour, relocation, extortion,
and arrest. Almost 143,000 Karen and Karenni refugees
remained in camps along the Thai-Myanmar border;
refugees from the Shan ethniC minority continued to be
denied access to refugee camps. More than 2,400
refugees were resettled to third countries during 2005.
A total of 705,293 migrant workers, 539,416 of them
from Myanmar, registered for work permits while an
unknown number of migrants remained in the country
il legally. In July and August migrants from Myanmar,
Laos and Cambodia were registered, entitling them to
the same labour rights as Thai workers, including a legal
minimum wage and safe working conditions. In
practice, working and living conditions for migrant
workers, most of whom did not receive the legal
minimum wage, were poor. Migrant workers in garment
factories in Tak Province received little more than half
the legal minimum wage.
a In September, more than 200 legally registered
migrant workers from Myanmar were arrested and
deported to Myanmar after protesting to the Ministry of
Labour about long working hours and payment below
the legal minimum wage in a fishing net factory in Khon
Kaen Province.
Death penalty
Some 1 ,000 people remained under sentence of death,
many of them held continuously in heavy metal
shackles. The government told the UN Human Rights
Committee that shackling was necessary because there

Police violations
Despite progress by the National Police ofTimor-Leste
in dealing with demonstrations without excessive use
of force, reports of arbitrary detention and ill­
treatment continued to occur.

Despite efforts to strengthen human rights a nd the
rule of law, the administration of justice was weak
and there were allegations of police a buses,
including a rbitrary detention a nd ill-treatment.
Impunity for perpetrators of serious human rights
violations in 1 999 continued despite the completion
of the U N-sponsored serious cri mes process in May.
Background
In March parliament appointed Sebastiao Dias
Ximenes as Proved or for Human Rights and justice
(Ombudsman). His mandate was to combat corruption,
prevent maladministration, and protect and promote
human rights by making recommendations to relevant
institutions, including the government. In july he
expressed concern about his insufficient budget.
The UN Mission in Support of EastTimor (UNMISET)
was replaced in May by the UN Office in Timor-Leste
(UNOTIL), which was mandated to support the
development of critical state institutions until May 2006.
Justice system weaknesses
A severe shortage of national judges, prosecutors and
defence lawyers in district courts limited the judiciary's
ability to function and ensure the right to a fair trial
within a reasonable time. This inadequacy discouraged
access by the population to the formal justice system,
and perpetuated reliance on traditional justice
mechanisms that do not guarantee fair trial standards.
Freedom of expression and association
Concerns were expressed throughout the year by local
and international organizations about provisions on

Past human rights violations
The UN-sponsored serious crimes process, which was
mandated to investigate and try those responsible for
serious CrImes committed in Timor-Leste (then East
Timor) during 1999, terminated in May, although the job
had not been completed. The UN Special Panels
convicted a total of 84 people of serious crimes,
including crimes against humanity, and acquitted three.
Over 300 people indicted for serious crimes were not
tried because they could not be brought within the
jurisdiction of the Special Panels before the mandate
ended. By the end of the year, there were serious
concerns that indictees living in West Timor, Indonesia,
were returning to Timor-Leste, and that there were no
clear arrangements within the under-resourced
judiciary to replace the Special Panels.
a In August, Manuel Mala, who was indicted for
crimes against humanity committed in Bobonara
District in March and April 1999, entered Timor-Leste
from West Timor. He was immediately detained by
members of the community and handed over to the
national police. He remained in detention pendIng trial
for serious crimes at the end of the year.
I n june, the report of a UN-sponsored Commission of
Experts (CoE) mandated to review the prosecution of
serious violations of human rights committed in 1 999 in
Timor-Leste was submitted to the UN Security Council .
I t concluded that accountability of those who bore the
"greatest responSibility" for the violations had not been
achieved, and recommended the continuation of the
serious crimes process.
The CoE report expressed concerns about the terms of
reference of the Truth and FrIendship Commission, a
truth-seeking mechanism offiCially established in March
by Indonesia and Timor-Leste to review the 1999 crimes.
The report was concerned that certain provisions may
not comply with international standards on denial of
impunity (see Indonesia entry), and recommended
"clarification, re-assessment and revision" of those
provisions. Despite these criticisms, the Truth and
Friendship Commission was set up in August. The
provisions relating to impunity remained in the
Commission's mandate. The Security Council had not
acted on the CoE's recommendations by the end of 2005.
In October, the Commission for Reception, Truth and
Reconciliation in Timor-Leste handed in its final report

to the Timor-Leste President. It contained a detailed
account of human rights violations In Tlmor-Leste
between 1974 and 1999. Its recommend ations echoed
those of the CoE report and called for the continuatio n
of the UN-sponsored crime process and consideratio n

A UN fact-finding mission concluded that hundreds
of people were extrajudicially executed and
thousands wounded by the security forces a nd a rmed
militia groups close to the ruling party before, during
a nd after the presidential election which brought
Faure Gnassingbe to power in April. Widespread
arbitrary detentions, torture a nd violence aga inst
women were reported. Throughout the yea r critics of
the government and human rights defenders faced
harassment a nd intimidation.
Background
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who had ruled Togo
for 37 years, died on 5 February. The Togolese Armed
Forces (Forces armees togolaises, FAT) then
proclaimed Faure Gnassingbe, his son, as President.
The fol lowing day, the President of the National
Assembly who, according to the Constitution, should
have become interim President pending elections,
was d ismissed and replaced by Faure Gnassingbe. The
Constitution was modified to a l low the new head of
state to serve the rest of his father's term, until 2008.
This unconstitutional transfer of power was
condemned by the main opposition parties and by the
international community including the African Union
(AU) and the European Union (EU). The AU and the
Economic Community of the West African States
256

(ECOWAS) imposed sanctions a n d Togo was
suspended from the International Francophone
Organisation (Organisation I nternationale de la
Francophonie, O I F).
In the face of international pressure, Faure
Gnassingbe stepped down and called presidential
elections in April. He won the elections amid widespread
violence and allegations by opposition parties of vote­
rigging and law-breaking. The European Parliament
considered that the elections were not free and fair.
Attacks on civilians by the FAT and militia groups
during and after the presidential election led to the
displacement and flight of tens of thousands of people.
Humanitarian agencies reported that by August, more
than 40,000 people had sought refuge in neighbouring
Benin and Ghana. At the end of 2005, several thousand
refugees were still in neighbouring countries.
In October, Togo ratified the Protocol to the African
Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of
Women in Africa.

Unlawful killings and 'disa ppearances'
Both government forces and armed militia groups close
to the ruling party, the Rally of the Togolese People
(Rassemblement du peuple togolais, RPT), unlawfully
killed Civilians between February and April. Some were
kil led in indiscriminate attacks, others were
deliberately targeted and extrajudicially executed.
In the days following PreSident Gnassingbe
Eyadema's death and during the presidential election,
the security forces and members of the mil itias fired
indiscriminately at opposition supporters on protest
demonstrations. These attacks were particularly
violent in Lome and the towns of Atakapme and Aneho.
Thousands of people were reportedly injured, with
gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the body and
head. Some people reportedly 'disappeared" after their
arrest by the FAT.
a On the day of the election, soldiers burst into
several pol ling stations firing their weapons and tear
gas grenades. According to an election observer from
the opposition Union of Forces for Change (Union des
Forces de Changement, UFC), assigned to the pol l
station at Be Plage, Lome, two military vehicles
containing members of the Presidential guard's
commando regiment arrived, firing in the air as the
votes were being counted. Many people panicked and
tried to leave, but there was only one exit. The soldiers
entered the room, fired tear gas grenades and live
rounds and took the ballot boxes. The observer said he
had to step over about 30 bodies to escape.
a On 26 April, the day on which the provisional
election results were announced, soldiers and
militiamen reportedly entered the home of an
apprentice driver who lived in the Ablogame district of
Lome, firing bul lets. He said that they shot at people as
they tried to flee, killing his mother and one of his
friends.
a Kogbe Koffi, a 28-year-old sheet metal worker, was
reportedly shot in the back in Atakpame, on 26 April,
when the security forces fired l ive ammunition at
demonstrators protesting against the election results.

UN report
In September a fact-finding mission set up by the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that between
400 and 500 people were killed and thousands wounded
at the time of the presidential election. The report found
the state security forces and militia groups responsible
for the political violence and the violations of human
rights, and noted evidence that commando units within
the FAT had been primed "not only to crush the
demonstrators and militants but also to round up the
corpses and systematically dispose of them so that they
could not be counted." The report also criticized
opposition groups for their part in serious violence.

Arbitrary a rrests a nd detentions
Dozens of people were arrested during 2005, most
apparently for their peaceful political opposition
activities. Some were released within hours or days but
others remained in detention without charge or trial for
more than two months.
a A woman shopkeeper named Dalas was arrested on
7 May in Aklakou, suspected of preparing food for
people who demonstrated in Aneho shortly after the
presidential election. She remained in detention
without charge or trial until l 5 J uly.
a In Aklakou, at least seven school students were
arrested and accused of demonstrating after the
presidential election. They were detained for more
than two months without charge or trial at Vogan
prison.
Torture
Dozens of people were tortured or i l l-treated by the FAT
and militia groups between February and April. Some
people were beaten to death in front of their family.
a At Be Chateau in Lome, in front of witnesses
including foreign journalists, a motorcyclist trying to
cross town was stopped by soldiers. A soldier hit him
several times with a stick, made him pull down his
trousers and kicked him in the testicles.
a At Tokoin Seminaire, 15 soldiers entered the house
of an opposition member and dragged him outside.
They made him lie down, then held his arms and feet
while others hit him with cudgels and thin cord. He was
unconscious when they left.
In May the UN Committee against Torture postponed
its consideration of the report ofTogo, given the
absence of a Togolese government delegation.
Violence aga inst women
Gender-based violence, in particular rape of women,
was reported, including cases from Atakpame where
FAT members and militia groups a llegedly raped women
suspected of supporting the opposition.
a On 26 April, members of a militia group entered a
house and beat the husband, the wife and three
children. They then held the arms and feet of the
woman while one of them raped her.

increased during 2005. Media workers were harassed
and journalists were beaten for criticizing the
government or trying to disseminate information about
the repression that followed the death of PreSident
Gnassingbe Eyadema.
A senior official intervened several times to prevent
the radio station Nana FM broadcasting certain
programmes, including a roundtable discussion which
was suspended while on air three days after the
President's death. I n a meeting, in the presence of the
FAT communications officer, the official reportedly
threatened some private radio stations including Nana
FM, Kanal FM and Radio Nostalgia.
The transmitters of Radio France Internationale (RFI)
stopped broadcasting on FM for several months. The
Minister of Communications publicly accused RFI of
having launched "disinformation and destabilization
campaigns".
a Thierry Tchukriel, a radio journalist with Rd'autan,
who went to Togo to cover the presidential election,
was beaten by four soldiers on the night of 24 Apri l,
after being detained by the Togolese police. H is press
card and camera were confiscated.

Human rights defenders
Members of human rights organizations continued to
face harassment, intimidation and to be at risk of
attacks. Perpetrators were believed to be linked with
the ruling party and to criminal gangs.
a On 13 May, a group of young people associated with
the ruling party prevented the Togolese Human Rights
League (Ligue togolaise des droits de I 'homme, LTDH)
from holding a press conference. The LTDH had planned
to publicize human rights violations since the death of
President Eyadema.
a On 9 October, Dimas Dzikodo, an outspoken human
rights defender and journalist, was assaulted by a
group of unidentified men on his way back from work.

treatment.
Background
The Caribbean Court of justice, a Trinidad and Tobago­
based final court of appeal intended to replace the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC), opened
in April. By the end of 2005, Barbados and Guyana had
altered their constitutions to enable the court to hear
their cases.
More than 10,000 people took part in a protest in
October against the high rate of violent crime. There
were reportedly 382 murders in 2005, out of a
population of 1 . 3 mil lion.
Death penalty
Senior offiCials repeatedly expressed their intention to
resume executions - the last executions in Trinidad
and Tobago were in 1999. The mandatory death penalty
continued to be the only sentence available for those
convicted of murder.
Eighty-six people on death row whose sentences
were commuted to terms of Imprisonment by the jCPC
in 2004 remained under sentence of death, as the
government apparently ignored the ruling.
n I n june, a warrant was issued for the executIOn of
Lester Pltman, even though he had an appeal pending.
He was later granted a stay of execution pending the
outcome of appeals. Lester Pltman was convicted of
murder in 2004.
Abuses by police
Abuses by police, Including unlawful killings, torture and
ill-treatment, continued to be reported. At least 14
people were reportedly shot dead by police during 2005.
a In january, 37-year-old Kevin Wallace was shot
dead by police. Eyewitnesses said that he was shot in
the back as he tried to run away, and that police kicked
him as he lay bleeding, before taking him to hospital.
a I n August, 20-year-old Kendell Hamilton was shot
dead by members of the Inter-Agency Task Force in
Laventille. Police alleged that they fired in self-defence,

but relatives claimed Kendell Hamilton was an
innocent bystander. After community protests, police
announced the death would be investigated.

Poor conditions of detention
Conditions in places of detention caused grave concern
and in some cases amounted to cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment. Overcrowding in prISons, remand
centres and court cell blocks was rife. Conditions were
often unsanitary and medical care was inadequate.
Death row prisoners alleged that they were denied

appointed by President Ben 'AIi In August. The Tunisian
Workers' General Union (Union Generale des
Travailleurs Tunisiens) boycotted the elections.
In November, Tunisia hosted the World Summit on
the Information Society, an intergovernmental and
civil society meeting held under the auspices of the
UN. The choice ofTunisia to host the meeting was
criticized by national and international human rights
organizations because of ItS wide-ranging restrictions
on freedom of expressIOn and association. I n
September, I I governments and the European UnIOn
issued a joint statement raising concerns about
restrictions on the participation of civil society groups
at the Summit by the Tunisian authorities. Human
rights defenders were intimidated and a French
journalist was stabbed. AI delegates were prevented
from meeting representatives of the National Council
for Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil national pour les
libertes en Tunisie, CNLT) at ItS Tunis office, by
Tunisian security officers.
The TUnisia Action Plan, part of the European
Neighbourhood Policy, came Into force in july. It set out
a series of actions and initiatives, and a regu lar review
mechanism, on issues including human rights,
migration and the fight against terrorism.

Violations in the 'war on terror'
Dozens of people were reportedly arrested and charged
under anti-terrorism legislation passed in December
2003; at least 30 people were tried and sentenced.
Detainees were often held incommunicado, sometimes
for weeks, and there were a lIegations of torture to
extract confeSSions or to force detainees to sign
statements.
a At least 13 prisoners, known as the Bizerte group,
were sentenced in April to prison terms of between five
and 30 years, reduced to a maximum of 20 years on
appeal in j uly. The accused were al legedly tortured and
ill-treated during their detention in premises of the
Ministry of the Interior. They had been arrested in April
2004 and charged under the anti-terrorism law of
December 2003(:] In September, Tawfik Selmi, a Tunlsian-Bosnian
dual national, appeared before a military court in Tunis
on charges of membership of a terrorist organization
abroad. The court reportedly refused to al low the
defence team access to the case file. The trial was due
to recommence in February 2006. Tawfik Selmi had
been expelled from Luxembourg in March 2003Update
a In March, Adil Rahali was sentenced under anti­
terrorism legislation to 10 years' imprisonment, reduced
to five years on appeal in October. A Tunisian national,
he had been extradited from Ireland in April 2004 after
his application for asylum was refused, and arrested
upon arrival in Tunisia. He was secretly detained in the
offices of the State Security Department of the Ministry
of the Interior, where he was reportedly tortured.
Freedom of expression
Freedom of expression remained severely curtai led.
In October, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
Amnesty International Report 2006

promotion and protection of the right to freedom of
opinion and expression publicly expressed concern at
the lack of freedom of expression in Tunisia. I n his
statement he cal led on the Tunisian government to
take action to increase freedom of expression and
press freedom, and to release unconditiona lly a l l
those imprisoned because of their beliefs o r for their
work as journalists.
The first congress of the Union of Tunislan
journalists (Syndicat des journal istes tunisiens, SjT),
scheduled to be held in September, was banned
without explanation after ItS president, Lotfi Hajji ,
h a d been repeatedly summoned for questioning by
the State Security Department. The SjT was formed in
2004 In response to widespread censorship, to
defend the rights of journalists and promote media
freedom.

Human rights activists a nd orga nizations
Human rights defenders continued to face harassment
and sometimes physical violence. Many human rights
defenders, their families and friends were subjected to
surveil lance by the authorities, and their activities
were severely restricted.
a In january, large numbers of police officers
surrounded the CNLT headquarters, preventing
members from attending the organization's general
assembly. The police allegedly said they were under
strict instructions not to al low the meeting to take
place. On 3 and 4 September, the entrance to the
building was again obstructed by plain-clothes police
officers, who refused entry to members of the board. I n
addition, Sihem Ben Sedrine, the CNLT spokesperson,
was subjected to a smear campaign in the state­
controlled media, in which she was accused of "acting
like a prostitute" and serving the Interests of the US and
Israeli governments.
a In March, lawyer and human rights defender
Radhia Nasraoui was beaten up in the street by police
officers. She was on her way to a demonstration to
protest at the Tunisian government's invitation to
I sraeli Prime M inister Ariel Sharon to attend the World
Summit on the Information Society. She sustained a
broken nose, cuts to her forehead and extensive
bruising. No action was known to have been taken
against those responsible.
a As human rights organizations organized activities
In the run-up to the World Summit on the Information
Society, one group particularly targeted was the
Tunisian Human Rights League (Ligue tunlsienne pour la
defense des droits de I 'homme, LTDH). I n September a
court order effectively prevented the LTDH from
carrying out preparatory activities two days before its
national congress. The order was in response to a
complaint by 22 people, reportedly close to the
authorities, who said they had been unfairly dismissed
as members from the LTDH.
Attacks on the independence of the j udiciary
I n a series of intimidatory measures, judges' activities
and right to freedom of expression were further
restricted.

(') In August, members were barred from the office of
the AssocIation of TUnIsIan j udges (AssociatIon des
Magistrats Tunlslens, AMT), under orders from the
MInIstry of justice and Human Rights. After calls for
more independence for the judiciary, the AMT's
telephone, fax and Internet access were increasingly
dIsrupted, then effectively shut down. AccordIng to
reports, Judges were arbItrarily transferred to isolated
areas, far from theIr famI lIes, In an attempt to
IntImIdate and silence them.

Prisoners of conscience
People continued to be at rIsk of ImprISonment,
harassment and intimidation because of their non­
vIolent belIefs.
) Mohamed Abbou, a lawyer and human rIghts
defender, was sentenced In AprIl to three and a half
years in prIson, largely for publishing artIcles critical of
the authorities on the I nternet. TUnISIan lawyers and
CIvIl socIety activists who protested at his trIal were
subjected to harassment and IntimIdation by the police
on several occasions. HIS lawyers were reportedly
denIed permiSSIon to visit hIm In prIson despIte
repeated attempts. HiS sentence was confIrmed on
appeal in june. At the end of 2005 he was ImprIsoned in
El-Kef, 200 kIlometres from hIS family home in TUnIS,
making VIsits difficult. The UN WorkIng Group on
ArbItrary Detention adopted the opinIon in November
that his detention was arbitrary.
Prison conditions
In April the authorities signed a n agreement wIth the
I nternatIonal CommIttee of the Red Cross (iCRC), whIch
allowed it to VISIt prIsons regularly to assess condItions
of detentIon and the treatment of prIsoners. The ICRC
started vISIting prISons In june.
Also In AprIl the government said it would no longer
hold prIsoners in solItary confInement for more than 10
days. This commItment was given in a meeting with
Human Rights Watch, whIch al leged that up to 40
polItical prisoners were held in solitary confInement or
In small groups isolated from the general prisoner
population The government also saId that Human
RIghts Watch would be allowed access to prisons when
It next sent representatives to Tunisia.
However, throughout the year large numbers of
polItIcal prISoners went on repeated hunger strikes to
protest agaInst the contInuing denIal of medIcal care
and harsh prIson condItions.
Torture and death in custody
a In june, Houcine Louhichi, a taxI drIver from
Tabarka in the north-west province of jendouba, died
shortly after his transfer to Rabta Hospital In Tunis. A
few days earlIer, he had been released by the State
SecurIty Department In Tabarka, where he was
detaIned IncommunIcado for almost two days and
allegedly tortured until he lost consciousness. On hIS
release, there were brUIses all over hIS body. The

REPUBLIC OFTU RKEY
Head of state: Ahmet Necdet Sezer
Head of government: Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Death penalty: abolitionist for all crimes
I nternational Criminal Court: not signed
UN Women's Convention and its Optional Protocol:

The Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU)
formally opened negotiations for Turkey's
membership of the EU, Practical implementation of
reforms intended to bring Tu rkish law into line with
international sta ndards slowed in 2005. The law
provided for conti nuing restrictions on the exercise of
fundamental rights. Those expressing peaceful
dissent on certain issues faced criminal prosecution
and sanctions after the introduction ofthe new
Tu rkish Penal Code. Torture and ill-treatment
continued to be reported, with those detained for
ordinary crimes particularly at risk. Law enforcement
officers continued to use excessive force in the
policing of demonstrations; four demonstrators were
shot dead in November, I nvestigations of such
incidents were inadequate a nd law enforcement
officers responsible for violations were rarely
brought to justice. Human rights deteriorated in the
eastern a nd south-eastern provinces in the context of
a rise in armed clashes between the Turkish security
services a nd the armed opposition Kurdistan
Workers' Party ( PKK).
Background
In june, the new Turkish Penal Code (TPC), Code of
CrimInal Procedure and Law on the Enforcement of
Sentences (LES) entered into force. The laws contaIned
positive aspects, with the TPC offerIng greater
protection from vIolence to women. However, the TPC
in particular also Included restrictions to the rIght to
freedom of expression. Human rights defenders in
Turkey also raised objections to the punishment regime

for prisoners envisaged by the LES. A revised draft of
the Anti-Terror Law was being discussed by a
parliamentary sub-commission at the end of the year;
human rights groups had commented critically on
earlier drafts.
In September Turkey signed the Optional Protocol to
the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
In October the Council of Ministers of the EU formally
opened negotiations for Turkey's membership of the EU.

Freedom of expression
A wide range of laws containing fundamental
restrictions on freedom of expression remained in
force. These resulted in the prosecution of individuals
for the peaceful expression of opinions in many areas
of public life. The pattern of prosecutions and
judgments also often demonstrated prosecutors' and
judges' lack of knowledge of international human rights
law. In some cases comments by senior government
offiCials demonstrated an intolerance of dissenting
opinion or open debate and seemed to sanction
prosecution.
Article 30 1 , on the denigration of Turkishness, the
Republic, and the foundation and institutions of the
state, was introduced in June and replaced Article 1 59
of the old penal code. Article 1 59 and Article 30 1 were
frequently applied arbitrarily to target a wide range of
critical opinion. Journalists, writers, publishers, human
rights defenders and academiCS were prosecuted under
this law. Among the many prosecuted were journalist
Hrant Dink, novelist Orhan Pamuk, Deputy Chair of the
Mazlum Der human rights organization Sehmiis Olek,
and academics Baskl n Oran and I brahim Kabo�lu .
An international academic conference on
perceptions of the historical fate of the Armenians in
the late Ottoman period, to be held in May at Bosphorus
University in Istanbul was postponed after comments
made by the Minister of J ustice, Cemil Ci�ek, which
fundamentally challenged the notion of academic
freedom by portraying the initiative as treacherous.
The conference eventually took place at Bilgi University
in September. However, in December legal proceedings
under TPC Articles 301 and 288 were initiated against
five journalists who reported on attempts to prevent
the conference.
A further restriction on freedom of expression
remained in the broad restrictions on the use of
minority languages in publiC life. Frequent
prosecutions for speaking or uttering single words in
Kurdish continued to be brought under Article 81 of the
Law on Political Parties.
In May the Court of Appeal ordered the closure of the
teachers' union, E�itim-Sen, on the grounds that a
clause in its statute defending the right to "mother­
tongue education" violated Articles 3 and 42 of the
Constitution which emphasize that no language other
than Turkish may be taught as a mother tongue. E�itim­
Sen later revoked the relevant article of its statute in
order to avoid closure.
a In October the prosecutor initiated a case to close
down permanently the Diyarbakl r Kurdish Assocation
Amnesty International Report 2006

(Kiird-Der) on various counts, including the decision to
adopt a "non-Turkish" spelling of the word Kurdish in
the association's name and statute, and provisions in
the association's statute defending the right to Kurdish­
language education. The association had previously
been warned to adjust the disputed elements in its
statute and name.
Provisions in the Press Law restricting press
coverage of cases under judicial process were used in
an arbitrary and overly restrictive way to hinder
independent investigation and public comment by
journalists on human rights violations. These
provisions were also used to hinder human rights
defenders.
Legal proceedings were begun against the
Chairperson of the Diyarbakl r branch of the Human
Rights Association (HRA), Selahattin Demirta�, and
Mihdi Perin�ek, HRA Regional Representative, in
connection with a report they co-authored with others
on the killing of Ahmet Kaymaz and U�ur Kaymaz (see
below). The indictment alleged that the report violated
Article 19 of the Press Law, undermining the
prosecutor's preparatory investigation into the killings,
despite the fact that the authors had no access to the
contents of files on the case which, by court order and
for reasons of security, were unavailable for
inspection. The first hearing against the two began in
July.

Torture and il l-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement offiCials
continued to be reported, with detainees allegedly
being beaten; stripped naked and threatened with
death; deprived of food, water and sleep during
detention; and beaten during arrest or In places of
unoffiCial detention. Reports of torture or ill-treatment
of indiViduals detained for political offences decreased.
However, people detained on suspicion of committing
ordinary crimes such as theft or for public disorder
offences were particularly at risk of ill-treatment.
Reports suggested that there were still many cases of
law enforcement offiCials completely fai ling to follow
lawful detention and investigative procedures and of
prosecutors failing to ascertain that law enforcement
offiCials had complied with procedures. Police also
regularly used disproportionate force against
demonstrators, particularly targeting leftists,
supporters of the pro-Kurdish party DEHAP, students
and trade unionists (see Kills in disputed
circumstances below). Often those al leging ill­
treatment, particularly during demonstrations, were
charged with resisting arrest while their injuries were
explained away as having occurred as police attempted
to restrain them.
a In October in Ordu, five teenagers aged between 1 5
and 18 were detained a t the opening of a new shopping
centre.The five reported being beaten, verbally abused,
threatened and having their testicles squeezed while
being taken into custody and while in custody a t the
Ordu Central Police Station. They were later released.
Two reported that they were stripped and threatened
with rape. Three were not recorded as having been in
261

TUR

police detention. One was subsequently charged with
VIOlently resisting arrest. Beyond the al leged ill­
treatment. which was documented in medical reports
and photographs, other irregularities In the handling of
the detained teenagers by the police and prosecutor
demonstrated a failure to follow legal procedures at
any pOint from the moment of detention onwards.
a In March, In the Sara�hane area of Istanbul,
demonstrator s gathering to celebrate I nternational
Women's Day were VIOlently dispersed by police,
beaten with truncheons and sprayed with pepper gas
at close range. Three women were reportedly
hospitalized. The scenes drew international
condemnation . In December, 54 police officers were
charged with uSing excessive force; senior officers
were not charged, but three received a "reprimand"
for the Incident.

Impunity
Investigations into torture and il l-treatment continued
to be marked by deeply flawed procedures and
supported suggestions of an unwillingness on the part
of the judiciary to bring perpetrators of human rights
violations to Justice. An overwhelming climate of
impUnity persisted.
a In Apri l, four police officers accused of the torture
and rape with a truncheon of two teenagers, Nazime
Ceren Salmano�lu and Fatma Deniz Polatta�, in 1999
were acquitted. More than six years after the judiCial
process had begun and after the case had been delayed
more than 30 times, a court in Iskenderun acquitted the
officers due to "insufficient eVidence". Lawyers for the
young women announced that they would appeal
against the deCision. The two women had been
sentenced to long prison terms on the basis of
"confessions" allegedly obtained under torture.
a Fifteen years after the death of university student
Birtan All1 nba�, the trial of four police officers accused
of killing him continued in the Ankara Heavy Penal
Court No. 2. Birtan Altl nba� died on 1 5 January 1991
follOWing six days in police custody, during which he
was interrogated on suspicion of being a member of an
il legal organization. The case, which received
international condemnation and was widely reported
in the Turkish press, demonstrated many aspects of the
flawed judiCial process.
a The trial of four police officers charged with killing
Ahmet Kaymaz and his 12-year-old son U�ur Kaymaz on
2 1 November 2004 in the Klzl ltepe district of Mardin
began in February. The four officers on trial were not
under arrest and were sti l l on active duty. It was
significant that senior officers responsible for the
police operation during which the two individuals were
kil led were excluded from the investigation and not
charged, supporting the view that in cases of this kind
prosecutors rarely examined the chain of command.
Fai r trial concerns
The continUing inequality between prosecution and
defence and the influence of the executive on the
appointment of judges and prosecutors prevented the
full independence of the judiciary. While from I June
2 62

detainees enjoyed the right to legal counsel and
statements made in the absence of lawyers were not
admissible as evidence in court, few prosecutors in the
new Heavy Penal Courts (which replaced the State
Security Courts in 2004) attempted to review ongoing
cases where statements were originally made without
the presence of legal counsel and where defendants
al leged that their testimony had been extracted under
torture. Little effort was made to collect eVidence in
favour of the defendant and most demands of the
defence to have witnesses testify were not met.

Imprisonment for conscientious objection
Conscientious objection was not recognized and no
civilian alternative to military service was available.
a In August, Sivas Military Court sentenced
conscientious objector Mehmet Tarhan to four years'
imprisonment on charges of "disobeying orders" and
refusing to perform military service. He was a prisoner
of conscience.
Killings in disputed circu mstances
On 9 November in the $emdinli district of Hakkari, a
bookshop was bombed, killing one man and injuring
others. Three men were charged in connection with
the incident. The alleged bomber was subsequently
revea led to be a former PKK guerrilla turned informant
and his alleged accomplices were two members of the
security services, with identity cards indicating that
they were plain-clothes gendarmerie intelligence
officers. Subsequently, as the prosecutor carried out a
scene-of-crime investigation, the assembled crowd
was fired upon from a car, resulting in the death of one
civilian and injury of others. The prosecutor's crime­
scene investigation was postponed. A gendarmerie
specialist sergeant was charged with disproportionate
use of force resulting in death. AI called upon the
government to establish an independent commission
of inquiry to investigate all dimensions of these
incidents including allegations of direct offiCial
involvement. During subsequent protests at the events
in $emdinli, three people in the Yuksekova district of
Hakkari and one person in Mersin were shot dead by
police.
During 2005 approximately 50 people were shot
dead by the security forces, over half of them in the
south-eastern and eastern provinces. Many may have
been victims of extrajudicial executions or the use of
excessive force. "Failure to obey a warning to stop" was
a common explanation provided by the security forces
for these deaths.
At least two individuals were al leged to have been
assassinated by the PKK. On 17 February, Kemal $ahin,
who split from the PKK to found an organization allied
with the Patriotic Democratic Party of Kurdistan, was
kil led near Suleimaniyeh in northern Iraq. On 6 July,
Hikmet Fidan, former DEHAP deputy chair, was killed in
Diyarbakl r.
An organization calling itself the Kurdistan Freedom
Falcons claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in J uly
on a bus In the Aegean town of Ku�adasl that kil led five
civil l ians.

Violence against women
Positive provisions In the new TPC offered an improved
level of protection for women against violence in the
family. The new Law on Municipalities required
municipalities to provide shelters for women in towns
with populations of more than 50,000 individuals.
I mplementation of this law will require adequate
funding for the establishment of shelters from central
government and full co-operation with women's
organizatIOns In civil society. Further efforts were
needed to ensure that law enforcement officials,
prosecutors and the medical profession were fully
versed in the still little-known Law on the Protection of
the Family.
Official human rights mechanisms
Official human rights monitoring mechanisms attached
to the Prime Ministry failed to function adequately and
had insufficient powers to report on and investigate
violations. The work of the Prime Ministry Human
Rights Advisory Board, encompassing Civi l society
organizations, was obstructed and the Board became
effectively inactive. Moreover, in November, former
Chair Ibrahim Kabo�lu, and Baskl n Oran, a board
member, were prosecuted for the contents of a report
on the question of minOrities In Turkey commissioned
by the Board and authored by Baskln Oran. The
Provincial and Human Rights Boards, set up by the
Human Rights Presidency and also attached to the
Prime Ministry, failed to conduct adequate
Investigations of human rights violations. Draft
legislation on the creation of an ombudsman failed to
advance.

Measures taken byTurkmenistan to counter
international criticism of its human rights record
failed to halt human rights violations. Religious
minorities, civil society activists and relatives of
dissenters were a mong those who faced harassment
or imprisonment or were forced into exile for
exercising their right to freedom of expression. At
least 60 prisoners, serving prison terms in
connection with a n a lleged assassination attempt on
the head of state in 2002, remained incommunicado.
In a further trial in the series of secret a nd u nfa ir
trials since the 2002 events, a n u nknown number of
men were sentenced to life a nd other long terms of
imprisonment.
International scrutiny
The UN Commission on Human Rights, at its 61st session
in March and April, failed to follow up resolutions In
2003 and 2004 raising grave concerns about the human
rights situation In Turkmenistan.
I n December the UN General Assembly expressed
"grave concern at continuing human rights Violations",
and, among other things, called on Turkmenistan to
respond POSitively to requests by UN Special
Rapporteurs to visit the country.
In August the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination considered Turkmenistan's first
report to a UN committee. Among issues raised by the
Committee were reports of hate speech, including by
senior offiCials and public figures, against national and
ethnic minorities and in favour ofTurkmen "ethnic
pUrity". The Committee expressed concern at reports
that members of minorities were denied state
employment or access to higher education, and that
minority cultural institutions and numerous schools
teaching in minority languages had been closed.
The authorities continued to deny that human rights
were violated. On 23 March, President Saparmurad
Niyazov was reported as saying that nobody was
arrested on political grounds but that "wanted
criminals" living abroad spread false reports.
However, to avoid being claSSified as a "country of
particular concern" under the USA's I nternational
ReligIOUS Freedom Act - which could Incur measures
such as targeted trade sanctions - some concessions
were made. The authOrities released four conSCientious
objectors on 16 April, one of whom - Begench
Shakhmuradov - had been sentenced to one year's
Imprisonment on 10 February for evading regular call­
ups to active military service. Legal restrictIOns on

registering religious communities were relaxed, and
several religious minority congregations registered.
However, conscientious objection remained a criminal
offence, punishable by imprisonment, and harassment
and intimidation of registered and unregistered
religious minorities continued.
The rIsk remained that asylum-seekers forcibly
returned to TurkmenJstan might be arbitrarily
detained, tortured or i l l-treated, or imprisoned after
unfair trials, includmg under a 2003 People's Council
decree that increased the number of activities deemed
treasonable in law.

Repression of dissent
Civil society activists, political dissidents and members
of religious minority groups were subjected to
harassment, arbitrary detention, torture and ill­
treatment.
Cl Jehovah's Witnesses Durdygul Ereshova and
Annajemal Tuylieva were detamed by police on 7
October and taken to Niyazov district police station in
Ashgabat. A senior officer al legedly insulted them, beat
and kicked Annajemal Tuylieva, and threatened to rape
them. Police were said to have accused them of "illegal
religious activity" and "vagrancy", and to have
confiscated the passport of Durdygul Ereshova's
husband and threatened her with forcible resettlement
to Lebap region in the east.
Relatives of exiled dissidents were targeted in an
attempt to silence critics abroad speaking out about
abuses in Turkmenistan.
Cl Ruslan Tukhbatullin, a senior postholder in the
military administration of Dashoguz region, was
reportedly forced to resign from his post in March and
refused further military employment because of his
family relationship to his brother Farid Tukhbatullin, an
exiled human rights activist and director of the non­
governmental group Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights.
Political prisoners
Dozens of prisoners sentenced fol lowing unfair trials
in connection with a November 2002 alleged
assassination attempt on President Niyazov continued
to be held incommunicado. Many had al legedly been
tortured and ill-treated following their arrests. They
were denied access to families, lawyers and
mdependent bodies including the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
In a further secret trial in connection with the
November 2002 events, several men were convicted
and sentenced to imprisonment, bringing the number
of those convicted in the case to at least 60.
a Major Begench Beknazarov, an armed forces officer
who had gone mto hiding following the al leged
assassination attempt, was arrested in Ashgabat in
May. He and several other men were subsequently tried
and sentenced to prison terms in a closed trial in the
first half of June. Their relatives were unable to visit
them or obtain official trial documents. Begench
Beknazarov was reportedly sentenced to life
imprisonment. His parents, Raisa and Amandurdy
Beknazarov, and one of his sisters, Dzheren
2 64

Beknazarova, were said to have been detained for 20
days at the Ministry of National Security building after
the November 2002 events in an attempt to obtain
information about his whereabouts and to put pressure
on him to turn himself in. The three were reported to
have been physically and psychologically i l l-treated in
detention. Their passports were subsequently
confiscated. Raisa Beknazarova was dismissed from her
job, and Dzheren Beknazarova expelled from
university. Ayna Shikhmuradova, an aunt of Begench
Beknazarov and sister-in-law of prominent opposition
leader Boris Shikhmuradov, who was sentenced to life
imprisonment followmg the al leged assassination
attempt, was reportedly threatened with a beating by
police at Ashgabat city police station in February 2003
unless she disclosed her nephew's whereabouts.

The independence of the j udiciary, freedom of
expression and press freedom came under attack.
Violence agai nst women and girls was widespread.
Torture by state secu rity agents persisted.
Background
On 28 June Parliament voted to amend the Constitution
and lifted the limit of two terms that a president could
serve. Demonstrators protesting against this vote
clashed with riot police. A national referendum on 28
July brought a return to a multi-party system of politics.
Abuses against civilians by all parties to the conflict
in northern Uganda continued. In October the
International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest
warrants for five senior leaders of the armed
opposition group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
The accused were Joseph Kony, leader of the LRA;
Vincent Otti, the second in command; Okot Odhiambo,

Dominic Ongwen and Raska Lukwlya. They were
charged with crimes against humanity and war CrImes
committed in Uganda since July 2002.

I ndependence of the judiciary
Retired army colonel Dr Kizza Besigye, presidential
candidate of the opposition party Forum for
Democratic Change (FDC) In the 2006 elections, was
arrested on 14 November. He was charged with rape
and, together with 22 other people, treason and
concealment of treason.
On 16 November, the High Court granted bail to 14 of
the co-accused facing charges of treason. However,
heavily armed state security agents were deployed in
the courtyard of the High Court, reportedly ready to re­
arrest the 14 once they emerged. Consequently, they
were not released on bail but returned to prison. The
14 appeared before a military court on 18 November,
charged with terrorism. Lawyers across Uganda staged
a one-day strike on 28 November In protest at this siege
of the High Court.
Thousands of people demonstrated In Kampala city
centre against the arrest of Dr Besigye. RIOt police used
live ammunition, tear gas and water cannons against
demonstrators. DUring the two-day protests, at least
one person was kil led and dozens were arrested. The
I nternal Affairs Minister banned demonstrations and
processions ahead of Dr Besigye's bail application and
court case.
On 24 November, Dr Besigye was charged before the
military court with terrOrism and unlawful possessIOn
of firearms. On the same day, he was scheduled to
appear before the High Court for hiS bail application.
Two lawyers representing Dr Besigye before the
military court were charged with contempt of court and
held for seven hours as they attempted to explain that
their client was due to appear before the High Court.
They were convicted and fined.
Dr Besigye was granted bail by the High Court on 25
November, but that morning, he had been remanded
back to Luzira Maximum Security Prison by the military
court and therefore he did not regain his freedom. The
High Court ordered the military to suspend its trial until
the Constitutional Court ruled on its legality, but the
mil itary court said the trial would go ahead. On 19
December Dr Beslgye appeared before the H igh Court ­
his trial before the military court was scheduled for the
same day. Dr Besigye's treason and rape cases were
adjourned to January 2006 and he remained in prison
until the end of the year.
Attacks on freedom of expression
Freedom of expression and press freedom came under
attack and continued to be threatened. Journalists
faced criminal charges because of their work.
a In February the Media Council banned the play The
Vagina Monologues by the US playwright Eve Ensler,
which several women's organizations had planned to
stage to raise awareness about violence against
women.
a In August the Uganda Broadcasting Council
suspended the licence of K FM 9J.3 Radio for a week
Amnesty International Report 2006

after it broadcast a programme discusSing the fatal
helicopter crash that killed John Garang de MablOr, the
Sudanese Vice President and Southern Sudanese
leader, and seven Ugandan crew members. Andrew
Mwenda, the programme's host, was charged with
sedition and released on bail. HIS trial had not been
fixed by the end of the year, pending the outcome of a
constitutional petition challenging the sedition laws.
a On 17 November, policemen and intelligence
personnel raided the offices of Monitor Publications,
newspaper publishers and owners of K FM 93.3 Radio.
The Momtordaily newspaper had run a paid
advertisement from the FOC cal ling for contributIOns to
a fund for the legal defence of political prisoners In
Uganda. Police claimed the advertisement breached
the law because the FOC had not obtained permission
to fundraise.
On 22 November, the State Minister for I nformation
and Broadcasting issued a directive to revoke the
licence of any media outlet hosting discussion of cases
before the courts. He added that as the trial of Dr
Besigye had started, a l l talk shows or debates "in
respect of or incidental to that case and other cases"
were banned.

Conflict in northern Uganda
The 19-year conflict between the government and the
LRA persisted throughout 2005. There were clashes
between the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF)
and the LRA in Gulu, Pader, Kitgum, Lira and Apac
districts.
At the end of August an estimated 1 . 4 million people
were confined to I nternally Displaced Persons (IDP)
camps across northern Uganda. Overcrowding and
poor sanitation rendered them vulnerable to outbreaks
of disease, Including cholera, while inseCUrity put them
at fISk of human rights abuses. In February, the
government officially launched a National Policy for
l OPs, which it said was based on international
humanitarian law, human rights instruments and
national laws.
The LRA extended its operations to daylight hours,
contrary to its earlier practice, and continued to use
road ambushes to attack Civilians.
A On 2 1 November, between seven and 10 LRA
fighters ambushed a minibus taxi between Pader and
Paiula In Pader district. Two civilians were killed
instantly. Ten other civilians were removed from the
vehicle, laid on the ground and executed. The vehicle
was set on fire.
The LRA attacked the staff of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in conflict-affected areas, making
humanitarian access hazardous.
a On 26 October, in an LRA ambush on the Pader
Pajule road, one staff member of the NGO Agency for
Co-operation and Research in Development (ACORD)
was killed and two others were wounded. In a separate
incident on the same day, the LRA kil led a staff member
of the NGO CARITAS about eight kilometres from
Kltgum town.
Civi lians also suffered human rights violations at the
hands of government soldiers.

a On 16 October, a family of four was shot dead by a
member of the UPDF at the main entrance to the 4th
Division Headquarters in Gulu Town. The soldier was
reportedly a former LRA combatant.
Torture
Allegations of torture and Ill-treatment committed by
state secunty agents persisted throughout 2005.
Uganda submitted ItS imtlal report on the
implementation of the UN Convention against Torture
to the Committee against Torture after a delay of 16
years. The Committee noted with concern "the lack of
proportion between the high number of reports of
torture and the very small number of convictions for
such offences" which contnbuted to Impunity. While
acknowledging the difficult situation of internal
conflict in northern Uganda, the Committee stressed
that there were "no exceptional circumstances,
whatsoever, which may be Invoked as a justification of
torture".
a In ju ly, the High Court sitting at Arua in the north­
west ordered the government to pay compensation of
Uganda Shillings 20,000,000 (approximately
US$ I I , OOO) to j ustlne Okot, following his arrest and
torture by UPDF soldiers who accused him of being a
"rebel collaborator". He had been beaten with clubs
and iron bars and molten plastic was poured on his
body. He sustained severe injunes and permanent
Impairment. By the end of the year, he had not
received payment.
Violence against women and girls
Women and girls continued to face widespread
violence both In the public and private spheres of life,
being subjected to beatings, killings, aCid attacks and
rapes In northern Uganda, women and girls were raped
and kil led by all parties to the conflict. While police
expressed concern about the growing number of rapes,
especially of young girls, acts of violence were little
reported for fear of repnsals. Between january and
j une, the rapes of 292 girls were reported in mid­
western Uganda (Kabarole, Kamwenge, Bundibugyo,
Kyenjojo and Kasese districts).
I n September the UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child recommended that the country adopt legislative
measures to prohibit the persistent practice of female
gemtal mutilation (FGM). I t also recommended
awareness-raising campaigns to combat FGM and other
traditional practices harmful to the health, survival and
development of children, especially girls.
Death penalty
In a landmark judgment delivered on 10 J une, the
Constitutional Court ruled In favour of ending laws that
stipulate a mandatory death sentence. I t ruled that the
death penalty as such was not unconstitutional when it
was defined as the maximum sentence for a crime, but
that laws Imposing a mandatory death sentence
Interfered with a judge's discretion in dispensing
Justice. The court stated that such laws were
unconstitutiOnal and must be amended by Parliament.
The Attorney General appealed against the ruling and
266

by the end of 2005, the parties were awaiting the
heanng of the appeal before the Supreme Court.
Death sentences continued to be imposed. At LUZlra
Maximum Security Prison, at the end of june, there
were 555 prisoners on death row, 27 of whom were
women. No executions were reported during the year.

Torture and ill-treatment
The new government acknowledged that torture and
Il l-treatment were a problem and took some positive
steps. In January, amendments to Article 127 of the
Criminal Code concerning torture made it possible to
charge state officials with this cnme. The General
Prosecutor stated m September that 226 cases had been
opened against police officers for torture and ill­
treatment and that there had been more than 1 , 000
complaints dunng the past year. I n September Ukrame
signed the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel. I nhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment.
Despite these measures, reports mdlcated that law
enforcement officers continued to use torture and ill­
treatment routinely and with impunity to extract
confessions and information from detainees. Police
officers were not adequately trained or equipped to
gather evidence and therefore depended on
confessions to solve crimes. Cases of torture and ill­
treatment were rarely followed up and victims rarely
received compensation.
a Makslm Kalinln, aged 16, was al legedly beaten by
police on 6 J une m Kerch. Accordmg to reports, a girl
he had argued with telephoned friends in the police to
say that he had msul ted her. Three police officers
arrived shortly after and beat Maksim Kalinin. They
then handcuffed him and took him to the local police
station where they a llegedly beat and threatened him.
He was held for 24 hours and then dnven home. He
required hospital treatment for his injuries. His
parents reported the i l l -treatment to the prosecutor's
office and a court case was started m J une agamst the
police officers involved. In December the officers
were sentenced to three and four years in prison
under Article 365 of the Cnmmal Code for exceedmg
their authority.
Poor conditions in pre-tria l detention
Conditions in most pre-trial detention faci lities failed
to meet international standards. Most of the temporary
holding facilities (ITTs) of the Ministry of the I nterior
dated from the 19th century or earlier and were not
equipped with adequate sanitary facilities, ventilation
or exercise yards. TuberculosIs continued to be
Widespread. However, a programme of renovation and
reconstruction was started. According to the
parliamentary Ombudsperson, by February, 1 39 of the
500 ITTs had been renovated and new ITTs had been
built in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Kyiv and
Mariupul.
Racist attacks
There were continuing reports of anti-Semitic and
racist attacks across the country. The Union of Councils
for Jews in the former Soviet Union reported at least
eight attacks against Jews and defacement of
synagogues in Ukraine. Synagogues and Jewish
community centres were vandalized m Ivano­
Frankivsk, Izmail, Zhytomyr, Kyiv and Vinnytsya, and an
Armenian church was daubed with anti-Semitic and
anti-Armenian graffiti in Lviv. On several occasions
Amnesty International Report 2006

during the year PreSident Yushchenko condemned
anti-Semitism and pledged to end It.
a On 26 February Robert Slmmons, an African­
American US diplomat, was attacked by a group of
skinheads in Kiev. His white companion was not
touched. A formal complamt was lodged and the
Ukramian authontles initiated an mvestigation.
a On 28 August Mordechal Molozhenov, a 32-year-old
student of Judaism, and another student were attacked
by skin heads m an underground passage m Kiev. The
skinheads allegedly shouted anti-Semitic abuse dunng
the attack. Mordechai Molozhenov was left m a coma
and required bram surgery. He was later treated m
hospital in Israel. Three suspects were detamed for
"hooliganism". The Deputy Minister of I nternal Affairs
told the Israeli ambassador that the attack had not
been motivated by anti-Semitism. President
Yushchenko, in a written statement, condemned all
forms of racism and xenophobia, and called the
mCldent shameful.

Trafficking in human beings
Ukrame contmued to be a major source of men, women
and children trafficked abroad, despite government
efforts to address the problem. Article 149 of the
Cnmmal Code, which came mto force in 200 1 ,
criminalizes trafficking. The comprehensive anti­
trafficking programme for 2002-2005, which included
measures for prevention, prosecution and protection,
continued to be implemented. However, a report
published m April by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF),
the Organization for Security and Co-operation m
Europe, the US Agency for I nternational Aid and the
British Council Identified weaknesses m the steps being
taken to stop trafficking. The report recommended
amendments to domestic legislation to address
mternal trafficking, which was not mcluded in Article
149. I t also drew attention to the increasing number of
minors being trafficked, and identi fied domestic
Violence as a major factor m forcing women to seek
work abroad.
Update: 'disappeara  ' of Georgiy Gongadze
In January President Yushchenko promised that those
responsible for the "disappearance" m September 2000
of mvestigatlve Journalist Georgiy Gongadze would be
brought before a court withm two months. In March,
two suspects were detained and allegedly confessed.
On 5 March former Minister of I nternal Affairs, YurYI
Kravchenko, committed SUicide. He was due to be
questioned that day in connection with the
investigation. On 20 September parliament heard the
long-delayed report of the investigating committee,
which concluded that Georgiy Gongadze had been
murdered, that the crime had been organized by former
PreSident Leonld Kuchma and YurYI Kravchenko, and
that other high rankmg offiCials had been mvolved. On
8 November the European Court of Human Rights ruled
that Ukrame had Violated three articles of the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms in the case of Georgiy
Gongadze.

Incommu nicado detention
At least three political suspects were detained
incommunicado and without charge for several
months. Political detainees were mostly held by State
Security (Amn al-Dawla) officials, apparently on
suspicion of holding Islamist views or calling for
political reforms, although no reasons were given. They
were held in solitary confinement and denied visitors,
but allowed to make brief, usually monthly, telephone
calls to their families.
a 'Abdullah Sultan al-Subaihat, Mohammad Ahmad
Saif al-Ghufli and Sa'eed 'AIi Hamid al-Kutbi, were
arrested on 2 August, and their homes and offices were
searched. They were held incommunicado, reported ly
in Abu Dhabi, but released without charge on 25
October.
a Humeid Salem al-Ghawas al-Za'abi, a high-ranking
officer in the UAE air force who was arrested in March
2004, continued to be held incommunicado throughout
2005· No charges were known to have been brought
against him.
Torture and cruel judicial punishments
A foreign national was reported to have been tortured
in May by police. 'Abdul Hameed Abu Fayad, an Irish
national of Libyan origin, was said to have been beaten
and threatened with rape by police in Sharjah in order
to force him to confess to embezzlement.
Courts in some UAE Emirates continued to impose
floggings for a range of offences.
a In October a foreign woman employed as a
domestic worker was sentenced to 150 lashes for
becoming pregnant outside marriage by a Shana
(IslamiC law) Court in the Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. It
was not known whether the sentence was carried out.

Severa l political suspects were deta ined and held
incommunicado at undisclosed locations, in some
cases for months. A criminal suspect was alleged to
have been tortured and at least one person, a foreign
domestic worker, was sentenced to flogging, An
a pplication submitted in 2004 to esta blish a n
i ndependent h u m a n rights organization was still
not gra nted.

Discrimination aga inst women
Women continued to be subject to discrimination
under UAE laws, including the nationality law. This
speCifies that women, unlike men, cannot pass on
their UAE nationality to their chi ldren i f their spouses
are foreign nationals. These chi ldren, in consequence,
suffer serious restrictions on their reSidency,
employment and education rights. They are
conSidered migrant workers for employment
purposes and required to pay higher fees for higher
education.

Background
I n July a new federal law was introduced to prohibit the
use of boys under the age of 18 as jockeys in camel
races. In May the government agreed to establish a
joint programme with the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF)
to repatriate to their home countries children who had
been brought to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to be
used as camel jockeys.
In Dubai Emirate, hundreds of mostly Asian migrant
workers demonstrated outside the Labour and Social
Affairs Ministry in September in protest at their
working conditions and their employers' failure to pay
their wages. In response, ministry offiCials were said to
be pursuing these issues with the employers.

Freedom of expression and human rights
organizations
In Fujairah Emirate, the authorities intervened at the last
minute to ban a conference on civil rights, women's
rights and democracy due to take place on 21 September.
It was to be attended by local rights advocates,
intellectuals and members of the UAE's Jurists'
Association. The authorities gave no reasons for the ban.
By the end of 2005, the Ministry of Labour and Social
Affairs had sti ll not responded to an applicatIOn
submitted in July 2004 by the UAE Association for
Human Rights for legal registration as UAE's first
independent human rights organization. It gave no
explanation for the delay.

The government continued to erode fundamental
human rights, the rule of law and the independence
of the judiciary, including by persisting with
attempts to u ndermine the ban on torture at home
and a broad, and by enacting a nd seeking to enact
legislation inconsistent with domestic and
international human rights law. Nonetheless, it lost
its legal battle to reverse the ban on the admissibility
in j udicial proceedings of information obtained
through torture as evidence. In July, 52 people were
killed a nd hundreds wounded as a result of bomb
attacks on the London transport system. Measures
purporting to counter terrorism led to serious human
rights violations, and concern was widespread a bout
the impact of these measures on Muslims and other
minority commu nities. Public judicial inquiries into
cases of alleged state collusion in past killings in
Northern Ireland began, but the government
continued to fail to esta blish an inquiry into the
killing of Patrick Finucane. Proposed legislation that
would impact on past human rights a buses in
Northern Ireland gave rise to serious concern.
'Anti-terrorism' measures
Serious human rights violations continued, including
the persecution of men labelled by the government as
"suspected international terrorists" on the basis of
secret intel ligence. Proposed and enacted measures
involved punishment of people whom the authorities
deemed a threat but against whom they said there was
insufficient evidence to present to a court.
Amnesty International Report 2006

In the aftermath of the December 2004 ruling of the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (the Law
Lords) that indefinite detention was incompatible
with the right to liberty and the prohibition of
discrimination, the government failed to provide
prompt redress to the victims. I nstead, it waited until
March for the relevant legislative provision to lapse.
Simultaneously, the government passed the Prevention
ofTerrorism Act 2005 (PTA), which was inconsistent
with the spirit of the Law Lords' ruling and allowed for
violations of a wide range of human rights. The PTA
gave a government minister unprecedented powers to
issue "control orders" to restrict the liberty, movement
and activities of people purportedly suspected of
involvement in terrorism, again on the basis of secret
intelligence. The imposition of "control orders" was
tantamount to the executive "charging", "trying" and
"sentencing" a person without the fair trial guarantees
required in criminal cases.
In March the government imposed "control orders"
on people interned under the previous legislation,
subjecting them to severe restrictions and violating
their human rights. "Control orders" were later imposed
on other people, including at least one UK national.
In june the European Committee for the Prevention
of Torture (CPT) published a report on its March 2004
visit. It found that detention under the Anti-terrorism
Crime and Security Act 2001 had caused mental
disorders in most of those interned, and that detention
had been even more detrimental to their health
because of its indefinite character and the lack of
knowledge about the evidence against them. The CPT
considered that the situation of some of them at the
time of the visit amounted to inhuman and degrading
treatment.
Also in june the Commissioner for Human Rights of
the Council of Europe published a report of his
November 2004 visit. This expressed concern about
the PTA; the admisSion, as evidence, of information
obtained through torture in judicial proceedings;
prison conditions; the treatment of asylum-seekers; the
low age of criminal responsibility; discrimination; and
the need to set up public inquiries capable of
establishing the full circumstances surrounding cases
of alleged state collusion in killings In Northern Ireland.
In August the Prime Minister proposed new
measures to counter terrorism. Most of them were
inconsistent with the UK's obligations under domestic
and international human rights law and many targeted
non-U K citizens.
The government concluded Memorandums of
Understanding with jordan, Libya and Lebanon. It
asserted that the "diplomatic assurances" featured in
these memorandums could be relied on to relieve the
UK of its domestic and international obligation not to
send anyone to a country where they would be at risk of
torture or other i l l-treatment.
In August, most of the former internees were
rearrested and, together with others newly arrested,
were imprisoned under immigration legislation
pending deportation on national security grounds. The
government maintained it could forCibly remove the

2 69

UNI

men, relying on the Memorandums of Understanding.
The detainees were held In prisons far from their
families, lawyers and doctors. Some of those detained
had recently been acquitted by a UK court of terrorism­
related charges. In October, partly as a result of their
sertously deteriorating mental and physical health, a
number of former internees were granted bail on
conditions amounting to house arrest.
In October, a new Terrorism Bill was published. I t
contained sweeping and vague provisions that, if
enacted, would undermine the rights to freedom of
expression, aSSOCiation, liberty and fair trial. In
November the Bill's proposal to extend the maximum
period of poltce detention without charge from 14 to 90
days was rejected In parliament; a provision of 28 days
was agreed. The Bill underwent further parliamentary
scrutiny.
In December the government faced mounting
accusatIOns that it had allowed the USA to use UK
territory in the context of secret transfers of
indiViduals Without any judicial process ("renditions")
to countries where they were reportedly tortured and
to vartous US detention centres around the world.

Police shooti ngs
a In July, after police shot dead Jean Charles de
Menezes, an unarmed Brazilian man on his way to work
in London, there were crucial delays in initiating an
independent investigation into the killing. Evidence
emerged giving rise to suspicion of an early attempt at a
cover-up by the police.
a In October the prosecuting authorities declined to
bring charges against the police officers involved in
shooting dead an unarmed man, Harry Stanley, as he
was walking down a street in London in 1999 ·
Torture 'evidence'
In December, seven Law Lords unanimously confirmed
the inadmissibility as evidence in judicial proceedings
of information extracted under torture. They also ruled
that there was a duty to investigate whether torture had
taken place, and to exclude any evidence if the
conclusion was that, on the balance of probabi lities, it
had been obtained through torture. AI coordinated a
coalltton of 14 organizations that jointly intervened in
the case.
The case had been brought by 10 foreign nationals
against being labelled "suspected international
terrorists" by the UK authorities. As a result of the
judgment, their cases were to be referred back to the
court of first instance for its reconsideration of the
"evidence".
Guantanamo Bay
In January the last four remaining UK nationals were
released from US detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
However, at least seven UK reSidents continued to be
held there, including Bisher al-Rawi, an I raqi national
legally resident in the UK, and Jamil AI-Banna, a
Jordanian national With refugee status in the UK. The
UK authorities were implicated in their unlawful
transfer to US custody, and continued to refuse to make
270

representations on behalf of the UK reSidents to the US
authorities.
a I n December, a UK court ruled that David Hicks, an
Australian national detained in Guantanamo Bay, was
entitled to be registered as a UK citizen and therefore to
receive assistance by UK authorities.

UK armed forces in Iraq
The UK breached international and domestic human
rights law through its role in the internment without
charge of at least 10,000 people in Iraq. UK offiCials sat,
along with US and I raqi offiCials, on the JOint Detention
Review Board, which reviewed the cases of all those
interned by members of the Multinational Force in I raq
(in most cases, by US troops). At the end of October, the
UK was itself holding 33 "security internees" in Iraq
without charge or trial .
a H i l a l Abdul-Razzaq AIi AI-Jedda, a dual l raql-UK
national who was arrested in October 2004, continued
to be detained without charge in Iraq by UK forces.
a In December the Court of Appeal of England and
Wales ruled in the case of AI-Skeini that the Human
Rights Act 1998 in principle had extra-territorial effect,
and that the system for investigating deaths at the
hands of UK armed forces personnel was seriously
defiCient, including in its lack of independence from the
commanding officer.
Refugees and asylu m-seekers
The Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill continued
to be discussed in parliament. Provisions in the Bill, if
enacted, would undermine one of the core purposes of
the UN Refugee Convention - to provide protection for
people seeking asylum on grounds of political
persecution.
An increasing number of people who sought asylum in
the UK were detained under Immigration Act powers at
the beginning and end of the asylum process. Those
detained included families with children, torture
survivors and other vulnerable people. They were held in
grim prison-like establishments and some complained of
racist and other verbal abuse in detention.
There was no maximum time limit to such detention,
nor was there an automatic and regular review by a
court or a similar competent body as to the lawfulness
of the decision to detain. In most cases, detention was
arbitrary and other measures short of detention would
have sufficed.
Prisons
Martin Narey, the outgoing chief executive in charge of
prison and probation services, criticized the record­
breaking increase in the prison population, which had led
to severe overcrowding. He also said it was "gross" that
about 16,000 prisoners were held in conditions in which
they had to share a toilet in a cell in which they also ate.
The number of self-inflicted deaths continued to be high.
Inquiries Act 2005
The Inquiries Act 2005 came into force in June. It
undermined the rule of law, the independence of the
judiciary and human rights protection. I t therefore
Amnesty International Report 2006

UNI

failed to provide for effective, independent, impartial
or thorough public judicial inquiries into serious human
rights violations. AI called for its repeal.

Northern Ireland
Direct rule continued. In December the prosecuting
authorities dropped all charges in the criminal
prosecution which, in October 2002, had precipitated
the suspension of the Northern I reland Assembly and
the reintroduction of direct rule by the U K
government. Shortly after, one of t h e people against
whom charges had been dropped, a senior Sinn Fein
politician, confessed publicly that he was a British
agent.
Collusion and political killi ngs
Three separate public judicial inquiries into al legations
of state collusion in the killings of Robert Hamill, Billy
Wright and Rosemary Nelson began under Northern
Ireland legislation. However, in November the
Secretary of State for Northern I reland converted the
Billy Wright Inquiry into an inquiry to be held under the
Inquiries Act, a move opposed by AI.
The government stated that it was making
arrangements to establish an inquiry into the 1989
killing of prominent human rights lawyer Patrick
Finucane under the Inquiries Act. It added that it was
likely that a large proportion of the evidence would be
conSidered in private since it involved issues "at the
heart of the national security infrastructure in
Northern Ireland". AI denounced as a sham the
prospect of a Finucane inquiry under the Inquiries Act.
legacy of the past
The government took two initiatives described as
moves to address the legacy of past human rights
abuses. In April a H istorical Enquiry Team (HET) was set
up with the view to the Police Service of Northern
Ireland investigating unresolved conflict-related
deaths. This gave rise to concern about a lack of
independence in the investigation. In November the
Northern I reland (Offences) Bill was introduced in
parliament which, if enacted, would sanction impunity
for past human rights abuses committed by state agents
and paramilitaries, and deprive victims of effective
redress. In light of this, there was concern about the
relevance of the HET's work.
Abuses by non-state actors
Abuses by members of paramilitary organizations,
including killings, shootings and beatings, continued.
Seven killings were attributed to members of Loyalist
groups, two to members of Republican groups, and one
pointed to Loyalist involvement.
a In january, Robert McCartney, a CatholiC, was
killed and another man seriously injured in the same
attack. According to the police, the attack was carried
out by members of the Provisional Irish Republican
Army, a lthough not sanctioned by the organization. In
their search for justice, the McCartney family and their
supporters were intimidated and threatened. In june,
two people were charged in connection with the attack.
a In March, Stephen Nelson died as a result of
injuries sustained during an assault in September 2004.
The I ndependent Monitoring Commission attributed
Amnesty International Report 2006

his death to members of the Ulster Defence
Association, a Loyalist paramilitary organization.

Violence against women
An opinion pol l commissioned by AIUK about attitudes
towards sexual assault against women revealed
widespread discriminatory and stereotypical views in
the UK. Two women each week on average were killed
by a partner or former partner. The UK continued to
have very low conviction rates for the crime of rape
with only 5.6 per cent of rapes reported to the police
resulting in conviction.

Thousands of detainees continued to be held in US
custody without charge or trial in Iraq, Afgha nistan
a nd the US naval base in Guanta namo Bay, Cuba.
There were reports of secret US-run detention
centres in undisclosed locations where deta inees
were held in circumstances a mounting to
"disa ppearances". Dozens of Guanta namo
deta inees went on hunger strike to protest against
their harsh treatment and lack of access to the
courts; some were reported to be seriously ill.
Reports of deaths in custody, torture and ill­
treatment by US forces in Iraq, Afgha nistan and
Guanta namo continued to emerge. Despite
evidence that the US government had sanctioned
interrogation techniques constituting torture or ill­
treatment, and "disappeara  s", there was a
fa ilure to hold officials at the hig hest levels
accountable, including individuals who may have
been guilty of wa r crimes or crimes against
humanity. Several trials took place of low-ra nking
soldiers charged with abusing detainees; i n most
cases sentences were light. There were reports of
police brutality and use of excessive force in the
USA. Sixty-<>ne people died after being struck by
police tasers, a huge rise over previous years. Sixty
people were executed, taking the tota l to over 1 ,000
since executions resumed in 1 97 7.
Guantii namo Bay
At the end of 2005 around 500 detainees of around 35
natiOnalities continued to be held wIthout charge or
tnal at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay; most had
been captured during the internatIonal armed conflict
In AfghanIstan In 2001 and were held for al leged links to
al-Oa'ida or the former Taleban government. They
included at least two juveniles who were under 16 when
they were taken into custody.
LegIslatIon passed in December (the Detainee
Treatment Act of 2005) removed the nght of
Guantanamo detainees to file habeas corpus claIms
In the US federal courts against their detention or
treatment, allOWing Instead only lImIted appeals
against the decIsions of the Combatant Status Review
Tribunals (see below) and mIlitary commiSSIons. The
legIslation called Into question the future of some 200
pending cases in which detainees had challenged the
272

legalIty o f their detention following a U S Supreme Court
ruling In 2004 that they had the right to file such claims.
By March, the Combatant Status Review Tribunals
(CSRT), administratIve panels set up in 2004, had
determIned that 93 per cent of the 554 detainees then
being held were "enemy combatants". The detainees
had no legal representation and many declined to
attend the CSRT heanngs, which could consider secret
eVIdence and evidence extracted under torture.
In August an unknown number of detainees resumed
a hunger stnke, inItiated in June, to protest against
their continued lack of access to the courts and alleged
harsh treatment, Including beatings, by guards. More
than 200 detainees were said to be taking part at one
stage, although the US Department of Defense said the
number was much lower. Several detainees al leged
they had been verbally and physically abused while
being force-fed, sustaining injuries when guards
roughly inserted feeding tubes through their noses. The
government denIed any ill-treatment. The hunger
strike was continuing at the end of the year.
In November, three UN human nghts experts
declined an offer by the US government to visit
Guantanamo as it had placed restrictions Inconsistent
WIth the standard terms of reference for such viSIts.

Military commissions
In November the US Supreme Court, ruling in the case
of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, agreed to review the legality
of the mil itary commIssions set up under a
presIdential order to try foreign terror suspects.
However, a further five Guantanamo detainees were
named to stand trial before the commISSions, whIch
are executive bodies, not impartial or independent
courts, bringing the total number deSignated to
appear before them to nine. The government
scheduled arraIgnment hearings before the
commiSSIOns for January for two of those charged.
One of them was Omar Khadr, who was 15 when taken
into custody and whose mental health and a l leged ill­
treatment remained a particular cause for concern.
Detentions in I raq and Afghanistan
During the year, thousands of 'security internees" were
held without charge or trial by US forces In Iraq.
RegulatIons governing detentions stipulated that
Internees must either be released or transferred to
IraqI cnmlnal Junsdiction within 1 8 months. They also
provided that detainees could continue to be interned
by the US-led MultI-National Force indefinitely for
'continued imperatIve reasons of security". The
International Committee of the Red Cross (iCRC) visited
detainees in internment facilities but not those held in
US dIviSIOn or brigade holding facilities ImmedIately
after arrest.
In AfghanIstan, hundreds of detainees continued to
be held in US military custody Without charge or tnal or
access to familIes or lawyers at Bagram alrbase, some
for more than a year. Although the ICRC had access to
detainees at Bagram, it had no access to detainees held
in an unknown number of US forward operating bases.
There were reports of ill-treatment in such faCilities,
Amnesty International Report 2006

UNI

including detainees being stripped naked during
interrogation and deprived of food and sleep.

Detentions in undisclosed locations
There were continued reports that the US Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) operated a network of secret
detentIon facilities in variOUS countries. Such facilIties
were a lleged to detain indIviduals Incommunicado
outsIde the protection of the law In cIrcumstances
amounting to "disappearances". Three Yemeni
detainees told AI that they had been held in isolation
for between 16 and 1 8 months in three detention
facilIties apparently run by the USA in unknown
locations; their cases suggested that such detentions
were not confined to a small number of "high value"
detainees as prevIOusly suspected. In November the
Council of Europe launched an investigation into
reports that the network of US secret prisons included
sites in Eastern Europe. The US authorities refused to
confirm or deny the a llegations.
Allegations of US involvement in the secret and
I llegal transfer of detainees between countries,
exposing them to the risk of torture and i l l-treatment,
continued.
Torture and ill-treatment outside the USA
Evidence continued to emerge of the torture and ill­
treatment of detainees in Guantanamo, Afghanistan
and Iraq, before and after the abuses in Abu Ghraib
prison, Iraq, which came to light in April 2004. Further
Information was published describing interrogation
techniques officially approved at various periods for
"war on terror" detainees, whIch included the use of
dogs to inspire fear, stress posItions, exposure to
extremes of heat or cold, sleep deprivation and
isolation.
There was continued faIlure to hold senior officials
accountable for abuses. The final report of Naval
Inspector General Vice-Admiral Church into
Department of Defense interrogation operations
worldwide, a summary of which was published in
March, found "no link between approved interrogation
techniques and detainee abuse". This was despite the
fact that many such techniques violate international
standards that prohibit torture and il l-treatment. The
Church investigation did not interview a single
detainee or former detainee, nor did It interview
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. No inquiries
examined the CIA whose activities remained shrouded
in secrecy.
The US Army reported in March that 27 deaths of
detainees in US custody in Iraq and Afghanistan during
raids, capture or in detention facilities had been listed
as confirmed or suspected homIcides. Some cases were
under Investigation while others had been referred to
other agencies or were recommended for prosecution.
Other sources, including court records and autopsy
reports, strongly indIcated that some detainees had
died after torture dUring or after interrogations.
There was also eVidence to suggest that delays and
deficiencies in investigations had hampered
prosecutions.
Amnesty International Report 2006

i n March the American Civil Liberties UnIon (ACLU)
and Human Rights First filed a federal lawsUIt on behalf
of eight men who had been tortured and ill-treated in
US military detention facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan,
seeking a declaration that Secretary Rumsfeld was
responsible for violating US and international laws. The
lawsuit, which was stil l pending at the end of the year,
also sought compensatory damages for the victims.
Several trials of US milItary personnel accused of
abusing detainees took place during the year, mainly
involving low-ranking soldiers. Many received
sentences that did not reflect the gravity of the crimes.
In March the government rescinded an April 2003
Pentagon Working Group Report on Detainee
I nterrogations which stated, among other things, that
the President had authority during milItary operatIons
to override the international prohibitIon against
torture with regard to interrogations. In November the
Pentagon approved a new policy directIve governing
interrogations, which would allow the army to issue a
long-delayed revised field manual. The directive stated
that "acts of physical or mental torture are prohibIted".
However, It did not elaborate other than to order that
detainees be treated humanely "in accordance with
applIcable law and policy". In December the Army
announced it had approved a new classIfied set of
interrogation methods to be added to the revIsed Army
Field Manual. Although the manual would specifically
prohibit stripping, prolonged stress positions, sleep
deprivation and use of dogs in interrogations, there
was concern that the classified addendum may stil l
include abusIve techniques.
In December, Congress passed legIslation
prohibiting the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
of people in the custody or control of the US
government anywhere in the world. However, concern
remained that a statement attached by President Bush
when signing the bill into law effectively reserved the
right of the executive to bypass the provision on
national security grounds.
a In August and September, trials took place in a
military court of US soldiers accused of abusing two
Afghan detainees, Dilawar and Habibullah, who died
from multiple blunt force injuries whIle being
interrogated in an isolation section of the Bagram
airbase in December 2002. As of December 2005, seven
low-ranking soldiers had been convIcted and received
sentences ranging from five months' Imprisonment to
reprimand, loss of pay and reduction in rank. No one
had been found responsible for serious offences such
as torture or other war crimes.

Detention of 'enemy combata nts' in the USA
a Jose Padilla - a US national held for more than
three years without charge in US mIlitary detention ­
was among five people indicted In a US federal court I n
November o n charges of conspIracy t o murder US
nationals overseas and supporting terrOrists. The
charges made no mention of the a lleged conspIracy to
detonate a "dirty bomb" in a US city for which he was
originally detained. The J ustice Department sought
permission from the Appeals Court to transfer him to
273

UNI

the federal prison system. However, the court did not
agree and Instead issued an order requiring both the
government and his lawyers to submit briefs on
whether it should withdraw Its earlier ruling upholding
the President's power to detain Jose Padilla indefinitely
as an "enemy combatant". The issue had not been
deCided on by the end of the year.
a AIi Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a Oatari national,
remained detained without charge or trial as an "enemy
combatant" In military custody. A lawsuit was filed in
August al leging that he was suffering from severe
physical and mental health problems as a result of his
treatment, which included sleep deprivation, sensory
deprivation, punitive shackling, exposure to cold, and
disrespectful handling of the Ou'ran.

Prisoners of conscience
a Kevin Benderman, a US army sergeant, was
sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment in July for
refusing to redeploy to I raq on grounds of his
conscientious objection to the war, developed during
a first term of service there. His application for
conscientious objector status was refused on the
ground that hiS objection was not to war in general but
to a particular war.
e Camilo Mejia Castillo, Abdullah Webster and Pablo
Paredes, three former soldiers imprisoned for their
conscientious objection to serving in I raq, were
released during the year.
Tria l of Ahmed Omar Abu Ali
Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, a US national, was convicted in a
US federal court in November on charges of conspiracy
to commit acts of terrorism. The trial was flawed as the
Jury was not allowed to hear evidence supporting
claims by Ahmed Abu AIi that his videotaped
confession, on which the prosecution relied almost
exclusively, had been obtained following torture in
Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Abu Ali a lleged that he was
flogged and threatened with death by the Interior
Ministry's General Intelligence (al-Mabahith al-Amma)
while being held Incommunicado in Saudi Arabia in
200). During the trial, general statements on the
treatment of detainees from Saudi Arabian officials
were used to undermine Ahmed Abu Airs allegations,
while the defence lawyers were not al lowed to present
any evidence pertaining to Saudi Arabia's human rights
record on torture.
I l l-treatment and excessive use of force
There were continued reports of ill-treatment and
deaths in custody Involving tasers - electro-shock
weapons deployed by some 7,000 US police and
correctional agencies.
Sixty-one people died after being struck by police
tasers, bringing to 142 the total number of such deaths
since 2001 . Coroners found tasers had caused or
contributed to at least 10 of the deaths In 2005,
increasing concerns about the safety of such weapons.
Most of those who died were unarmed men who
reportedly did not pose a serious threat when they
were electro-shocked. Many were given multiple or
274

prolonged shocks, potentially harmful acts highlighted
in a Department of Defense preliminary study into
taser safety published in April 2005.
Several police departments suspended the use of
tasers, others tightened the rules for taser use.
However, most departments continued to authorize
tasers in a wide range of situations, including against
unarmed people who resisted arrest or refused to obey
police commands. Mentally disturbed and intoxicated
individuals, children and the elderly were among those
shocked.
AI renewed its call on the US authorities to suspend
use and sales of tasers and other stun weapons pending
a rigorous, independent inquiry into their use and
effects.
a In February police in Florida tasered a 1 3-year-old
girl who had been fighting with her mother. The girl was
handcuffed in the back of a police patrol car when she
was shocked.
a In February, a 14-year-old developmentally
disabled boy went into cardiac arrest after being
shocked with a police taser in Chicago, I l l inois, as he
was sitting on a sofa in a care home and, according to
police, attempted to stand up "in an aggressive
stance". Doctors who treated him said the taser
shocks had caused a potentially fatal disturbance of
the heart rhythm and that he would have died had he
not been immediately resuscitated by medical staff at
the scene.
a Seventeen-year-old Kevin Omar, who was acting
erratically under the influence of drugs, lapsed into a
coma after being shocked three times by police officers
from Waco, Texas; he died two days later. The medical
examiner said he believed the taser was a contributory
factor in the death.

Abuses of lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people
In September AIUSA published a report, Stonewalled:
police abuse and misconduct against lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender people in the United States.

The report found that, although there was greater
recognition of the rights of LGBT people, many still
faced discriminatory treatment and verbal and physical
abuse by police. It also showed that within the LGBT
community, transgender individuals, people of colour,
youth, immigrants, homeless individuals and sex
workers experienced a heightened risk of abuse. The
report found that police often fai led to respond
adequately to hate crimes or domestic violence against
LGBT people.

Death penalty
In 2005, 60 people were executed, bringing to 1,005 the
total number of prisoners put to death since executions
resumed in the USA in 1977 following a moratorium. Two
people were released from death row on grounds of
innocence, bringing to 122 the total number of such
cases since 1973On I March the US Supreme Court banned the
execution of child offenders - those aged under 18 at
the time of the crime - bringing the USA Into line with
Amnesty International Report 2006

UNI

international standards prohibiting such executions.
Twenty-two child offenders had been executed in the
USA since 1 977.
Executions continued of people with mental i l l    
and disorders, of prisoners who had been denied
adequate legal representation at trial, and in cases
where the rel iability of evidence had been questioned.
Cl Troy Kunkle was executed in Texas on 25January,
despite suffering from serious mental illness, including
schizophrenia, evidence of which was not presented to
the jury that sentenced him to death. He was just over
18 at the time of the crime and had suffered a childhood
of deprivation and abuse.
Cl Frances Newton was executed in Texas on 1 4
September, despite doubts over the reliability of her
conviction. She was found guilty on the basis of
circumstantial evidence, and always maintained that
she was innocent.

H u rricane Katrina
In August Hurricane Katrina swept across Louisiana,
killing more than 1 , 000 people and leaving hundreds of
thousands of others homeless or temporarily displaced
without their basic needs for food, clean water and
medicines met. There was widespread anger at the
federal government's slow response to the
humanitarian disaster.
Scores of inmates in New Orleans Parish Prison were
allegedly abandoned by guards following the
hurricane. Prisoners reported being left locked in cells
for days without food or drinking water as flood waters
rose. There were reports, denied by the Louisiana
authorities, that some prisoners had drowned. AI called
for a full inquiry and for the authorities to ensure that
all prisoners were fully accounted for. It also called for
an investigation into allegations that evacuated
inmates were i l l-treated.

Hundreds of irregular or undocumented migrants die in

Other concerns
A joint study published in October by AI and Human
Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life without
Parole for Child Offenders in the United States,

reported that at least 2,225 child offenders under 18 at
the time of the crime were serving sentences of l i fe
without parole. Such a sentence for child offenders is
prohibited under the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child, signed but not ratified by the USA. Of the
cases examined, 1 6 per cent of the offenders were aged
between 13 and 15 at the time of the crime and 59 per
cent received the sentence for their first conviction.
Many were convicted of 'felony murder" based on
evidence of their participation in a crime during which a
murder took place, but without direct evidence of their
involvement in the killing. The report called on the US
authorities to stop sentencing children to life without
parole and to grant child offenders serving such
sentences immediate access to parole procedures.

Progress was made in dea ling with human rights
violations committed in the 1 970s a nd 1 980s.
However, in most cases justice remained obstructed
by the 1 986 Expiry Law, which prevented legal
proceedings against those involved in violations in
this period. There were reports of the i ll-treatment of
detainees and of harsh conditions in prisons.
Impunity under the Expiry Law
The government of PreSident Tabare Vazquez Rosas
initiated a number of investigations to establish the
fate and burial places of victims of "disappearances"
from the period of military government (1973-1985). The
investigation sites included military barracks where a
number of human remains were discovered. Three
cases of past human rights violations were taken before
the courts. However, no attempts were made to abolish
the Expiry Law.
The government ofTabare Vazquez Rosas
interpreted the scope of the Expiry Law as limited to
human rights violations committed under the military
governments after the j une 1973 military coup. This
Interpretation opened up the possibility of legal action
against some 600 active and former members of the
armed forces in connection with crimes committed
before the coup.
The new government also excluded from the Expiry
Law three cases that took place in Argentina, allegedly
with the co-operation of Uruguayan and Argentine
armed forces. The three cases were subsequently
brought before the courts.
a In j une, former President juan Maria Bordaberry
and former Minister of Foreign Affairs j uan Carlos
Blanco were charged with involvement in the
murders of legislators Zelmar M ichelini and Hector
Guti«�rrez Ruiz and activists Rosario Barredo and
William Whitelaw. All four were kil led in Argentina
i n 1976.
a I n August the armed forces revealed that the
remains of Maria Claudia Garcia de Gelman, who
"disappeared" with her husband in 1976, were almost
certainly buried in the grounds of the army's 14th
Battalion near the capital, Montevideo. However, in
November the Appeals Court shelved the case on the
grounds that it was covered by the Expiry Law.
Ill-treatment of prisoners
There were reports of detainees, including minors,
being ill-treated in police stations.
276

Harsh conditions and other ill-treatment were
reported at Libertad Prison, in the department of San
jose, 50km from Montevideo. In june, hundreds of
prisoners staged a hunger strike in protest at
overcrowding at the prison and at the lack of food,
medical assistance, hot water or electricity. They also
demanded that Congress urgently introduce legislation
to ease prison overcrowding.
In September, the Senate passed the Humanization
and Modernization of the Prison System Law. The law
aimed to relieve overcrowding in prisons by granting
provisional or early release to certain categories of
prisoners.

Background
In response to Uzbekistan's refusal to a l low an
independent international investigation of the May
killings in Andizhan, the European UnIOn (EU) in
November announced an embargo on EU arms sales
and military transfers to Uzbekistan, and a one-year
visa ban on 12 senior government ministers and
officials. However, the Minister of Internal Affairs was
granted a n exception on humanitarian grounds to
receive medical treatment in Germany. In turn the
authonties in Uzbeklstan banned European members
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) from
using their a irspace and asked a l l , apart from
Germany, to withdraw their troops from Termez
alrbase. The UN General Assembly adopted a
resolution, put forward by the EU, expressing deep
regret over Uzbekistan's refusal to al low an
international investigation and urging the authorities
to stop their "harassment and detention of
eyewi tnesses".
Also in November the US military completed its
withdrawal from Khanabad airbase, as requested by the
Uzbekistani authorities. The airbase had been leased
since October 2001 as part of the US-led "war on terror".
On 14 November, the government signed a mutual
defence agreement with the Russian Federation that
would al low Russian use of military facilities In
Uzbekistan.
'Akramia' trials
On 11 February, 23 business entrepreneurs prominent
in I slamic charitable work went on tnal at the Altinkul
District Court, Andizhan. They were charged with
attempting to overthrow the constitutional order,
membership of an i l legal religious organization, and
possessing or d istributing literature that threatened
public safety. Arrested between June and August 2004,
the men were accused of being members of a group
seeking to establish an Islamic state and linked to the
banned Islamist opposition party H izb-ut-Tahrir,
categorized as a "terrorist" organization in
Uzbekistan. The authorities named the supposed
group " Akramia" after its a lleged founder, Akram
Yuldashev, serving a 17-year prison sentence for
"terrorism" and other anti-state charges imposed in
1 999. The 23 consistently denied the charges or
membership of any group. They appeared to have
been held a lmost completely incommunicado in pre­
trial detention. They said they were repeatedly
threatened, subjected to physical, sexual and mental
torture and ill-treatment, and forced to sign
i ncriminating statements under duress.
Other individuals were arrested and charged in
connected cases.
a In February, nine men - all employees of one of the
23 entrepreneurs, who owned a furniture company in
Tashkent - were charged with attempting to overthrow
the constitutional order and membership of an illegal
religious organization. In July, three of them were
sentenced to between 15 and a half and 16 years in
prison after an unfair trial. They were among 20
employees detained in September 2004 and reportedly
Amnesty International Report 2006

coerced into saying they were Akramia leaders in
Tashkent. The fate of the remaining detainees was not
known.
a In another case, a group of I) men were reportedly
arrested in Andizhan on 23 and 24 January, and charged
with similar offences.

13 May killings
During the night of 12 to 1 3 May, unidentified armed men
broke into military barracks and the prison I n
Andizhan, reportedly freeing t h e 23 entrepreneurs and
hundreds of other prisoners, and occupying the
regional government bUilding. I n the course of the day,
thousands of people gathered in the main square,
reportedly to demand justice and an end to poverty.
According to the authorities, civilians took hostage a
number of offiCials, and gunfire was exchanged
between armed men and the security forces.
Throughout I) May the security forces reportedly fired
sporadica l ly on the mostly unarmed and peaceful
crowd. In the early evening, after surrounding the
protesters with buses, armed personnel carriers and
other barriers, the troops fired indiscriminately and
Without warning, killing and wounding as many as )00
and possibly up to 500 people, eyewitnesses said.
Relatives were not allowed to Visit the wounded taken
to hospital.
The same night, hundreds of people fled across the
border to neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, walking in large
groups. The authorities said most did not go voluntarily
but were forced at gunpoint to be human shields for the
armed i nsurgents. Refugees in Kyrgyzstan Insisted they
had not been coerced, and reported that Uzbekistani
troops opened fire without warning as they approached
the border Village ofTeshik Tosh, killing at least eight
people and wounding others, includi ng women (see
Kyrgyzstan entry).
The authorities said that 187 people were killed on 1 3
May, a n d denied that troops h a d used excessive force
or killed civilians, including women and children. At the
end of 2005, the government had yet to publish the
names of those killed. Although a parliamentary
commiSSion of inquiry was established, its members
were closely allied to PreSident Karimov, and
reportedly did not carry out their own investigation
but Simply reviewed the findings of the CrIminal
investigation. The inquiry failed to meet International
standards for a thorough, independent and Impartial
investigation, and the government refused demands for
an international inquiry. Although the trial began in
December of 12 police officers charged with negligence
in connection with the Andizhan events, by the end of
2005 no members of the security forces responsible for
human rights abuses had been brought to Justice.
Extradition requests and forcible returns
Following the 1 3 May killings, the authorities requested
the extradition of suspected supporters of Akramia and
H lzb-ut-Tahm from Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and the
Russian Federation. On 1 6 June the Prosecutor
General's Office said it was seeking the extradition
from Kyrgyzstan of 131 refugees who were "direct
277

UZB

participants in the acts of terrorism ! i n Andizhanl".
a On 9 june, Dilshod Gadzhiev, Tavakkal Gadzhiev,
Muhammad Kadirov and Abdubais ( Gasan) Shakirov
were forcibly taken from a refugee camp at Besh-Kana
to a detention centre in the city of Osh in Kyrgyzstan,
and handed over to Uzbekistani security forces. The
four men were reportedly detained incommunicado,
and at least one of them was tortured, in Andizhan
prison after their return to Uzbekistan. The Uzbekistani
authorities told the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) that the four had returned "voluntarily" and
were held in a detention facility in Tashkent, but denied
the UNHCR access to them.
a Russian law enforcement officers detained 1 4
ethnic Uzbek men in lvanovo in the Russian Federation
on 18 june, a llegedly for swearing and refusing to show
their identity documents. The Uzbekistani authorities
requested their extradition for involvement in the 1 3
May events, supporting Akramia, and financing
"terrorist" activities. All the men denied the
accusations. A Russian citizen among them said he had
visited Uzbekistan in May only to renew his Uzbekistani
passport, and was released on 11 October. The other 13,
a Kyrgyzstani national and 12 Uzbekistani nationals,
applied for asylum in the Russian Federation in August
but were still in custody at the end of 2005.

Unfair trials of 1 3 May suspects
Hundreds of people suspected of involvement in the 1 3
May events were detained, and many were a llegedly ill­
treated or tortured. l n june, the Prosecutor General
said that 102 detainees had been charged. The charges
included "terrorism" and premeditated, aggravated
murder - capital offences - as wel l as attempting to
overthrow the constitutional order and organizing
mass d isturbances.
The first group of 15 defendants went on trial on 20
September. Access to the courtroom was restricted: a
local independent human rights organization was
allowed an observer, but the government refused a
request by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
to send observers. Subsequently, at least four closed
trials reportedly started in November. All were unfair.
Most detainees were believed to have been held
incommunicado before trial and denied access to
lawyers of their choice, relatives or medical assistance.
The identity of the defendants, the charges against
them, and the dates and locations of their trials were
not notified to their relatives. International observers,
human rights activists and families were denied access
to all four trials, which were held in different locations
outside Tashkent. In early December, 58 defendants
were sentenced to terms of imprisonment from 12 to 22
years.
a The first trial, of 15 defendants including Tavakkal
Gadzhiev, opened on 20 September before the
Supreme Court in Tashkent. Access to the court was
restricted. Relatives of the defendants, without notice
of the trial. had not been able to apply to attend. The
defendants pleaded guilty to charges of "terrorism"
and asked for forgiveness, but there were concerns
that their confessions, which followed closely the
278

wording of the charges, had been extracted under
duress. Government officials and the national media
made prejudicial statements that presumed the gUilt
of the defendants. Most defendants had been held
incommunicado and none was granted adequate
access to a lawyer of his choice in pre-trial detention.
There was no cross-examination of defendants or
witnesses, and contradictions in the testimonies were
not addressed. Witnesses for the defence faced
intimidation. Out of hundreds of witnesses who
testified, only one, Makhbuba Zokirova, told the
court she had seen the security forces firing
indiscriminately at mostly unarmed civilians,
including women and chi ldren, even as they ran for
safety. She asked the prosecutor whether she would
be arrested for telling the truth. National newspapers
subsequently denounced her as a traitor and a n
accomplice t o terrorists. On 1 4 November t h e 1 5
defendants were sentenced t o terms of imprisonment
ranging from 1 4 to 20 years. Their appeals against their
sentences were pending at the end of 2005.

Clampdown on dissent
The events in Andizhan were used as a pretext for a
further clampdown on political freedoms in the name
of national security and the "war on terror". Scores of
civil society activists, including human rights activists
and journalists who had tried to document the 13 May
killings, were threatened, assaulted, detained, forcibly
confined to their homes, and had their telephone
connections cut. A number of human rights defenders
considered to be prisoners of conscience were held on
serious criminal charges. The authorities denounced as
traitors and hypocrites those who questioned the
official version of events, restricted access to websites
linked with opposition groups in exile, and blocked the
broadcasts of Russian television stations critical of
Uzbekistan.
a Prominent human rights defender and prisoner of
conscience Saidzhakhon Zainabitdinov was arrested on
21 May and detained. I nitially held in police custody at
the Andizhan Regional Department of Internal Affairs,
he was reportedly transferred to Tashkent in july. His
family and lawyer were denied information about his
whereabouts. In November he was reportedly in an
isolation unit at Tashkent prison, sti ll incommunicado.
I nitially charged with defamation, punishable by up to
three years in prison, in relation to an open letter about
the case of the 23 entrepreneurs, he was subsequently
charged with "terrorism" and other more serious
charges. The real reason for his detention appeared to
be his representation in court of one of the 23, and his
reporting of the 13 May events, which received
international media coverage.
The death pena lty a nd flawed justice
Dozens of death sentences were believed to have been
passed and executions carried out, but the government
did not publish comprehensive statistics. The criminal
justice system was flawed throughout with widespread
corruption and a failure to investigate allegations of
torture. The authorities carried out executions in
Amnesty International Report 2006

VEN

secrecy, not informing relatives of the date of
execution in advance or revealing the place of burial.
The EU strongly encouraged abolition of the death
penalty at a meeting of the EU-Uzbekistan Cooperation
Council in February. I n March the U N Human Rights
Committee deplored the execution of death row
prisoners while their cases were stil l pending before
the Committee.
S On 14 March, the father of Akhrorkhuzha
TolIpkhuzhaev, sentenced to death on ! 9 February 2004,
was turned away when he tried to visit his son. The
following day, when a lawyer asked to see
Akhrorkhuzha TolIpkhuzhaev, prison guards said he was
no longer registered on death row. On 21 March the
authorities assured the UN Human Rights Committee,
which had been considering human rights violations in
the case since May 2004, that he was still alive. On 6
April, his father received a death certificate stating the
execution had taken place on I March. The Human
Rights Committee described Uzbekistan's actions as a
"grave breach" of its international legal obligations.
Under a presidential decree on I August the death
penalty was to be abolished from I January 2008.
However, without any moratorium on the death
penalty or commutation of death sentences, scores of
people remained at risk of execution.

There were reports of unlawful killings of criminal
suspects by police. Most cases were not i nvestigated
a nd the perpetrators remained unpunished. The lack
of independence of the judiciary remained a concern.
Persistent social and economic inequalities
continued to limit access to the economic a nd social
rights of Afro.<Jescenda nts a nd indigenous peoples.
Background
Political polarization continued to be a destabilizing
factor. There were continued concerns that critics of
the government were being harassed, including
through the criminal justice system. Some
confrontations between supporters of President
Chavez and the opposition took place before August
municipal elections, which were won by PreSident
Chavez' party, Movimiento V Republica.
Congressional elections i n December resulted in a
landslide victory for President Chavez' party. after
opposition parties refused to take part, accusing the
electoral body of bias. The elections were largely
regarded as fair by international observers.
International relations with the USA remained tense
as US offiCials continued to accuse PreSident Chavez'
government of threatening the stability of the region.
President Chavez continued to increase Its co-operation
with Latin American nations, including trade and
energy links.
Police brutality
There were continuing reports of human rights
violations by the police, including unlawful killings of
criminal suspects. I n most cases an investigation was
not opened and the alleged perpetrators were not
brought to justice. According to statistics published by
the Public Prosecutor's Office in July, between 2000
and mid-200S, more than 6, 100 people were killed by
police in S, Soo incidents. Of the nearly 6,000 police
officers implicated, only SI7 were charged and fewer
than 2S0 were under arrest.
The Commission of Internal Affairs of the National
Assembly, the Human Rights Ombudsman and the Public
Prosecutor's Office received reports of killings by the
police In Guarico, Aragua, Falcon and Carabobo states.
The National Assembly expressed its commitment to
investigate these allegations. In a report published in
July, local human rights organizations warned of a
pattern of killings, possible "disappearances" and
kldnappings in six states (Anzoategui. Capital District,
Falcon, Miranda, Portuguesa and Yaracay).

Victims of human rights violations, and their relatives,
were reportedly threatened and intimidated by police.
� In January, 16-year-old Rlgoberto Barrios died i n
hospital after being shot eight times b y the police i n
Guanayen town, Aragua State. He was the third
member of his family allegedly killed by the police since
they reported the killing of Narciso Barrios in
December 2003, following an argument with Aragua
State police officers. In June an attempt was made on
the life of Oscar Barrlos. He escaped unharmed. I n
August, J ua n Barrios was threatened b y two uniformed
police officers. The family was granted police
protection In May, fol lowing Instructions from the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights. However, by
the end of 2005, none of the police officers implicated
In the killings and threats had been prosecuted.
Carmen Alicia Mota de Hernandez and her fami ly i n
Valle d e la Pascua town, Guarlco State, were reportedly
subjected to a campaign of intimidation by police
officers after reporting the killing of her husband,
Arturo Hernandez, I n April 2004.

lack of independence of the judiciary
The failure of the JudiCiary and the PubliC Prosecutor's
Office to guarantee Impartial and effective redress
mechanisms for victims of human rights violations
undermined their credibility. According to reports,
98 per cent of human rights violations remained
unpunished. Only a small proportion of judges and
prosecutors were reportedly in permanent
employment.
Human rights defenders
Human rights defenders continued to face harassment
and intimidation.
There were concerns over the safety of members of
the human rights organization COFAVIC (Comite de
Famlliares de Victimas de los Sucesos de Febrero-Marzo
de 1989), after their police protection was Withdrawn i n
March. The organization h a d made a public statement
which criticized the authorities for not bringing to
justice the perpetrators of human rights violations
committed during confrontations in 1989 between the
opposition, the police and the military. In November
2002, the I nter-American Court of Human Rights had
ordered Venezuela to protect members of COFAVIC
after they suffered threats and acts of intimidation.
Freedom of expression
Administrative and tax proceedings were allegedly used
to restrict freedom of expression. The Office of the
Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the
Inter-American CommiSSion on Human Rights expressed
concern over the deciSion of the National Agency for the
Administration of Taxes and Customs to impose a fine
and order a 24-hour closure of the regional newspaper El

Freedom of expression, association and religious

Despite sizeable prisoner a mnesties, political
dissidents remained in prison. The human rights
situation in the Central H ighla nds a nd limited access
to the a rea continued to cause concern. More than
1 80 ethnic minority Montagnards continued to be

Central Highlands
At least 45 members of Montagnard ethnic minority
groups were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment
during 2005. They were charged in connection with the
2001 and April 2004 protests about land ownership and
religious freedom, and for assisting people to leave for
Cambodia. The true figure was believed to be much
higher. Despite severe restrictions on freedom of
expression and on access to the area, reports of arrests,
ill-treatment and forced renunciation of religion
continued to emerge. The human rights situation
caused more Montagnard people to seek asylum in
Cambodia.
A six-month tripartite Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) was signed in January by Vi et
Nam, Cambodia and the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) aimed at resolving the situation of
around 750 Montagnard asylum-seekers in sites in
Cambodia (see Cambodia entry). The MOU contained
significant gaps that reduced the protection of asylum­
seekers returning to Viet Nam. Viet Nam agreed not to
punish returnees for il legally leaving the country, but
this did not preclude punishment for their religious or
political beliefs. UNHCR was allowed several brief
monitoring visits to returnees, apparently
accompanied by Vietnamese officials.
a Y Jim Eban, Y Tuna H'Dok and seven other
Montagnards of the Ede ethnic group were sentenced
to between eight and 13 years' imprisonment in July for
"undermining the national unity policy" by organizing
anti-government protests and helping asylum-seekers.
Political imprisonment
Dissidents continued to be held on espionage charges
for sharing information and opinions on political
reform and human rights via the I nternet. Nguyen Vu
Blnh, Nguyen Khac Toan and Dr Pham Hong Son,
arrested in 2002 and sentenced to between five and 12
years' imprisonment, remained in prison at the end of
2005. Dr Pham Hong Son suffered serious health
problems for which he did not receive appropriate
medical treatment.
a Prisoner of conscience Nguyen Dinh Huy, 73. a
former English and history professor, was released
under the prisoner amnesty to mark Lunar New Year in
February. He was arrested in November 1 993 and
sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for planning an
international conference on democracy and human
rights. He had previously spent 17 years in prison
without charge or trial for "re-education".
Suppression of religious freedom
Religious practice remained under the strict control of
the authorities, despite the release of several religious
dissidents and the issUing of instructions intended to
faCilitate official recognition of churches. Members of
churches seen as opposing state policies were
harassed, arrested and imprisoned, and church
property was destroyed.
The senior leadership of the Unified Buddhist Church
of Vietnam (UBCV) remained under house arrest,
including 86-year-old Supreme Patriarch Thich Huyen
Amnesty International Report 2006

Quang, and his deputy Thich Quang Do. In August, one
member of the Hoa Hao Buddhist church burned
himself a live In protest at religious persecution,
following which at least seven other church members
were arrested.
Religious dissidents and prisoners of conscience
released during 2005 included UBCV Buddhist monk
Thich Thien Mien, detained for 26 years; Father Pham
Ngoc lien (Tri) and Brother Nguyen Thien Phung
(Huang), members of the Congregation of the Mother
Coredemptrix, detained for 18 years; Catholic priest
Father Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly, imprisoned since 200 1 ;
a n d Vietnamese Mennonite Christian Church members,
Le Thl Hong Lien and Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang.
a Vo Van Thanh Liem, a Hoa Hao Buddhist monk, was
arrested in August following harassment by local police
authorities of a temple in An G iang province. He was
sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for "opposing
the public authorities".

Death pena lty
Despite previous indications that the number of capital
offences would be reduced, the death penalty was
retained for 29 crimes, including economic offences.
Large numbers of death sentences and executions were
reported. According to offiCial media sources, at least 21
people were executed and 65 people including SIX
women were sentenced to death. The true figures were
believed to be much higher. Almost all were accused of
drug trafficking offences. Statistics on the death
penalty remained classified as a "state secret".
In June the Ministry of Justice announced a proposal
to change the method of execution from firing squad to
lethal injection. By the end of 2005 this had not been
implemented.
a Duong Quang Tri was sentenced to death by Ho Chi

allegedly involving up to US$382,ooo.
a In January Tran Van Le, a former narcotics police

Hundreds of people were killed in Sa'da Province
amid armed clashes between the security forces and
followers of H ussain Badr a I-Din a l-Huthi, a cleric
from the Zaidi community. Police also a ppa rently
used excessive force during violent protests in J u ly

followers of Hussa in Badr aI-Din al-Huthi were
deta ined without charge or trial, as were hundreds of
people arrested in previous years in the context of
the "war on terror". In the rare cases where political
prisoners were brought to trial, the proceedings fell
far short of international standards. Press freedom
was further restricted a nd journalists were frequently
attacked by police a nd others. The government
continued to forcibly return people to countries
where they risked serious human rights violations.
Dozens of people were reportedly executed a nd
several hundred people remained u nder sentence of
death.
Fuel protests
More than 30 people, including chi ldren, were reported
to have been killed, and hundreds of others injured
when a government decision to double fuel prices
resulted in violent protests across the country on 19120
J u ly. Several soldiers and police were also among those
killed. It was reported that protesters used firearms
and the military used heavy weaponry, including
helicopter fire and tanks.
'War on terror'
At least 200 people continued to be detained Without
charge or trial throughout 2005 as suspects in the "war
on terror". More than 100 others were released after
they agreed to engage in religiOUS dialogue with Islamic
figures and signed a pledge renouncing "extremist"
views. However, dozens of those released were later
rearrested after it was reported that some of those
freed had gone to I raq to fight against US-led forces.
a At least three Yemeni nationals who were returned
to the country from secret, apparently US-run,
detention camps abroad continued to be detained
unlawfully and without trial apparently at the behest of
the US authorities. The Yemeni authorities told Al in
October that they had no basis for detaining
Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmilah, Salah Nasser Salim
'Ali and Mohammed Abdullah Salah al-Assad, fol lowing
their return to Yemen in May 2005, but had been
282

requested to do so by the US authorities. Two other
men, Walid Muhammad Shahir Muhammad al-Oadasi
and Karama Khamis Khamisan, were returned to Yemen
in April 2004 and August 2005 respectively. By the end
of the year, the former was detained without charge or
trial and the latter was standing trial on drug charges.
a In March, six Yemeni nationals accused of being
al-Oa'ida members were sentenced to two years'
imprisonment for forging travel documents. Five others
were acquitted. All 11 were acquitted of another charge
of establishing an armed group to carry out attacks in
Yemen. Six of the defendants had been forcibly
returned to Yemen from Saudi Arabia.
a I n May, two suspected al-Oa'ida members, both
Yemeni nationals who had been forcibly returned from
Oatar, were reportedly convicted of forging documents.
AI-Khadar Salam Abdullah al-Hatami was sentenced to
three years and four months in prison. Abdullah Ahmed
Saleh al-Raimi received a four-year sentence and
lodged an appeal.

The Sana'a Committee
The Sana'a Committee, established in 2004 by Yemeni
human rights defenders, AI activists, lawyers and
others, met for a second time in June. The Committee
widened its mandate to provide legal and other
assistance to detainees' families and called on
governments in the Gulf region to ensure that people
detained in the context of the "war on terror" were
treated humanely and in accordance with international
human rights standards.
Unrest in Sa'da Province
Hundreds of people were reportedly killed in Sa'da
Province where there were armed clashes between
government security forces and followers of cleric
Hussain Badr aI-Din al-Huthi. Intense fighting broke out
in the area in late March after the authorities launched
a search for fol lowers of the cleric, who was killed in
September 2004. The area was closed to journalists and
human rights activists on grounds of security. Some 400
people were reported to have been killed in a two-week
period, many al legedly as a result of excessive use of
force by government troops. Hundreds of local men
were rounded up and detained. The government also
closed hundreds of religious schools within the Zaidi
community and in October ordered the closure of 1,400
charities which it said were contravening the law.
Arrests and trial of members of the
Zaidi community
More than 1,000 followers of Zaidi cleriC Hussain Badr
aI-Din al-Huthi were reported to have been detained.
The crackdown was prompted by their continued
chanting of anti-US and anti-Israeli slogans after Friday
prayers.
In May, dozens of Zaidis, including children, were
arrested. At the end of the year most remained in
incommunicado detention without charge or trial and

reportedly in the Political Security prison in Sana'a.
There were fears that he was at risk of torture and ill­
treatment. According to reports, he sustained serious
injuries in the clashes in Sa'da: his right arm was
amputated, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in his skull
and his right legwas injured. It was unclear whether he
was receiving adequate medical treatment.
On 25 September, the President announced a pardon
for followers of Hussain al-Huthi. However, it was not
clear who was covered by the pardon and most of those
held reportedly remained in detention.
a In August the trial began of 36 members of the Zaidi
community, eight of them in absentia. They were
accused of plotting to kill the President and senior
army officers. The trial was adjourned after it was
disrupted by defendants shouting verses from the
Our'an and political slogans. A subsequent hearing in
November was also adjourned to seek clarification
whether the suspects were covered by the presidential
pardon.
a Zaidi cleric Yahia al-Dailami was sentenced to
death on 29 May after an unfair trial. Another Zaidi
cleric, Mohammed Muftah, who was also tried with
Yahia al-Dailami, was sentenced to eight years'
imprisonment. The prosecution lodged an appeal
against the sentence and called for the death penalty to
be imposed. On 3 December the Court of Appeal upheld
the sentences. The two men were charged with vaguely
worded offences including "communicating with I ran"
and "supporting Hussain Badr ai-Din al-Huthi". Both
were prisoners of conscience.
a In j une, the Special Criminal Court for terrorism in
Sana'a reduced judge Muhammad AIi Luqman's
sentence from 10 to five years' imprisonment. H Is
sentence was reduced on the grounds that there was
insuffiCient evidence in relation to one of the charges.
He had been arrested for his a lleged support for
Hussain al-Huthi and reportedly charged with "sedition,
fanning sectarian discord and forming an armed gang".

Restrictions on media freedom
Media freedom was restricted and journalists who
criticized the government were harassed, attacked
and had their property confiscated. In May, the
authorities introduced a draft press law which was
strongly criticized by Journalists as posing an even
greater threat to press freedom than the existing
Press and Publication Law (1990). New offences would
include "criticizing heads of state" and some, such as
'communicating classified information or
documentation to foreign bodies", would be
punishable by death.
Journalists attempting to report on the j uly fuel
protests were arrested and attacked by police and
security forces. Several were banned from covering the
protests or had their equipment confiscated.
a Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, chief editor of the
opposition publication al-Shura, was released on 23
March following a presidential pardon. A prisoner of
conscience, he had been sentenced to one year's
Amnesty International Report 2006

imprisonment in September 2004 for h i s alleged
support for Hussain al-Huthi. During his appeal hearing
In March, defence lawyers Mohammed Naji Allow and
jamal al-j u'bi, as well as the Secretary General of the
Union of journalists, Hafez al-Bukari, were badly
beaten by the security forces. Other people attending
the hearing were also allegedly beaten when they tried
to leave the courtroom in protest.
a jamal Amer, chief editor of the independent al­
Wassat newspaper, was reportedly abducted outside
his home on 23 August, taken to an unknown
destination and beaten and threatened with death.
Shortly before, his newspaper had accused government
officials of corruption. A day later the office of Ahmed
al-Hajj. an Associated Pressjournalist, was reportedly
raided by the security forces, who confiscated files and
two computers.

Women's rights
Women's organizations continued to campaign against
discrimination and violence against women. Women's
rights activists called on the government to reserve at
least 30 per cent of parliamentary seats for women. I n
September the National Women's Committee
announced that it would establish a coordination
council to press political parties to support women in
forthcoming presidential and local elections.
On 8 March, I nternational Women's Day, a group of
women journalists established a new organization,
Women journalists Without Borders, to promote
human rights, including women's rights, across the
M iddle East, but the government revoked its l icence
after members of the organization reported on the july
fuel protests.
In December a conference on the rights of Arab
women was held in Sana'a, continuing the work of a
similar conference in 2004.
Forcible returns
The Yemeni authorities forCibly returned at least 25
people to countries where they would be at risk of
torture and other human rights violations, i n
contravention of international human rights standards.
a Twenty-five Saudi Arabian nationals considered to
be suspects in the 'war on terror" were reportedly
returned involuntarily to Saudi Arabia on 28 March. I n
previous months, Saudi Arabia h a d returned at least 27
unnamed Yemenis to Yemen. Their fate was not known
at the end of the year.
a Abdul Rahman Ameur and Kamal Berkane, both
Algerian nationals, were believed to have been
deported in May. They had completed prison sentences
in Yemen in December 200), Their whereabouts
remained unknown at the end of the year and it was
feared that they had "disappeared".
Death penalty
Death sentences continued to be passed and dozens of
people were reportedly executed. Hundreds of people
were believed to remain under sentence of death.
a Fuad 'AIi Mohsen al-Shahari, whose death sentence
was ratified by President Saleh on 6 September, was
283

lAM

executed on 29 November. He had been on death row
for more than nine years. He had been sentenced to
death for murder in 1996 at the end of a grossly unfair
trial that may have been politically motivated or
influenced by tribal factors.
o Fatima Hussein al-Badi, who was sentenced to
death in February 2001 for the murder of her husband,
was at risk of imminent execution. Her brother, who
was sentenced at the same time, was executed in May.
o In February the Appeal Court upheld the death
sentence on Hizam Saleh Mejalli, who was convicted of
the 2002 bombing of the French oi I tanker Limburg and
other attacks. It also imposed a death sentence on
Fawaz Yahya al-Rabi 'ee who had previously been
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
o Hafez Ibrahim's death sentence for a murder
committed when he was 16, was stayed in Apri l.
o Amina Ali Abdulatif's execution, scheduled for 2
May, was stayed to al low a review of her case. She was
sentenced to death at 16 for the murder of her husband.
The Attorney General reportedly appointed a special
committee to review her case and confirm whether she
was under 18 at the time of the crime.

Refugees
Around 80,000 refugees registered with UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, including more than
68,000 refugees from Somalia, were living in Yemen.
Around 7,000 were housed in AI-Kharaz refugee camp.
Throughout the year, hundreds of refugees drowned
off the coast of Yemen either because they were forced
to jump from smugglers' boats or because the boats
became unseaworthy.
Refugees in Yemen faced poor economic conditions
and a lack of work opportunities. There were reports of
rapes of refugee women; the justice system failed to
ensure that survivors had access to justice.
Oromo refugees from Ethiopia repeatedly
complained of harassment by the Yemeni authorities,
including arbitrary arrests.

REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
Head of state and government: Levy Mwanawasa
Death penalty: retentionist

UN Women's Convention: ratified
Optional Protocol to UN Women's Convention: not signed

Human rights violations by the police remained
common. I ndependent journalists were harassed a nd
arrested. Opposition politicians were deta ined. No
death sentences were carried out. In November,
President Mwanawasa commuted 1 2 death
sentences to life imprisonment.
Background
The Constitutional Review Commission reported in
June. I f implemented, its recommendations would
strengthen freedom of expression by empowering
parliament, reducing presidential powers, and
introducing a Bill of Rights. Its recommendation that
the new Constitution be adopted by a Constituent
Assembly - a demand of civil society organizations ­
was rejected by President Mwanawasa. The President
also opposed popular demands that the new
Constitution be implemented before elections due in
December 2006. Peaceful nationwide demonstrations
over these demands took place in November.
In February, the Supreme Court dismissed a case
brought by opposition politicians challenging the
results of the 2001 elections.
A corruption case against former President Frederick
Chiluba dragged on without resolution. In September,
agreement was reached for a UK court to sit in Lusaka to
hear charges against the former President. This was
seen as a de facto recognition of the Zambian legal
system's failure to deliver prompt and effective justice.
Legislation was tabled to create 60 para legal posts
across the country, which would strengthen popular
access to legal advice. The Legal Aid Board had been
effectively inoperative since its establishment in 2000
due to a lack of funds.
Threats to freedom of expression
Opposition party offiCials were arrested and denied
equal access to state-controlled media. I ndependent
journalists were harassed and arrested.
o On 24july, opposition leader Michael Sata was
arrested and charged with sedition and espionage after
supporting striking mineworkers. The Minister of Mines
stated publicly that Michael Sata was a "terrorist" who
sought to make Zambia ungovernable. M ichael Sata was
released on 8 August. By the end of the year he had not
been tried. The Chief of Police, Inspector General Zunga
Siakalima, was dismissed by the President for initially
refusing to arrest Michael Sata.
o I n june Fred M'membe, editor of the independent
newspaper The Post, was questioned by police about a
Amnesty International Report 2006

ZIM

series of editorials critical of the President which
appeared in The Post. In November Fred M'membe was
arrested for allegedly defaming the President, the
charge relating to another editorial in the newspaper.
He was released on bail after a few hours in custody.
The case remained pending at the end of the year.

Violence against women
Sexual violence against women continued to be a major
cause of H I V/AIDS. Widespread pov�rty continued to
force many women into economically dependent
sexual relations. The belief that HIV can be cured by sex
with a virgin persisted, contributing to a high incidence
of rape of girls.
In January, President Mwanawasa declared that new
legislation would incorporate the UN Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women into Zambian law. However, no such legislation
had been introduced by the end of 2005.
A Bill to amend the Penal Code, including by
widening the scope of what the law considers a sexual
offence and increasing the severity of punishments for
sexual offences, received its second reading in
December.
Abuses by police
Torture of suspects in police custody and excessive use
of force by police continued. Low-paid police officers
regularly detained people in order to recover debts
owed by them to third parties.
a In June, police in Livingstone beat Catherine
Mubiana for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of
her brother. No one was charged or disciplined in
connection with the assault.
a In September, Kennedy Zulu died in police custody
in Lusaka after he was arrested in connection with a
theft at his workplace. Relatives believed that police
were paid by his employer to torture him so he would
reveal the whereabouts of the stolen goods. A post
mortem established that death was a consequence of
injuries sustained during a beating with a blunt object.
Police promised an inquest into the death, but this had
not happened by the end of the year.

The government engaged in widespread a nd
systematic violations ofthe rights to shelter, food,
freedom of movement a nd residence, a nd the
protection of the law. Hundreds of thousands of
people were forcibly evicted during wi nter a nd thei r
homes demolished as part o f Operation
Mura mbatsvina ( Restore Order). Tens of thousands
of informal traders a nd vendors lost their liveli hoods
and their ability to support their families as part of
the operation. Despite overwhelming evidence of
humanita ria n need the government repeatedly
obstructed the humanitarian efforts of the UN a nd
civil society groups. The police continued to operate
in a politically biased manner a nd police officers
were i mplicated in numerous human rights
violations, including arbitrary arrest and detention,
assault, ill-treatment of deta inees a nd excessive use
of force, Freedom of expression, association and
assembly continued to be severely curta iled.
H u ndreds of people were a rrested for holding
meetings or participating in peaceful protests.
Background
In parliamentary elections held on 31 March, PreSident
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) party won 78 out of 120 contested
seats. This gave ZANU-PF an effective two-thirds
majority in parliament, where a further 30 seats go to
people who are not elected, including traditional
leaders sympathetic to ZANU-PF and direct Presidential
appointees. There were fewer reports of politically
motivated violence surrounding the elections than in
previous elections. However, Al was concerned by the
levels of non-violent intimidation and harassment,
systematic repression of the rights to freedom of
expreSSion, association and assembly, and the
manipulation of food distribution by the government­
controlled Grain Marketing Board that took place
before, during and after the parliamentary elections.
Supporters of the main opposition party, the Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC), suffered acts of reprisal
following the March elections, including assault and
destruction of property.
Voter turn-out for Senate elections in November was
extremely low, reported to be less than 20 per cent of
eligible voters. The M DC was split over a decision by its
leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, not to contest the Senate
elections and some MDC candidates stood for election.
ZANU-PF won the majority of the seats.

ZIM

A report by the African Commission o n Human and
Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) of a fact-finding mission to
Zimbabwe In 2002, which was offiCially made public in
February 2005, concluded that human rights violations
had occurred in Zimbabwe. The ACHPR made several
recommendations , but by the end of the year almost
nothing had been done to implement them.
Government ministers and offiCials made disparaging
comments about the report and the ACHPR. In
December the ACHPR adopted a resolution on
Zimbabwe for the first time, condemning human rights
Violations and cal ling on the government to Implement
ACHPR and UN recommendations including an end to
forced evictions and respect for freedoms of
expression, association and assembly and the principle
of separation of powers.
Despite a poor harvest, the government again
deCided not to appeal for food aid. Supplies of maize
via the government's Grain Marketing Board were
extremely erratiC, particularly towards the end of the
year, and many areas were without maize for long
periods. World Food Programme reports repeatedly
highlighted serious food insecurity in many areas, With
inCidence of hunger increaSing towards the end of the
year as Zimbabwe entered the traditional "hungry
season".

Mass forced evictions and demolitions
I n May the government embarked on Operation
Murambatsvina, a programme of mass forced evictions
and demolition of homes and informal bUSinesses. The
operation, which was carried out against a backdrop of
severe food shortages, targeted poor urban and
surrounding (peri-urban) areas nationwide. The
evictions and demolitions were carried out without
adequate notice, court orders, due process, legal
protectIOn, redress or appropriate relocation
measures, in violation of Zimbabwe's obligations under
internatIOnal human rights law. During the operation
police used excessive force: property was destroyed
and people were beaten.
In June the UN Secretary-General appointed Anna
Tibaijuka as Special Envoy on Human Settlement Issues
In Zimbabwe to examine the impact of Operation
Murambatsvina. In a report released on 22 July, she
estimated that some 700,000 people had lost their
homes, their livelihoods or both between May and July
and that at least 2 million more people were indirectly
affected by the operation. She stated that Operation
Murambatsvina "was carried out in an indiscriminate
and unjustified manner, with indifference to human
suffering, and, in repeated cases, with disregard to
several provisions of national and international legal
frameworks".
The police, who carried out most of the evictions,
and the government stated publicly that those evicted
should "return to their rural areas". This was despite
Widely acknowledged food shortages and hunger in the
rural areas. Moreover, many people evicted during
Operation Murambatsvlna had fled these areas because
of political violence in previous years. People were
forCibly put on police and government trucks and taken

286

to rural areas. In numerous cases the authorities simply
abandoned groups of people at rural bus stops or local
authority offices, without access to shelter, food, water
or sanitation.
a On 28 J une heavily armed police arrived at Porta
Farm, an Informal settlement of approximately 10,000
people established in 1991 on the outskirts of Harare,
and began demolishing homes. The police were acting
in defiance of two court orders prohibiting evictions
from Porta Farm unless alternative accommodation
was provided for the community. The police reportedly
told residents that they were not going to obey the
court orders as they were acting on orders "from
above". Demolitions continued throughout the day and
on 29 and 30 June police forcibly removed people by
truck. Local human rights monitors reported that
during the chaos several people were injured. At least
three people reportedly died on 30 J une. The deaths
were raised with the authorities by the UN and Civic
groups, but no investigation had taken place by the end
of the year. Some of those forCibly removed from Porta
Farm were abandoned outSide Harare, apparently left
to make their own way to a rural village where they
might be received by relatives. Others were taken to
Caledonia Farm Transit Camp, established by the
government to temporarily accommodate victims of
the mass evictions. Conditions at Caledonia Camp were
extremely poor.
In July the government launched Operation
Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle (Reconstruction), under which it
was implied that thousands of new homes would be
built to address the needs of those made homeless by
Operation Murambatsvina. However, no proper plans
were made public and, although the government stated
that 3 trillion Zimbabwe dollars had been allocated to
the operation, it did not appear in the national budget.
Given the grave economic crisis affecting Zimbabwe,
there was widespread scepticism about the operation.
By the end of the year the state and independent media
as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
were reporting that the rebuilding operation was
significantly behind schedule. Many of those houses
designated as "built" remained incomplete, without
access to services such as water and sanitation, and
appeared to be uninhabited. The criteria used for
a llocating new houses were unclear, but appeared to
Include proof of employment or income, effectively
excluding the majority of Operation Murambatsvina
victims. Reports in the media, as well as from NGOs,
stated that some of the new houses were allocated to
civil servants and government offiCials, and there were
several reports of corruption in relation to the
operation.
While the majority of the evictions and demolitions
took place between May and July, the government
continued to evict people during the remainder of the
year. In several cases, families endured repeated
evictions as the government sought to drive people
back to the rural areas.

Humanitarian crisis
Operation Murambatsvina resulted in enormous
internal displacement of people. The UN described the
Amnesty International Report 2006

ZIM

aftermath as a "humanitarian crisis of immense
proportions". Although the UN Special Envoy
recommended that there should be full and unfettered
access to humani tarian assistance for the victims of the
forced evictions and house demolitions, the
Zimbabwean authorities repeatedly obstructed and
curtailed the humanitarian operations of the UN and
civil society groups.
Humanitarian groups reported that in some cases
negotiations with the authorities enabled them to
supply food, water and other relief items to internally
displaced people, but that their access was constrained
and subject to arbitrary changes by the authorities, and
they were generally prevented from providing
temporary shelter, particularly tents, to those living in
the open. Many humanitarian actors maintained that
this was because the government thought tents were
too visible a sign of the humanitarian crisis created by
Operation Murambatsvina.
a On 20 July the police conducted a series of night­
time raids on churches in Bulawayo sheltering more
than 1,000 of the most vulnerable victims of forced
evictions, including elderly and i l l people, and children.
According to witnesses, the police arrived after
midnight wearing riot gear and forced their way into
the churches. Sleeping people were poked with batons
and kicked to wake them up. They were forced onto
trucks and transported to a transit camp outside
Bulawayo. Within days the transit camp was closed and
people were again forced to board trucks, in most cases
at night, and were transported to various rural areas
where they were left without shelter, food, water or
sanitation. Following the raids the churches were told
that they could no longer provide shelter to those made
homeless as a result of Operation Murambatsvina.
Police subsequently checked to make sure the churches
were complying with this directive.
a At the end of J uly more than 1,000 people - many
from Porta Farm -were taken by police and
government agencies to Hopley Farm, where they
were left on open land with no shelter, no access to
sanitation and insufficient food and clean water. The
government did not provide humanitarian assistance,
nor did it inform the humanitarian community that
people were stranded there. On the contrary, when the
plight of those at Hopley Farm began to be known in
Harare, organizations that went to the camp to help
were turned away by police. Some humanitarian access
to Hopley Farm was subsequently negotiated by the
UN and civic groups, but at the end of the year l iving
conditions at Hopley Farm remained extremely poor.
On 31 October the UN Secretary-General expressed
great concern about the humanitarian situation i n
Zimbabwe and the failure of the government t o ensure
proper humanitarian assistance for those in need. I n
November t h e government agreed t o a llow t h e UN to
provide shelters, but continued to refuse the UN
permission to use tents to provide immediate shelter
for the homeless. By the end of the year the UN shelter
programme had not been i mplemented and its future
was unclear after the M inister for Local Government,
Public Works and National Housing reportedly rejected
Amnesty International Report 2006

as sub-standard a model structure prepared by the
UN in collaboration with government technicians.
Meanwhile, thousands of people, including children,
the i l l , the elderly and other vulnerable people,
continued to live without shelter and in conditions of
extreme hardship. Overall, humanitarian access
remained highly constrained.

Freedom of association and assembly curtailed
The Public Order and Security Act (POSA) and the
Miscellaneous Offences Act continued to be used
selectively to prevent the pol itical opposition and civil
society groups from meeting or engaging in peaceful
protest. Hundreds of human rights activists and
opposition supporters were arrested or detained under
these laws during the year. Dozens of people were
assaulted during arrest or while in police custody.
Police repeatedly obstructed or denied detainees'
access to lawyers, food and medical care.
a On the evening of 31 March, the day of the
parliamentary elections, police arrested approximately
260 women, some carrymg babies, when the activist
group Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) attempted to
hold a peaceful post-election prayer vigil at Africa
Unity Square in Harare. During and after the arrests,
several of the women were beaten. Some were forced
to lie on the ground and were beaten on the buttocks by
police. Several were seriously injured and needed
hospital treatment. None was given access to adequate
medical treatment during their detention. The women
and children were detained overnight in an open-air
courtyard at Harare Central police station under armed
guard. They were initially denied access to lawyers.
Police reportedly told the women that they could pay a
fine and be released if they pleaded gui lty to minor
offences under the Miscel laneous Offences Act;
otherwise they would remain in detention over the
weekend to face charges under the POSA. The women ­
several of whom were elderly, injured or with their
children - decided to pay fines, fearing further abuses
in detention.
a On 8 November more than 100 people were
arrested in Harare when the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions tried to hold a peaceful demonstration
protesting against the grave economic situation i n
Zimbabwe. Lawyers were initially denied access t o the
detainees, who were moved by police from one police
station to another in an apparent attempt to prevent
access to lawyers. Neither the detainees nor their
lawyers were informed of the charges against them
until the second day of their detention, when police
said they would be charged under the POSA. However,
the Attorney General refused to prosecute and a l l the
detainees were released on 1 1 November.
Repressive laws including the Access to Information
and Protection of Privacy Act and the Broadcasting
Services Act were used to curtail freedom of
expression.
a On 15 December armed police in Harare raided
Voice of the People, an independent radio station that
broadcast from outSide Zimbabwe but maintained
offices in the country. Three staff members were

287

ZIM

detained. Police initially told lawyers that the three
would be held until Voice of the People executive
director John Masuku presented himsel f at the police
station, and then said they would be charged under the
Broadcasting Services Act. However, the Attorney
General refused to prosecute, reportedly on grounds
that there was no evidence of any offence. The three
were released on 19 December. The same day John
Masuku and Voice of the People board chairman David
Masunda presented themselves at Harare Central
police station and were detained. David Masunda was
released later that day. John Masuku was held until 23
December and was charged under the Broadcasting
Services Act wIth i llegal possession and use of
broadcasting equipment.

H u man rights defenders under threat
LegIslation passed by parlIament in December 2004
governing the operation of NGOs, which was strongly
crIticized for targeting human rights groups, was not
signed into law by the President. However, the
government continued to use the Private Voluntary
Organisations Act to intimidate and harass NGOs.
Following the March elections, the government used
provisions in the Act to investigate numerous NGOs.
Investigation teams made unannounced visits to NGOs,
and demanded to see documents relating to activities
and funding. The investigation process was reported to
be mtlmidatmg and intrusive.
The ever-present threat of closure created a climate
of fear and compromised the effectiveness of many
NGOs. Human rights activists continued to face
harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention and assault,
most frequently at the hands of the police.
Repressive legislation
On 30 August parliament passed the Constitution of
Zimbabwe Amendment Act (No. 17), which was
subsequently SIgned into law by the President. The Act
violated internationally recognized rights, including
the right to equal protection of the law and the right to
freedom of movement. Clause 2 of the Act removed the
power of courts to hear any challenge or appeal against
the acquisition by the state of agricultural land under
Section 16 of the Constitution. Land owners and anyone
with an interest or rIght in agricultural land so acquired
can no longer challenge the lawfulness of the
acquisition. Clause 3 of the Act extended the grounds
under which it is possible to limit the right to freedom
of movement enshrined in Section 22 of the
ConstitutIon. Freedom of movement can now be l imited
in "the public interest" and in "the economic interests of
the State". Moreover, the Constitutional Amendment
Act restricts the rIght to leave Zimbabwe. The new
limItatIons on the right to freedom of movement breach
international human rights standards.
a In December the authorities seized the passports of
Trevor Ncube, publisher of independent newspapers
The Standard and the Zimbabwe Independent,
opposition politician Paul Themba Nyathi and trade
unionist Raymond Majongwe. The passports of Trevor
Ncube and Paul Themba Nyathi were returned and the
288

High Court subsequently ruled that the passport
seizures were il legal. However, by the end of the year
the passport of Raymond Majongwe had not been
returned.

Update: Roy Bennett
Former opposition member of parliament (MP) Roy
Bennett was released from prison on 28 June, having
served eight months of an effective one-year prison
sentence. It remained standard policy to commute a
third of any sentence for good behaviour. Roy Bennett
had been convicted of assaulting the Minister for
J ustice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs during a heated
exchange in parI iament on 18 May. He was convicted by
a parliamentary committee acting under the Privileges,
Immunities and Powers of Parliament Act. The
procedure was politically biased and failed to meet
international standards for fair trial, including the
requirement that a punishment be proportionate to the
gravity of an offence. Roy Bennett was also denied the
right of appeal. During his detention Roy Bennett
suffered humiliating and degrading treatment.

WHAT DOES AI DO?

WHAT DO    AI DO?
Amnesty I nternational (AI) mobilizes volunteer
activists - people who give freely of their time and
energy in solidarity with the victims of human rights
abuses. At the latest count there were more than
1.8 million AI members and supporters in over 1 50
countries and territories in every region of the world.
AI is funded largely by its worldwide membership and
public donations.
AI members are women, men and children who come
from many different backgrounds and hold widely
different beliefs, but who are united by a determination
to work for a world where everyone enjoys all human
rights. Some members are organized in groups in local
communities, schools and colleges. Others participate
in networks focused on particular countries, issues or
campaigning activities.
AI's Urgent Action network consists of thousands of
AI members around the world who take immediate
action in response to threats of execution, killing,
torture or ill-treatment. Prisoners, human rights
defenders and others at risk have testified to the impact
of one of AI's most effective and endUring action
techniques, which contributes to some improvement in

Through a range of campaigning methods, varying
from country to country, A I members take up human
rights issues with governments and businesses, sending
appeals, collecting signatures for petitions, and making
their voices heard in protests against abuses in their
own and other countries. They raise general awareness
about human rights by giving platforms to human rights
defenders from around the world; organizing musical
and other artistic events; providing education activities
in schools and local communities; and offering human
rights training for criminal justice professionals.

In 2005, AI campaigns aimed in particular to stop
violence against women, control the arms trade, and
eradicate torture in the "war on terror".
At the World Social Forum in Brazil in January, A I
activists joined non-governmental organizations and
grassroots groups calling for a better world. The
Forum tackled a range of issues, including social
struggle and democratic a l ternatives, demilitarization,
economic independence, and human rights and
dignity. AI delegates cooperated with other activist
and campaigning groups at the Forum in organizing

AI campaigning remained firmly rooted i n the power
of indiViduals working in support of other individuals.
AI sections and members in 35 countries celebrated
I nternational Human Rights Day on 10 December by
sending over 80,000 letters in a Global Letter-Writin g
Marathon, an annual event started by AI Poland in
200 1 . Once a year, AI supporters get together to write
letters, e-malls and faxes to governments . They cal l for
death sentences to be commuted, torture to be halted,
prISoners of conscience to be released and other
indiViduals to be protected from a range of human
rights violations. Some people join the marathon for

just a few minutes. Others keep going for the full 24
hours. More and more sections have found the
marathon effective in attracting new supporters.
In December, AI launched its Make Some Noise
campaign, a mix of music. celebration and action i n
support o f AI's work. Thanks t o an extraordinary gift
from Yoko Ono - the recording rights to " Imagine"
and John Lennon's entire solo songbook - AI was able
to harness the power of music to inspire a new
generation to stand up for human rights. Classic
tracks about injustice, poverty and war, as relevant
today as when they were first written, were recorded i n

Whatever the particular focus, the activities of AI's
members, supporters and staff aim to support the
victims of human rights abuses and people working on
their behalf, and to influence those who have the power
to make a d ifference.

Torture and the 'war on terror'
As the international ban on torture and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment was flouted and
challenged by the US and other governments, AI
contested the arguments of those who sought to justify
brutal and long-outlawed methods of interrogation in
the particular circumstances of the "war on terror". AI's
report Cruel. Inhuman. Degrades us all -Stop torture
and ill-treatment in the "war on terror"(Al lndex: ACT
40/010/2005) challenged states that claimed no longer
to be bound by previously agreed human rights
standards in the face of terrorist threats. Governments
around the world agreed many years ago that torture
and other i ll-treatment are always wrong, and wrote
into international law that there is never any
circumstance that justified their use.
Yet over a year after the scandal of torture in Abu
Ghraib prISon in Iraq was exposed, the conditions
remained i n place for such treatment to occur at US

detention faCil ities in Afghanistan, I raq, Guantanamo
Bay and beyond. Over a year after the US Supreme
Court ruled that US courts had the jurisdiction to
consider appeals from detainees in Guantanamo Bay,
the US administration had ensured that not a single
detention was judicially reviewed.
A gathering of former 'war on terror" detainees was
held in November in London, UK, by AI and the UK­
based non-governmental organization Reprieve, as part
of AI's campaign against torture and other ill-treatment
committed in the name of security. The accounts of
former detainees and their families confirmed growing
numbers of reports that detainees were being held
i llegally, secretly flown across borders, and tortured
and i ll-treated at US detention facilities around the
world. Former detainees spoke of being shackled i n
painful stress pOSitions, o f their extreme fear and
exhaustion, of the lack of medical care, and of beatings
and broken bones.
AI's response to the erosion of human rights, the rule
of law and the role of the judiciary by the UK
government was simple. I n a report in November,
United Kingdom: Human rights are not a game (AI
I ndex: EUR 4s!043I2005), AI's message was that respect
for human rights is the route to security, not an
obstacle to it. AI opposed anti-terrorism measures
introduced following the attacks in the USA on I I
September 2001 and the London bombings o n 7 July
lOOS, including a draft Terrorism Bill in 2005 that would
extend the maximum period of police detention
without charge from 1 4 to 28 days. A I cal l   on the UK
government to live up to its international obligations
under human rights law.

Violence against women
In 2005, AI's Stop Violence against Women campaign
highlighted the marginalization, prejudice and danger
faced by women human rights defenders in the front line.

A conference organized by A I i n Bahrain m early 2005
was the first aimed at combating violence and
discrimination against women in Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Oatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. Migrant domestic workers in particular are
unable to access the protection of the law from
violence at the hands of employers. Among those
attending the conference were survivors of
discrimination and violence, women human rights
defenders, lawyers, academics, Journalists, religious
scholars and government officials.
In 2005 AI highlighted the impact on Palestinian
women of the unprecedented levels of poverty,
unemployment and health problems in the Occupied
Territories caused by decades of Israeli military
occupation, compounded by constraints imposed in a
traditional patriarchal society. AI called on the Israeli
government to end human rights violations i n the
Occupied Territories, and on the Palestinian Authority
to take action to prevent, investigate and punish
violence against women.
AI members in Turkey and the Netherlands worked
with Turkish municipalities and architects in creatmg
tulip gardens to raise public awareness about violence
against women. Women's groups in Turkey use tulips to
represent women who have died or suffered as a resul t
o f family a n d community violence. Legal discrimination
against women, including the reduction or eradication
of sentences of rapists if they married their victims, was
removed in a new penal code.
AI called on the Japanese government to accept full
responsibility for crimes committed against girls and
women condemned to sexual slavery - so-called
'comfort women" - in countries occupied by Japan
before and during World War 11. For over 60 years, the
now elderly survivors of a n estimated 200,000 victims
have been denied justice and adequate reparation from
the Japanese government, which only belatedly
acknowledged responsibil i ty for the crimes.
A I called on the Russian government to give higher
priority to tackling domestic violence, including by
publishing statistics on the incidence of violence
against women in the home and the prosecution of
perpetrators; by special training for police, judges and
other professionals; by working with women's groups
to counter common perceptions that domestic violence
is a private matter; and by systematically setting up
shelters and crisis centres to protect victims.

launched a report. The Impact of Guns on Women 's
Lives (AI I ndex: ACT 30/001/2005), in the USA and
South Africa in March. The report showed the ways in
which women are subjected to violence because of the
growmg availabi lity of small arms. in times of peace as
well as war. Studies and examples from several
countrIes I l lustrated that women are more likely to be
murdered than other members of households where
there are guns.

Control Arms
AI called for tougher arms controls, better
implementation of existing gun control laws and action
to break the cycles of violence that threaten to
brutalize successive generations.
The Million Faces petition, launched by AI and its
partner organizations in the Control Arms campaign ­
Oxfam and the I nternational Action Network on Smal l
Arms - more than met i t s halfway target in 2005. The
action was part of AI's campaign for an international
Arms Trade Treaty that would oblige governments not
to transfer arms internationally i f they are likely to be
used to commit serious violations of human rights and
war crimes. Over half a million supporters signed up
and posted their photos on line. The number of
governments pledging support for the Treaty grew five­
fold to 50 in 2005. They included the UK, one of the
world's largest exporters of weapons. The Treaty, i f
implemented, would stem the proliferation of arms and
save lives.
As civilians' lives were claimed daily in Haiti in
political violence between armed groups and gangs,
and by unlawful use of force by police, AI urged the
international community to ensure adequate funding
for the protection of human rights, and in particular for
disarmament. A huge quantity of arms and small
weapons, in the hands of former rebels and former

294

soldiers, criminal gangs with and without political
affiliation, security guards and Civilians, has
exacerbated recurring political crises.
AI called on the UN Security Council to strengthen
the UN embargo on arms exports to the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and ensure monitoring of
airports m eastern ORe. AI called on the governments
of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Israel, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, South
Africa, the UK and the USA to investigate reports of
arms being i l legally transferred to the governments of
the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda for onward distribution
to armed groups in eastern ORe.

The death pena lty
The campaign against the death penalty gained
strength in the course of 2005. AI members in more than
40 countries participated in the third World Day against
the Death Penalty in October, which focused on Africa
and which saw demonstrations, petitions, concerts and
televised debates to campaign against capital
punishment around the world.
In a long-overdue victory for campaigners against the
death penalty, the execution of child offenders in the
USA was declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme
Court in March. The landmark decision by the Court, by
five votes to four, followed years of campaigning by AI
and other human rights groups to stop the execution of
offenders under 18 at the time of the crime. The ruling
was given in the case of Christopher Simmons, who was
sentenced to death for a murder committed when he
was 17 years old. AI joined 16 other Nobel Peace
laureates in supplementing the legal appeals before the
Court. The brief was cited in the majority opinion.
Following the decision, more than 70 child offenders
under sentence of death had their sentences commuted.
Progress towards abolition in a number of countries
in Europe and Central Asia followed intensified
campaigning by AI in recent years. The last provisions
for the death penalty were removed from the
Constitution in Moldova, and similar constitutional
amendments were proposed in Kyrgyzstan. However,
despite an announcement in Uzbekistan that the death
penalty would be abolished in 2008, executions were
reportedly still carried out and death sentences
passed after trials that fell far short of international
fair trial standards.

Economic, social and cultural rights
2005 saw an increase in AI campaigning at a global level
for economiC, social and cultural rights. The focus was
on opposing grave abuses against marginalized people.
I n Human rights (or human dignity -A primer on
economiC, social and cultural nghts (Al l ndex : paL
34/009/2005), AI highlighted the obligations of
governments not only within their own countries but
also worldwide to take immediate actions to address
hunger, homelessness and preventable disease.
AI joined the Centre on HOUSing Rights and Evictions
and Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights to coordinate
a global cal l for the international community, including
the UN and African Union, to stand up for human rights
and against the mass forced evictions of hundreds of
thousands of people in Zimbabwe. Over 200 mostly
African human rights non-governmental organizations
JOined the cal l . In December the African Commission
on Human and Peoples' Rights adopted - for the first
time - a resolution condemning the human rights
situation in Zimbabwe, includmg the mass evictions,

vigilante "death squads". I n 2005, Al campaigning
highlighted aggressive police operations in which the
inhabitants of favelas (shanty towns), branded as
criminals, are killed with impunity. In one terrifying
attack in March, police officers shot at random at
residents of a district of Rio de janeiro, killing 29 people
in a matter of hours. Al called for the government to
implement human rights-based poliCing and ensure the
effective protection of all Brazilians.

"Kids don't

says the t·
shlrt of one

in Australia.

Human rights defenders
Al works to protect the right to promote and defend
human rights, and takes action to ensure human rights
defenders are able to carry out their work unimpeded.
As part of AI's work to defend those on the front line
in the defence of human rights, Al called on the Chinese
authorities to stop the detention and harassment of the
Tiananmen Mothers, a group of 1 30 human rights
defenders - mainly women - seeking accountability
and redress for the killing of their children and other
close relatives during the suppression of peaceful
protests around Tiananmen Square in june 1989. They
have distributed humanitarian aid to victims' families
and helped to set up a fund for the education of the
children of those killed or injured during the crackdown.
Al called on the Serbian authorities to stop the
campaign of harassment of human rights defenders by
individual political leaders, some of whom were
members of the government or of allied political
parties, and by members of the security forces.
Activists, journalists and lawyers were assaulted,
burgled and threatened with prosecution, especially
around the loth anniversary in July of the massacre
at Srebrenica during the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Those under attack were primarily
defenders - and in particular women leaders of
targeted organization s - whose campaigning exposed

offiCial failures to investigate human rights violations
and address impunity for war crimes.
In February, Vi et Nam released four prominent and
long-standing prisoners of conscience, one of whom
had been in prison for 25 years. Al appeals continued,
however, for the release of cyber dissidents serving
lengthy prison terms after being convicted of espionage
for criticizing government policies, circulating petitions
and making contact on the Internet with opposition
groups in exile.
In Zimbabwe, Al called for an end to state detention,
i ll-treatment and harassment of human rights
defenders and for the repeal of legislation that
undermines their work. Human rights organizations
work in a climate of fear and with the ever-present
threat of closure. AI joined human rights groups in
countries including Botswana, Namibia, Nigeria,
Senegal, South Africa and Zambia in publicizing the
condemnation by the African Commission on Human
and Peoples' Rights of human rights violations in
Zimbabwe. An awareness-raising tour of Europe by the
women's activist group Women of Zimbabwe Arise
(WOZA) was hosted by AI sections in October.

Refugees and migrants
Action to defend the rights of refugees, asylum-seekers,
internally displaced people and migrants played a large
part in the campaigning activities of Al sections and
members around the world. Al opposed the return of
people to countries where they faced persecution, the
death penalty, torture or other ill-treatment, and
campaigned for states to uphold their international
obligations and respect all rights of displaced people
and migrants.
Al members highlighted the cases of four men
detained in Kyrgyzstan and at risk of forCible return to
neighbouring Uzbekistan. They were among more than
500 people who fled Uzbekistan after the security
forces fired on thousands of mainly peaceful
demonstrators during protests in Andizhan in May.
Greece was the target of appeals for investigations
into overcrowded and insanitary conditions for
detained refugees and migrants, where children were
held with adults and where some women were allegedly
sexually abused.
On World Refugee Day on 20 june, Al drew attention
to the plight of asylum-seekers and refugees, in
particular those in arbitrary detention in Australia and
a number of European counties, including Italy, Spain
and the UK.

Amnesty International Report 2006

WHAT DOES AI DO?

AI marked International Migrants Day on 18 December
with appeals to states to ratify or implement the
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
of All Migrant Workers and Members ofTheir Families,
which only 34 states had ratified. An estimated 200
million migrants lived and worked outside their country
of origin. They faced a range of human rights abuses,
from having their salaries routinely withheld or their
identity documents confiscated by their employers, to
verbal and physical abuse at the hands of employers or a
lack of access to proper housmg and health care.

Justice and the rule of law
Threats to the right to justice and to the rule of law
remained central to many areas of AI campaigning
across a spectrum of countries.
In Colombia, AI called for an effective legal
framework for the demobilization of i llegal armed
groups that fully respected the right of victims to truth,
justice and reparation. More than 2 , 300 killings and
"disappearances· were attributed to army-backed
paramilitaries, despite their engagement in a
demobilization process and their declaration of a
unilateral ceasefire in 2002.
AI addressed a range of long-standing abuses by
French police - fatal shootings, deaths in custody and
torture and ill-treatment - and in the criminal justice
system, most of them against foreign nationals or people
of foreign origin. Complaints against the police soared in
France but officers enjoyed effective impunity.
AI appeals continued for an end to the killings in the
internal conflict in Nepal m which more than 12,000
people have died. An escalation in the fighting in 2005
resulted in hundreds more deaths of civilians and
widespread detentions, rape and other torture by both
government and insurgent forces. Children have been
abducted and recruited as child soldiers.
Accountability for war crimes and crimes against
humanity in Darfur, Sudan, remained a major focus of AI
campaigning in 2005 as government forces, government­
aligned militias and armed political groups targeted
civilians. AI called for action by the international
community to end the rape and abduction of women and
girls, and attacks on human rights defenders.

How Al works
AI is a democratic, self-governing movement. Major
policy deCisions are taken by an International Council
made up of representatives from all sections. The
Council meets every two years, and has the power to
amend the Statute which governs AI's work and
methods. (The Statute is available from the
I nternational Secretariat or on the AI website,
www.amnesty.org.) The Council elects an I nternational
Executive Committee of volunteers which carries out its
decisions and appoints the movement's Secretary
General, who heads the I nternational Secretariat and is
the movement's chief spokesperson.
A I 's sections and local volunteer groups and
networks are primarily responsible for funding the
movement through donations from members and the
public. No funds are sought or accepted from
governments for AI's work investigating and
campaigning against human rights violations.
Information about AI's finances is published annually
in the Amnesty International Review.
Information about AI is available from national
section offices, on the A I website, and from the
International Secretariat, Peter Benenson House,
I Easton Street, London WCIX oDW, United Kingdom.
AI's guiding principles
AI is independent of any government, political
persuasion or religious creed. AI does not support or
oppose the views of the victims whose rights it seeks to
protect. It is concerned solely with the impartial
protection of human rights.
AI forms a global community of human rights
defenders whose principles include international
solidarity, effective action for the individual victim, the
universality and indiviSibility of human rights,
impartiality and independence, and democracy and
mutual respect.
AI's vision is of a world in which every person enjoys
all the human rights enshrined in the U niversal
Declaration of Human Rights and other international
human rights standards. Its ambition is to promote
ethical globalization to strengthen the forces of
justice - the forces that provide hope for the many

A I 's mission is to undertake research and action

AI's goals
In 2005, AI's work to build a better world was organized
around eight global goals.

Reform and strengthen the justice sector

The central importance of the rule of law for any field of
human activity is Widely recognized across societies
and governing systems. Yet many of the domestic
institutions which are meant to uphold the rule of law
are seriously flawed, resulting in continuing
widespread human rights violations, committed with
impunity. Such human rights violations include the
imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, unfair
political trials, torture and other i ll-treatment,
"disappearances· and unlawful killings. International
mechanisms to compensate for national failures have
evolved rapidly in the last decade, but remain
embryonic and contested.
In 2005, AI's objectives were to:
• Reform police practice and strengthen the
judiciary.
• Address discrimination in the justice sector,
particularly with regard to lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people (LGBT) and ethnic and religious
minorities.
• Consolidate international criminal justice,
speCi fically by supporting the I nternational Criminal
Court and universal jurisdiction.
• Ensure human rights in transitional justice.

urvlvor; Of torture

regional and international
mechanisms of state accountability, focusing in
particular on UN reform.
• Further develop international standards, for example
on "disappearances" and with regard to companies.
• Study the impact of corruption on the administration
of justice.
• Strengthen national,

Abolish the death penalty
The momentum for abolition of the death penalty
continues, particularly at the level of non-governmental
organizations, through the emergence of a World
Coalition against the Death Penalty, and the work of
dedicated national organizations. However, a Sizeable
number of countries remain opposed to abolition, and
the threats of terrorism, drugs and organized crime are
being used to justify the retention or even in some cases
the reinstatement of capital punishment.
In 2005, A I 's objectives were to:
• Promote abolition of the death penalty in all
countries and internationally, especially by showing
the impact of discrimination.
• Monitor death penalty developments globally and
respond quickly to events with action, particularly
on cases that illustrate systemic problems in the
application of the death penalty.
• Produce global statistics, thematic reports and
action.
• End the use of the death penalty for child offenders.

Protect the rights of defenders
Human rights defenders are at the front line of work on
human rights, and there is increasing recognition of the
important role that activists play. Throughout the
world, however, they are deliberately targeted in a
variety of ways. Governments use many pretexts,
including security and the "war on terror", to stifle
legitimate critiCism of their poliCies. Women human
rights defenders in particular risk social stigma within
their communities and attempts to discredit their work
if they challenge the political order or social, religious,
gender or sexual conventions.

WHAT DOES AI DO?

"Amnesty International came to our aid at a time
when a lot of doors were closing."

In 2005, A I 's objectives were to:
• Engage defenders from all sectors of society,

including by building coalitions, skills and greater
visibility for the work of women defenders.
• Highlight the contribution of defenders to the
security of society at large and address abuses
impacting on their rights.
• Promote the protection and safety of human rights
defenders and counter the misuses of the judicial
system to persecute them.
• Widen and deepen the use of the UN Declaration on
Human Rights Defenders, and support the work of
UN and regional protection mechanisms.

Resist human rights abuses in the 'war on terror'
The framework of international law and multi lateral
action is undergoing the most sustained attack since
its establishment. I nternational human rights and
humanitarian law are being chal lenged by
governments as ineffective in responding to security
issues. Armed groups continue to carry out abuses.
and some operate in a loose global all iance. Public
opinion is polarized.
In 2005. AI's objectives were to:
• Address the human rights impact of counter­
terrorism measures. focusing speCifically on
detention and trial safeguards. torture. killings and
discriminatory laws and practices.
• Address the impact of cooperation agreements
among states on human rights protection.
• Engage with the development of treaties on terrorism.
• Promote international and regional mechanisms for
state accountability.

Report on abuses by armed groups. and explore
strategies for raising human rights concerns with
these groups.
• Advance progressive interpretations of international
human rights and humanitarian law as relevant to
the "war on terror".
•

Uphold the rights of refugees and migrants
The debate relating to the rights of refugees. migrants
and the internally displaced has become increasingly
high profile and politicized. People continue to move
across borders seeking protection from persecution or
driven by the prospects of economic opportunities.
Demand for cheap migrant labour and exploitative
labour practices continue. Xenophobic and racist
responses to refugees. asylum-seekers and migrants
continue in both developed and developing countries.
Restrictive migration control measures and security
measures targeting non-nationals increase the
vulnerability of non-nationals to a wide variety of
human rights abuses.
In 2005. AI's objectives were to:
• Defend refugees' right not to be returned to
countries where they might suffer abuses of their
human rights.
• Defend the right of asylum-seekers to access fair and
satisfactory asylum procedures.
• Ensure a human rights approach to durable solutions
to refugee problems.
• Promote the human rights of migrants.
• Monitor and address arbitrary detention practices
applied to refugees and migrants.
• Enhance the access of refugees and migrants to their
economic. social and cultural rights.
• Improve protection of refugee and displaced girls
and women at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse.

Promote economic, social and cultural rights for
margina lized communities
Growing global inequalities. and the failure of
governments to significantly reduce the number of
people living in extreme poverty. are among the
defining human rights issues of our times. There is still

WHAT DOES AI DO?

little acceptance that poverty raises fundamental
issues of human rights. However, mass social
movements are beginning to use the language of rights
in global campaigns on issues including trade, aid,
investment, debt and access to medicines.
In 2005, A I 's objectives were to:
• Promote economic, social and cultural rights as
human rights, including by participating in global
processes such as those on trade.
• Strengthen legal recognition of economic, social and
cultural rights, through national law reform
initiatives and development of international
standards and mechanisms.
• Address severe abuses of economic, social and
cultural rights suffered by marginalized
communities.
• Address abuses arising from H IV/ A IDS.
• Highlight the obligations of economic actors such as
companIes and expose abuses, for example
discrimination in employment.
• Promote human rights principles for privatization
and in investment and trade agreements.

Stop violence aga inst women
Violence against women is one of the most widespread
and pervasive human rights violations. It is also one of
the most hidden. It cuts across cultural, regional,
religious and economic boundaries. It is mani fested in
the context of the family, in the community, in state
institutions and in conflict and post-conflict situations.
Thanks in particular to the women's movement, there
have been significant advances in the promotion of
women's rights in international law, including criminal
law. However, such advances have made little difference
for women on the ground and much remains to be done.
In 2005, AI's objectives were to:
• Demand that governments criminalize rape and
ratify the UN Women's Convention without
reservations.
• Challenge impunity for rape and other forms of
violence against women, including by armed groups,
in conflict and post-conflict situations.
• Ensure that states respect, protect and fulfil women's
rights, using the standard of due diligence nationally
and internationally to hold states accountable to
their obligations.
• Challenge the tolerance within society of violence
against women and urge traditional and informal
authorities to take effective action to fight it.

people all over
the world ...it is
great to have that
solidarity and
support, because
you have really

• Support women human rights defenders.
• Develop policies to address reproductive health

rights and other related concerns.

Protect civilians and close the taps that fuel abuses
in conflict
In parts of the world conflict appears chroniC. Identity
issues, poverty and mineral reserves are among the
causes. Sometimes weak states are confronted with
economically powerful armed groups; often conflict is
prolonged by foreign governments, private companies
and d iaspora communities. Mass abuses against
civilians persist, and despite significant international
and national legal developments, impunity persists.
Effective protection seems to depend too often on the
presence of foreign troops.
In 2005, AI's objectives were to:
• Demand accountability for abuses in armed conflict
by states and armed groups.
• Promote an agenda for protecting civilians, including
through peacekeeping and peace-building.
• Campaign against the use of child soldiers.
• Demand accountability of external actors complicit
in abuses, including second states and economic
actors.
• Campaign to restrict the arms trade, including by
promoting an Arms Trade Treaty.
• Campaign against indiscriminate weapons, such as
cluster weapons.
• Advance the debate on the use of military force.

You can make a difference
AI works to improve human rights through the actions
of ordinary people around the world. AI members and
supporters have a record of real achievement.
Prisoners of conscience have been released. Death
sentences have been commuted. Torturers have been
brought to justice. Governments have been persuaded
to change their laws and practices. Sometimes
solidarity keeps hope alive. Hope is a precious weapon
for prisoners battling to survive, relatives trying to
obtain justice or human rights defenders bravely
continuing their work despite danger and isolation.
However bleak the situation, AI's members and
supporters, acting together, can make a d ifference.
