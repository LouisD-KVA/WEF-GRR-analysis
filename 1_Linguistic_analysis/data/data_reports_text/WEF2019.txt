Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have evolved with new issues emerging on the 10-year horizon. For example, cyberattacks, income disparity and unemployment entered the set
of global risks in 2012. Some global risks were reclassified: water crises and rising income disparity were re-categorized first as societal risks and then as a trend in the 2015 and 2016 Global Risks Reports, respectively.

Børge Brende
President
World Economic Forum

We publish the 2019 edition of the
World Economic Forum’s Global
Risks Report at an important
moment. The world is facing a
growing number of complex and
interconnected challenges—from
slowing global growth and persistent
economic inequality to climate
change, geopolitical tensions and
the accelerating pace of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution. In isolation,
these are daunting challenges;
faced simultaneously, we will
struggle if we do not work together.
There has never been a more
pressing need for a collaborative
and multistakeholder approach to
shared global problems.
This is a globalized world, as a
result of which historic reductions in
global poverty have been achieved.
But it is also increasingly clear that
change is needed. Polarization is on
the rise in many countries. In some
cases, the social contracts that hold
societies together are fraying. This
is an era of unparalleled resources
and technological advancement, but
for too many people it is also an era
of insecurity. We are going to need
new ways of doing globalization that
respond to this insecurity. In some
areas, this may mean redoubling
efforts at the international level—
implementing new approaches to
a range of issues: technology and
climate change to trade, taxation,
migration and humanitarianism. In
other areas renewed commitment
and resources will be needed at the
national level—tackling inequality,
for example, or strengthening
social protections and the bonds of
political community.
Renewing and improving the
architecture of our national and
international political and economic
systems is this generation’s defining
task. It will be a monumental
undertaking, but an indispensable
one. The Global Risks Report
demonstrates how high the
stakes are—my hope is that this
year’s report will also help to build
momentum behind the need to act.
It begins with a sweep of the global

risks landscape and warns of the
danger of sleepwalking into crises.
It goes on to consider a number
of risks in depth: geopolitical and
geo-economic disruptions, rising
sea levels, emerging biological
threats, and the increasing
emotional and psychological strain
that many people are experiencing.
The Future Shocks section again
focuses on potential rapid and
dramatic changes in the systems
we rely on—topics this year include
quantum computing, human rights
and economic populism.
The Global Risks Report
embodies the collaborative and
multistakeholder ethos of the
World Economic Forum. It sits at
the heart of our new Centre for
Regional and Geopolitical Affairs,
which is responsible for our crucial
partnerships with the world’s
governments and international
organizations. But the breadth
and depth of its analysis also hinge
on constant interaction with the
Forum’s industry and thematic
teams, which shape our systemsbased approach to the challenges
facing the world. I am grateful
for the collaboration of so many
colleagues in this endeavour.
I am also particularly grateful for
the insight and dedication of the
report’s Advisory Board. I would like
to thank our long-standing strategic
partners, Marsh & McLennan
Companies and Zurich Insurance
Group, as well as our academic
advisers at the National University
of Singapore, the Oxford Martin
School at the University of Oxford
and the Wharton Risk Management
and Decision Processes Center at
the University of Pennsylvania. As
in previous years, the Global Risks
Report draws on our annual Global
Risks Perceptions Survey, which
is completed by around 1,000
members of our multistakeholder
communities. The report has also
benefitted greatly from the input
of many individuals in the Forum’s
global expert networks.

Executive
Summary

Is the world sleepwalking into a
crisis? Global risks are intensifying
but the collective will to tackle them
appears to be lacking. Instead,
divisions are hardening. The world’s
move into a new phase of strongly
state-centred politics, noted in
last year’s Global Risks Report,
continued throughout 2018. The
idea of “taking back control”—
whether domestically from political
rivals or externally from multilateral
or supranational organizations—
resonates across many countries
and many issues. The energy now
expended on consolidating or
recovering national control risks
weakening collective responses to
emerging global challenges. We are
drifting deeper into global problems
from which we will struggle to
extricate ourselves.
During 2018, macroeconomic
risks moved into sharper focus.
Financial market volatility increased
and the headwinds facing the global
economy intensified. The rate of
global growth appears to have
peaked: the latest International
Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts point
to a gradual slowdown over the
next few years.1 This is mainly the
result of developments in advanced
economies, but projections of a
slowdown in China—from 6.6%
growth in 2018 to 6.2% this year
and 5.8% by 2022—are a source of
concern. So too is the global debt
burden, which is significantly higher
than before the global financial
crisis, at around 225% of GDP.
In addition, a tightening of global
financial conditions has placed
particular strain on countries that
built up dollar-denominated liabilities
while interest rates were low.
Geopolitical and geo-economic
tensions are rising among the
world’s major powers. These
tensions represent the most urgent
global risks at present. The world is
1

evolving into a period of divergence
following a period of globalization
that profoundly altered the global
political economy. Reconfiguring
the relations of deeply integrated
countries is fraught with potential
risks, and trade and investment
relations among many of the world’s
powers were difficult during 2018.
Against this backdrop, it is likely
to become more difficult to make
collective progress on other global
challenges—from protecting the
environment to responding to the
ethical challenges of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution. Deepening
fissures in the international system
suggest that systemic risks may
be building. If another global crisis
were to hit, would the necessary
levels of cooperation and support
be forthcoming? Probably, but the
tension between the globalization of
the world economy and the growing
nationalism of world politics is a
deepening risk.
Environmental risks continue
to dominate the results of our
annual Global Risks Perception
Survey (GRPS). This year, they
accounted for three of the top
five risks by likelihood and four by
impact. Extreme weather was the
risk of greatest concern, but our
survey respondents are increasingly
worried about environmental
policy failure: having fallen in the
rankings after Paris, “failure of
climate-change mitigation and
adaptation” jumped back to number
two in terms of impact this year.
The results of climate inaction are
becoming increasingly clear. The
accelerating pace of biodiversity
loss is a particular concern. Species
abundance is down by 60% since
1970. In the human food chain,
biodiversity loss is affecting health
and socioeconomic development,
with implications for well-being,
productivity, and even
regional security.

The Global Risks Report 2019

Technology continues to play a
profound role in shaping the global
risks landscape. Concerns about
data fraud and cyber-attacks were
prominent again in the GRPS, which
also highlighted a number of other
technological vulnerabilities:
around two-thirds of respondents
expect the risks associated with
fake news and identity theft to
increase in 2019, while three-fifths
said the same about loss of privacy
to companies and governments.
There were further massive data
breaches in 2018, new hardware
weaknesses were revealed, and
research pointed to the potential
uses of artificial intelligence to
engineer more potent cyberattacks. Last year also provided
further evidence that cyber-attacks
pose risks to critical infrastructure,
prompting countries to strengthen
their screening of cross-border
partnerships on national
security grounds.
The importance of the various
structural changes that are under
way should not distract us from the
human side of global risks. For
many people, this is an increasingly
anxious, unhappy and lonely world.
Worldwide, mental health problems
now affect an estimated 700 million
people. Complex transformations—
societal, technological and
work-related—are having a
profound impact on people’s lived
experiences. A common theme
is psychological stress related to
a feeling of lack of control in the
face of uncertainty. These issues
deserve more attention: declining
psychological and emotional wellbeing is a risk in itself—and one that
also affects the wider global risks
landscape, notably via impacts on
social cohesion and politics.
Another set of risks being amplified
by global transformations relate
to biological pathogens. Changes
in how we live have increased

the risk of a devastating outbreak
occurring naturally, and emerging
technologies are making it
increasingly easy for new biological
threats to be manufactured and
released either deliberately or
by accident. The world is badly
under-prepared for even modest
biological threats, leaving us
vulnerable to potentially huge
impacts on individual lives, societal
well-being, economic activity and
national security. Revolutionary new
biotechnologies promise miraculous
advances, but also create daunting
challenges of oversight and
control—as demonstrated by claims
in 2018 that the world’s first genemodified babies had been created.
Rapidly growing cities and ongoing
effects of climate change are
making more people vulnerable to
rising sea levels. Two-thirds of
the global population is expected
to live in cities by 2050 and already
an estimated 800 million people
live in more than 570 coastal cities
vulnerable to a sea-level rise of 0.5
metres by 2050. In a vicious circle,
urbanization not only concentrates
people and property in areas of
potential damage and disruption,
it also exacerbates those risks—
for example by destroying natural
sources of resilience such as coastal
mangroves and increasing the
strain on groundwater reserves.
Intensifying impacts will render
an increasing amount of land
uninhabitable. There are three main
strategies for adapting to rising
sea-levels: (1) engineering projects
to keep water out, (2) naturebased defences, and (3) peoplebased strategies, such as moving
households and businesses to
safer ground or investing in
social capital to make flood-risk
communities more resilient.

could trigger dramatic deteriorations
and cause cascading risks to
crystallize with dizzying speed. Each
of the 10 shocks we present is a
“what-if” scenario—not a prediction,
but a reminder of the need to
think creatively about risk and to
expect the unexpected. Among
the topics covered this year are
quantum cryptography, monetary
populism, affective computing and
the death of human rights. In the
Risk Reassessment section,
experts share their insights about
how to manage risks. John Graham
writes about weighing the trade-offs
between different risks, and András
Tilcsik and Chris Clearfield write
about how managers can minimize
the risk of systemic failures in their
organizations. And in the Hindsight
section, we revisit three of the
topics covered in previous reports:
food security, civil society and
infrastructure investment.

In this year’s Future Shocks
section, we focus again on the
potential for threshold effects that

Is the world sleepwalking into a crisis? Global risks

to emerging global challenges. We are drifting
deeper into global problems from which we will
struggle to extricate ourselves.
The following sections focus on five areas of concern
highlighted in this year’s Global Risks Perception
Survey (GRPS), which frame much of the analysis
in subsequent chapters: (1) economic vulnerabilities,
(2) geopolitical tensions, (3) societal and political
strains, (4) environmental fragilities, and
(5) technological instabilities.

Economic
worries
Geo-economic tensions ratcheted
up during 2018, as discussed in
Chapter 2 (Power and Values).
GRPS respondents were concerned in the short term about the
deteriorating international
economic environment, with the
vast majority expecting increasing
risks in 2019 related to “economic
confrontations between major
powers” (91%) and “erosion
of multilateral trading rules
and agreements” (88%).
Last year’s report advised caution
about broader macroeconomic
fragilities, even at a time of
strengthening growth. Economic
risks have since moved into sharper
focus. Financial market volatility
increased in 2018, and the
headwinds facing the global
economy intensified. The rate of
global growth appears to have
peaked: the latest International
Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts point
to a gradual slowdown over the next
few years.1 This is mainly the result
of developments in advanced
economies, where the IMF expects
real GDP growth to decelerate from
2.4% in 2018 to 2.1% this year and
to 1.5% by 2022. However, while
developing economies’ aggregate
growth is expected to remain
broadly unchanged, projections
of a slowdown in China—from 6.6%
in 2018 to 6.2% this year and 5.8%
by 2022—are a source of concern.

The Global Risks Report 2019

High levels of global indebtedness
were one of the specific financial
vulnerabilities we highlighted last
year. These concerns have not
eased. The total global debt
burden is now significantly higher
than it was before the global
financial crisis, at around 225% of
GDP.2 In its latest Global Financial
Stability Report, the IMF notes that
in countries with systemically
significant financial sectors, the
debt burden is higher still, at 250%
of GDP—this compares with a
figure of 210% in 2008.3 In addition,
a tightening of global financial
conditions has placed particular
strain on countries that built up
dollar-denominated liabilities while
interest rates were low. By October
last year, more than 45% of lowincome countries were in or at high
risk of debt distress, up from onethird in 2016.4
Inequality continues to be seen as
an important driver of the global
risks landscape. “Rising income
and wealth disparity” ranked fourth
in GRPS respondents’ list of

underlying trends. Although
global inequality has dipped this
millennium, within-country
inequality has continued to rise.
New research published last year
attributes economic inequality
largely to widening divergences
between public and private levels
of capital ownership over the past
40 years: “Since 1980, very large
transfers of public to private wealth
occurred in nearly all countries,
whether rich or emerging. While
national wealth has substantially
increased, public wealth is now
negative or close to zero in rich
countries”;5 (see Figure 1.1).
Coupled with political polarization,
inequality erodes a country’s social
fabric in an economically damaging
way: as cohesion and trust diminish,
economic performance is likely
to follow.6 One study attempts
to quantify by how much various
countries’ per capita income would
hypothetically increase if their levels
of trust were as high as they are in
Sweden.7 Even in richer developed
countries, the estimated gains

(REUTERS/Damir Sagolj)

would be significant, ranging from
6% in the United Kingdom to 17%
in Italy. In some other countries
they are much greater: 29% in the
Czech Republic, 59% in Mexico
and 69% in Russia. Given these
results, it is sobering that the 2018
Edelman Trust Barometer
categorizes 20 of the 28 countries
surveyed as “distrusters”.8 Beyond
economic impacts, eroding trust is
part of a wider pattern that

threatens to corrode the social
contract in many countries. This
is an era of strong-state politics,
but also one of weakening
national communities.
Interest is increasing in approaches
to economics and finance that
draw on moral theory and social
psychology to reconcile individual
and communitarian goals. For
example, more attention is

being paid to economist and
philosopher Adam Smith and to
placing his work on the “invisible
hand” of market capitalism in
the context of his ideas on moral
obligation and community. Some
argue that too much emphasis
has been placed on “the ‘wants’
of The Wealth of Nations” over
“the ‘oughts’ of The Theory of
Moral Sentiments.”9 There are
no easy remedies: the moral
psychology of partisan differences
is not conducive to compromise
on values,10 while the geopolitical
divergences discussed in
Chapter 2 (Power and Values)
will complicate any attempt to find
consensus on bold attempts to
rethink global capitalism. However,
that is the new challenge, and it is

Forum will devote itself at its Annual

The Global Risks Report 2019

The evolving China-US relationship
is part of the emerging geopolitical
landscape described in last year’s
Global Risks Report as “multipolar
and multiconceptual”. In other
words, the instabilities that are
developing reflect not just changing
power balances, but also the fact
that post-Cold War assumptions—
particularly in the West—that the

world would converge on Western
norms have been shown to be
naïvely optimistic. As Chapter 2
(Power and Values) discusses,
differences in fundamental norms
are likely to play an important role
in geopolitical developments in
the years and decades ahead.
These differences will affect the
global risks landscape in significant
ways—from weakening security
alliances to undermining efforts to
protect the global commons.
With multilateralism weakening
and relations between the
world’s major powers in flux, the
current geopolitical backdrop is
inauspicious for resolving the
many protracted conflicts that
persist around the world. In
Afghanistan, for example, civilian
deaths in the first six months of
2018 were the highest in 10 years,
according to the UN, while the
share of districts controlled by the
United States–supported Afghan
government fell from 72% in 2015
to 56% in 2018.11 In Syria, multiple
states are now embroiled in a civil
conflict in which hundreds of
thousands have died. And in
Yemen, the direct casualties of
war are estimated at 10,000 and
as many as 13 million people are
at risk of starvation as a result of
disruptions to food and other
supplies, according to a UN
warning in October 2018.12
One positive geopolitical
development since the last edition
of this report has been an easing
of tensions and volatility related to

North Korea’s nuclear programme,
following increased diplomacy
involving the United States, South
Korea and North Korea. This may
have played a part in a sharp fall—
from 79% to 44%—in the proportion
of the survey respondents
expecting the risk of “state-onstate military conflict or incursion”
to increase over the next year.
Nonetheless, for the third year
running, weapons of mass
destruction ranked as the
number one global risk in
terms of potential impact.

Political strains
Around the world, mounting
geopolitical instabilities are
matched—and frequently
exacerbated—by continuing
domestic political strains. GRPS
respondents ranked “increasing
polarization of societies” second
only to climate change as an
underlying driver of developments
in the global risks landscape. Many
Western democracies are still
struggling with post-crisis patterns
of political fragmentation and
polarization that have complicated
the process of providing stable and
effective governance. But this is a
global issue, not just a “first-world
problem”. In the World Economic
Forum’s inaugural Regional Risks
for Doing Business report,
published last year, “failure of
national governance” ranked
second globally and first in Latin
America and South Asia, based

on a survey of around 12,000
business leaders covering more
than 130 countries.13
Polarization and weak governance
raise serious questions about
numerous countries’ political health.
In many cases, partisan differences
are deeper than they have been for
a long time. A vicious circle may
develop in which diminishing social
cohesion places ever-greater strain
on political institutions, undermining
their ability to anticipate or respond
to societal challenges. This problem
is even more acute when global
challenges require multilateral
cooperation or integration:
weaker levels of legitimacy and
accountability invite an anti-elitist
backlash. So too do failures of
multilateral policy and institutional
design. For example, it is now widely
acknowledged that more should
have been done to provide
protection or remedies to the losers
from globalization.14 It should not
have taken a crisis to recognize
this. In the GRPS, 59% of
respondents said they expect
risks associated with “public anger
against elites” to increase in 2019.

Chapter 3 (Heads and Hearts)
looks at the causes and potential
consequences of rising levels
of anger, along with other forms
of emotional and psychological
distress.
Identity politics continue to drive
global social and political trends,
and immigration and asylum policy
raise fundamental questions about
control over the composition of
political communities. Migration
has triggered political disruption in
recent years, ranging from Asia
and Latin America to Europe and
the United States. Global trends—
from demographic projections to
climate change—practically
guarantee further crises, and some
leaders are likely to take a tougher
line in defence of dominant national
cultures. In the GRPS, 72% of
respondents said they expect
risks associated with “populist
and nativist agendas” to
increase in 2019.

In some countries, efforts to secure
recognition and equality for a
widening range of minority social
groups—defined by characteristics
such as race, ethnicity, religion,
gender identity or sexual orientation—have become increasingly
electorally significant. In the United
States, for example, attitudes
towards identity politics mark
increasingly bitter divisions
between Republican and
Democratic voting blocs.15
November 2018’s mid-term
Congressional elections saw a
record number of women and
non-white candidates elected.
There has been a period of
renewed politicization around
gender, sexism and sexual assault
in the United States. The #MeToo
movement, which began in
October 2017, continued in 2018
and has also drawn attention to—
and in some cases amplified—
similar campaigns against sexual

violence.16 The increased attention
being paid globally to violence
against women was also reflected
in the Nobel Peace Prize going to
Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege
for their work to end the use of
sexual violence as a tool of conflict.
Beyond being directly targeted with
violence and discrimination,
women around the world are also
disproportionately affected by many
of the risks discussed in the Global
Risks Report, often as a result of
experiencing higher levels of poverty and being the primary providers
of childcare, food and fuel. For
example, climate change means
women in many communities must
walk farther to fetch water. Women
often do not have the same freedom
or resourcesas men to reach safety
after natural disasters—in parts of
Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India, men
who survived the 2004 tsunami
outnumbered women by almost
three to one.17 According to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF),

women are also more likely than
men to have their jobs displaced
by automation.18

Climate
catastrophe
Environment-related risks dominate
the GRPS for the third year in a row,
accounting for three of the top five
risks by likelihood and four by
impact (see Figure IV). Extreme
weather is again out on its own
in the top-right (high-likelihood,
high-impact) quadrant of the Global
Risks Landscape 2019 (see Figure I).

Climate Assessment warned in
November that without significant
reductions in emissions, average
global temperatures could rise by
5ºC by the end of the century.20
GRPS respondents seem
increasingly worried about
environmental policy failure: having
fallen in the rankings after Paris,
“failure of climate-change mitigation
and adaptation” jumped back to
number two in terms of impact this
year. And the most frequently cited
risk interconnection was the pairing
of “failure of climate-change
mitigation and adaptation” and
“extreme weather events”.

Environment-related risks
account for three of the top
five risks by likelihood and
four by impact

The year 2018 was another one of
storms, fires and floods.19 Of all risks,
it is in relation to the environment
that the world is most clearly
sleepwalking into catastrophe. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) bluntly said in
October 2018 that we have at most
12 years to make the drastic and
unprecedented changes needed to
prevent average global temperatures
from rising beyond the Paris
Agreement’s 1.5ºC target. In the
United States, the Fourth National

The accelerating pace of biodiversity
loss is a particular concern. The
Living Planet Index, which tracks
more than 4,000 species across
the globe, reports a 60% decline in
average abundance since 1970.21
Climate change is exacerbating
biodiversity loss and the causality
goes both ways: many affected
ecosystems—such as oceans and
forests—are important for
absorbing carbon emissions.
Increasingly fragile ecosystems also
pose risks to societal and economic

stability. For example, 200 million
people depend on coastal
mangrove ecosystems to protect
their livelihoods and food security
from storm surges and rising sea
levels, as discussed in Chapter 5
(Fight or Flight).22 One estimate of
the notional economic value of
“ecosystem services”—benefits
to humans, such as drinking water,
pollination or protection against
floods—puts it at US$125 trillion
per year, around two-thirds higher
than global GDP.23
In the human food chain, loss of
biodiversity affects health and socioeconomic development, with
implications for well-being,
productivity and even regional
security. Micronutrient malnutrition
affects as many as 2 billion people.
It is typically caused by a lack of
access to food of sufficient variety
and quality.24 Nearly half the world’s
plant-based calories are provided
by just three crops: rice, wheat
and maize.25 Climate change
compounds the risks. In 2017,
climate-related disasters caused
acute food insecurity for
approximately 39 million people
across 23 countries.26 Less
obviously, increased levels of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere are
affecting the nutritional composition
of staples such as rice and wheat.
Research suggests that by 2050
this could lead to zinc deficiencies
for 175 million people, protein
deficiencies for 122 million, and
loss of dietary iron for 1 billion.27

The Global Risks Report 2019

As environmental risks crystallize
with increasing frequency and
severity, the impact on global
value chains is likely to intensify,
weakening overall resilience.
Disruptions to the production and
delivery of goods and services
due to environmental disasters
are up by 29% since 2012.28 North
America was the region worst
affected by environment-related
supply-chain disruptions in 2017;
these disruptions were due notably
to hurricanes and wildfires.29 For
example, in the US automotive
industry, only factory fires and
company mergers caused more
supply-chain disruptions than
hurricanes.30 When the disruptions
are measured by the number of
suppliers affected rather than the
number of individual events, the
four most significant triggers in
2017 were hurricanes, extreme
weather, earthquakes and floods.31
Upheavals in the global waste
disposal and recycling supply chain
during 2018 may be a foretaste.
China banned the import of foreign
waste, including almost 9 million
tons of plastic scrap, to reduce
pollution and strain on its national
environmental systems.32 This
ban exposed weaknesses in the
domestic recycling capacity of
many Western countries. Plastic
waste built up in the United
Kingdom, Canada and several
European states. In the first half of
2018 the United States sent 30%
of the plastic that would previously
have gone to China to landfill,33
and the rest to other countries

16

The Global Risks Report 2019

including Thailand, Malaysia and
Vietnam. However, all three of
those countries have since
announced their own new
restrictions or bans on plastic
imports. In sum, as the impact of
environmental risks increases, it
will become increasingly difficult
to treat those risks as externalities
that can be ignored or shipped
out. Domestic and coordinated
international action will be needed
to internalize and mitigate the
impact of human activity on
natural systems.

Technological
instabilities
Technology continues to play a
profound role in shaping the global
risks landscape for individuals,
governments and businesses. In
the GRPS, “massive data fraud and
theft” was ranked the number four
global risk by likelihood over
a 10-year horizon, with “cyberattacks” at number five. This
sustains a pattern recorded last
year, with cyber-risks consolidating
their position alongside
environmental risks in the highimpact, high-likelihood quadrant of
the Global Risks Landscape (Figure
I). A large majority of respondents
expected increased risks in 2019
of cyber-attacks leading to theft of
money and data (82%) and
disruption of operations (80%). The
survey reflects how new instabilities
are being caused by the deepening
integration of digital technologies

into every aspect of life. Around
two-thirds of respondents expect
the risks associated with fake news
and identity theft to increase in
2019, while three-fifths said the
same about loss of privacy to
companies and governments.
The potential psychological
effects of the increasing digital
intermediation of people’s lives
is discussed in Chapter 3
(Heads and Hearts).
Malicious cyber-attacks and lax
cybersecurity protocols again led
to massive breaches of personal
information in 2018. The largest
was in India, where the government
ID database, Aadhaar, reportedly
suffered multiple breaches that
potentially compromised the records
of all 1.1 billion registered citizens. It
was reported in January that criminals were selling access to the database at a rate of 500 rupees for 10
minutes, while in March a leak at a
state-owned utility company allowed
anyone to download names and
ID numbers.34 Elsewhere, personal
data breaches affected around
150 million users of the
MyFitnessPal application,35 and
around 50 million Facebook users.36
Cyber vulnerabilities can come
from unexpected directions, as
shown in 2018 by the Meltdown
and Spectre threats, which
involved weaknesses in computer
hardware rather than software.
They potentially affected every Intel
processor produced in the last
10 years.37 Last year also saw
continuing evidence that cyber-

The vulnerability of critical
technological infrastructure
is a growing national
security concern
attacks pose risks to critical
infrastructure. In July the US
government stated that hackers
had gained access to the control
rooms of US utility companies.38
The potential vulnerability of critical
technological infrastructure has
increasingly become a national
security concern. The second most
frequently cited risk interconnection
in this year’s GPRS was the
pairing of cyber-attacks with
critical information infrastructure
breakdown.
Machine learning or artificial
intelligence (AI) is becoming more
sophisticated and prevalent,
with growing potential to amplify
existing risks or create new ones,
particularly as the Internet of
Things connects billions of devices.
In a survey conducted last year by
Brookings, 32% of respondents
said they view AI as a threat to
humanity, while only 24% do not.39
IBM last year revealed targeted AI
malware that can “hide” a
well-known threat—WannaCry—
in a video-conferencing application,
activating only when it recognizes
the face of the intended target.40
Similar innovations are likely to
occur in other fields. For example,
Chapter 4 (Going Viral) highlights

the potential for malicious actors
in synthetic biology to use AI to
create new pathogens. One of
this year’s Future Shocks
(Chapter 6) considers the
potential consequences of
“affective computing”—referring to
AI that can recognize, respond to
and manipulate human emotions.
Among the most widespread and
disruptive impacts of AI in recent
years has been its role in the rise
of “media echo chambers and fake
news”, a risk that 69% of GRPS
respondents expect to increase
in 2019. Researchers last year
studied the trajectories of 126,000
tweets and found that those
containing fake news consistently
outperformed those containing true
information, on average reaching
1,500 people six times more quickly. One possible reason cited by
researchers is that fake news tends
to evoke potent emotions: “Fake
tweets tended to elicit words
associated with surprise and
disgust, while accurate tweets
summoned words associated with
sadness and trust.”41 The interplay
between emotions and technology
is likely to become an ever more
disruptive force.

Power and
Values
Evolving Risks in a
Multiconceptual World

REUTERS/Marko Djurica

A period of change in the international system is
destabilizing assumptions about global order. Last year’s
Global Risks Report argued that the world is becoming not
just multipolar, but also “multiconceptual”. This chapter
further examines how changing power dynamics and
diverging norms and values are affecting global politics
and the global economy.

The chapter begins by outlining how normative differences
increasingly shape domestic and international politics. It
then highlights three trends with the potential to trigger
disruptive change: (1) the difficulty of sustaining global
consensus on ethically charged issues such as human
rights; (2) intensifying pressure on multilateralism and
dispute-settlement mechanisms; and (3) states’ increasingly
frequent use of geo-economic policy interventions.

No room for
nostalgia
It should be no surprise that a
multipolar world is also more
multiconceptual: as global power is
diffused, there is more room for
divergent values to shape
geopolitics than there has been
since the end of World War II.
After the bipolar Cold War gave
way to unipolar US power, some
argued that the battle of ideas
was over and Western liberal
democratic norms would, in time,
prevail globally. That was a bold
claim then and it looks like hubris
now. In today’s world, narratives
of gradual convergence on any set
of overarching values look
unconvincing. Values seem to be a
source of division rather than unity,
not just globally but also within
regions and countries.
Nostalgia is an inadequate
response, especially as previous
decades were hardly risk-free. The
imperative now is to understand
the changes that are happening

and learn how to safely navigate
the challenges they entail. After
a period of globalization that has
deeply integrated many countries,
reconfiguring relationships is
unlikely to be easy.

States,
individuals and
markets
Values-based tensions are
manifesting in different ways in
different places, creating new fault
lines within and between countries
and regions. But they have common
features: control, and the role of the
state. Many political leaders and
communities feel they have lost
control—whether to internal
divisions, external rivals or
multilateral organizations—and,
in response, they look to strengthen
the state. Because notions of power,
security and self-determination are
so politically fundamental, clashes
may have less scope for
compromise than when differences
involve more technical issues.

Domestically, key tensions include
the following:
States and individuals. The
balance has tilted from
individuals towards states.1
In this context, the idea of
“illiberal democracy” has
gained currency.2
States and minorities.
Politically, rising majoritarianism
means voting is increasingly a
winner-takes-all contest between
polarized groupings. Culturally,
identity politics have become
increasingly contentious, with
national majorities in many
countries seeking greater
assimilation (or exclusion)
of minorities.
States and markets. The scale
and power of multinational
businesses has fuelled growing
opposition to globalization in
many countries. Elsewhere,
states are taking a stronger
economic role: almost a quarter
of the world’s largest firms are
now state-controlled, the
highest level in decades.3

The Global Risks Report 2019

Globally, key pressures relate to
how states interact and tackle
cross-border challenges:
Multilateral rules and institutions.
Strong-state politics makes it
harder to sustain multilateralism.
As further explored below, this
has been most evident so far
in the shift in trade policy from
global frameworks overseen by
the World Trade Organization to
state-led regional initiatives and
bilateral deals.5
Sovereignty and noninterference. The protections
for state sovereignty in the UN
Charter appear more resilient
than the interventionist norms of
the 2005 Responsibility to
Protect principle. In the digital
era, efforts to promote (or disrupt)
political values in other countries
have become increasingly
contentious.
Migration and asylum. The
international movement of
people has emerged in recent
years as a fault-line issue in
many countries. Demographic
trends—such as those

illustrated in Figure 2.1,
which projects changes in the
relative populations of Africa
and Europe—will drive
inter-regional migration in
the decades ahead.
Protection of the global
commons. Climate change,
outer space, cyber space and the
polar regions are aspects of the
global commons that are already
or could increasingly become a
source of international tensions.
In the context of rising geopolitical
competition and weakening
multilateral institutions, debates
revolving around these pressures
have the potential to be destabilizing
and even to foment conflict. A
more hopeful prospect is that the
current flux in the international
system instead will lead in
pragmatic, open and pluralist
directions, but even then a difficult
and risky transition lies ahead.

Shared goals amid
divergent values
In a world of disparate powers and
divergent values, it is likely to be
more difficult to make progress on
shared global goals. Such progress
requires two things: aligning on
substantive priorities for action, and
then sustaining coordination and
collaboration. The example of
climate change shows that, even
when the first is possible, the

The role of technology. New
technological capabilities have
amplified existing tensions
over values—for example, by
weakening individual privacy or
deepening polarization—while
differences in values are
shaping the pace and direction
of technological advances
in different countries.4

second can be challenging: broad
consensus was built up over
decades, culminating in the signing
of the Paris Agreement in 2015—
but evidence on implementation is
mixed, and even full implementation
will not be enough to prevent
damaging levels of global warming.
Challenges related to the Fourth
Industrial Revolution will evolve
rapidly and coordinating a
response may be complicated
when they touch on fundamental
values. Chapter 4 (Going Viral)
discusses how emerging biotechnologies are blurring the lines
between humanity and technology:
for example, it was claimed in late
2018 that gene-editing tools had
been used to create genetically
modified babies. Whether
countries each chart their own
course on such research or
instead align around shared ethical
principles to craft international
restrictions could have important
implications for the future
of humanity.

The Global Risks Report 2019

Migration and cross-border tax
policy are among other global issues
that are both ethically charged and
subject to divergent state interests.
However, the most acute challenge
may be posed by human rights,
which have become a litmus test
for the changing role of values in the
international system.
As geopolitical tensions and
competition have intensified,
human rights have been
increasingly politicized.6 The
complex global picture that is
emerging in that area—nominal
alignment on shared values, marked
differences in interpretation and
implementation, fragmented
approaches to multilateral
institutions—is a microcosm
of the wider role of values in the
international system. An optimistic
scenario sees the kind of flux that
is evident around human rights as
an opening for states and other
stakeholders to find better ways
of doing things. However, values
divergence means that it will be
difficult even to align on what

24

The Global Risks Report 2019

“better” means in this context.
As sketched out in one of our
Future Shocks (see page 74), it is
possible to imagine a tipping point is
reached where states simply
abandon ideas—and institutions—
that limit their autonomy.

Multilateralism
under threat
Political leaders have increasingly
asserted the primacy of the nationstate in the international system and
sought to weaken the constraints
placed on national autonomy by
international agreements and
multilateral institutions. Defenders of
multilateralism point out that this
fragmentation risks creating blind
spots, undermining global stability,
and limiting the capacity to respond
to cross-border challenges.
The current multilateral architecture
has been criticized in rising and
legacy powers alike. In some rising
powers, critics argue that the

international architecture is too
firmly shaped by the post-World
War II balance of power and
values, and has failed to evolve
to reflect subsequent global
transformations.7 In economic
terms, for example, in 1950 the
United States had 27.2% of global
GDP and China 4.6% (on a
purchasing power parity basis); in
2017 those figures were 15.3% and
18.2%, respectively.8 Such shifts
in the economic centre of gravity
create demands for institutional
change. Meanwhile, in some
legacy powers, critics argue that
multilateralism is a costly drag on
their freedom to manoeuvre.
Multilateralism can be weakened in
numerous ways. States can
withdraw from agreements and
institutions; they can intervene to
block consensus; and they can
adopt a selective approach to
upholding norms and rules.
Multilateral institutions can also
experience a gradual process of
disuse or disregard. Arguably, the
cohesiveness of the multilateral

REUTERS/Edgar Su

Fragmentation risks creating blind spots,
undermining global stability, and limiting
the capacity to respond

system could be weakened by the
creation of new parallel structures,
but it is also possible that
increased institutional density
could bolster the resilience
of the system.
International dispute resolution
is an area of particular concern,
so far manifesting especially in
relation to trade. For example, if the
appointment of new judges to the
WTO’s Appellate Body continues
to be blocked, a key disputesettlement panel could cease to
function in December 2019, when
there will no longer be enough
judges on the panel to issue
valid rulings.9
Dispute resolution is a crucial part of
the architecture of international

commerce, and the system is
already changing—its centre of
gravity is shifting from the West to
Asia. For example, in late 2017 the
China International Economic and
Trade Arbitration Commission
(CIETAC) introduced its first
international arbitration rules, and
in mid-2018 China established two
new international courts to handle
commercial disputes related to
the Belt and Road Initiative.10
Controversy has escalated in many
countries over investor-state dispute
settlement (ISDS) procedures, which
allow foreign investors to rely on
international arbitration processes
rather than the local legal frameworks of countries in which they
have invested.11 If cross-border trust
is eroded by geopolitical competition
and diverging values, creating

mutually accepted disputesettlement mechanisms may
become increasingly complicated.

Worsening trade
relations
Trade is the arena in which the
broader implications of a more
multipolar, multiconceptual world
have so far played out most clearly.
Trade relations between China and
the United States rapidly worsened
during 2018. There were positive
signs in the final months of the
year, raising hopes that a normalization of relations will follow, but
the pace of the earlier deterioration
highlights how quickly risks can
crystallize and intensify in this area.

The Global Risks Report 2019

25

The US Department of Commerce’s strategic
plan states that “economic security is
national security”

In early 2018, on the
recommendation of the US
International Trade Commission,12
President Trump announced “global
safeguard tariffs”—the first time
this provision had been used since
2001—totalling US$8.5 billion on
solar panel imports and US$1.8
billion on washing machine imports.
The United States later cited national
security when imposing tariffs on
steel and aluminium imports, and on
three occasions it increased Chinaspecific tariffs related to intellectual
property and technology disputes.13
These US steps drew countermeasures from China, and the
stand-off soon threatened to
cover all goods trade between
the two countries.14
The potential costs of deepening
trade tensions were highlighted
in October 2018 when the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
revised down its global growth
projections for 2018 and 2019 by
0.2 percentage points. The IMF
expects growth to slow in the
United States from 2.9% last year
to 2.4% in 2019, and in China from
6.6% to 6.2%. Any slowdown in
global growth will add to the

26

The Global Risks Report 2019

headwinds for developing
countries, which already face rising
interest rates and, in some cases,
domestic political stresses as well:
in September, as US bond yields
picked up, investor nervousness
had pushed emerging market
equities into bear-market territory.15
Economic policy—long seen as a
means of mitigating geopolitical
risk by embedding powers in
mutually beneficial relationships—
is now frequently seen as a tool of
strategic competition. For
example, the US Department of
Commerce’s strategic plan for
2018–22 states that “economic
security is national security.”16
Each side in the worsening
stand-off between the United
States and China last year
blamed the other for eroding
bilateral relations,17 18 and domestic
political factors have not always
been conducive to compromise
between the two countries. Their
current relationship is such that
a rapid unwinding of protectionist
measures cannot be ruled
out, but some analysts
have warned about more
fundamental challenges.

It was not only among rivals that
global trade conditions worsened
in 2018. US trade relations with
its allies also saw unexpected
volatility. Ahead of the meeting
of G7 leaders in June, the United
States imposed tariffs on steel and
aluminium imports from the
European Union, Canada, Mexico
and others.19 Threat and counterthreat followed, between the United
States and the European Union in
particular: President Trump talked
of imposing a 20% tariff on vehicle
imports from the European Union;
the European Commission hinted
at global countermeasures totalling
US$294 billion, around one-fifth
of total goods exports.20 The
uncertainty put strain on
European car makers, some
of which were already under
pressure from US-China trade
tensions.21 In a rapprochement
of sorts, President Trump and
European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in
July to work towards reducing
tariffs on both sides. And in
October, a revised trade deal
between the United States,
Mexico and Canada was announced to replace NAFTA: the

REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis

USMCA (the United States-MexicoCanada Agreement).22
Almost all of the high-profile trade
disruptions that were threatened or
imposed in 2018 relate to exports
and imports of physical goods.
But a growing proportion of global
trade consists of services—digital
services in particular. As digital

flows have increased in economic
importance, so too have data
localization provisions that require
businesses to store data in the
country where they are collected
rather than on company servers

argue, however, that governments’
expressed reasons for restricting

digital trade.24

rules have been justified on
numerous grounds, from privacy
and intellectual property to national

Investment tensions
The past year’s developments in
foreign direct investment (FDI) are
arguably even more significant than
trade tensions. As discussed in the
2018 Global Risks Report, outward
investment has become more
associated with geopolitical
positioning. As a result, caution
towards inward investment is
growing. Because FDI creates
economic facts on the ground in a
way that trade flows do not, this
is an area where increasing geoeconomic competition could sow
seeds of tensions that take years
to grow and years more to resolve.
Western countries in particular have
been sharpening their power to
block investments in strategic
sectors, particularly emerging
technologies—raising the prospect
of a partial unwinding of globalization
in investment, as in trade.
In August 2018 the German
government announced a
reduction in the threshold at
which foreign investments can be
blocked.25 It had earlier instructed
a state-owned bank to acquire
a 20% stake in an energy
infrastructure company to prevent
its acquisition.26 This is not the first
time that a European government
has sought to restrict inward
investment. In 2005 France
notoriously fended off PepsiCo’s
mooted acquisition of dairy
producer Danone.27 Then-Prime
Minister Dominique de Villepin

competitiveness.28 That language

prompted a backlash at the time,
but it resonates today—though
European wariness now focuses
on Chinese rather than US
takeovers.

Figure 2.2: Opening Up?

This wariness has intensified
since the cutting-edge German
technology firm Kuka was acquired
by a Chinese company in 2016. In
2018 the United Kingdom released
a 120-page policy proposal that
would increase government power
to block foreign acquisitions,29
while France published draft
legislation increasing the number
of sectors in which foreign
acquisitions must receive prior
ministerial approval.30 Technology
firms are a particular focus for
investment screening because their
significance goes beyond the
economic: the dual-use nature of
many new technologies means
their acquisition could have national
security implications.31
In December 2017 the European
Commission proposed EU-wide
measures to control non-EU
investment into EU companies,
as only 12 of the 28 member states
have screening mechanisms. One
reason for EU concern is that
many decisions need memberstate unanimity, creating vulnerability
to foreign leverage in individual
member states. In September 2018
European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker called for
more foreign-policy decisions in

Note: The index covers four main types of
FDI restriction: foreign equity restrictions,
discriminatory screening or approval
mechanisms, restrictions on key foreign
personnel, and operational restrictions.

The United States also introduced
legislation in 2018 to improve the
screening of investment into 27
sectors, including semiconductors
and telecommunications.33 In 2017
India tightened the rules for foreign
businesses operating in power
transmission.34 Australia has
repeatedly tightened its inward
investment rules in recent years,
and in 2018 announced further
restrictions on investment in
electricity infrastructure and
agricultural land.35
China is travelling in the other
direction, albeit from a very
different starting point. According
to Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) data, China has significantly

reduced its restrictiveness to FDI
in recent years, but nevertheless
it remains among the world’s
most restrictive countries
(see Figure 2.2).36 While in 2018
China announced further cuts to
its “negative list”—of sectors into
which foreign businesses are
prohibited from investing, or in
which they can operate only as
part of a joint venture with Chinese
entities37—many sectors that would
generate interest from foreign
investors remain on the list.38
As with trade, if the climate for
cross-border investment flows

If this were to be sustained, it
would leave many states—
particularly smaller or weaker
ones—having to make painful
choices between securing
investment for growth and
maintaining fiscal control
and strategic independence.

continues to worsen it will hamper
global economic growth and risk
creating a vicious circle in which
economic and geopolitical tensions
aggravate each other. The data
already point to a sharp fall-off in
FDI in 2017, despite other
macroeconomic indicators being
solid. This trend continued in the
first half of 2018 (see Figure 2.3).39

Heads and
Hearts
The Human Side of
Global Risks

REUTERS/Jon Nazca

The Global Risks Report tends to deal with structural
issues: systems under stress, institutions that no longer
match the challenges facing the world, adverse impacts
of policies and practices. All these issues entail
widespread human costs in terms of psychological
and emotional strain.

This is usually left implicit but it deserves more
attention—and not only because declining psychological
and emotional well-being is a risk in itself. It also affects
the wider global risks landscape, notably via impacts
on social cohesion and politics.

The Global Risks Report 2019

33

This chapter focuses explicitly on
this human side of global risks.
For many people, as explored in
the first two sections, this is an
increasingly anxious, unhappy and
lonely world. Anger is increasing
and empathy appears to be in
decline. The chapter examines
the ramifications of complex
transformations in three areas—
societal, technological and
work-related. A common theme
is that psychological stress is
related to a feeling of lack of
control in the face of uncertainty.1

The age of anger
Every year Gallup takes a
large-scale snapshot of the
world’s emotional state. It asks
respondents—154,000 across
more than 145 countries in 2017—
whether they had various positive
and negative experiences on
the preceding day. Overall, the
positive experiences (such as
smiling, respect and learning)

people are
estimated to have
a mental disorder

34

The Global Risks Report 2019

comfortably outstrip the negative
(which include pain, worry and
sadness)—but the trend lines
are worrying.
As illustrated by the graphs in
Figure 3.1, the positive experience
index (a composite measure of five
positive experiences) has been
relatively steady since the survey
began in 2006. Meanwhile, the
negative experience index has
broken upwards over the past five
years. In 2017, almost four in ten
people said they had experienced a
lot of worry or stress the day before;
three in ten experienced a lot of
physical pain; and two in ten
experienced a lot of anger.2
Although still the least prevalent
of Gallup’s negative experiences,
anger is commonly referenced as
the defining emotion of the zeitgeist.
Some suggest this is an “age of
anger”, noting a “tremendous
increase in mutual hatred.”3 And
while it is conceivable that public
anger can be a unifying and
catalysing force—a hope often
expressed at the start of the
decade in relation to the Arab
Spring4—it has since come to be
seen more as politically divisive
and societally corrosive.
In the United States, public opinion
researchers note that where
opposing political groups previously
expressed frustration with each
other, they now express fear and
anger.5 In one survey, almost a third
of respondents reported having
stopped talking to a family member

or friend over the 2016 presidential
election.6 In another, 68% of
Americans said they were angry
at least once a day; women
reported themselves more angry
than men, as did the middle
class relative to their richer
and poorer peers.7
Anger has long been associated
with loss of status.8 Recent research
also suggests a strong link with
group identity.9 The risk is that this
combination generates angry
polarization—an increasingly

prevalent feature of politics in many
countries. And as further explored
in the technology section below, in
recent years group identities have
been hardened by a process of
“social sorting” that has eroded
traditional, cross-cutting societal ties.10

Global trends in
mental health
Gallup’s finding that negative
experiences are on the rise chimes
with World Health Organization
data suggesting that depression
and anxiety disorders increased
by 54% and 42%, respectively,
between 1990 and 2013.11 They
rank second and seventh,
respectively, in the global burden
of disease; five of the top 20 are
mental illnesses.12 Worldwide,
700 million people are estimated
to have a mental disorder.13
Not all data confirm the finding
that the prevalence of mental
health problems is rising, but there
are indications that the current
generation of young people
in particular are experiencing
significant increases. In the
United States, for example, the
proportion of the total population
with depression increased from
6.6% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2015, but
the rise was much sharper for
individuals aged between 12 and
17, where prevalence increased
from 5.7% to 12.7%.14 One study
found that between five and eight
times as many US students in

2007 reported psychopathological
symptoms on a standardized
survey than their counterparts in
1938. These trends are particularly
pronounced for American girls—in
2016 one in five had experienced
a major depressive episode in the
previous year.15 Concerns have
been raised about a loosening of
diagnostic criteria, but behavioural
evidence points in the same
direction. The rate of self-harm for
girls aged between 10 and 14 nearly
tripled between 2009 and 2015
and the suicide rate for 15- to
19-year-olds increased by 59%
over the same period.16
Recorded rates of mental health
disorders are higher in the West—
the lifetime prevalence rate for
anxiety ranges from 4.8% in China
to 31% in the United States.
Suggested explanations for this
have included reporting bias,
methodological factors and
the possibility that in poorer
circumstances mental suffering
is more likely to be seen as
an expected part of life than
a diagnosable condition.17
Nonetheless, people with mental
health conditions in lower-income
countries can face profound
difficulties: one study across 28
countries found treatment gaps of
up to 85%.18
Within affluent countries, wealth
affects well-being in complex ways.
The prevalence of anxiety disorders
is higher among lower-income
groups. But attitudes towards
money matter too—researchers

have linked reduced well-being to
societal shifts away from intrinsic
motivations (related to community
feeling and affiliation) and towards
extrinsic motivations (related to
financial success and social
status).19 This is generationally
significant: in one US study,
81% of 18- to 25-year-olds said that
getting rich was their generation’s
top or second goal, compared to
62% of 26- to 39-year-olds.20
Another important generational
pattern relates to expectations
of increasing quality of life.
As illustrated by Figure 3.2, there
is significant variation across
countries in terms of young people’s

perceptions of how their lives will
compare to those of their parents.
Only 5% of survey respondents
in China expect to live a worse life
than their parents, compared with
30% in the United States and the
United Kingdom and almost
60% in France.21

Violence, poverty
and loneliness
What is contributing to these
patterns of increased negative
experience? Societal stressors are
the first potential driver considered.
Violent conflict remains one of the
most potent causes of emotional
and psychological distress. There
is a danger of complacency here,

Figure 3.2: Life Prospects

because conflict-related deaths
have fallen sharply since the middle
of the 20th century, as shown in
Figure 3.3. However, as the figure
illustrates, the overall number of
conflicts is close to the highs of the
early 1990s and has risen in recent
years.22 While not mass death
conflicts, these are clearly a source
of emotional and psychological
distress for huge numbers of
people, particularly in Africa, the
Middle East and South Asia.23
The same is true for violence of
other sorts. The prevalence of
homicide is particularly important,
because it influences overall
perceptions of security.24 Although
the global rate fell for a decade
before a marginal uptick in 2016,25
regions are affected very differently:
Latin America accounts for 8% of
the world’s population but 33% of
its murders.26 Similar trendlines are
not available for “intimate partner
violence”, but the World Health
Organization estimates that around
30% of women globally experience
it during their lives, and that it
doubles the risk of depression.27
In 2017, 137 women were killed
every day by intimate partners
or family members.28

The proportion of the world’s
population living in poverty has
dropped significantly in recent
decades, alleviating one of the
key threats to physical and mental
well-being,29 but increases in the
global population mean the absolute
numbers are still extremely high. In
2015 there were 736 million people

Figure 3.3:
Conflict and Death
Number of conflicts, 1946–2016

Researchers call the current share
of people living alone “wholly
unprecedented historically”.32 In
the United Kingdom, the average
proportion of single-person
households has increased from
around 5% in pre-industrial
communities to 17% by the 1960s
and 31% in 2011. Similar figures are
recorded in Germany, Japan, the
Netherlands and the United States.

living on less than US$1.90 a day,
and numbers were increasing in
Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle
East and North Africa.30 And even in
high-income countries, income and
wealth disparities—ranked fourth as
a driver of the global risks landscape
in our survey this year—have been
linked to increasing mental health
problems.31
A third societal stressor is
loneliness. This is on the rise, in
the West in particular, where
household structures have been
undergoing a profound shift.

Many capital cities have even
higher proportions of so-called
“solitaries”—for example, 50% in
Paris and 60% in Stockholm.
In midtown Manhattan 94% of
households are single-person.
Researchers argue that urbanization
can weaken family and other
bonds relative to smaller, rural
communities;33 this may help to
explain high-income countries’
apparently higher prevalence of
mental health problems.34 Evidence
of psychological strains related to
urbanization also comes from
emerging economies: in China,
where the rural population plunged
from 80.6% to 45.2% between 1980
and 2014,35 research finds increased
levels of loneliness both among
migrants moving to cities and in the
rural communities they have left.36
The latest official data in the United
Kingdom point to an increase to
22% in 2017 in the proportion of
people feeling lonely either
sometimes, often or always, up from
an average of 17% in 2014–16.37
The proportion of people never
feeling lonely decreased from 33%
to 23% over the same period. A US

study looked at how many close
friends people have: the average fell
from 2.9 in 1985 to 2.1 in 2004, and
the proportion of people responding
that they had no close friends
tripled over that period to become
the modal response.38
Research suggests that people
who describe themselves as lonely
have as much social capital as
their non-lonely peers.39 One of
the behavioural patterns linked to
loneliness is poorer sleep quality,
which has knock-on effects on
individuals’ wider resilience.40 There
are early signs that the potential
societal impacts of rising loneliness
are beginning to be recognized as a
problem requiring attention—in early
2018, the United Kingdom added
loneliness to the remit of one of its
government ministers.

Technology,
addiction and
empathy
In one recent study, technology
was cited as a major cause of
loneliness and social isolation by
58% of survey respondents in
the United States and 50% in the
United Kingdom.41 However, the
same survey found that social
media was viewed as making it
easier for people to “connect with
others in a meaningful way”, and
respondents who reported feeling
lonely were no more likely than
others to use social media. These
findings exemplify the uncertainty
around how technological changes
impact individual well-being.
Technological change is always
a source of stress, but the
current wave of change—the
Fourth Industrial Revolution—
is defined by the blurring of the
line between the human and
the technological.
Debate, for example, surrounds
the claimed addictiveness of digital
technologies.42 UK research in
mid-2018 found that people spend
an average of 24 hours per week
online—more than twice as much
as in 2011.43 At least one
prominent endocrinologist has
likened digital technologies to
addictive substances—in that they
stimulate dopamine, which
produces pleasure, but also
require increasing use to get the

38

The Global Risks Report 2019

same effect.44 Many business
models rely on the efficiency with
which new technologies can attract
and retain users’ attention; some
companies have even marketed
their ability to leverage the
behavioural impact of dopamine.45
However, others argue that claims
of addictiveness are alarmist or
overblown:46 the UK research
found people still spend less
time online than they do
watching television.
Researchers looking at early
child development are worried
less by addiction than risks of
“functional impairment”—that
digital technologies could crowd
out interpersonal interactions that
provide the building blocks for
subsequent development, such
as the ability to “concentrate,
prioritize, and learn to control
passing impulses”.47 The American

Academy of Pediatrics now
recommends that children up
to 18 months old use screens only
for video chats, and a limit for
children up to 5 years old of one
hour of “high quality” programming,
watched with a parent.48
Among adolescents, a study of
more than 500,000 US school
students found those who spent
more time on digital media—
relative to non-digital activities such
as sports, in-person interactions,
homework, printed media or
religious services—were more likely
to report mental health issues.49
Critics contest these findings,
particularly for moderate levels of
screen time. They also note that
even with high levels of screen time
the effects remain small compared
to, for example, missing breakfast
or not getting enough sleep.50

monitoring and
workplace stress

Another potential concern is that
technology is leading to a decline in
empathy, the ability to put oneself
in the shoes of another. One study
of students in the United States
found that levels of empathy had
fallen by 48% between 1979
and 2009;51 however, possible
explanations for this other than
the greater use of personal
technologies include increasing
materialism and changes in
parenting practices. Debate
often centres on how digital echochambers can weaken crosssociety empathy by anchoring individuals in tight-knit sub-groups.
Other technologies also play a
role—such as online dating
platforms leading to sorting
and matching processes that
researchers find are reducing
cross-cutting societal bonds.52

The relationship between
technology and empathy seems
to be nuanced: online connections
can be empathetic, but research
suggests the effect is six times
weaker than for real-world
interactions.53 Some believe virtual
reality (VR) technologies will
become an “engine for empathy”.54
Others note, for example, that
current online gaming is negatively
correlated with empathy,55 which
might suggest that more immersive
VR versions of similar games would
strengthen the negative effect.
Some suggest that emotionally
responsive robots could tackle
loneliness, particularly in carerelated settings. But this is not
without potential risks—we
consider potential dangers in
Future Shocks, on page 73.56

Technological and societal change is
linked to rapid transformations in the
workplace—and what happens
at work has the potential to affect
emotional and psychological
well-being.57 According to a survey
of full-time employees in 155
countries, just 15% feel “highly
involved in and enthusiastic about
their work”.58 This “engagement”
rate varies from 33% in the United
States to just 6% across East Asia,
a result the researchers attribute to
overwork. Globally, a higher proportion of employees—18%—were
found to be actively disengaged,
defined as “resentful and acting out
their unhappiness”.59
For many workers, a pronounced
recent change has been a blurring
of the line dividing work from the
rest of life.60 Work-related emails
often begin long before the start
of nominal working hours and finish
long afterwards. Many families
juggle multiple jobs with childcare,
stressful commuting logistics and
caring for elderly parents. In
growing numbers, employees
cite the ability to manage work/life
balance as the most important
thing for thriving at work.61
According to one study, 50% of
American workers say they are

The Global Risks Report 2019

39

No amount of law or regulation will overcome
a lack of empathy
“often or always exhausted due to
work”, up by almost a third in 20
years.62 In another study, when UK
workers were asked to identify the
main workplace causes of stress,
half cited unrealistic time pressure
and demands. The same study
noted employees’ concern about
lack of consultation on workplace
changes (31%) and lack of control
over the work they do (27%).63
Automation has long been a
source of disruption in the
workplace. It has allowed huge
numbers of employees to move
up the value chain and escape
monotonous and dangerous tasks,
but as far back as 1959 the World
Health Organization was noting
adverse psychological impacts not
just of automation but even of the
prospect of automation.64
Research published in 2018
suggests that, in the United States,
a 10% increase in the likelihood of
being affected by automation is
associated with decreases in
physical and mental health of
0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.65
Technology is also making it
easier for employers to monitor
workers; some suggest the level
of “anticipatory conformity” this
can encourage amounts to a
surrogate form of automation.66

40

The Global Risks Report 2019

One of the sectors in which
concerns about automation and
monitoring have become most
prominent is online retailing, where
the level of efficiency with which
warehouses in particular can
now operate has led to numerous
reports of productivity targets
causing physical and psychological
strain among workers. However,
workplace monitoring can actually
reduce output if workers perceive it
as an indication of distrust.67 Loss
of privacy due to monitoring may
have a similar effect: a study in a
Chinese factory found that workers
shielded from monitoring by a
curtain were 10–15% more
productive than their peers.68
Conversely, in a study of US
restaurants where monitoring
was being used to deter employee
theft, large increases in weekly
revenues were recorded—the
result of unexpected improvements
in levels customer service.69
Wider changes in the structure of
work and in its place in society are
a further source of potential stress.
Job security and stability are in
decline in many advanced
economies, with real earnings
growth sluggish or stagnating and
less predictable “gig economy”
work expanding. In many lowincome countries, meanwhile,
secure and stable employment

has always been the exception:
for example, 70% of employment
in Sub-Saharan Africa is classified
as “vulnerable” by the International
Labour Organization.70
Evidence from the workplace
reinforces concerns about growing
problems with mental health. In the
United Kingdom, an independent
review found that while sicknessrelated absences overall fell by
more than 15% between 2009
and 2017, absences related to
mental health problems increased
by 5%.71 Of course, not all mental
health problems recorded in the
workplace are caused in the
workplace—but employers and
regulators ought to ensure that
workplace conditions are not
triggering or exacerbating
problems. The UK review
recommended revising health
and safety provisions to take
greater account of mental as
well as physical well-being.
In the 19th century, physical
health and safety rules and
practices reshaped work in many
industrializing economies. In the
21st century, mental health and
safety rules and practices could
play an analogous role by ensuring
that workplace conditions are
appropriate for an increasingly
knowledge-based economy.

Why well-being
matters
This chapter has focused on some
of the drivers leading to increased
individual harm and distress. The
chapter considered societal,
technological and workplace trends,
but could equally have examined
how other transformations are linked
to declining well-being, from political
uncertainty to demographic change
and environmental disruption.
Individual harms matter in
themselves, but they can also
feed into wider systemic risks and
challenges. For example, there are

huge economic costs. Research
by the World Economic Forum
and the Harvard School of Public
Health suggests that the global
economic impact of mental
disorders in 2010 was US$2.5
trillion, with indirect costs (lost
productivity, early retirement and
so on) outstripping direct costs
(diagnosis and treatment) by
a ratio of around 2:1.72
Beyond the economic risks, there
are potential political and societal
implications. For example, a world
of increasingly angry people would
be likely to generate volatile
electoral results and to increase
the risk of social unrest. If empathy
were to continue to decline the

risks might be even starker, in
some societies at any rate:
“empathy underwrites all political
systems that aspire to the liberal
condition . . . and no amount of
law or regulation will overcome
a lack of empathy.”73
Internationally, repeated
accusations have been made in
recent years of rival states using
technology to foment angry
fragmentation and polarization.
It is not difficult to imagine such
emotional and psychological
disruptions having serious
diplomatic—and perhaps
even military—consequences.

The Transformation of
Biological Risks

REUTERS/Yves Herman

The previous chapter looked at the emotional and
psychological impact of the multiple transformations the
world is undergoing. This chapter considers another
set of threats being shaped by global transformations:
biological pathogens. Changes in how we live have

increased the risk of a devastating outbreak occurring
naturally, while emerging technologies make it increasingly easy for new biological threats to be manufactured
and released—either deliberately or by accident.

The Global Risks Report 2019

45

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

The world is badly under-prepared
for even modest biological threats.
We are vulnerable to potentially
huge impacts on individual lives,
societal well-being, economic
activity and national security.
Revolutionary new biotechnologies
promise miraculous advances,
but they also create daunting
challenges of oversight and control.
Progress has made us complacent
about conventional threats,
but nature remains capable of
“innovating” a pandemic that
would cause untold damage.
The sections that follow examine
the way biological risks are
evolving both in nature and in
laboratories. We are at a critical
juncture. If there is one area in
which a turn inward by societies
could be needlessly destructive,
it is global health security. Yet, as
new risks emerge, there are early
signs that important governance
systems and protocols are eroding.

46

The Global Risks Report 2019

Outbreaks are
increasing
In the past, naturally emerging
infectious diseases have caused
extraordinary health, economic and
security impacts—often assisted
by propitious conditions created
by changing patterns of human
behavior. Many years of global
headlines have made various
threats familiar: Ebola, MERS,
SARS, Zika, yellow fever and
each year’s strains of influenza.
The frequency of disease outbreaks
has been rising steadily. Between
1980 and 2013 there were 12,012
recorded outbreaks, comprising 44
million individual cases and affecting
every country in the world.1 Each
month the World Health Organization
(WHO) tracks 7,000 new signals of
potential outbreaks, generating 300
follow-ups, 30 investigations, and
10 full risk assessments. In June
2018 there were—for the first time

ever—outbreaks of six of the eight
categories of disease in the WHO’s
“priority diseases” list. If any had
spread widely, it would have had the
potential to kill thousands and
create major global disruption.2
Five main trends have been driving
this increase in the frequency of
outbreaks. First, surging levels of
travel, trade and connectivity mean
an outbreak can move from a
remote village to cities around the
world in less than 36 hours.
Second, high-density living, often
in unhygienic conditions, makes
it easier for infectious disease to
spread in cities—and 55% of the
world’s population today lives in
urban areas, a proportion expected
to reach 68% by 2050.3
Third, increasing deforestation is
problematic: tree-cover loss has
been rising steadily over the past
two decades, and is linked to
31% of outbreaks such as Ebola,
Zika and Nipah virus.4 Fourth, the
WHO has pointed to the potential of

climate change to alter and accelerate the transmission patterns of
infectious diseases such as Zika,
malaria and dengue fever.5
Finally, human displacement is a
critical factor in this regard. Whether
due to poverty, conflict, persecution
or emergencies, the movement of
large groups to new locations—
often under poor conditions—
increases displaced populations’
vulnerability to biological threats.
Among refugees, measles, malaria,
diarrheal diseases and acute
respiratory infections together
account for between 60 and 80%
of deaths for which a cause
is reported.6

Fewer deaths,
higher costs
Globalization has made the world
more vulnerable to societal and
economic impacts from infectiousdisease outbreaks, even though
impacts of those outbreaks on
human health are declining because
medical breakthroughs and
advances in public health systems
have enabled us to contain the
effects on morbidity and mortality.7
The 2003 SARS outbreak—which
infected about 8,000 people
and killed 774—cost the global
economy an estimated US$50
billion.8 The 2015 MERS outbreak
in South Korea infected only 200
people and killed 38, but led to
estimated costs of US$8.5 billion.9

Revolutionary new
biotechnologies promise
miraculous advances, but
also daunting challenges
of oversight and control
One estimate of potential
pandemics through the 21st
century puts the annualized
economic costs at US$60 billion.10
Including the imputed value of lifeyears lost, another estimate puts
the cost of pandemic influenza
alone at US$570 billion per year—
the same order of magnitude
as climate change.11
Given that many outbreaks occur in
comparatively poor countries, even
economic costs that may appear low
in absolute terms can have a severe
impact on the countries concerned.
The World Bank has estimated that
the three countries most badly
impacted by Ebola in 2014–15—
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone—
suffered combined GDP losses of
$2.2 billion.12 However, including the
cost of associated social burdens—
direct impacts on health as well
as indirect effects on food security
and employment—that figure
jumps to US$53 billion.13
The relatively low recent death toll
of infectious outbreaks—for
comparison, in 1918 Spanish
Influenza killed more than 50 million
people—can be seen as evidence

of the success of countermeasures: vaccines, antivirals and
antibiotics greatly reduce the risk
of massive loss of life. But another
way of looking at the outbreaks
since 2000 is as a “roll call of
near-miss catastrophes”, which
should be prompting increased
vigilance but is instead lulling us
into complacency.14

Preparedness gaps
The WHO has begun to caution
against such complacency. In 2015
it introduced a “priority diseases”
list, reviewed annually. The purpose
of the list is not to forecast which
pathogen is most likely to cause
the next outbreak, but to highlight
where increased research and
development is most warranted. In
2018 the WHO included “Disease
X” in its list to focus researchers’
attention on pandemic risks posed
by diseases that cannot currently
be transmitted to humans, or
transmitted only inefficiently.
The priority diseases exercise
builds on work that saw the first

effective vaccine against Ebola
developed in 12 months, rather
than the normal development
cycle of 5–10 years. The estimated
costs of developing vaccines for
other key diseases greatly exceeds
the resources currently devoted
to such work. One 2018 study
assessed the minimum cost of
developing a vaccine for each of
11 infectious diseases previously
highlighted by the WHO at between US$2.8 and 3.7 billion.15 By
contrast, the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI),
set up in 2017 to coordinate and
finance vaccine development, has
committed to invest just US$1
billion by 2021.16
The weakness of basic
preparedness in individual
countries is an important obstacle
to pandemic responses. Progress
has been made, particularly since
the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic, but
most countries have not yet reached
minimum international standards
of capacity to detect, assess,
report and respond to acute public
health threats as set out in binding
regulations that took effect in 2007.17
Thus when an outbreak hits,
appropriate responses may be
absent or delayed, and resources
will be stretched to deal with other
epidemic events that may emerge.

A pattern of panic and neglect
tends to affect pandemic
preparedness. During and after
every major outbreak, leaders
are quick to call for increased
investment in preparedness. Real
progress often follows these calls—
but as the effects of the outbreak
fade, neglect sets in again until a
new outbreak erupts; this prompts
a new burst of panic, in which time
and energy may be wasted on
unnecessary and potentially
costly measures. For example,
throughout the 2014–16 Ebola
epidemic, the WHO advised that
general travel restrictions were
unnecessary but still registered
41 instances of restrictions being
placed on international travel.18
Our ability to respond to biological
risks is also being hampered
by carelessness. Misuse and
overuse of antibiotics continues
to undermine the efficacy of one
of the most important medical
countermeasures ever discovered.
Similarly, an erosion of vaccine
norms is leading to a resurgence
of older biological threats that were
thought to have been defeated:
for example, incidents of measles—
which pose a serious threat for
babies, toddlers and young
people—are increasing across
Europe because vaccination

coverage rates are falling as a result
of unfounded safety concerns.19

Synthetic biology is
amplifying risks
Synthetic biology technologies have
the potential to transform the risk
landscape. The possible gains
are profound—they include new
ways of producing chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, fuels and
electronics—but so is the risk of
things going badly wrong. The skills
and equipment required to replicate
and alter the building blocks of life
are proliferating rapidly. Driven by
scientific advances and market
forces, the cost of DNA synthesis
has decreased at a rate faster than
Moore’s Law: more and more
people around the world have
access to powerful biotechnologies
that were once accessible only to
well-established and well-funded
scientists.20 A state-of-the-art DNA
synthesis facility can already be built
in a space the size of a shipping
container, and miniaturization is
advancing rapidly—enzymatic DNA
synthesis can now be accomplished
with a desktop device.21 Carrying
out this kind of work does not create
any external “signature” that would
distinguish a facility synthesizing

Outbreaks since 2000 have been described
as a “roll call of near-miss catastrophes”

DNA from one performing other
biological work.
It is possible now for a small
research team to conduct
experiments with potentially
profound global consequences.
For example, in 2018 a group
of researchers in Canada
demonstrated that a budget of
US$100,000 is enough to synthesize
horsepox virus. Horsepox is benign
to humans, but a close relative
is Variola major, which causes
smallpox—a disease that was
eradicated in 1980, having killed
300 million people since 1900.
Live samples of smallpox virus now
exist in just two highly secure
facilities, one in the United States
and one in Russia.
By publishing the synthesis process
for horsepox virus, the Canadian
research team sharply lowered
the barriers to smallpox synthesis
and increased the risk of smallpox
being released into the world, either
accidentally or intentionally. The
researchers argue that these risks
of their work are outweighed by the
potential benefits of creating a new
vaccine.22
This is not an isolated dilemma.
The H5N1 strain of influenza, for
example, has a staggering case
fatality rate of above 50%; by
comparison, the fatality rate for
Spanish Influenza in 1918 was under
2.5%, and for seasonal influenza
it is less than 0.1%. Human cases
of H5N1 are rare, in part because
the virus is inefficient at transmitting

from person to person. If that were
to change, a pandemic risk greater
than any previously encountered
could result. In 2011, researchers
studied H5N1 transmissibility with
the aim of enabling more rapid
responses to new variants. The
research was controversial—
biosecurity experts worried that it
could lead to a highly transmissible
virus being released into human
populations, by accident or as a
deliberately deployed bio-weapon.23

Deliberate attacks
Received wisdom is that biological
agents are an unattractive weapon,
in part because of the perceived
risks involved in their production,
and also because of the difficulty
of targeting particular groups or
populations. But this is not an
area for complacency. A report
commissioned last year by the US
Department of Defense highlights
the “almost limitless list of malicious
activities that could potentially be
pursued with biology” and draws
parallels with the importance of
advances in physics and chemistry
during the Cold War.24
State-sponsored development of
biological weapons has broadly
ceased since the Biological
Weapons Convention (BWC)
entered into force in 1975. However,
the BWC has weaknesses. First, it is
plagued by financial woes, struggling
even to sustain a modest meeting
programme.25 Second, the only

mechanism for demonstrating
compliance is a system of annual
“confidence-building measures”—
but no more than half the signatories
submit such measures in any given
year, and a third have never done
so. Third, the BWC has limited
application to cutting-edge
research—a growing problem, given
revolutionary biological advances.26
Even if restraint on the part of
state actors could be guaranteed,
biological weapons still have
attractions for malicious non-state
actors. The current state of
microbial forensics would make
it difficult to reliably attribute a
biological attack, and the impact
could be incalculable: the direct
effects—fatalities and injuries—
would be compounded by
potentially grave societal and
political disruption.
In contrast to other types of
terrorist attack, which require
resources that are difficult to
scale and replenish, the technical
knowledge required to launch a
catastrophic biological attack can
be deployed repeatedly once it is
mastered. This potential to “reload”
creates the potential for successive
high-impact attacks. According
to one expert, this means that the
national security vulnerabilities
revealed by the 9/11 terrorist
attacks in the United States were
smaller than those revealed by
the series of “anthrax letters” that
killed five people in the weeks that
followed.27 In June 2018, German
police intercepted a potential

biological attack when an arrest
led to the discovery of 84
milligrams of the poison ricin.28
Responses that would work
against a natural pandemic
might not be as effective against
a deliberate attack, given such
an attack’s military and political
dimensions and the lack of reliable
governing frameworks.29 For
example, states might be reticent
about sending resources and
personnel to assist other countries
if they perceive a risk of being
affected themselves by any
subsequent attacks.

50

The Global Risks Report 2019

The potential impact of a deliberate
attack was highlighted last year by
a pandemic preparedness exercise
in the United States. This involved
a war-gaming scenario in which a
terrorist group released a virus that
had been modified to combine a
high case fatality rate with ease of
transmission.30 The results? A failed
vaccine, tens of millions of deaths,
incapacitated governments, overwhelmed healthcare systems and
stock markets down by 90%.31 This
may have been a hypothetical
scenario, but it is not in the realm
of science fiction.

Governance
challenges
Current governance systems risk
creating the conditions for
bioterrorism. Scientists often
take the lead, developing selfgovernance frameworks to define
acceptable limits for synthetic
biology research. For example,
DNA synthesis companies have
developed new systems to screen
orders for synthesized DNA to
look for potential indications
of malicious intent. However,
screening is voluntary; it does

not apply in many countries; and
screening standards, technologies
and incentives have not kept pace
with the rapid evolution of DNA
synthesis technologies and
business models. More rigorous
transparency and oversight
requirements are needed, as well
as stronger norms applying to
work that might increase
pandemic risks.
In another example of selfgovernance, in 2015 the National
Academy of Sciences of the United
States, the Institute of Medicine,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences
and the Royal Society of London
convened scientists to consider the
future of germline editing, which
changes the DNA that is passed on
from generation to generation. The
group issued a recommendation
against performing germline editing
on human embryos.32 However,
this kind of recommendation is
difficult to enforce and researchers
in China subsequently used
CRISPR to correct a mutation in
nonviable human embryos.33 Some
top-tier journals refused to publish
this research, in part on ethical
grounds, but that has not
prevented further work in this
area. In November last year the
dividing line between technology
and humanity was further blurred
when a researcher in China
claimed to have created the first
gene-modified babies, twin girls
whose genomes had been altered
to make them resistant to HIV.34

The challenges of regulating
synthetic biology will intensify
as mutually reinforcing advances
are made across the various
technologies that make up the
Fourth Industrial Revolution. For
example, machine learning can
identify which influenza mutations
would prove most deadly.35 The
rationale for this research was to
enable more efficient outbreak
responses, but machine learning
could equally be deployed to
help a hostile actor build a better
biological weapon. Work is also
being done at the intersection
of artificial intelligence and gene
editing, with consequences that
are uncertain—not only practically
but ethically too.36 While continued
innovation must be encouraged,
too little attention has so far been
paid to emerging risks of highimpact events.
The challenge of establishing norms
that can be enforced globally is
exacerbated by geo-economic
competition across advanced
technologies, as discussed in
Chapter 2 (Power and Values).
But the field of synthetic biology is
still young enough for norms and
practices to be put in place that will
steer its development in the years
and decades ahead. There is an
analogy with the internet: with
hindsight, a much stronger security
focus could have been incorporated
in its building blocks at an early
stage. Cybersecurity experts see
a similar opportunity in synthetic
biology today.

Governance challenges also
exist in relation to “conventional”
pandemic preparedness, despite
advances such as the establishment
of a Global Preparedness Monitoring
Board and a Pandemic Emergency
Financing Facility.37 The WHO’s
Contingency Fund for Emergencies,
established in 2015 to enable rapid
responses to disease outbreaks and
health crises, is funded at only onethird of its annual US$100 million
target. The international system for
sharing biological samples, vital for
disease surveillance and response,
appears to have been weakened
since the introduction of the Nagoya
Protocol. This is an agreement on
“access and benefit sharing” that
has been interpreted to give states
greater rights over virus samples
collected on their territory.38 It has
revived concerns in some countries
about samples being used to create
vaccines generating benefits that are
not fairly shared.39
Negotiations around access and
benefits have already delayed
responses to novel outbreaks
and even started to complicate
the exchange of seasonal influenza
samples. It would be dangerous
if differences between countries
were not swiftly and equitably
resolved: in few areas is apolitical
commitment to open and
collaborative exchange as
crucial as in global health security.

Preparing Cities for
Sea-Level Rise

REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco

Rapidly growing cities are making more people vulnerable
to rising sea levels. Two-thirds of the global population is
expected to live in cities by 2050. Already an estimated
800 million people in more than 570 coastal cities are
vulnerable to a sea-level rise of 0.5 metres by 2050.1

disruption, but it also exacerbates those risks—for example,
by destroying natural sources of resilience such as coastal
mangroves and increasing the strain on groundwater
reserves. The risks of rising sea levels are often compounded
by storm surges and increased rainfall intensity.

In a vicious circle, urbanization not only concentrates
people and property in areas of potential damage and

Some cities and countries started
decades ago to put strategies in
place to deal with accelerating
sea-level rise. In the last 20 years,
approaches have shifted notably
towards supplementing “hard”
engineering strategies with greater
promotion of more “soft” naturebased approaches. In many cities,
however, preparations are lagging
and the need to take action is
increasingly urgent.
The following sections set out the
latest projections for sea-level rise,
assess which parts of the world are
likely to be hardest hit, and look at
the potential impacts on human
populations and urban infrastructure.
The chapter then considers the
adaptation strategies being pursued
in a number of cities, highlighting the
growing prevalence of holistic
approaches to flood resilience.

Rising sea levels
If global warming continues at its
current rate, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
considers it likely that the rise in
atmospheric temperature will reach
1.5°C degrees within the next
35 years.2 Forestalling this will
require unprecedented action to
drive decarbonization of agriculture,
energy, industry and transport.3 It
appears increasingly unlikely that the
world will meet even the 2°C upper
limit identified by the Paris Climate
Agreement.4 The current trajectory
is towards a rise of around 3.2°C.5

56

The Global Risks Report 2019

As global temperatures have
increased, so sea levels have risen
at an accelerating rate. According
to the IPCC, the mean sea-level rise
between 1901 and 2010 was
1.7 millimetres per year (mm/y).
Between 1993 and 2010 it was
3.2 mm/y. Global sea levels will
continue to rise through the 21st
century and beyond, owing to
increased oceanic warming and
loss of glaciers and ice sheets.
According to the IPCC, a 2°C
increase will cause sea levels to
rise between 0.30 metres and
0.93 metres by 2100.6 Other
research suggests this rise could
be as much as 2 metres even with
warming below 2°C.7 Beyond 2100,
it could eventually reach 6 metres.8
The uncertainty is due to the
complex nature of the interaction of
atmospheric warming, oceanic
warming and ice-sheet responses:
for example, the collapse of the
West Antarctic Ice Sheet could push
up sea levels by 3.3 metres.9
Global averages tell only part of the
story. Sea-level rise will also vary
regionally and locally: ice loss in the
Antarctic, for example, is expected
to have a disproportionate impact
in the northern hemisphere, where
most of the world’s coastal cities
are located.10 Estimates suggest
that 90% of coastal areas will
experience above-average rise,11
with differentials of up to 30%
relative to the mean.12
Relative sea-level rise will be even
higher in the many cities that are
sinking because of factors that

include groundwater extraction
and the growing weight of urban
sprawl. Some cites are sinking faster
than sea levels are rising: in parts of
Jakarta, for example, ground level
has sunk by 2.5 metres in the past
decade.13 In addition, sea-level rise
amplifies the impact of storm
surges, as it takes a smaller surge
to produce the same extreme
water level.

Estimates
suggest
that 90%
of coastal
areas will
experience
aboveaverage rise

Uncertainties surround the precise
interactions of regional sea-level rise
and patterns of urban demography
and development. However, it is
clear that Asia will be the worstaffected region as a result of a
combination of hydrology,
population density and asset
concentration.14 Asia is home to fourfifths of the people who are
expected to be flooded if there is
a 3°C rise in global temperatures.15
China alone has more than
78 million people in low-elevation

cities, a number increasing
by 3% each year.16
The World Bank notes that 70% of
the largest cities in Europe have
areas vulnerable to rising sea
levels.17 Africa has at least 19
vulnerable coastal cities with a
population of more than 1 million,
including Abidjan, Accra,
Alexandria, Algiers, Casablanca,
Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Douala,
Durban, Lagos, Luanda, Maputo,
Port Elizabeth and Tunis.18 In the
United States, East Coast cities
including Norfolk, Baltimore,
Charleston, and Miami have
already experienced “sunny day”
flooding due to the rising sea
levels.19 One study suggests that a
sea-level rise of 0.9 metres by 2100
would expose 4.2 million people to
flooding, while a rise of 1.8 metres
over the same period would affect
13.1 million people—equivalent to
4% of the current population.20
Deltas are home to more than
two-thirds of the world’s largest
cities and 340 million people.21
These delta cities are particularly
vulnerable to land subsidence.
Relative sea-level rise poses the
highest risks for the Krishna
(India), Ganges-Brahmaputra
(Bangladesh) and Brahmani (India)
deltas.22 In Bangladesh, a rise of
0.5 metres would result in a loss
of about 11% of the country’s
land, displacing approximately
15 million people.23

Potential damage
Sea-level rise threatens significant
damage to property—not only
homes and businesses but
also public assets and critical
infrastructure, which adds
significant contingent liabilities to
the taxpayer. Research suggests
that economic impacts are highly
concentrated geographically,
where sea-level vulnerabilities
interact with high-value property
and infrastructure. Just four cities
account for 43% of average annual
losses: Guangzhou, Miami, New
Orleans and New York.24 The
researchers note that because
“coastal flood risks are highly
concentrated, flood reduction
actions in a few locations could
be very cost-effective.”25

Existing protection already reduces
these losses significantly. The same
research compares cities’ recorded
average annual losses with their
expected exposure to a 100-year
flood event—that is, a flood with a
severity that would be statistically
expected once every century. The
results vary hugely. For example,
Amsterdam’s exposure to a 100year flood event is more than double
that of Guangzhou—an estimated
US$83 billion versus US$38.5 billion.
But the strength of Amsterdam’s
protection means its average annual
losses to date are just US$3 million,
compared with US$687 million
for Guangzhou.26

In the United States, a study found
that between 2005 and 2017 sealevel rise wiped US$14.1 billion off
home values in Connecticut,
Florida, Georgia, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Virginia.27 In developing
countries, the threat to property is
often exacerbated by coastal
erosion as rising sea levels, sandmining and built infrastructure
disrupt the flow of coastal sediment.
Some coastal communities in SubSaharan Africa are already being
washed away, losing up to 30–35
metres of land each year, with
thousands more at risk.28
A study by the UK National
Oceanographic Centre projects the
global cost of rising sea levels at
US$14 trillion per year in 2100.29
It found that China would face the
biggest costs in absolute terms,
while as a percentage of GDP the
impacts will be highest for Kuwait
(24%), Bahrain (11%), the United
Arab Emirates (9%) and Viet
Nam (7%).30

Various forms of infrastructure and
economic activity are at risk from
rising sea levels:
Roads: A study of coastal roads
on the US East Coast estimates
that high tide flooding already
causes 100 million vehicle-hours
of delay every year, which could
rise to 3.4 billion hours by 2100.31
Railways: Researchers predict
that a 4.5 kilometre stretch of
coastal railway in the United
Kingdom would be disrupted
on 84 days each year with a
0.55 metre sea-level rise, and
the line would cost hundreds of
millions of pounds to divert.32
Ports: The World Bank has
identified 24 port cities in the
Middle East and 19 in North
Africa at particular risk of sealevel rise.33 Rising sea levels
will lead to a greater frequency
of disruptive events such as
Hurricane Florence, which closed
North Carolina’s port to trucks for
10 days in September 2018.34
Internet: In the United States,
more than 4,000 miles of underground fibre optic cable and
1,100 nodes are projected to be
underwater within 15 years, with
New York, Miami and Seattle at
greatest risk.35 Unlike submarine
internet cables, these are not
designed to be waterproof.
Sanitation: A 2018 study found
that in the United States, a sealevel rise of just 30 centimetres

58

The Global Risks Report 2019

will expose 60 wastewater
treatment plants, which serve
more than 4.1 million people.36
Water treatment facilities in
Benin and other countries in
West Africa are already
threatened by the sea.37
Drinking water: Pollution of
aquifers will be exacerbated by
declines in streamflow: by the
2050s, more than 650 million
people in 500 cities are projected
to face declines in freshwater
availability of at least 10%.38
As rivers and streams contain
some groundwater, salination
could also affect surfacelevel fresh water.
Energy: The C40 Cities initiative
has identified 270 power plants
that are vulnerable to a sea-level
rise of 0.5 metres; these plants
provide power to 450 million
people mostly in Asia, Europe,
and the east coast of North
America.39
Tourism: In many cities, coastal
areas are a source of revenue
from tourism and business. In
Egypt, for example, the IPCC
has estimated that a 0.5 metre
rise in sea levels would destroy
Alexandria’s beaches, leading to
losses of US$32.5 billion.40
Agriculture: Sea-level rise can
lead to increased salination of
soil and of water sources used
for irrigation, particularly in delta
regions. In Bangladesh, the
World Bank estimates salination

could cause a 15.6% decline in
rice yield.41
In 2017, 18.8 million people were
newly displaced by weather-related
causes, including floods and
coastal storms.42 The intensifying
impact of sea-level rise on coastal
cities and plains will render an
increasing amount of land
uninhabitable or economically
unviable.
This is likely to lead to population
movement within and from large
cities. More people will be crammed
into shrinking tracts of habitable
urban space, and more are likely
to move to other cities, either
domestically or in other countries.
These movements have the
potential to cause spillover risks—
for example, they could result in
heightened strain on food and water
supplies and in increased societal, economic and even security
pressures. According to the World
Bank, climate change could force
86 million people in Sub-Saharan
Africa, 40 million in South Asia
and 17 million in Latin America
to permanently relocate
internally by 2050.43

Coastal adaptation
Cities faced with the risk of
damage from rising sea levels can
adapt either by trying to keep water
out or learning to live with water
at higher levels. Some strategies
and technologies are new, but the

REUTERS/Amit Dave

basic idea is not: “[C]oastal
societies have a long history of
adapting to environmental change
and local sea-level rise because
coasts are amongst the most
dynamic environments on Earth.
For example, a number of coastal
megacities in river deltas have
experienced, and adapted to,
relative sea-level rise of several
metres caused by land subsidence
during the twentieth century.”44
There are three main strategies.
The first involves “hard” engineering
projects to keep water out of cities,
such as sea walls, storm-surge
barriers, water pumps and overflow
chambers. The second involves
nature-based defences—for
example, conserving or restoring
mangroves and salt marshes—or
seeking to shape how floods will
affect cities, rather than always
trying to prevent them. The third
strategy involves people—for

example, moving households and
businesses to safer ground, or
investing in social capital to make
flood-risk communities more
resilient. An appropriate mix of
coastal adaptation measures
can potentially “reduce some
coastal impacts by several orders
of magnitude.”45
The Netherlands is at the forefront
of coastal adaptation because of
its existential exposure to rising sea
levels—two-thirds of the country
is vulnerable to flooding. The
importance of water management
is recognized in the country’s
administrative structures—regional
water boards levy their own taxes
for flood protection rather than
depending on government.46
The Netherlands pursues a mix
of the three strategies. Its highly
developed hard infrastructure
includes an extensive system
of dikes and the world’s largest

Spending

recovery is
almost nine
times higher
than on
prevention
storm-surge barrier. However,
inland floods in the early 1990s,
in which 200,000 people were
evacuated, led to a shift of
approach. Instead of continuing
to build ever-higher dikes—which
means greater damage is done
if they are breached—the “room
for the river” programme lowered
some dikes to allow farmland to
be inundated in flood events to
protect towns. Farmhouses in
affected areas were demolished

The Global Risks Report 2019

59

and families moved to new homes
built on artificially created mounds,
8 metres high.47
In Rotterdam—where 90% of land
is beneath sea level—a programme
called “the Sand Engine” involved
dredging sediment from the North
Sea and depositing it off the city’s
shore to prevent waves from
eroding the coastline.48 Rotterdam
is also home to numerous urban
water innovations, such as floating
houses and city squares designed
to collect millions of litres of water
in flood conditions.

Managed retreat
Like the Netherlands, China’s
approach to flood management
changed in the 1990s in response
to major flooding. The 1998
Yangtze River Basin floods killed

60

The Global Risks Report 2019

4,000 people and prompted a
shift away from reliance on hard
infrastructure projects. Naturebased measures were prioritized
and more than 2 million people
were relocated to higher ground.49
However, the rapid pace of
urbanization has continued to
increase flooding risks in many
coastal areas by destroying natural
flood defences: in Shenzhen, for
example, around 70% of mangrove
coverage has been destroyed.50 In
2015 a new “sponge city” initiative
was launched to offset this process
by introducing urban features such
as permeable pavements, new
wetland areas and green roofs; the
30 cities in the programme include
Shanghai, which is particularly
vulnerable to sea-level rise. The
target is for 80% of urban land to
be able to absorb or re-use 70%
of stormwater by 2030.51

Many cities and countries have
struggled to cope with the
mounting challenges posed by
rising sea levels. In Indonesia,
Jakarta is building a massive sea
wall—with Dutch help—and has
also launched a five-year project
to relocate around 400,000 people
away from riverbanks and
reservoirs under threat from rising
sea levels.52 However, some critics
argue that the authorities should
also be doing more to prevent the
city from sinking.53 This debate
over the right course of action
highlights the institutional complexity
of getting flood management right:
often success depends on legacy
infrastructure issues that are hugely
expensive to resolve. Jakarta’s
system of water pipes reaches only
one-third of residents, leaving twothirds reliant on the groundwater
extraction that is weakening the
city’s foundations.54

In Thailand, Bangkok is low lying
and sinking, its natural coastal
defences have been eroded, and
the nearby Gulf of Thailand is rising
faster than the global average.55
Bangkok’s surface area is also one
of the world’s most impervious—it
averages just 3.3 square metres
of green space per resident,
compared with 66 square metres in
Singapore.56 Extreme weather
patterns are intensifying, leaving the
city vulnerable to rising sea levels
from the south and increasingly
severe monsoon rains from the
north.57 The government’s response
includes constructing a 2,600
kilometre canal network, as well as a
central park that can drain 4 million
litres into underground containers.58
In 2011, severe flooding in Bangkok
prompted some authorities to
suggest moving the capital city.59
The idea of “managed retreat” is
likely to become an increasingly

familiar feature of adaptation plans
as sea levels rise and extreme
weather intensifies. One study
identifies 27 cases across
22 countries that have already
occurred.60 Elsewhere, plans are in
preparation. The Maldives intends
to build artificial islands, fortified
with 3 metre high sea walls and
financed by renting out islands and
boosting tourism.61 In the Pacific
Ocean, Kiribati has purchased
land in Fiji as a potential new home
for its citizens. And in the United
States, US$48 million has been
allocated to relocate the entire
community of the Isle de Jean
Charles in Louisiana, which has
lost 98% of its land since 1955.62
The complex task of resettling
these residents while keeping their
sense of community will serve as a
test case for the future.

No time to waste
As sea levels rise and urban
vulnerabilities increase, the
urgency of the need to respond to
these changes is going to intensify.
Beyond adaptation measures,
addressing urban vulnerability
to sea-level rise will require
households, businesses and
governments to avoid exacerbating
dangers. There is little point putting
new flood defences in place, for
example, if existing defences are
undermined through continued
development of homes and
businesses in coastal areas and
on floodplains.
The affordability of flood resilience
is set to become an increasingly
important issue. Robust risk
financing strategies will be
required, both to fund investment

in adaptation and to pay for
recovery when floods occur. At
present, spending on recovery is
almost nine times higher than on
prevention.63 Turning that around
will not be easy: building support
for pre-emptive spending and action—particularly if it involves major
disruptions such as relocation—
can take many years of dialogue
and planning. There is no time
to waste.
As adaptation becomes more
costly, questions of burden-sharing
will arise—for example, between
the public and private sectors, and
between municipal and national
authorities. Burden-sharing may
also be needed between countries.
Failure to prepare for sea-level rise
will create cross-border spillovers,
and some of the cities most at
risk are in countries that may
struggle to find the resources to
adapt. Innovative and collaborative
approaches may be needed to
ensure that action is taken globally
before it is too late.

As the world becomes more complex and interconnected, incremental change is giving way to the
instability of feedback loops, threshold effects and cascading disruptions. Sudden and dramatic
breakdowns—future shocks—become more likely. In this section, we present 10 such potential
future shocks. Some are more speculative than others; some build on risks that have already
begun to crystallize. These are not predictions. They are food for thought and action—what are the
possible future shocks that could fundamentally disrupt or destabilize your world, and what can
you do to prevent them?

TOOLS STOKES GEOPOLITICAL
TENSIONS

Weather manipulation tools—
such as cloud seeding to induce
or suppress rain—are not new,
but deploying them at scale
is becoming easier and more
affordable. As the impacts of
climate-related changes in weather
patterns intensify, the incentives
to turn to technological fixes will
increase in affected areas. Think
of governments trying to manage
simultaneous declines in rainfall and
increases in water demand.
Aside from the potential
environmental consequences, at
a time of increasing geopolitical
tensions even well-intentioned
weather manipulation might be
viewed as hostile. Perceptions
would be paramount: a
neighbouring state might see largescale cloud-seeding as theft of rain
or the reason for a drought. Cloudseeding planes might be viewed
as dual-use tools for espionage.
Hostile uses are prohibited, but
cannot be ruled out—for example,
weather manipulation tools could
be used to disrupt a neighbour’s
agriculture or military planning.
And if states decided unilaterally to
use more radical geo-engineering
technologies it could trigger
dramatic climatic disruptions.
As technologies evolve and
deployment increases, increased
transparency—about who is
using what, and why—would help
limit destabilizing ambiguity. So
too would active discussion and
collaboration on environmental
vulnerabilities, both bilaterally
between bordering states and
on wider regional and global
multilateral platforms.

When the huge resources being
devoted to quantum research lead
to large-scale quantum computing,
many of the tools that form the
basis of current digital cryptography
will be rendered obsolete. Public
key algorithms, in particular, will
be effortlessly crackable. Quantum
also promises new modes of
encryption, but by the time new
protections have been put in place
many secrets may already have
been lost to prying criminals,
states and competitors.

QUANTUM COMPUTING RENDERS
CURRENT CRYPTOGRAPHY OBSOLETE

A collapse of cryptography
would take with it much of the
scaffolding of digital life. These
technologies are at the root of
online authentication, trust and
even personal identity. They keep
secrets—from sensitive personal
information to confidential
corporate and state data—safe.
And they keep fundamental
services running, from email
communication to banking
and commerce. If all this
breaks down, the disruption
and the cost could be massive.
As the prospect of quantum
code-breaking looms closer, a
transition to new alternatives—
such as lattice-based and hashbased cryptography—will gather
pace. Some may even revert to
low-tech solutions, taking sensitive
information offline and relying
on in-person exchanges. But
historical data will be vulnerable
too. If I steal your conventionally
encrypted data now, I can bide
my time until quantum advances
help me to access it, regardless
of any stronger precautions you
subsequently put in place.

WIDENING GULF BETWEEN URBAN
AND RURAL AREAS REACHES
A TIPPING POINT

The world’s political geography
is being transformed by surging
migration from rural to urban areas,
straining the web of connections
between the two. Divergences are
widening on numerous dimensions,
such as values, age, education,
power and prosperity. What if a
tipping point is reached at which
the urban-rural divide becomes
so sharp that the unity of states
begins to erode?
Domestically, divergent values
between urban and rural areas
are already fuelling polarization
and electoral volatility in many
countries. Greater bitterness
and rivalry could lead to localized
nativism and even violent clashes.
Separatist movements might break
through in wealthy city-regions
that resent diverting revenues to
poorer rural areas with which they
feel diminishing affinity. Leading
cities might look to bypass national
structures and play an international
role directly. Economically,
accelerating urban migration could
lead to rural depopulation and the
decline of local economies, with
potential food security implications
in some countries.
Better long-term planning—for
both expanding cities and rural
areas at risk of decline—might help
to mitigate these dangers. Stronger
transport and communications links
could help to soften the urban-rural
divide. Resources will be needed,
which might require more fiscal
creativity, such as finding ways to
decentralize revenue-raising
powers or more widely redistribute
the productivity gains that
urbanization generates.

With climate change placing
growing strain on the global food
system, and with international
tensions already heightened, the
risk of geopolitically motivated
food-supply disruptions increases.
Worsening trade wars might spill
over into high-stakes threats to
disrupt food or agricultural
supplies. Conflict affecting
supply-chain chokepoints could
lead to disruption of domestic
and cross-border flows of food.
At the extreme, state or non-state
actors could target the crops of an
adversary state, for example with a
clandestine biological attack.

In these circumstances, retaliatory
dynamics could swiftly take hold.
Domestically, rationing might
be needed. Hoarding and theft
could undermine the social order.
Widespread famine risk in recent
years suggests that greater
hunger and more deaths—in
least-developed countries, at any
rate—might not trigger a major
international reaction. If similar
suffering were inflicted on more
powerful countries, the responses
would be swift and severe.
More resilient trade and
humanitarian networks would help
to limit the impact of food supply
disruption. But if trade wars were a
contributing factor, then countries
might seek greater self-sufficiency
in food production and agriculture.
In some advanced economies, this
might require rebuilding skills that
have been allowed to fade in recent
decades. Agricultural diversification
and the development of moreresilient crop variants could bolster
national security by reducing
countries’ vulnerability.

BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE ALLOWS
NEW FORMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL

Biometrics are already making
exponential advances—
technologies that were recently
in the realm of science fiction
now shape the reality of billions of
people’s lives. Facial recognition,

gait analysis, digital assistants,
affective computing, microchipping,
digital lip reading, fingerprint
sensors—as these and other
technologies proliferate, we move
into a world in which everything

about us is captured, stored and
subjected to artificial intelligence
(AI) algorithms.
This makes possible increasingly
individualized public and private
services, but also new forms of
conformity and micro-targeted
persuasion. If humans are
increasingly replaced by
machines in crucial decision
loops, the result may lead not
only to greater efficiency but
also to greater societal rigidity.
Global politics will be affected:
authoritarianism is easier in a
world of total visibility and
traceability, while democracy may
turn out to be more difficult—many
societies are already struggling to
balance threats to privacy, trust
and autonomy against promises of
increased security, efficiency and
novelty. Geopolitically, the future
may hinge in part on how societies
with different values treat new
reservoirs of data.
Strong systems of accountability for
governments and companies using
these technologies could help to
mitigate the risks to individuals
from biometric surveillance. This
will be possible in some domestic
contexts, but developing wider
global norms with any traction will
be a struggle.

A range of compounding factors
risk pushing more megacities
towards a “water day zero” that
sees the taps run dry. These
include population growth,
migration, industrialization,
climate change, drought,
groundwater depletion, weak
infrastructure and poor urban
planning. Short-termist and
polarized politics at both
municipal and national levels
in many countries further
heighten these dangers.
The societal shock of running
out of water could lead in sharply
differing directions depending on
the context. It could exacerbate
divisions. Conflict might erupt
over access to whatever water
was still available, or wealthier
residents might start to import
private supplies. But a water shock
could also galvanize communities
in the face of a shared existential
challenge. Either way, damage
would be done. Hygiene would
suffer, increasing strains on
healthcare systems. And
governments blamed for the failure
might be tempted to scapegoat
weaker communities, such as those
in informal dwellings with unofficial
connections to the water system.
Getting governance and planning
right during times of plentiful water
would reduce the risk of day zero
arising, including public information
campaigns and basic maintenance
of existing infrastructure, as well as

regulations limiting the amount of
water that households, businesses
and government can use. New
water sources could be identified,
subject to careful risk assessment.
And smart technologies could be
deployed to reduce water use
and improve water reclamation.

LOW EARTH ORBIT BECOMES A
VENUE FOR GEOPOLITICAL CONFLICT

With satellites now central to
the smooth functioning of civil
and military technologies, the
amount of commercial and
government activity in space has
been increasing. This is a legally
ambiguous realm, creating the
potential for confusion, accident
and even wilful disruption. Space
debris is proliferating too—half a
million pieces are now moving at
the speed of a bullet in low orbit.
Even accidental debris collisions
could cause significant disruption
to internet connectivity and
all that relies on it. But at a
time of intensifying geopolitical
competition, space could also
become an arena for active conflict.
Even defensive moves to protect
critical space assets might trigger
a destabilizing arms race. Precision
weapons and military earlywarning systems rely on high-orbit
satellites—militarizing space might
be seen as necessary to deter a
crippling attack on them. In the
future, as space becomes more
affordably accessible, new threats
of space-based terrorism
could emerge.
New rules or updated protocols
would provide greater clarity—
particularly on the rapid expansion
of commercial activity, but also
on military activity. Even simple
measures could help—such as
ensuring transparency on debrisremoval activities to prevent the
misinterpretation of intentions.
At a time of fraying global
cooperation, space might be an
area where multilateral advances
could be signed up to by all.

As the intertwining of technology
with human life deepens, “affective
computing”—the use of algorithms
that can read human emotions or
predict our emotional responses—
is likely to become increasingly
prevalent. In time, the advent of
artificial intelligence (AI) “woebots”
and similar tools could transform
the delivery of emotional and
psychological care—analogous to
heart monitors and step counters.
But the adverse consequences,
either accidental or intentional,
of emotionally “intelligent” code
could be profound.
Consider the various disruptions
the digital revolution has already
triggered—what would be the
affective-computing equivalent
of echo chambers or fake news?
Of electoral interference or the
micro-targeting of advertisements?
New possibilities for radicalization
would also open up, with machine
learning used to identify emotionally
receptive individuals and the
specific triggers that might push
them toward violence. Oppressive
governments could deploy affective
computing to exert control or whip
up angry divisions.
To help mitigate these risks,
research into potential direct
and indirect impacts of these
technologies could be encouraged.
Mandatory standards could be
introduced, placing ethical limits
on research and development.
Developers could be required to
provide individuals with “opt-out”

rights. And greater education about
potential risks—both for people
working in this field and for the
general population—would
also help.

BREACHED WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE

Amid a new phase of strong-state
politics and deepening domestic
polarization, it becomes easier for
governments to sacrifice individual
protections to collective stability.
This already happens widely:
lip service is paid to human
rights that are breached at
home or abroad when it suits
states’ interests. What if even lip
service goes by the wayside, and
human rights are dismissed as
anachronisms that weaken the
state at a time of growing threats?
In authoritarian countries with weak
human rights records, the impact of
such a tipping point might be one
of degree—more rights breached.
In some democratic countries,
qualitative change would be more
likely—a jolt towards an illiberalism
in which power-holders determine
whose rights get protected, and
in which individuals on the losing
side of elections risk censorship,
detention or violence as “enemies
of the people”.
Battles are already under way
among major powers at the UN
over the future of the human rights
system. In a multipolar world of
divergent fundamental values,
building far-reaching consensus
in this area may be close to
impossible. “Universal” rights are
likely to be interpreted locally, and
those interpretations then fought
over globally. Even superficial
changes might be of modest help,
such as new language that is less
politicized than “human rights”.

INDEPENDENCE OF CENTRAL BANKS

A direct political challenge to the
independence of major central
banks would unsettle financial
markets. Investors might question
the solidity of the global financial
system’s institutional foundations.
As unease deepened, markets might
start to tremble, currencies to swing.
Uncertainty would spread to the
real economy. Polarization would

with mounting problems blamed
on enemies within and without.
Internationally, there might be no
actors with the legitimacy to force
a coordinated de-escalation.
The risk of a populist attack on the
world’s financial architecture could
be mitigated by deepened efforts to
maximize the popular legitimacy
of central bank independence.
This could be done by bringing
the public in—perhaps through
formal consultative assemblies—
to decisions on independence,
accountability and stability. The
greater the public understanding
of and support for monetary
policy mandates and tools, the
less vulnerable they will be in

Each year the Hindsight section revisits previous editions of the Global Risks

we return to are food security, civil society and investment in infrastructure.

Security of Food Systems
One of the earliest Global Risks Reports, in 2008, included a chapter on food security. It asked whether the
food-price spikes recorded in 2007 represented familiar short-term volatility or more structural disruptions to the
food system, and highlighted drivers of food insecurity including climate change, population growth and changing
consumption patterns. In 2016, we looked more closely at the first of these in a chapter entitled “Climate Change
and Risks to Food Security”, which noted that crop yields were growing more slowly than demand. It highlighted
two main ways that climate change is affecting food security: (1) direct impact on agricultural output, through
changing temperature and rainfall patterns; and (2) wider systemic disruptions such as market volatility,
interruptions to transport networks, and humanitarian emergencies.

Food distress
on the rise
The threats to food security have
intensified in recent years. In 2017,
a state of famine was declared in
South Sudan; although it was lifted
within months, this was only the
second such declaration since the
turn of the century. Conditions in
South Sudan are still designated as
“emergency”—one step
below famine on the five-point
scale used by the Famine Early
Warning Systems Network
(FEWS)1—as are conditions in
Ethiopia, Nigeria and Yemen. More
countries are in the next most severe
“crisis” category: Afghanistan,
Democratic Republic of Congo,
Somalia and parts of Southern
Africa. According to FEWS, the
number of people currently
requiring emergency food
assistance is “unprecedented in
recent decades”. In Yemen alone,
15 million people require emergency
food assistance each month.2

Undernourishment has increased
in both absolute and relative
terms since 2015, as shown by
Figure 7.1. The proportion of the
world’s population suffering from
undernourishment declined from
around 15% in the early 2000s to
10.6% in 2015, but edged back up
to 10.9% over the next two years.
In absolute terms, that represents
an increase of around 40 million
people: in 2017 a total of
821 million people were
undernourished, the most since

Conflict is one important driver
of these recent increases in food
insecurity. Most of the world’s
hungry people live in countries
affected by conflict,4 and—as
discussed in Chapter 3 (Heads and
Hearts)—the number of conflicts
around the world has increased in
recent years. All 19 of the countries
classified in 2017 as experiencing
protracted food crises were also
affected by violent conflict.5
Conflict can trigger the kind of
systemic disruptions of food systems discussed in the 2016 Global
Risks Report, and as noted in the
2017 State of Food Security and
Nutrition report: “. . . conflict can
lead to economic and price impacts
that reduce household food access
and may also constrain people’s
mobility, thereby limiting household

access to food, health services and
safe water.”6 In Yemen, the rial
depreciated sharply in the second
half of 2018, pushing up the price
of food and essential commodities;
in the capital city Sana’a, food
prices increased by 35% between
July and October. Conflict also
triggers displacement, which
creates food security issues.
Currently 68.5 million people are
displaced worldwide. Providing
adequate food for refugees is an
ongoing struggle. In 2016, the
UN’s World Food Programme
had to halve rations in Kenyan
refugee camps.7 In 2017, rations
were cut three times in Ethiopia’s
refugee camps because of
insufficient funding.8

Population growth
and waste
Global population growth
exacerbates the impact on food
systems of conflict and other
drivers of food insecurity. To
sustain current levels of food
availability between now and
2050 will require an estimated
70% increase in food production.9
The efficiency of efforts to
intensify food production will be
compromised unless wastage is
also addressed: currently, around a
third of the world’s food is wasted.10
Levels of food waste vary widely,
from 95 kilograms per person each
year in the United States to
1 kilogram in Rwanda.11 Research
suggests that food waste could rise

by almost 2% per year to 2030.
The impacts go beyond food
security: according to the Food
and Agricultural Organization of
the UN (FAO), food waste causes
an estimated 8% of annual
greenhouse gas emissions.13
12

Climate change
and chokepoints
Climate change continues to increase
strain on the global food system
through “changes in temperature,
precipitation and extreme weather
events, as well as increasing CO2
concentrations.”14 The last four years
have been the hottest on record.15
The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has warned
about the impacts on food security if
global warming exceeds the 1.5°C
targeted in the Paris Agreement.
For example, while an estimated
35 million people would be exposed
to crop yield changes at 1.5°C,
this would increase to 1.8 billion
at 3°C. Already around one-third
of changes in yields are due to
climate factors.16 Drought conditions
in Europe during 2018 led to the
region’s lowest grain production
since 2012,17 contributing to an

food system “chokepoints”—
maritime corridors, coastal
infrastructure and inland transport
networks19—which handle a
disproportionate volume of global
food trade: “Half of all internationally
traded grain must pass through at
least one of 14 major chokepoints
and over 10% depends on a maritime
chokepoint to which there is no viable
alternative route.”20 The risk posed by
these chokepoint vulnerabilities has
increased in tandem with the growing
role of global food supply chains—
between 2000 and 2015, the volume
of agricultural commodities traded
internationally increased by 127%.21
The researchers note that climate
change increases the risk of multiple
chokepoint failures occurring
simultaneously: “A worst-case
scenario—one in which the Gulf
Coast ports in the US were shut
down due to a hurricane at the
same time as key roads in Brazil
were swamped owing to heavy
rains—would cut off up to half
of global soybean supply in
one fell swoop.”22

expected sharp decrease in global
grain stocks.18 The food system
also has to compete for water
with other users, including urban
groundwater extraction, as discussed
in Chapter 5 (Fight or Flight).
Researchers also identify climate
change as a risk factor affecting

The Space for Civil Society
The 2017 Global Risks Report included a chapter that discussed the “[c]losing space for civil society”. That chapter
warned of growing constraints on the operation of civil society organizations around the world, with adverse
consequences including declining societal trust and increasing corruption, polarization and unrest. The chapter cited
research pointing to serious threats to civic freedoms in 109 countries, notably press freedom. It highlighted the frequent
use of security considerations to justify restrictions on civil society groups, and the growing importance of new
technologies as a means of limiting freedom of expression and assembly.
Normally we would wait longer than two years to feature a topic in the Hindsight series, but even in this short time these
trends have increasingly defined the societal and political risks landscape in many countries. This reflects a general
intensification of strong-state politics and a shift to more authoritarian modes of governance in both democratic and
non-democratic states.
In its latest annual report, Freedom House stated that global freedom declined in 2017 for the 12th consecutive year,
with 113 countries recording a net decrease in freedom over that period compared to 62 recording an improvement.
According to the civil society monitoring group CIVICUS, conditions continued to tighten during 2018—between March
and November there was a rise in the number of countries categorized as “obstructed” or “repressed” and a decline in
those categorized as “open” or “narrowed”.

Press under
pressure
Globally, the most frequent violations
of civic freedoms recorded by
CIVICUS relate to freedom of the
press. Developments over the
past two years have borne out the
concerns raised in our 2017 report.
There has been a broad-based
decline in press freedom around
the world. The Economist
Intelligence Unit ranks 2017 as the
worst year since it began its index
of media freedom in 2006.23
Conditions have deteriorated
significantly even in a number of
countries in Europe, the region
where protections for journalists
are typically strongest, according to

80

The Global Risks Report 2019

Reporters Without Borders. Malta
and Slovakia have seen high-profile
murders of journalists in the past
18 months.24

Conservative
groups gain
strength
We omitted in 2017 to discuss one
development that has since
become more important. While
most well-established nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
are liberal, it is important to note
that conservative civil society
groups play a prominent role in
some countries.

A recent study points to the
influence of conservative civil
society movements in other
countries, including Brazil, India,
Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine
and the United States.25 These
groups pursue a range of causes—
rooted in different religious beliefs,
community norms and political
views—but one commonality is
“the search for protection—
protection from change, from
outside economic pressures,
from new kinds of identities
and moral codes.”26

freedoms continue to cite security
as a justification. A 2018 report by
the UN Special Rapporteur on the
Rights to Freedom of Peaceful
Assembly and of Association
identifies concerns including
“declarations of a state of
emergency, sometimes without
adequate justification, the use of
vague wording to define acts of
terrorism and threats to public
security, and broad legal provisions
that allow for the abusive
interpretation of limitations on
the rights to freedom of peaceful
assembly and of association.”27 The
report cites provisions of varying
severity in almost 20 countries.

Values), many countries already
worry about rivals using
“information operations” to
sow political instability.29
The use of new technologies to
monitor or control civil society
is also likely to have deepening
geopolitical ramifications. Globally,
online freedom has declined for
eight consecutive years.30 The
Special Rapporteur notes the
“utmost importance” of new
technologies for freedom of
assembly and highlights how
some governments have prohibited
access to social networking
platforms.31 Some see digital
freedom as a key fault line in the
evolving multipolar and
multi-conceptual world order.32

The Special Rapporteur also notes
the growing use of restrictive rules
and regulations that make it difficult
for civil society groups to operate.
These can range from onerous
administrative requirements to
more substantive provisions:
“some restrictions require nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) to align their activities with
government policies, with heavy
sanctions for NGOs that fail to do
so.”28 Organizations in receipt of
foreign funding are at particular
risk—a trend we highlighted in
2017, and one that is likely to
intensify. Against the backdrop of
values-based geopolitical tensions

Investment in Infrastructure
Nine years ago, the fifth edition of the Global Risks Report drew attention to the need for greater investment in
infrastructure. The report was published in 2010, a year after the global economy had contracted at the height of the
financial crisis. Against this backdrop of slumping demand and heightened uncertainty, the report cited global
infrastructure needs equivalent to an estimated US$35 trillion over 20 years. It pointed to two key trends that would
shape the challenge—population growth and climate change—and the need for associated development in the
agriculture and energy sectors. It also warned that vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure were a source of wider
systemic risk that needed to be assessed and managed.
Since then, estimates of future needs have increased. According to projections from the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH),
a body created by the G20, infrastructure investment totalling US$97 trillion is required by 2040 across 57 countries
and seven sectors. That compares with current investment trends of US$79 trillion, leaving a global infrastructure gap
of US$18 trillion.33 Many countries, both emerging and advanced, “have paid insufficient attention to maintaining and
expanding their infrastructure assets, creating economic inefficiencies and allowing critical systems to erode.”34

Spending gaps
vary by region
Infrastructure spending has differed
sharply by region in recent years,
with one estimate ranging from
1.9% of GDP in Sub-Saharan
Africa to 6.9% in the Middle East
and North Africa.35 In absolute
terms, levels of spending have
been particularly high in Asia,
specifically China. Asia Pacific
accounted for more than half
of global infrastructure
spending in 2015.36
According to GIH projections,
China is the country with the most
significant infrastructure needs
between now and 2040. On
current trends, China will fall
US$1.9 trillion short of its
total spending requirement of
US$28 trillion. In the United States,
overall investment needs are much

82

The Global Risks Report 2019

lower (US$12 trillion), but the
shortfall relative to current trends
is twice as large (US$3.8 trillion). In
our 2010 report we noted that the
American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE) rated the infrastructure
stock of the United States at “D”
(where “A” is the best, and anything
below “D” is unfit for purpose). The
latest ASCE report card is from
2017, when the United States had
improved only marginally to a
rating of “D+”.37
Relative to GDP, Africa has the
largest infrastructure gap between
now and 2040.38 One reason is that
Africa’s population is set to double
over that period. Meeting the
region’s infrastructure needs is likely
to require significant change:
concerns that we cited in 2010
about weak political and governance
systems continue to hold back
flows of investment finance. The
African Development Bank notes
that in 2016 commitments of public

and private infrastructure funding
fell to their lowest level in five years,
largely as a consequence of a
reported reduction in inflows
from China.39

Growing risks:
FDI and cyber
In recent decades, the profile of
development finance in general—
and for infrastructure projects in
particular—has swung from
traditional aid flows to foreign direct
investment (FDI).40 China has been
instrumental: its share of global
investment flows increased from
4% in 2006 to 17% by 2017.41
Flows of FDI into developing
countries have become increasingly
geopolitically charged, as discussed
in Chapter 2 (Power and Values).
The interdependencies created by
a deepening web of international
infrastructure projects were not a

pressing concern at the time of
our 2010 report, but they are now
a growing source of risk in the
international system.
Technology has also radically
altered risks related to infrastructure
development over the past decade.
The critical infrastructure risks
we noted in 2010 have risen as
digitalization and the Internet of
Things have deepened connectivity
across the world, increasing the
potential for malicious actors to
mount online attacks and
amplifying their potential damage.
A successful cyber-attack on a
country’s electricity system, for
example—a current area of focus
for the World Economic Forum42—
could trigger devastating spill-over
effects. One estimate suggests that
energy utilities spent US$1.7 billion
in 2017 on protecting their systems
from cyber-attacks.43

Low-carbon
infrastructure
Climate change has driven
significant change in the world’s
infrastructure needs since our
2010 report. There is now more
awareness of the risks it poses and
greater consensus on the need for
collective policy responses. The
low-carbon transition will shape the
profile of infrastructure investment
in multiple ways. For example, in
the energy sector, investment in
renewables is likely to accelerate,
despite a pause in the shift

towards cleaner energy in 2017.44
Transport infrastructure will need to
be adapted to manage increasing
shares of electric vehicles, as well
as huge projected increases in
road, air and sea traffic.45 And
sensor-based technologies are
likely to be widely deployed across
all kinds of networks and grids,
increasing demand for the digital
infrastructure on which they rely.46

funding available to help meet
the world’s infrastructure needs
sustainably.

The climate-change imperative will
also drive increased investment
in “green infrastructure” solutions
of the kind discussed in Chapter
5 (Fight or Flight). These work
with natural materials and can, for
example, lower energy demand,
reduce urban temperatures and
improve water management.47
The rapid roll-out of sustainable
infrastructure is likely to lead to
continuing financial innovation
as more investors move into this
market. Already there has been a
significant increase in the number
of funds investing in infrastructure
assets generally, pushing returns
down from 14% in 2004 to 10.6%
in 2016.48 According to UN
Environment, issuance of “green
bonds” jumped from US$11 billion
in 2013 to US$155 billion in 2017.49
There are potential risks associated
with the rapid expansion of green
finance—including asset bubbles
and the temptation to lower capital
requirements to encourage
sustainable investment50—but the
costs of managing these risks are
likely to be small compared with
the benefits of making increased

Risk
Reassessment
In the Risk Reassessment section of the Global Risks Report, we invite
selected risk experts to share their insights about risk and risk management.
The aim is to encourage fresh thinking about how to navigate a rapidly
evolving risks landscape. In this year’s report, John D. Graham discusses
the importance of considering trade-offs between risks—because efforts to
mitigate one risk can often exacerbate others. And András Tilcsik and Chris
Clearfield highlight a number of the steps that can be taken to protect
organizations from systemic risks.

Weighing Risks
By John D. Graham

Corporate executives, regulators,
physicians and security officials
often face a shared dilemma in
decision-making: deciding which
risks to accept, at least for now.
The stark reality is that few decision
options in these fields are without
any risk. The executive may decide
in favour of a promising acquisition,
despite knowing that merging with
an unfamiliar company is fraught
with downside risks. Heart patients
often trust cardiologists to help
them decide whether the longevity
gains from coronary artery bypass
surgery are worth its additional
surgical dangers compared with
the simpler angioplasty procedure.
The bold German phase-out of
nuclear power is indirectly forcing
Germany to incur greater risks from
coal-fired electricity, at least until
the ambitious path to renewables
is accomplished. And measures
to counteract terrorism at airports
may not reduce overall societal
risk if terrorists simply respond by
shifting to new vulnerable targets
such as sporting events, concerts
and subways.

88

The Global Risks Report 2019

Trade-offs
between risks
What might be called the “target
risk” is the one of primary concern
to decision-makers. The Trump
administration sees imports from
China as an immediate threat to
American businesses because
there are plenty of US businesses that have been damaged by
government-subsidized Chinese
products. The “countervailing risk”
is the unintended risk triggered by
interventions to reduce the target
risk. Slapping tariffs on Chinese
imports may bring the Chinese to
the negotiating table but, in the
interim, the tariffs make some US
goods more expensive in global
markets, especially those that rely
on Chinese inputs. US tariffs also
invite a trade war with the Chinese
that will create some countervailing
risks for US exporters that do
business in China.
The challenge of resolving
trade-offs between target and
countervailing risks is particularly
perplexing in the short run.
Technological options are fairly fixed,
research and development (R&D)
solutions are beyond the relevant
time horizon, and current legal and
organizational arrangements in both
government and business are
difficult to reform quickly. In the
long run, there are more “risksuperior” solutions because the
extra time for risk management
allows R&D, innovation and

organizational change to work
against both the target and
countervailing risks.
The most promising short-run
solution to risk trade-offs is as
simple in theory as it is devilishly
difficult in practice: identify and
carefully weigh the competing
risks of decision alternatives. For
example, with the global economy
in an encouraging recovery, it
is tempting for policy-makers to
enforce monetary discipline—but
that discipline might cause interest
rates to rise above the surprisingly
low levels that have become
familiar throughout much of the
world. If interest rates rise too
much or too fast, the adverse
effects on business activity are
predictable. Weighing the risks
and benefits of monetary discipline
is a crucial responsibility of
monetary policy-makers.

Geography and
culture
Risk trade-offs are particularly
sensitive for decision-makers when
the parties suffering from the
target risk are different from the
parties likely to experience the
countervailing risk. In China, electric
cars look promising to families in
polluted Eastern cities who breathe
motor vehicle exhaust on a daily
basis, especially those families
living close to congested roads and
highways. But, when electric cars
are recharged by drawing electricity

from the Chinese electrical grid,
more pollution is generated at the
electric power plants. Those
facilities may be located on the
perimeter of Chinese cities or in the
less prosperous, inner regions of
China where electricity plants are
easier to site. It requires careful air
quality modelling, informed
by state-of-the-art atmospheric
chemistry and high-resolution
geographic information systems,
to know precisely who will incur the
indirect public health risks of
plug-in electric cars. If the
countervailing risks are not given
the same analytic attention as the
target risks, it is impossible for a
thoughtful regulator to weigh the
ethical aspects of shifting pollution
from one population to another.
In this setting, making the
countervailing risks as transparent
as the target risks is easier said
than done.
When decisions about risk
trade-offs are made in different
cultures, it should be expected that
some stark differences will result.
In the United States, the national
energy policies of both George W.
Bush and Barack Obama
facilitated a surge of unconventional
oil and gas development through
innovations such as multi-stage
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling. The diffusion of innovation
occurred so rapidly in the states of
Pennsylvania, North Dakota,
Oklahoma and Texas that state
regulators are only beginning to
fully understand and regulate the
resulting risks of earthquakes and

water pollution. The same
unconventional technologies used
in the United States are seen as
unacceptable in Germany, where
bans on “fracking” were imposed
before the new industry could get
off the ground. Businesses and
households in Germany are
incurring high natural gas prices
as well as greater dependence
on Russian gas as a result of the
ban on fracking, but German
policy-makers are entitled to
make those trade-offs.
Stark international differences in
regulatory risk management are
less acceptable when the alleged
risks relate not to production
activity, which is confined to a
particular country, but to
consumption of goods that are
traded across borders in a global
economy. The World Trade
Organization (WTO) has already
exposed several instances where
countries have tried to use
health-risk concerns to conceal
protectionist motivations for
product bans and restrictions.
The Chinese are concerned that the
United States and the European
Union behave in this fashion; the
United States has already won
cases against the European
Union at the WTO related to
hormone-treated beef and
genetically modified seeds.
One of the advantages of
evidence-based approaches to
resolving trade disputes is that all
countries, regardless of cultural
norms, have access to scientific

evidence. Understanding cultural
norms is a more subjective
exercise. Scientific knowledge
about risk and safety does not
stop at an international border,
though genuine uncertainty
about the severity of established
risks might justify differences in
the precautionary regulations of
different countries. The WTO is
far from a perfect organization,
but it has potential to promote an
evidence-based approach to risk
management and foster more
international learning about risk
trade-offs.

Investing to ease
risk trade-offs
Fortunately, the long run opens up
more promising opportunities for
superior management of risk. New
surgical techniques have made
coronary artery bypass surgery
much safer and more effective today
than it was 20 years ago. The
fracking techniques used today in
the United States and Canada are
much more sustainable and costeffective than the techniques used
only five years ago. And progress
in battery technology is making
electrification of the transport sector
a more plausible, sustainable and
affordable option than most experts
believed possible a decade ago.
The hard question is how to foster
productive R&D investments to ease
difficult risk trade-offs. When will
innovation occur productively

The Global Risks Report 2019

through market competition, and
when does an industry require
incentives, nudging or even
compulsion in order to innovate?
Should governmental subsidies
focus on basic research, or is there
also a need for government to pick
some promising technologies
and subsidize real-world
demonstrations? There are plenty
of cases where government R&D
policy has produced “duds” in the
commercial marketplace, but there
are also cases, such as fracking
and plug-in electric vehicles, where
government R&D policy has played
a constructive role in fostering
exciting and transformative
innovations.

The Global Risks Report 2019

Managing in the Age of Meltdowns
By András Tilcsik and Chris Clearfield

While we are right to worry about
major events—such as natural
disasters, extreme weather and
coordinated cyber-attacks—it is
often the cascading impact of
small failures that brings down our
systems. The sociologist Charles
Perrow identified two aspects of
systems that make them vulnerable
to these kinds of unexpected
failures: complexity and tight
coupling.1 A complex system is
like an elaborate web with many
intricately connected parts,
and much of what goes on in it is
invisible to the naked eye. A tightly
coupled system is unforgiving:
there is little slack in it, and the
margin for error is slim.
When something goes wrong in
a complex system, problems start
popping up everywhere, and it is
hard to figure out what’s happening.
And tight coupling means that the
emerging problems quickly spiral
out of control and even small
errors can cascade into massive
meltdowns.
When Perrow developed his
framework in the early 1980s, few
systems were both highly complex
and tightly coupled; the ones that

missions. Since then, however, we
have added an enormous amount
of complexity to our world. From
connected devices and global
supply chains to the financial
system and new intricate
organizational structures, the
potential for small problems to
trigger unexpected cascading
failures is now all around us.
The good news is that there are
solutions. Though we often
cannot simplify our systems, we
can change how we manage them.
Research shows that small changes
in how we organize our teams and
approach problems can make a
big difference.

Think small
In complex and tightly coupled
systems—from massive information
technology (IT) projects to business
expansion initiatives—it is not
possible to identify in advance all
the ways that small failures might
lead to catastrophic meltdowns.
We have to gather information
about close calls and little things
that are not working to understand
how our systems might fail. Small
errors give us great data about
system vulnerabilities and can help
us discover where more serious

threats are brewing. But many
organizations fail to learn from such
near misses. It is an all-too-human
tendency familiar from everyday life:
we treat a toilet that occasionally
clogs as a minor inconvenience
rather than a warning sign—until it
overflows. Or we ignore subtle
warning signs about our car rather
than taking it into the repair shop.
In a complex system, minor glitches
and other anomalies serve as
powerful warning signs—but
only if we treat them as such.
Leaders can build organizational
capabilities that attend to weak
signals of failure. The pharmaceutical
giant Novo Nordisk started
developing such capabilities after
senior executives were shocked by a
manufacturing quality breakdown
that cost more than US$100 million.
In the wake of the failure, Novo
Nordisk did not blame individuals
or encourage managers to be more
vigilant. Instead, it created a new
group of facilitators tasked with
interviewing people in every unit and
at all levels to make sure important
issues don’t get lost at the bottom
of the hierarchy. The group follows
up on small issues before they
become big problems.

Encourage
scepticism
When success depends on
avoiding small failures, we need to
build scepticism into our

The Global Risks Report 2019

91

organizations so that we consider
our decisions from multiple angles
and avoid groupthink. One
approach, pioneered by NASA’s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is
to embed a sceptic in every project
team—specifically, an engineer
from JPL’s Engineering Technical
Authority (ETA).
ETA engineers are ideal sceptics.
They are skilled enough to
understand the technology and
the mission but detached enough
to bring a distinct perspective. And
the fact that they are embedded in
the organization, but with their own
reporting lines, means that project
managers cannot just dismiss their
concerns. If an ETA engineer and
a project manager cannot agree
about a particular risk, they take
their issue to the ETA manager,
who tries to broker a technical
solution, gets additional resources
for the mission, or escalates the
issue to JPL’s Chief Engineer.
Another effective way to cultivate
scepticism is through diversity.
Surface-level diversity (differences
of race and gender, for example)
fosters healthy dissent in
organizations. Research shows
that diverse groups ask tougher
questions, share more information
and discuss a broader range of
relevant factors before making a
decision. Diversity in professional
backgrounds matters, too. In
one study that tracked over a
thousand small banks for nearly
two decades, researchers found
that banks with fewer bankers on

their boards were less likely to fail.2
The explanation: non-bankers were
more likely to disrupt groupthink
by challenging seemingly obvious
assumptions. As one bank CEO
with a professionally diverse board
put it: “When we see something
we don’t like, no one is afraid
to bring it up.”

Learn to stop
When faced with a problem or
surprising event, our instinct is
often to push forward. But sticking
to a plan in the face of an emerging
problem can easily lead to a disaster. Stopping gives us a chance
to assess unexpected threats
and figure out what to do before
things get out of hand. It sounds
simple, but in practice it can be
nerve-wracking for team members
to trigger delays and disruption for
something that might turn out to
be a false alarm. This is something
leaders need to actively encourage.
In some cases, stopping may not
be an option. In those situations,
effective crisis management
requires rapidly cycling between
doing, monitoring, and diagnosing.
We do something to try and fix the
system. We monitor what happens
in response, checking to see if our
actions had the intended effect. If
they didn’t, we use the information
from our monitoring to make a new
diagnosis and move to the next
phase of doing. Research shows
that teams that cycle rapidly in this

way are more likely to solve
complex, evolving problems.

Imagine failure
Cognitive biases are often the
source of the small errors that
trigger major failures in complex,
tightly coupled systems.
Fortunately, there are some
simple techniques we can use to
make better decisions. One is the
“premortem”.3 Imagine that it’s
six months from now and that the
ambitious project you’re about
to undertake has failed. The
premortem involves working
backward to come up with reasons
for the failure and ideas for what
could have been done to prevent it.
The process is distinct from brainstorming about risks that might
emerge: by asserting that failure
has already happened, we tap
into what psychologists call
“prospective hindsight”, letting us
anticipate a broader and more
vivid set of problems.
Similarly, the use of predetermined
criteria to make decisions can
prevent us from relying on our
(often incorrect) gut reactions. Too
often, we base decisions on
predictions that are overly
simplistic, missing important
possible outcomes. For example,
we might anticipate that a project
will take between one and three
months to complete. One way of
being more structured about this
kind of forecast is to use

Subjective Probability Interval
Estimates (SPIES), which entails
dividing the entire possible range
of outcomes into intervals and then
estimating the probability of each.
In our example, we might consider
six intervals for the project’s
duration: zero to one month, one
to two months, two to three
months, three to four months,
four to five months, and more
than five months.4

Chris Clearfield and András
Tilcsik are the co-authors of
Meltdown: Why Our Systems
Fail and What We Can Do
About It (Penguin Press, 2018).

Conclusion
Even with all these techniques,
things will go wrong. When they
do, we need to do a better job of
learning lessons. Too often there
is practically a script: a superficial
post-mortem is conducted, an
individual or a specific technical
problem is found to be at fault, and
a narrow fix is implemented. Then
it’s back to business as usual. That
is not good enough anymore.
We need to face reality with a
blameless process that not only
identifies specific issues but also
looks at broader organizational and
systemic causes. Only by doing
this—and by recognizing early
warning signs, building scepticism
into organizations, using structured
decision tools and managing our
crises better—will we be able to
prevent the “unprecedented errors”
that seem to be a defining feature
of the modern world.

Appendix B | Global Risks Perception Survey and
Methodology
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the World Economic Forum’s source of original risks data,
harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s extensive network of business, government, civil society and thought
leaders. The survey was conducted from 6 September to 22 October 2018 among the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities, the professional networks of its Advisory Board, and members of the Institute of
Risk Management. The results of the GRPS are used to create the Global Risks Landscape, Interconnections Map,
and Trends Map presented at the beginning of the report, and to offer insights used throughout.
Both the GRPS and the Global Risks Report adopt the following definitions of global risk and trend:
Global risk: A “global risk” is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant negative
impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years.
Trend: A “trend” is defined as a long-term pattern that is currently evolving and that could contribute to
amplifying global risks and/or altering the relationship between them.

Methodology
The world in 2019
In the first section of the GRPS,
respondents were asked to assess
whether the risks associated with
42 current issues would increase
or decrease in 2019 compared to
2018. For a list of these issues,
see Figure 1.2 (page 12), which
summarizes the results.
The possible answers ranged
from “significantly decrease” to
“significantly increase” along a
1–5 scale. For each issue, the
share for each answer (“significantly
increase”, “somewhat increase”,
“no change”, “somewhat decrease”
or “significantly decrease”) was

obtained by dividing the number
of respondents who selected
that answer by the total number
of answers.
In most cases, respondents were
asked to base their answers on
developments in their region. They
were asked the following question:
“In your region specifically, do
you think that in 2019 the risks
presented by the following issues
will increase or decrease compared
to 2018?” For the following seven
issues, the question was framed
globally: “On a global level, do
you think that in 2019 the risks
presented by the following issues
will increase or decrease
compared to 2018?”

Economic confrontations/
frictions between major
powers1
Political confrontations/
frictions between major
powers
Erosion of global policy
coordination on climate change
Erosion of multilateral trading
rules and agreements
Loss of confidence in collective
security alliances
Regional conflicts drawing in
major power(s)
State-on-state military conflict
or incursion

In last year’s Global Risks Perception Survey 2017–2018, respondents were asked to assess “Political or economic confrontations/frictions between major
powers”. In this year’s survey, we separated this into two separate issues, one economic and one political.

could choose “no opinion” if they
felt unable to provide an informed
answer, and they could also leave
the question completely blank.
Partial responses for any risk—those
assessing only the likelihood of
occurrence or only the negative
impact—were dropped.

The global risks
landscape
For each of the 30 global risks
listed in Appendix A, respondents
were asked to assess (1) the
likelihood of the risk occurring
globally within the next 10 years,
and (2) its negative impact for
several countries or industries
over the same timeframe.
For the first of these questions, the
possible answers ranged from “very
unlikely” to “very likely” along a 1–5
scale (1 = very unlikely, 5 = very
Likely). For the second question,
respondents could select one of
five choices: “minimal”, “minor”,
“moderate”, “severe”, or “catastrophic”,
again using a 1–5 scale (1 = minimal,
5 = catastrophic). Respondents

Global risks
interconnections
Part 3 of the GRPS assesses
interconnections between pairs
of global risks. Part 4 assesses
interconnections between global
risks and a set of underlying
trends or drivers.
For the interconnections between
pairs of risks, survey respondents
were asked the following question:
“Global risks are not isolated, and it
is important to assess their
interconnections. In your view,
which are the most strongly
connected global risks? Please
select three to six pairs of global
risks.” The results are illustrated in
the Global Risks Interconnections
Map 2019 (Figure III).
For the interconnections between
trends and risks, respondents were
first asked to identify up to three
trends (for the full list, see Appendix
A) that they considered most
important in shaping the global
agenda in the next 10 years. They
were then asked to identify the
three global risks that are most
strongly driven by each of the three
chosen trends. The two questions
read: “What are the three most
important trends (in no particular
order) that will shape global development in the next 10 years?”
followed by “For each of the three
trends identified [in the previous
question,] select up to three global

risks . . . that are most strongly
driven by these trends.” The
results are illustrated in the RisksTrends Interconnections Map
2019 (Figure II).
In both cases, a tally was made of
the number of times each pair was
cited. This value was then divided
by the count of the most frequently cited pair. As a final step, the
square root of this ratio was taken
to dampen the long-tail

value of the interconnection
determines the thickness of each

with the most frequently cited pair
having the thickest line.
In the Global Risks Landscape and
the Risks-Trends Interconnections
Map, the size of each risk is scaled
according to the degree of weight of
that node in the system. Moreover,
in the Risks-Trends Interconnections
Map, the size of the trend represents
the perception of its importance in
shaping global development (answer
to the first part of the question on
trend, as explained above); the
most-frequently cited trend is the
one considered to be the most
important in shaping global
development.

The placement of the nodes in the
Risks-Trends Interconnections Map
was computed using ForceAtlas2,
a force-directed network layout
algorithm implemented in Gephi
software, which minimizes edge
lengths and edge crossings by
running a physical particle
simulation.2

Part 2 “Assessment of Global
Risks”: The answers from the 885
respondents who assessed the
impact and likelihood of at least
one risk were used to compute the
results (the answer “no opinion” is
considered a valid answer, but
leaving the question entirely
blank is not).

Completion
thresholds

Part 3 “Global Risk
Interconnections”: The answers
from the 635 respondents who
selected at least one valid pair
of risks were used in the
computation.

We did not apply an overall
threshold for the GRPS completion
rate. Instead, we set specific
validity criteria for each section
of the survey:
Part 1 “The World in 2019”:
Only respondents who assessed
at least three of the risks listed
in this question were considered
(916 respondents met the criterion).

Part 4 “Assessments of Trends”:
The answers from the 749
respondents who selected at least
one combination of an important
trend and at least one associated
risk were used in the computation.
Figure B.1 presents some
key descriptive statistics and
information about the profiles
of the respondents.
