of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 26 June 2016

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 86th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2016.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 412.9 million, compared with
SDR 542.9 million for the preceding year. Details of the results for the financial year
2015/16 may be found on pages 170–1 of this Report under “Financial activities
and results”.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 120.0 million in

Overview of the economic chapters

Chapter I: When the future becomes today
Judged by standard benchmarks, the global economy is not doing as badly as the
rhetoric sometimes suggests. Global growth continues to disappoint expectations
but is in line with pre-crisis historical averages, and unemployment continues to
decline. Less comforting is the longer-term context – a “risky trinity” of conditions:
productivity growth that is unusually low, global debt levels that are historically
high, and room for policy manoeuvre that is remarkably narrow. A key sign of these
discomforting conditions is the persistence of exceptionally low interest rates, which
have actually fallen further since last year.
The year under review saw the beginnings of a realignment in the forces
driving global developments: partly in response to US monetary policy prospects,
global liquidity conditions began to tighten and the US dollar appreciated; financial
booms matured or even began to turn in some emerging market economies (EMEs);
and commodity prices, especially the oil price, dropped further. However, global
prices and capital flows partly reversed in the first half of this year even as underlying
vulnerabilities remained.
There is an urgent need to rebalance policy in order to shift to a more robust
and sustainable expansion. A key factor in the current predicament has been the
inability to get to grips with hugely damaging financial booms and busts and the
debt-fuelled growth model that this has spawned. It is essential to relieve monetary
policy, which has been overburdened for far too long. This means completing
financial reforms, judiciously using the available fiscal space while ensuring longterm sustainability; and, above all, this means stepping up structural reforms. These
steps should be embedded in longer-term efforts to put in place an effective
macro-financial stability framework better able to address the financial cycle. A firm
long-term focus is essential. We badly need policies that we will not once again
regret when the future becomes today.

Chapter II: Global financial markets: between uneasy calm
and turbulence
Financial markets experienced alternating phases of calm and turbulence in the
past year, as prices in core asset markets remained keenly sensitive to monetary
policy developments. Investors also closely followed growing signs of economic
weakness in the main EMEs, especially China. Bond yields in advanced economies
continued to fall, in many cases to historical lows, while the share of outstanding
government bonds trading at negative yields reached new records. Low yields
reflected low term premia as well as a downward shift in expected future shortterm interest rates. Investors turned to riskier market segments in a search for yield,
thereby supporting asset prices despite already high valuations. Unease about such
valuations, coupled with concerns about the global outlook and about the
effectiveness of monetary policy in supporting growth, resulted in recurring selloffs and bouts of volatility. Markets appeared vulnerable to a sharp reversal of high
valuations. Some outsize bond price movements point to changes in market

liquidity, but lower leverage should support more robust market liquidity under
stress. Financial markets also exhibited persistent market anomalies that spread
further, such as a widening cross-currency basis and negative US dollar interest rate
swap spreads. These anomalies partly reflected market-specific supply-demand
imbalances, sometimes reinforced by the impact of central bank actions on hedging
demand. They also reflected shifts in the behaviour of large dealer institutions,
which are now less active in arbitraging the anomalies away.

Chapter III: The global economy: realignment under way?
Global growth of GDP per working age person slightly outpaced its historical
average and unemployment rates generally fell in the year under review. Perceptions
of economic conditions, however, were defined by further falls in commodity prices,
large swings in exchange rates and lower than expected headline global growth.
These developments hint at a realignment of economic and financial forces that
have unfolded over many years. In EME commodity exporters, the downturn in the
domestic financial cycle mostly compounded the fall in export prices and currency
depreciations, with economic conditions becoming weaker. In general, tighter
access to dollar borrowing amplified these developments. The anticipated rotation
of growth failed to materialise, with activity in advanced economies not picking up
as much as needed to offset slower EME growth, despite some upturn in domestic
financial cycles in the advanced economies most affected by the Great Financial
Crisis. Lower oil and other commodity prices have not yet triggered the expected
fillip to growth in importers, possibly because some parts of the private sector are
still nursing weak balance sheets. The scars of repeated financial booms and busts
and debt accumulation also hang over global potential growth: factor misallocation
appears to be holding back productivity, with debt overhang and uncertainty
seemingly restraining investment.

Chapter IV: Monetary policy: more accommodation, less room
Monetary policy remained exceptionally accommodative as the room for
manoeuvre shrank and the prospects for further delay in policy normalisation
increased. Against the backdrop of diverging monetary policies among the major
advanced economies, some central banks continued to supplement historically low
policy rates with further expansion of their balance sheets. Inflation developments
played a big role in policy decisions, as exchange rate swings and declines in
commodity prices affected headline inflation. At the same time, central banks had
to factor in the inflationary cross-currents coming from a mix of cyclical and secular
drivers, with the latter continuing to keep a lid on underlying inflation. Central banks
also had to grapple with concerns about the seemingly diminished effectiveness of
monetary policy through domestic channels. Naturally, external channels took on
greater prominence, but they also presented additional challenges to price and
financial stability. More broadly, the evolving policy tensions between price and
financial stability underscored the need to raise the prominence of financial stability
considerations, both of a domestic and external nature, in current monetary policy
frameworks. Further progress has been made in understanding the trade-offs and
in operationalising such a framework.

Chapter V: Towards a financial stability-oriented fiscal policy
Fiscal policy should be an essential part of the post-crisis macro-financial stability
framework. As history shows, banking crises wreak havoc with public finances.
Growing fiscal risks, in turn, weaken the financial system: directly, by undermining
deposit guarantees and by weakening banks’ balance sheets through losses on
their public debt holdings; and indirectly, by limiting the authorities’ ability to
stabilise the economy through countercyclical fiscal policy. The tight two-way link
between banks and public finances also creates the potential for an adverse
feedback loop, in which financial and sovereign risks reinforce each other. Moving
away from the present favourable treatment of domestic public debt in capital
regulation to one that reflects more accurately sovereign risk is important to
weaken this loop. But, by itself, it is not sufficient. Maintaining or rebuilding a sound
fiscal position is key. Building sufficient buffers in a financial boom creates the room
to repair balance sheets and stimulate demand if a crisis occurs. A stronger
countercyclical stance may also help contain excessive growth in credit and asset
prices. But the most important contribution to crisis prevention may come from
removing tax provisions that unduly incentivise debt over equity, leading to too
much leverage and greater financial fragility.

Chapter VI: The financial sector: time to move on
The Basel III framework is nearing completion. In addition to finalising the
remaining calibration decisions, consistent and thorough implementation is now
key, alongside more rigorous supervision. With regulatory uncertainty receding,
banks need to keep adjusting their business models to the new market environment.
This includes addressing legacy problems, such as those related to non-performing
loans – an adjustment that will have to take place in challenging macroeconomic
conditions linked to low, or even negative, interest rates. Once financial sector
repair is completed, safer and stronger banks will unambiguously contribute to a
more resilient economy. At the same time, as risks continue to migrate from banks
to non-bank intermediaries, additional prudential challenges arise. Key areas
include insurance supervision and mutual fund regulation.

I. When the future becomes today

The global expansion continues. But the economy still conveys a sense of uneven
and unfinished adjustment. Expectations have not been met, confidence has not
been restored, and huge swings in exchange rates and commodity prices in the
past year hint at the need for a fundamental realignment. How far removed are we
from a robust and sustainable global expansion?
When put in perspective, standard metrics indicate that macroeconomic
performance is not as dire as the rhetoric may sometimes suggest (Graph I.1). True,
global growth forecasts have been revised downwards once more, as they
consistently have been since the Great Financial Crisis. But growth rates are not that
far away from historical averages, and in a number of significant cases they are
above estimates of potential. In fact, once adjusted for demographic trends, growth
per working age person is even slightly above long-run trends (Chapter III).
Similarly, unemployment rates have generally declined and in many cases are close
to historical norms or estimates of full employment. And although inflation is still
below specific targets in large advanced economies, it may be regarded as broadly
in line with notions of price stability. Indeed, the downbeat expression “ongoing
recovery” does not do full justice to how far the global economy has come since
the crisis.
Less comforting is the context in which those economic gauges are evolving
and what they might tell us about the future. One could speak of a “risky trinity”:
productivity growth that is unusually low, casting a shadow over future improvements
in living standards; global debt levels that are historically high, raising financial
stability risks; and a room for policy manoeuvre that is remarkably narrow, leaving
the global economy highly exposed.

As noted in last year’s Annual Report, a highly visible and much debated sign
of this discomfort has been exceptionally and persistently low interest rates. And
they have fallen even further since then (Graph I.2, left-hand panel). Inflationadjusted policy rates have edged deeper below zero, continuing the longest
postwar period in negative territory. Moreover, the Bank of Japan has joined the
ECB, Sveriges Riksbank, Danmarks Nationalbank and the Swiss National Bank in
adopting negative nominal policy rates. And at the end of May, close to $8 trillion
in sovereign debt, including at long maturities, was trading at negative yields – a
new record (Graph I.2, right-hand panel).
These interest rates tell us many things. They tell us that market participants
look to the future with a degree of apprehension; that despite huge central bank
efforts post-crisis, inflation has remained stubbornly low and output growth
disappointing; and that monetary policy has been overburdened for far too long.
The contrast between global growth that is not far from historical averages and
interest rates that are so low is particularly stark. That contrast is also reflected in
signs of fragility in financial markets and of tensions in foreign exchange markets.
Interpreting the evolution of the global economy is fraught with difficulties,
but it is necessary if we are to identify possible remedies. As we have in recent
Annual Reports, we offer an interpretation using a lens that focuses on financial,
global and medium-term aspects. We suggest that the current predicament in no
small measure reflects the failure to get to grips with hugely costly financial booms
and busts (“financial cycles”). These have left long-lasting economic scars and have
made robust, balanced and sustainable global expansion hard to achieve – the
hallmark of uneven recovery from a balance sheet recession. Debt has been acting
as a political and social substitute for income growth for far too long.
This interpretation argues for an urgent rebalancing of policy to focus more on
structural measures, on financial developments and on the medium term. A key
element of this rebalancing would be a keener appreciation of the cumulative
impact of policies on the stocks of debt, on the allocation of resources and on
the room for policy manoeuvre. For it is this lack of appreciation that constrains

options when the future eventually becomes today. Intertemporal trade-offs are of
the essence.
In this Annual Report, we update and further explore some of these themes
and the tough analytical and policy challenges they raise. This chapter provides an
overview of the issues. It looks first at the evolution of the global economy during
the past year. It then digs deeper into some of the forces at play, putting the elements
of needed macroeconomic realignments in a longer-term perspective and assessing
the risks ahead. The chapter concludes with the resulting policy considerations.

The global economy: salient developments in the past year
By and large, the performance of the global economy in the year under review
traced patterns seen in previous years, with signs of recurrent tension between
macroeconomic developments and financial markets.
Global output again grew more slowly than expected, although at 3.2% in 2015
it was only slightly lower than in 2014 and not far from its 1982–2007 average
(Chapter III). On balance, the projected rotation of growth from emerging market
economies (EMEs) to advanced economies failed to materialise, as advanced economies
did not strengthen enough to compensate for weakness in commodity-exporting
EMEs. At the time of writing, consensus forecasts point to growth strengthening
gradually in advanced economies and bouncing back more strongly in EMEs.
Labour markets proved more resilient. In most advanced economies, including
all the largest jurisdictions, unemployment rates continued to decline. By the end
of 2015, the aggregate rate was down to 6.5%, its level in 2008 before the bulk
of its surge during the crisis. Even so, in some cases, unemployment remained
uncomfortably high, notably in the euro area and among the young. The picture
was more mixed in EMEs, with major weakness as well as some strength, but their
aggregate unemployment rate edged up slightly.
This differential performance – improving employment but moderate output
growth – points to weak productivity growth, the first element of the risky trinity
(Graph I.3, left-hand panel). Productivity growth remained on the low side,
continuing the long-term decline that had been visible at least in advanced
economies and that had accelerated in those hit by the crisis.
Inflation stayed generally subdued, except in some EMEs – notably in Latin
America – that experienced sharp currency depreciations (Chapter IV). In the largest
advanced economies that are home to international currencies, underlying (core)
inflation, while remaining below targets, moved up even as headline rates remained
considerably lower. Low inflation also prevailed in much of Asia and the Pacific and
in smaller advanced economies.
Once more, a critical factor in these developments was the further drop in
prices for commodities, especially oil. After some signs of a pickup during the first
half of last year, oil prices resumed their plunge before recovering somewhat in
recent months. The generalised drop in commodity prices helps explain growth
patterns across commodity exporters and importers (Chapter III). The resultant
contraction in commodity exporters was only partly offset by currency depreciations
against the backdrop of an appreciating US dollar. Similarly, the commodity price
declines shed light on the wedge that opened up between headline and core
measures and on why the most uncomfortably high inflation rates went hand in
hand with weak economic activity (Chapter IV).
In the background, debt in relation to GDP continued to increase globally – the
second element of the risky trinity (Graph I.3, right-hand panel). In the advanced
economies worst hit by the crisis, some welcome reduction or stabilisation in

private sector debt tended to be offset by a further rise in the public sector.
Elsewhere, a further increase in private sector debt either accompanied that in the
public sector or outweighed the decline in the latter.
The financial sector’s performance was uneven (Chapter VI). In advanced
economies, banks quickly adapted to the new regulatory requirements by further
strengthening their capital base. Even so, non-performing loans remained very high
in some euro area countries. Moreover, even where economic conditions were
favourable, bank profitability was somewhat subdued. Worryingly, banks’ credit
ratings have continued to decline post-crisis, and price-to-book ratios still typically
languish below 1. In the past year, insurance companies did not fare much better. In
EMEs, with their generally more buoyant credit conditions, the banking picture
looked stronger. That said, it deteriorated where financial cycles had turned.
Financial markets alternated phases of uneasy calm and turbulence (Chapter II).
The proximate cause of the turbulence was anxiety about EME growth prospects,
especially China’s. A first bout of anxiety took hold in the third quarter and, after
markets had regained their composure, a second appeared in early 2016 – one of
the worst January sell-offs on record. This was followed by a briefer, if more intense,
turbulent phase in February, when banks found themselves at the centre of the
storm. Triggers included disappointing earnings announcements, regulatory
uncertainty concerning the treatment of contingent convertible securities (CoCos)
and, above all, worries about banks’ profits linked to expectations of persistently
lower interest rates following central bank moves. Thereafter, markets stabilised,
notably boosting asset prices and capital flows to EMEs once more.
The alternation of calm and turbulence left a clear imprint on financial markets.
By the end of the period, most equity markets were down even as price/earnings
ratios remained rather high by historical standards. Credit spreads were considerably
higher, especially in the energy sector and in many commodity-exporting countries.
The US dollar had appreciated against most currencies. And long-term yields were
plumbing new depths.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Against this backdrop, the room for macroeconomic policy manoeuvre
narrowed further – the third element of the risky trinity. This applies most obviously
to monetary policy (Chapter IV). True, the Federal Reserve began to raise the policy
rate after having kept it effectively at zero for seven years. But it subsequently
signalled that it would tighten more gradually than originally planned. At the same
time, monetary policy eased further in other key jurisdictions through both lower
interest rates and a further expansion in central bank balance sheets. The reduction
in room for manoeuvre also applies to some extent to fiscal policy (Chapters III and V).
With the fiscal stance in advanced economies turning, on balance, more neutral
or supportive of economic activity in the short term, the process of long-term
consolidation paused. In the meantime, fiscal positions weakened substantially in
EMEs, especially commodity exporters.

The global economy: interpretation and risks
It is tempting to look at the global economy over time as a set of unrelated frames
– or, in economists’ parlance, as a series of unexpected shocks that buffet it about.
But a more revealing approach may be to look at it as a movie, with clearly related
scenes. As the plot unfolds, the players find that what they did in the early part of
the movie inevitably constrains what they can reasonably do next – sometimes in
ways they had not anticipated. Again, in economists’ parlance, it is not just “shocks”
but “stocks” – the underlying circumstances that have evolved – that matter. This
suggested perspective may help to explain not only how we got here, but also what
the future might have in store.1 It is worth briefly reviewing the key features of the
movie.

Interpretation: a movie
As argued in previous Annual Reports, the movie that best describes the current
predicament of the global economy probably started many years back, even before
the crisis struck. And, in many respects, we may not yet have stepped out of the
long shadow of the crisis.
The crisis appears to have permanently reduced the level of output. Empirical
evidence increasingly indicates that growth following financial crises may recover
its previous long-term trend, but the output level typically does not. So, a
permanent gap opens up between the pre-crisis and post-crisis trend of the output
level (Chapter V). On this basis, given the almost unprecedented breadth and depth
of the recent crisis, it would be unrealistic to think that output could regain its precrisis trend. Hence the persistent disappointing outcomes and gradual ratcheting
down of potential output estimates.
All this would imply that, at least for a while, the crisis reduced the growth of
potential output. The persistent and otherwise puzzling slowdown in productivity
growth is consistent with this. There are many candidate explanations for the
mechanisms at work. But a possibly underappreciated one is the legacy of the
preceding outsize financial boom (Chapter III). Recent BIS research covering more
than 20 advanced economies and 40 years suggests three conclusions: financial
booms can undermine productivity growth as they occur; a good chunk of the
erosion typically reflects the shift of labour to sectors with lower productivity

growth; and, importantly, the impact of the misallocations that occur during a boom
appears to be much larger and more persistent once a crisis follows.
The corresponding effects on productivity growth can be substantial. Taking,
say, a five-year boom and five post-crisis years together, the cumulative impact
would amount to a loss of some 4 percentage points. Put differently, for the period
2008–13, the loss could equal about 0.5 percentage points per year for the
advanced economies that saw a boom and bust. This roughly corresponds to their
actual average productivity growth during the same window. The results suggest
that, in addition to the well known debilitating effects of deficient aggregate
demand, the impact of financial booms and busts on the supply side of the
economy cannot be ignored.
In this movie, the policy response successfully stabilised the economy during
the crisis, but as events unfolded, and the recovery proved weaker than expected,
it was not sufficiently balanced. It paid too little attention to balance sheet repair
and structural measures relative to traditional aggregate demand measures. In
particular, monetary policy took the brunt of the burden even as its effectiveness
was seriously challenged. After all, an impaired financial system made it harder for
easing to gain traction, overindebted private sector agents retrenched, and
monetary policy could do little to facilitate the needed rebalancing in the allocation
of resources. As the authorities pushed harder on the accelerator, the room for
manoeuvre progressively narrowed.
This had broader implications globally. For one, with domestic monetary policy
channels seemingly becoming less effective, the exchange rate rose in prominence
by default (Chapter IV). And resistance to unwelcome currency appreciation
elsewhere helped spread exceptionally easy monetary conditions to the rest of the
world, as traditional benchmarks attest (Graph I.4): easing induced easing. In addition,
the exceptionally easy monetary stance in the countries with international currencies,
especially the United States, directly boosted credit expansion elsewhere. From 2009

BIS 86th Annual Report

to the third quarter of 2015, US dollar-denominated credit to non-banks outside
the United States increased by more than 50%, to about $9.8 trillion; and to nonbanks in EMEs, it doubled to some $3.3 trillion. Global liquidity surged as financing
conditions in international markets eased (Chapter III).
In sum, we witnessed a rotation in financial booms and busts around the world
after the crisis. The private sector in the advanced economies at the heart of the
crisis slowly started to deleverage; elsewhere, especially but not only in EMEs, the
private sector accelerated the pace of releveraging as it left behind the memory of
the 1997–98 Asian crisis. Signs of unsustainable financial booms began to appear
in EMEs in the form of strong increases in credit and property prices and, as in
previous episodes, foreign currency borrowing. Currency appreciations failed to
arrest the tide. In fact, as BIS research suggests, they may have even encouraged
risk-taking, as they seemingly strengthened the balance sheet of foreign currency
borrowers and induced lenders to grant more credit (the “risk-taking channel”)
(Chapters III and IV).
Crucially, the prices of commodities, especially oil, reinforced these developments
– hence all the talk about a commodity “supercycle” (Chapter III). On the one hand,
the strong growth of more energy-intensive EMEs drove prices higher. China, the
marginal buyer of a wide swathe of commodities, played an outsize role as it
embarked on a major fiscal and credit-fuelled expansion after the crisis, thereby
reversing the sharp, crisis-induced drop in prices and giving the commodity boom
a new lease of life. On the other hand, easy monetary and financial conditions
boosted commodity prices further. And as prices soared, they reinforced the
financial booms and easy external liquidity conditions for many commodity
producers. The mutually reinforcing feedback gained momentum.
What we have been witnessing over the past year may be the beginning of a
major, inevitable and needed realignment in which these various elements reverse
course. Domestic financial cycles have been maturing or turning in a number of
EMEs, not least China, and their growth has slowed. Commodity prices have fallen.
More specifically, a combination of weaker consumption and more ample production
has put further pressure on the oil price. In addition, actual and expected US
monetary policy tightening against the backdrop of continued easing elsewhere
has supported US dollar appreciation. This in turn has tightened financing
conditions for those that borrowed heavily in the currency (Chapter III).
We have also seen that this realignment is neither smooth nor steady. Rather, it
slows or accelerates as market expectations change. Indeed, since the financial
market turbulence in early 2016, oil prices have recovered and the US dollar has
lost some of the ground gained earlier. In some cases, these market shifts reflect
shocks of a more political nature, such as uncertainties around the UK referendum
on continued EU membership. But mostly they are in response to the same
underlying forces that have been shaping the global economy for a long time:
shifting expectations of monetary policy, the evolution of borrowing costs in major
currencies, and further credit-fuelled stimulus in China. In the end, it is the stocks,
and far less the shocks, that are driving the global adjustment.
Two factors stand out in this narrative: debt and the cumulative impact of past
decisions.
Debt can help better explain what would otherwise appear as independent
bolts from the blue (Chapter III). First, it sheds light on the EMEs’ slowdown and on
global growth patterns. Debt is at the heart of domestic financial cycles and of the
tightening of financing conditions linked to foreign currency borrowing. This is
most evident for commodity producers, especially oil exporters, who have seen
their revenues and collateral strength collapse – hence the large holes in fiscal
accounts and big investment cuts. And debt may be one reason why the boost to

BIS 86th Annual Report

13

consumption in oil-importing countries has been disappointing: households have
been shoring up their balance sheets.
Second, debt provides clues about the currency movements in the past year
and their impact on output. Foreign currency debt reinforces the pressure on
domestic currencies to depreciate and hence on the funding currency, largely the
US dollar, to appreciate. Chinese companies’ sizeable repayments of US dollar debt
are an obvious example. And empirical evidence suggests that high foreign
currency debt weakens, and may even completely offset, the expansionary trade
effect of depreciations (Chapter III).
Third, debt hints at one reason for the oil price weakness beyond the influence
of more familiar factors. During the recent commodity boom, oil and gas companies
borrowed heavily on the back of unusually easy financing conditions. Their bonds
outstanding increased from $455 billion in 2006 to $1.4 trillion in 2014, or by 15%
per year; and their syndicated loans rose from $600 billion to $1.6 trillion, 13% per
year. Shale producers and EME state-owned oil companies accounted for much of
the borrowing. As their financial condition deteriorated, they came under pressure
to keep the spigots open to meet their debt service burdens and to hedge even
more their dwindling revenues.
Finally, debt may even shed light on the puzzling slowdown in productivity
growth. When used wisely, credit is a powerful driver of healthy economic growth.
But as the previous evidence indicates, unchecked credit booms can be part of the
problem and leave a long shadow after the bust, sapping productivity growth. In
addition, debt overhangs depress investment, which weakens productivity further. In
turn, weaker productivity makes it harder to sustain debt burdens, closing the loop.
The cumulative impact of past decisions is behind the narrowing room for
policy manoeuvre. At any given time, the reduced set of options and political
constraints make it tempting to seek to solve the problems by boosting aggregate
demand regardless of means and circumstances. But untailored measures may risk
wasting ammunition and fail to address the obstacles that hold back growth. If so,
over time policy choices become increasingly constrained. And when tomorrow
eventually becomes today, one may discover that short-term gains have brought
long-term pain and worsened policy trade-offs. We return to this issue below.

Secular stagnation – or financial booms gone wrong?
This possible interpretation of the post-crisis global growth slowdown differs in key
respects from one that has been gaining currency – secular stagnation. It suggests
rather that the world is better regarded as having suffered a series of financial
booms gone wrong. Consider, admittedly in a very stylised form, the main
differences in the two views.
The most popular variant of the secular stagnation hypothesis posits that the
world has been haunted by a structural deficiency in aggregate demand. This
deficiency predates the crisis and is driven by a range of deep-seated factors,
including population ageing, unequal income distribution and technological
advances. In this view, the pre-crisis financial boom was the price to pay for having
the economy run at potential. The key symptom of the malaise is the decline in real
interest rates, short and long, which points to endemic disinflationary pressures.
In the hypothesis proposed here, the world has been haunted by an inability to
restrain financial booms that, once gone wrong, cause long-lasting damage. The
outsize and unsustainable financial boom that preceded the crisis masked and
exacerbated the decline in productivity growth. And rather than being the price to
pay for satisfactory economic performance, the boom contributed, at least in part,
to its deterioration, both directly and owing to the subsequent policy response. The

14

BIS 86th Annual Report

key symptom of the malaise is the decline in real interest rates, short and long,
alongside renewed signs of growing financial imbalances.
As discussed in detail in last year’s Annual Report, the interpretation of
exceptionally and persistently low interest rates is indeed critical. According to the
secular stagnation view and prevailing perspectives more generally, these rates are
a long-run equilibrium phenomenon – they are necessary to fill a global shortfall in
demand that existed even before the crisis. In that view, the behaviour of inflation
provides the key signal. According to the view proposed here, interest rates cannot
be fully at equilibrium if they contribute to financial imbalances that, at some point,
will cause serious economic damage. Likewise, inflation is a highly imperfect gauge
of sustainable economic expansions, as became evident pre-crisis. This would
especially be expected in a highly globalised world in which competitive forces and
technology have eroded the pricing power of both producers and labour and have
made the wage-price spirals of the past much less likely.
Adjudicating between these two hypotheses is exceedingly hard. One might
make several points against the secular stagnation hypothesis, initially developed
for the United States. It is not easily reconciled with that country’s large, pre-crisis
current account deficit – indicating that domestic demand actually exceeded output.
The world in those years was seeing record growth rates and record low
unemployment rates – not a sign of global demand shortfalls. Ageing populations
also affect supply, not just demand – hence the prospect of lower growth unless
productivity growth is raised. Finally, the decline in unemployment rates, in many
cases to levels close to historical norms or estimates of full employment, is
seemingly more indicative of supply constraints than of demand shortfalls.
But counterfactuals mean that empirical evidence cannot be conclusive,
leaving the door open to contrasting interpretations. In this Report, we present
several pieces of evidence consistent with the importance of financial booms and
busts. We find that financial cycle proxies can help provide estimates of potential
output and output gaps in real time – as events unfold – that are more accurate
than those commonly used in policymaking based on traditional macroeconomic
models and inflation (Chapter V). This finding dovetails with the well known weak
empirical link between inflation and measures of domestic slack as well as with
the previous evidence on the impact of credit booms on productivity growth. In
Chapter IV, we also find that international supply chains can be a powerful
mechanism through which global factors impinge on domestic inflation, regardless
of domestic capacity constraints. And we find that variants of such financial cycle
measures can help tease out estimates of equilibrium interest rates that are higher
than commonly thought.
Importantly, all estimates of long-run equilibrium interest rates, be they short
or long rates, are inevitably based on some implicit view about how the economy
works. Simple historical averages assume that over the relevant period the
prevailing interest rate is the “right” one. Those based on inflation assume that it is
inflation that provides the key signal; those based on financial cycle indicators – as
ours largely are – posit that it is financial variables that matter. The methodologies
may differ in terms of the balance between allowing the data to drive the results
and using a priori restrictions – weaker restrictions may provide more confidence.
But invariably the resulting uncertainty is very high.
This uncertainty suggests that it might be imprudent to rely heavily on market
signals as the basis for judgments about equilibrium and sustainability. There is no
guarantee that over any period of time the joint behaviour of central banks,
governments and market participants will result in market interest rates that are set
at the right level, ie that are consistent with sustainable good economic performance
(Chapter II). After all, given the huge uncertainty involved, how confident can we

BIS 86th Annual Report

15

be that the long-term outcome will be the desirable one? Might not interest rates,
just like any other asset price, be misaligned for very long periods? Only time and
events will tell.

Risks
The previous analysis points to a number of risks linked to the interaction between
financial developments and the macroeconomy.
The first risk concerns the possible macroeconomic dislocations arising from
the combination of two factors: tightening global liquidity and maturing domestic
financial cycles. It is as if two waves with different frequencies merged to form a
more powerful one. Signs that this process was taking hold appeared in the second
half of 2015, when foreign currency borrowing peaked and conditions tightened
for some borrowers, especially among commodity producers. After the turbulence
at the beginning of 2016, however, external financial conditions generally eased,
also taking the pressure off the turn in domestic financial cycles. And in China, the
authorities provided yet another boost to total credit expansion in an attempt to
stave off a drastic turn and smooth out the needed economic rebalancing towards
domestic demand and services. As a result, tensions in EMEs have diminished,
although the underlying vulnerabilities remain. Events often unfold in slow motion
for a long time and then suddenly accelerate.
Since past crises, EMEs have taken strides to strengthen their economies and
make them more resilient to external influences. Their macroeconomic frameworks
are sounder; their financial infrastructures and regulatory arrangements are
stronger; and flexible exchange rates coupled with large foreign exchange war
chests enhance the room for policy manoeuvre. For instance, despite the worst
recession on record, Brazil has not yet had an external crisis, in part thanks to its
extensive use of foreign exchange reserves to insulate the corporate sector from
losses. In addition, at least so far, the increase in loan losses has been contained.
More generally, EMEs’ foreign currency debt as a share of GDP is smaller than it was
before previous financial crises.
Even so, prudence is called for. In some of these economies, the increase in
domestic debt has been substantial and well beyond historical norms. The corporate
sector has been very prominent, and it is there that the surge in foreign currency
debt has concentrated even as profitability has declined to levels below those in
advanced economies, notably in the commodities sector (Chapter III). While the
reduction in that debt appears to have begun, most notably in China, poor data on
currency mismatches make it hard to assess vulnerabilities. The growth of new
market players, especially asset managers, could complicate the policy response to
strains by changing the dynamics of distress and testing central banks’ ability to
provide liquidity support. In addition, EMEs’ greater heft and tighter integration in
the global economy indicate that the impact of any strains on the rest of the world
would be bigger than in the past, through both financial and trade channels
(Chapter III).
The second risk concerns the persistence of exceptionally low interest rates,
increasingly negative even in nominal terms and in some cases even lower than
what central banks expected. This risk has a long fuse, with the damage less
immediately apparent and growing gradually over time. Such rates tend to depress
risk premia and stretch asset valuations, making them more vulnerable to a reversal
by encouraging financial risk-taking and raising their sensitivity to disappointing
economic news (snapback risk) (Chapter II). They sap the strength of the financial
system by eroding banks’ net interest margins, raising insurance companies’ return
mismatches and greatly boosting the value of pension fund liabilities (Chapter VI).

16

BIS 86th Annual Report

And over time they can have a debilitating impact on the real economy. This effect
occurs through the channels just discussed, including by weakening banks’ lending
capacity. But it also arises by encouraging the further build-up in debt and by no
longer steering scarce resources to their most productive uses. In effect, the longer
such exceptional conditions persist, the harder exit becomes. Negative nominal rates
raise uncertainty further, especially when they reflect policy choices (see below).
The third risk concerns a loss of confidence in policymakers. The more time
wears on, the more the gap between the public’s expectations and reality weighs
on their reputation. A case in point is monetary policy, which has been left to
shoulder an overwhelming part of the burden of getting economies back on track.
Once the crisis broke out, monetary policy proved essential in stabilising the
financial system and in preventing it from causing a bigger collapse in economic
activity. But despite extraordinary and prolonged measures, monetary policymakers
have found it harder to push inflation back in line with objectives and to avoid
disappointing gains in output. In the process, financial markets have grown
increasingly dependent on central banks’ support and the room for policy
manoeuvre has narrowed. Should this situation be stretched to the point of shaking
public confidence in policymaking, the consequences for financial markets and the
economy could be serious. Worryingly, we saw the first real signs of this happening
during the market turbulence in February.

The global economy: policy
The previous analysis contains useful clues about policy. Some relate to what policy
should do now, not least an urgent rebalancing away from the excessive burden
placed on monetary policy. Others relate to the frameworks’ architecture. It may be
helpful to take them in reverse order, so that one does not lose sight of the final
destination when embarking on the journey.

Towards a macro-financial stability framework
The destination is a set of arrangements that systematically incorporate financial
stability considerations into traditional macroeconomic analysis – what in the past
we have termed a “macro-financial stability framework”.2 The framework is intended
to more effectively tackle the financial booms and busts that cause so much
economic damage. At a minimum, it would encompass prudential, monetary and
fiscal policies with strong support from structural measures. Its key operational
feature is that authorities would lean more deliberately against financial booms and
less aggressively and, above all, less persistently against financial busts.
This more symmetrical policy over financial cycles could help moderate them
and avoid the progressive loss of policy room that is arguably a serious shortcoming
of current arrangements. One symptom of that loss is the relentless increase in the
debt-to-GDP ratio, both private and public. Another is exceptionally low policy
rates. While part of their decline in real terms surely reflects secular factors beyond
policymakers’ control, part probably also reflects policymakers’ asymmetrical
response, which can contribute to the build-up of financial imbalances and to their
long-term costs for output and productivity. This raises the risk of a debt trap,
whereby, as debt increases, it becomes harder to raise rates without causing damage.

framework’s features, see Chapter I in the 84th and 85th Annual Reports.

And it means that, over sufficiently long horizons, low interest rates become to some
extent self-validating. Low rates in the past help shape the economic environment
policymakers take as given when tomorrow becomes today. In this sense, low rates
beget lower rates (see below).
How much progress has been made in prudential, fiscal and monetary policies?

Prudential policy
Prudential policy has made the biggest strides. The strategy has been to build
arrangements with a strong systemic (macroprudential) orientation based on solid
foundations. With the support of the international community, national authorities
over the past year have taken further steps to set up or implement macroprudential
frameworks designed mainly to strengthen resilience and to restrain the build-up of
financial imbalances. While this is still a work in progress, the direction is clearly set.
In bank regulation, a priority in the current year is to finalise the Basel III
framework. In doing so, it will be critical to ensure that the level of capital is
commensurate with the underlying risks. As recent BIS research confirms, the public
debate tends to underestimate the benefits of capital as the very foundation of
lending and to overestimate its costs (Chapter VI). Across banks, higher capital goes
hand in hand with lower funding costs and higher lending. Stronger banks lend more.
A question that has come to the fore in the period under review is the link
between regulatory reforms and market liquidity (Chapters II and VI). In the past
couple of years, sharp moves in the prices of the most liquid sovereign bonds in the
world – US Treasuries and German bunds – have heightened concerns about the
fragility of liquidity conditions. More generally, signs of lower secondary market
liquidity in a number of fixed income markets and of smaller broker-dealer inventories
have been linked to regulation-induced balance sheet costs and other restrictions.
Evidence that financial institutions may be less willing than in the past to commit
their balance sheets to the arbitraging of asset pricing relationships has pointed in
the same direction (Chapter II).
Such claims must be assessed in a broad context, as changes in market liquidity
dynamics have many sources. In the case of fixed income markets, for instance, the
spread of electronic trading platforms and of algorithmic and high-frequency
trading has played a key role. Likewise, the growth of the asset management
industry has probably increased the net demand for liquidity services. And since
the crisis, banks’ management and shareholders have taken a much more critical
view of the risk-return trade-off in the trading business. Even more importantly,
liquidity was grossly underpriced pre-crisis, contributing to its evaporation under
stress – such gross underpricing is a problem we definitely do not want to revive.
The best structural safeguard against fair-weather liquidity and its damaging power
is to avoid the illusion of permanent market liquidity and to improve the resilience
of financial institutions. Stronger capital and liquidity standards are not part of the
problem but an essential part of the solution. Stronger market-makers mean more
robust market liquidity.

Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy is a critical missing element in a macro-financial stability framework.
Financial stability generally, and financial cycles in particular, have hardly featured
in fiscal policy design, whether for short-term macroeconomic objectives or longterm sustainability. Yet history indicates that financial crises can wreak havoc with
fiscal positions; conversely, the design of fiscal policy can have a substantial impact
on financial stability. And one should not underestimate the risk of a doom loop,

18

BIS 86th Annual Report

whereby weaknesses in public and private sector balance sheets feed into each
other. That is why we devote a whole chapter to these issues (Chapter V).
Protecting the sovereign from financial stability risks requires that they be
properly identified and mapped into fiscal positions. By hugely flattering the fiscal
accounts, financial booms have all too often lulled the authorities into a false sense
of security. Outsize and unsustainable booms artificially boost estimates of potential
output, growth and sustainable tax revenues and mask the contingent liabilities
linked with the public funds needed to support financial repair once a crisis erupts.
We suggest ways in which better estimates of underlying fiscal positions can be
produced and included in broader assessments of fiscal space.
Conversely, protecting the financial system from the sovereign has several
dimensions. One is how to treat sovereign risks in prudential regulation and
supervision. A critical issue is the treatment of credit risk, which is under revision in
the Basel III framework. The paramount principle is that the prudential standard
should be commensurate with the risk. This would also limit the danger of
unlevelling the playing field between the private and public sectors, further weakening
the growth engine. But the devil is in the details, and the sovereign poses multifaceted
risks that give rise to trade-offs. For instance, the sovereign’s ability to “print money”
reduces, although does not eliminate, credit risk. But it may do so at the expense of
inflation risk and, hence, interest rate and market risk. The balance sheet of the
sovereign underpins an economy’s soundness. One can run, but one cannot hide.
Ultimately, there is no substitute for a sound fiscal position with enough policy space
to avoid macroeconomic instability and support the financial system if the need arises.
One can then go a step further and think about how best to use fiscal policy
more actively to mitigate financial stability risks. One possibility is to make it more
countercyclical with respect to the financial cycle. Another, more structural approach
is to reduce implicit guarantees, which may encourage risk-taking. Yet another is to
use the tax code to restrict or eliminate the bias of debt over equity or to attenuate
financial cycles (eg through time-varying taxes in the property market). Each of
these complementary options raises well known and tricky implementation
challenges. Some options have already been used. They all deserve further in-depth
consideration.

Monetary policy
Monetary policy is at a crossroads. On the one hand, there is a growing recognition
that it can contribute to financial instability by fuelling financial booms and risktaking and that price stability does not guarantee financial stability. On the other
hand, there is a reluctance to have it play a prominent role in preventing financial
instability. The prevailing view is that it should be activated only if prudential policy
– the first line of defence – does not prove up to the task. The development of
macroprudential frameworks has provided an additional reason to adhere to this
sort of “separation principle”.
As we have in previous Annual Reports, we argue for a more prominent
monetary policy role. It would be imprudent to rely exclusively on (macro)prudential
measures. Financial cycles are too powerful – witness signs of a build-up of financial
imbalances in a number of EMEs that have actively deployed such measures. And
there is a certain tension in pressing on the accelerator and the brake at the same
time, as policymakers would do if they, say, cut interest rates and simultaneously
sought to offset their impact on financial stability by tightening prudential
requirements. True, the relative reliance on monetary and macroprudential measures
must depend on circumstances and country-specific features, not least the
exchange rate and capital flows (Chapter IV). But the two sets of tools arguably

BIS 86th Annual Report

19

work best when they operate in the same direction. At a minimum, therefore,
monetary frameworks should allow for the possibility of tightening policy even if
near-term inflation appears under control.
This year we explore this reasoning further by considering in more detail the
trade-offs involved in such a strategy (Chapter IV). Under what conditions do the
costs of using monetary policy to lean against financial imbalances outweigh
the benefits? The answer is not straightforward. But we suggest that some of the
standard analyses may underestimate the potential benefits by underestimating the
costs of financial instability and the capacity of monetary policy to influence it. In
addition, there is a certain tendency to interpret “leaning” too narrowly. Accordingly,
the central bank follows a “normal” inflation-oriented strategy most of the time
and deviates from it only once signs of financial imbalances become evident. This
raises the risk of doing too little too late or, worse, of being seen as precipitating
the very outcome one is trying to avoid.
It may be more useful to think of a financial stability-oriented monetary policy
as one that takes financial developments systematically into account during both
good and bad times. The objective would be to keep the financial side of the
economy on an even keel. Some preliminary findings suggest that by augmenting a
standard policy rule with simple financial cycle proxies, it may be possible to
mitigate financial booms and busts, with considerable long-run output gains. Such
a strategy could also limit the decline in the long-run equilibrium or natural rate of
interest – the “low rates beget lower rates” phenomenon.
Of course, the issues raise daunting analytical challenges. These findings are
subject to a number of caveats and represent just one contribution to the debate.
They do suggest, though, that it may be imprudent to implement a selective
leaning policy. They also point to frameworks that allow sufficient flexibility not just
when financial imbalances are well advanced but throughout the financial cycle,
during both booms and busts. And they highlight how current decisions can
constrain future policy options.

What to do now?
Our analysis suggests that different policies could have taken us to a better place.
Trade-offs have deteriorated and policy options have narrowed. What, then, could
be done now?
A key priority is to rebalance the policy mix away from monetary policy – a
need the international policy community has now fully recognised. In doing so,
though, it is essential to focus not only on the near-term issues but above all on the
longer-term ones. But how? Consider, in turn, prudential, fiscal, monetary and
structural policies.
For prudential policy the priority, in addition to completing the reforms, is
twofold, depending on countries’ specific circumstances. In crisis-hit countries, it is
essential to finalise banks’ balance sheet repair, which is still lagging in a number of
jurisdictions, and restore the basis for sustained profitability. To maximise banks’
internal resources, where appropriate, restrictions on dividend payments should not
be ruled out. Critically, the process may require the support of fiscal policy as the
public sector balance sheet is brought to bear on bank resolutions. Ensuring that
banks have pristine balance sheets and are well capitalised is the best way to relieve
pressure on other policies and improve their traction. Moreover, restoring the
banking sector’s long-term profitability also calls for eliminating excess capacity, a
process for which tight supervision can be the catalyst.
In non-crisis-hit countries, where financial booms are more advanced or have
turned, it is essential to strengthen defences against possible financial strains. The

20

BIS 86th Annual Report

authorities should continue to actively rely on macroprudential tools. And they
should intensify supervisory vigilance to quickly identify and resolve any
deterioration in asset quality.
For fiscal policy, the priority is to help strengthen the foundations for
sustainable growth, avoiding destabilising debt dynamics. One mechanism is to
improve the quality of public spending, which is already close to record highs in
relation to GDP in many countries, notably by shifting the balance away from
current transfers towards investment in both physical and human capital. A second
mechanism is to support balance sheet repair. A third is to use fiscal space to
complement structural reforms. A fourth is to judiciously carry out infrastructure
investments, where needed and provided proper governance is in place. A final, key
step is to reduce tax code distortions, including the bias towards debt.
In the process, it is important not to overestimate fiscal space. The long-term
commitments linked to an ageing society loom large. Debt is generally at an alltime high in relation to income. And the additional buffers needed for financial
stability risks can be sizeable (Chapter V). In some countries, the collapse of
commodity prices has already revealed the lack of policy room; and in those where
unsustainable financial booms are under way, this room may appear deceptively
large. The prevailing exceptionally low interest rates should not be taken as a
reliable guide to long-term decisions. They provide breathing space, but they will
have to return to more normal levels. The risk of having monetary policy become
subordinated to fiscal policy (“fiscal dominance”) is very real.
For monetary policy, the key is to rebalance the evaluation of risks in the
current global stance. The exceptionally accommodative policies in place are
reaching their limits. The balance between benefits and costs has been
deteriorating (Chapter IV). In some cases, market participants have begun to
question whether further easing can be effective, not least as its impact on
confidence is increasingly uncertain. Individual incremental steps become less
compelling once the growing distance from normality comes into focus. Hence,
accumulated risks and the need to regain monetary space could be assigned
greater weight in policy decisions. In practice, and with due regard to countryspecific circumstances, this means seizing available opportunities by paying greater
attention to the costs of extreme policy settings and to the risks of normalising too
late and too gradually. This is especially important for large jurisdictions
with international currencies, as they set the tone for monetary policy in the rest of
the world.
Such a policy shift relies on a number of prerequisites. First: a more critical
evaluation of what monetary policy can credibly do. Second: full use of the flexibility
in current frameworks to allow temporary but possibly persistent deviations of
inflation from targets, depending on the factors behind the shortfall. Third:
recognising the risk of overestimating both the costs of mildly falling prices and
the likelihood of destabilising downward spirals. Fourth: a firm and steady hand –
after so many years of exceptional accommodation and growing financial market
dependence on central banks, the road ahead is bound to be bumpy. Last: a
communication strategy that is consistent with the above and thus avoids the risk
of talking down the economy. Given the road already travelled, the challenges
involved are great, but they are not insurmountable.
The need to rebalance the policy mix puts a greater onus on structural policies.
Their implementation, of course, faces serious political economy obstacles. In
addition, they do not necessarily yield near-term results, although this depends
on the specific measures and their impact on confidence. But they provide the
surest way of removing impediments to growth, unlocking economies’ potential and
strengthening their resilience.

21

Unfortunately, in this area the gap between needs and achievements is
especially large. The importance of structural policies has been clearly recognised –
witness their salience in G20 deliberations. And so has the need to tailor them to
country-specific conditions, beyond the familiar calls for flexibility in goods and
labour markets and for fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. Yet the record
on implementation so far has been very disappointing, with countries falling far
short of their plans and aspirations. Redoubling efforts is essential.

In defence of central banking
The stakes in the required policy rebalancing are high – for the global economy, for
market participants and governments, and, not least, for central banks. From its
faltering initial steps in the 17th century, central banking has become indispensable
to macroeconomic and financial stability. Its performance at the height of the crisis
proved this once more. Independence, underpinned by transparency and
accountability, allowed central banks to act with the determination needed to put
the global economy back on the recovery path.
And yet the extraordinary burden placed on central banking since the crisis is
generating growing strains. During the Great Moderation, markets and the public
at large came to see central banks as all-powerful. Post-crisis, they have come to
expect the central bank to manage the economy, restore full employment, ensure
strong growth, preserve price stability and foolproof the financial system. But in
fact, this is a tall order on which the central bank alone cannot deliver. The
extraordinary measures taken to stimulate the global economy have sometimes
tested the boundaries of the institution. As a consequence, risks to its reputation,
perceived legitimacy and independence have been rising.
There is an urgent need to address these risks so that central banks can pursue
monetary and financial stability effectively. A prerequisite is greater realism about
what central banks can and cannot achieve. Without that, efforts are doomed to
fail in the longer run. A complementary priority is safeguarding central banks’
independence within a broader institutional framework that clearly distinguishes
between the responsibilities of central banks and those of other policymakers. This
has been fully recognised in the area of financial stability, hence the post-crisis
stepped-up efforts to create structured arrangements to pursue this shared task.
But it needs further thought in the area of traditional macroeconomic policy, where
the line between monetary and fiscal measures has become increasingly blurred.
Independence, backed by transparency and accountability, remains as critical as ever.

Conclusion
Judged by historical standards, the performance of the global economy in terms of
output, employment and inflation has not been as weak as the rhetoric sometimes
suggests. In fact, even the term “recovery” may not do full justice to its current
state (Chapter III). But a shift to more robust, balanced and sustainable expansion is
threatened by a “risky trinity”: debt levels that are too high, productivity growth
that is too low, and room for policy manoeuvre that is too narrow. The most
conspicuous sign of this predicament is interest rates that continue to be
persistently and exceptionally low and which, in fact, have fallen further in the
period under review. The global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the
debt-fuelled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture.

22

BIS 86th Annual Report

A shift of gears requires an urgent rebalancing of the policy mix. Monetary
policy has been overburdened for far too long. Prudential, fiscal and, above all,
structural policies must come to the fore. In the process, however, it is essential to
avoid the temptation to succumb to quick fixes or shortcuts. The measures must
retain a firm long-run orientation. We need policies that we will not once again
regret when the future becomes today.

II. Global financial markets: between uneasy calm
and turbulence

In 2015 and 2016, financial markets experienced alternating phases of calm and
turbulence. As in prior years, prices in core asset markets were keenly sensitive
to monetary policy developments. Weaknesses in the main emerging market
economies (EMEs), especially China, were again watched closely. Relative to a year
earlier, by end-May 2016 equity prices were lower; credit spreads higher; the dollar
had depreciated against most currencies; and bond yields were reaching new lows.
As bond yields fell to historical troughs in a number of countries, the share of
outstanding government bonds trading at negative yields reached new records.
Low yields reflected low term premia as well as a downward shift in expected future
rates. In response, investors sought returns in riskier market segments, which
supported asset prices. Standard metrics, such as nominal GDP growth in the case
of bonds or historical price/earnings (P/E) ratios for equities, pointed to signs of
overvaluation. Unease about such valuations, coupled with concerns about the global
outlook for growth, resulted in recurring sell-offs and bouts of volatility. Markets
appeared vulnerable to a sharp reversal of high valuations. Some outsize bond
price movements point to changes in market liquidity, but lower leverage should
support more robust liquidity under stress. At the same time, the persistence of low
yields could worsen financial system weaknesses over the longer term, through a
number of channels.
Persistent market anomalies spread further. Examples included a widening of
the cross-currency basis and negative US dollar interest rate swap spreads. These
anomalies partly reflected market-specific supply-demand imbalances, sometimes
reinforced by central bank actions. They also resulted from shifts in the behaviour
of large dealing institutions, which are now less active in arbitraging the anomalies
away.
The first section reviews market developments during the past year. The second
looks more closely at market valuations, with an emphasis on the role of very low
nominal and real interest rates and market liquidity conditions in fixed income
markets. The third explores the factors behind the emergence and persistence of
certain market anomalies in recent years.

A year of alternating calm and turbulence
Markets experienced periodic bouts of turbulence in 2015 and the first half of 2016,
which alternated with phases of uneasy calm. A common theme was the progressive
downward revision to the global growth outlook, particularly for EMEs (Chapter III).
As in previous years, markets were closely attuned to central bank decisions. But
market participants’ confidence in monetary policy’s ability to steer the economy
appeared to falter (Chapter IV). By May 2016, equity indices, commodity prices and
advanced economy benchmark bond yields were below their levels of a year earlier,
while both corporate and EME sovereign credit spreads were higher. Measures of
volatility were stable or higher (Graph II.1). EME currencies, while recouping some
of their losses, were in most cases weaker against the dollar compared with a year
earlier.

The first episode of market turbulence started in the third quarter of 2015,
when the growth prospects of a number of large advanced and emerging
economies were downgraded. The spotlight shone especially brightly on China,
which for several years had been seen as the global growth engine. A rapid rise in
equity prices in the first half of the year, fuelled in part by heavy retail margin
purchases, was reversed sharply over the summer (Graph II.2, left-hand panel). The
Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index collapsed from a high of 5,354 on 8 June 2015 to
3,026 on 26 August, while the high-tech-oriented ChiNext board fell even more
dramatically. In August, Chinese authorities altered their exchange rate mechanism,
allowing the renminbi to depreciate sharply against the US dollar (centre panel).
Such events shook confidence in China’s ability to achieve a “soft landing” scenario
after years of rapid credit-fuelled growth.
Concerns about China quickly spread to other economies and asset prices
in August and early September. EME currencies weakened against the dollar
(Graph II.2, right-hand panel) while the euro and yen strengthened. Equity prices
plunged, particularly in EMEs (Graph II.1, left-hand panel). Credit spreads started to
widen again (Graph II.1, centre panel). Volatility rose, especially for equities and
commodities (Graph II.1, right-hand panel). The plunge in commodity prices
weakened the economic prospects of commodity-exporting countries and of
commodity-producing firms, some of them heavily leveraged and with a large
weight in key equity and credit indices (Graph II.3).
Markets stabilised in October 2015, but in most cases did not recoup their
summer losses. Continued strong data for the United States reinforced the
expectation that the Federal Open Market Committee would at last tighten policy
at its December meeting. The likelihood of divergent monetary policies between
the United States, on the one hand, and the euro area and Japan, on the other,
contributed to renewed dollar strength (Graph II.4). However, when the hike did

take place on 16 December, ending eight years of near zero nominal policy rates,
markets took it in their stride, as the move had already been fully incorporated into
expectations.
The new year nevertheless brought a second bout of turbulence. The triggering
event was again economic news about China, as weak data signalled a sharper than
anticipated growth slowdown. Moreover, the arrival of fresh data soon led to a
downgrade in growth estimates for a number of other countries. From the start of
the year to mid-February, commodity markets weakened, with oil prices falling
below $30 per barrel, and major global equity indices dropping 10–20%. US highyield spreads widened by almost 200 basis points over this period. The high-yield
market was particularly vulnerable to turbulence since US energy producers had
issued a large volume of lower-quality debt in recent years.
In January, banks came under particular pressure. Their credit spreads widened
sharply and equity prices fell before partially recovering in the following months
(Graph II.5, left-hand panel). Signs of stress were particularly evident in the pricing
of European bank debt, with the prices of contingent convertible obligations
(CoCos) diving precipitously (Graph II.5, centre panel). Clearly, investors were still
learning about the risks associated with such relatively recent financial instruments.
Bank profits, especially in Europe, were seen as coming under growing pressure as
policy rates were cut further into negative territory and as an increasing proportion
of European government bonds traded at negative yields (Chapter VI). Consistent
with this development, ever deeper negative euro interbank rates initially went hand
in hand with wider bank credit spreads (Graph II.5, right-hand panel). Bank credit
spreads then partially recovered, following the ECB’s announcement on 10 March
of various policy measures, including the possibility for banks of borrowing from
the ECB at its negative deposit rate under certain conditions.
Weaker growth led to expectations of a longer-lasting, and in some cases
stronger, monetary policy stimulus. Government bond yields fell across the major

economies. The expected path of Federal Reserve tightening shifted downwards.
Central banks explored new stimulus measures, including expanded asset purchases
by the ECB and a shift to negative policy rates by the Bank of Japan (Box II.A). But
whereas in the past these measures might have buoyed markets, in early 2016 they
met with an indifferent or even negative response. While the end-January
announcement by the Bank of Japan of negative rates led at first to a rebound in
the Japanese stock market and a depreciation of the yen, Japanese banks’ stock
prices soon fell sharply and the yen strengthened as investors seemingly began
questioning whether monetary policy would be able to successfully stimulate the
economy.
The market episodes of July–September 2015 and January–February 2016
shared a number of common elements. Weaker global stock and credit markets,
and weakness in EME bonds and currencies, pointed to “risk-off” behaviour on the
part of investors and expectations of slower growth. Commodity prices weakened,
especially oil prices, highlighting the important role of oil producers in global
equity and credit indices.

Low-rate environment drives asset valuations
Government bond yields of advanced economies continued to fall during the
period under review (Graph II.4, left-hand panel). By May 2016, medium- and longterm bond yields stood well below the already very low levels observed in June 2015,
irrespective of whether monetary policy rates had been reduced (Germany, Japan,
Sweden), left unchanged (Switzerland, UK) or raised (US) since then (Graph II.6, lefthand and centre panels). Moreover, having been given an upward jolt following the
Bank of Japan’s decision to move to negative rates, the stock of sovereign bonds
trading at negative yields across the globe soared to new highs, reaching close to
$8 trillion by end-May (Graph II.6, right-hand panel).

Box II.A

The transmission of negative policy rates: initial experience

Looking for additional tools to achieve their inflation or exchange rate targets, five central banks – Danmarks
Nationalbank (DN), the European Central Bank (ECB), Sveriges Riksbank (RIX), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and,
more recently, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) – moved their policy rates below zero, traditionally seen as the lower bound
for nominal interest rates in the presence of physical currency offering a zero nominal rate of return.
The experience to date suggests that modestly negative policy rates have been transmitted to money markets
in much the same way as positive rates. The pass-through to short-term money market rates has been persistent
and the impact on trading volumes – already depressed by central banks’ abundant and cheap supply of reserves –
appears to have been small, in general. Problems with instruments designed with only positive nominal interest
rates in mind, such as constant net asset value money market funds, have so far not materialised.
The introduction of negative policy rates also coincided with a decrease in longer-maturity and higher-risk
yields. Isolating their impact precisely is not easy, though, owing to the simultaneous introduction or expansion of
central bank asset purchase programmes.
In contrast to what happened in money markets, the effect of negative policy rates on exchange rates was not
uniform and in some cases coincided with bouts of volatility. After the introduction of negative policy rates, the DN,
which maintains a nearly fixed exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro, saw the appreciation pressure on the krone subside.
The SNB, after announcing in December 2014 that rates would be negative on some sight deposits, had to
discontinue its exchange rate floor vis-à-vis the euro a month later. The SNB continued to accumulate foreign
exchange reserves even after it further lowered the interest rate on sight deposit accounts to –75 bp. In Japan, the
2.8% depreciation of the yen vis-à-vis the US dollar upon announcement of negative policy rates proved transitory
and was reversed in the following days.
While zero has not proved to be a technically binding lower bound for central bank policy rates, difficulties
associated with their transmission to various parts of the financial system have become more apparent over time.

In all jurisdictions, banks, motivated by deposit withdrawal concerns, have been reluctant to pass negative rates
through to retail depositors. Partly to limit the resulting impact on their net interest margins, some central banks
introduced exemption thresholds for negative remuneration, thereby limiting banks’ average cost of holding central
bank liabilities (Graph II.A, left-hand panel). Initially, there was also uncertainty as to how banks would treat their
“wholesale” depositors, but some banks are now passing on the costs in the form of negative wholesale deposit rates.
In some cases, banks have used exemption thresholds akin to those that central banks have applied to their reserves.
In Switzerland, banks adjusted selected lending rates, notably mortgage rates, upwards, even as the policy rate
was lowered to –75 bp (Graph II.A, centre panel). The Swiss experience suggests that banks’ ability to cope with the
relatively high cost of retail deposit funding (Graph II.A, right-hand panel) without increasing lending rates will
affect the technical room to keep interest rates in negative territory. This ability depends, among other factors, on
the degree of competition in the banking sector and the share of retail deposits in banks’ funding mix (Chapter VI).
In Denmark, where mortgage loans are mainly financed with pass-through bonds rather than deposits,
mortgage rates fell alongside money market rates, although mortgage markups edged up throughout 2015
(Graph II.A, centre panel). Yet, as most Danish mortgages have adjustable rates, there was uncertainty about the tax
treatment and the mechanics of dealing with negative mortgage bond coupons. Also, some investors, notably
insurers, were unwilling or unable to buy negative cash flow securities, creating a demand for instruments with
interest payments floored at zero.
So far, negative policy rates have not led to an abnormal jump in the demand for cash. However, anecdotal
evidence suggests that both financial and non-financial firms have started adapting to the new environment and
are seeking to adopt innovations that would reduce the costs associated with physical currency use.

unparalleled (Graph II.7, left-hand panel). Nominal 10-year bond yields, at between
–0.1 and 1.8% for these four countries, are also at or near record lows (Graph II.7,
centre panel). And while current 10-year real yields are not unprecedented when
compared with ex post real yields since 1900, they are at levels not seen since the
inflationary 1970s (Graph II.7, right-hand panel).
The historically low bond yields coincided with low estimated term premia. In
fact, estimates indicate that a significant part of the decline in nominal and real
bond yields in recent decades reflects a secular decline in term premia, which are
also at historical troughs (Graph II.8, left-hand panel).
Sudden jumps in term premia led to sharp yield increases in the second quarter
of 2015, in particular in the euro area (Graph II.8, centre panel). Euro area and
US term premia estimates then stabilised before edging down again in the second
half of the year. By contrast with historical experience, where US yield movements
have tended to drive those in other currencies, US bond yields came under pressure
when euro area bond yields fell, as investors chasing higher yields moved into
US Treasuries. And during the turbulence of early 2016, a global flight to quality
pushed down premia on government bonds further still.
Alongside term premia, expectations of future interest rates also played a
role (Graph II.8, right-hand panel). Between May and December 2015, the
expected average short-term interest rate in the United States over a 10-year
period rose some 40 basis points. This rise came to a halt and was partly reversed
in early 2016 as investors reassessed US monetary policy prospects. In the euro
area, the expectations component played a smaller role but still contributed to
lower yields.
Large-scale central bank purchases, possibly reinforced by financial institutions’
behaviour, weighed heavily on yields. For example, by end-2015 the Eurosystem
had increased its holdings of euro area government debt to almost 17%, while the
Bank of Japan held around 32% of outstanding Japanese government bonds.
Hedging by institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies may
have further boosted demand for government securities. And banks increasingly

favoured sovereign bond holdings, in part owing to financial regulatory reforms,
but also due to increased demand for collateral in financial transactions.
In this environment, some observers have asked whether government bonds
in the main currencies might be overvalued. Although it is difficult to define
overvaluation in the context of government bonds, various views have informed
the debate. Some have argued that both the natural real rate of interest and, to a
lesser extent, expected inflation have fallen substantially for the foreseeable future
in a number of advanced economies (Chapter IV). Others have noted that economic
growth, productivity, inflation and other macroeconomic fundamentals could well
revert to their pre-crisis levels. Even disregarding term premia, this second line of
argumentation would view current bond market valuations as overly rich.
Unusually low prevailing term premia are another piece of the puzzle. Bond
prices would be overvalued if zero or negative term premia turned out to be
unsustainable. True, term premia may not necessarily return to their pre-crisis levels:
for instance, inflation may be viewed as less of a long-term threat than in previous
years, or investors’ risk aversion may have changed. That said, it seems unlikely that
deeply negative term premia such as the ones estimated for the euro area can persist
indefinitely. The question then becomes when, and how fast, premia will normalise.
Comparing long-term bond yields with the evolution of nominal GDP suggests
that yields are indeed currently on the low side. Over the past 65 years or so, the broad
trends in nominal GDP growth and 10-year bond yields have lined up reasonably
well across the United States, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom (Graph II.9).
Most likely, the real bond yields and expected inflation components of nominal
yields have fluctuated in tandem with real GDP growth and inflation, respectively.
Currently, bond yields are somewhat below nominal GDP growth in all four countries.
If, for whatever reason, bond yields are “too low”, they could snap back at some
point as market expectations adjust. The size and potential disruption of a reversal
have less to do with the characteristics of day-to-day liquidity provision than with
the incidence of forced sales and financial institutions’ capacity to absorb the hit.

Despite the higher frequency of large price moves in recent years, there is no
convincing evidence of a structural decline in fixed income market liquidity
(Box II.B). That said, there is no doubt that such liquidity will evaporate under stress,
as it has always done in the past. Signs of liquidity illusion in the growing asset
management industry suggest caution. At the same time, stronger bank balance
sheets, lower broker-dealer leverage and better liquidity risk management should
all support more robust liquidity and help contain any damage from periods of
illiquidity (Chapter VI).
Alternatively, persistently low yields could end up having pernicious effects on
the economy and become to some extent self-validating. By sapping banks’
profitability and resilience, low yields may reduce banks’ capacity to support the
economy (Chapter VI). They may also distort financial and real economic decisions
more generally, for instance by encouraging unproductive firms to maintain
capacity or by inflating asset prices, thereby weakening productivity (Chapter III).
And they may encourage further debt build-up, which could make it harder for the
economy to withstand higher rates (Chapter IV).
Equity valuations have also come under scrutiny. As bond yields fell globally
post-crisis, equity prices rose, pushing up valuation metrics such as P/E ratios.
Stocks naturally became increasingly attractive relative to bonds while lower real
interest rates boosted the discounted value of future corporate earnings. Partly as a
result, cyclically adjusted P/E ratios in the United States and the United Kingdom
have stood well above their historical averages in the past few years (Graph II.10,
first two panels) – a possible sign of stretched valuations. The corresponding P/E
ratio for Japan has been below average, but that average has arguably been inflated
by the financial bubbles of the 1980s (Graph II.10, third panel). Moreover, the runup of US equities in recent years has coincided with sharply higher leveraged
positions (Graph II.10, last panel). And equity prices have also been supported by
very strong share buybacks, particularly in the United States. The nervousness
observed in global equity markets over the past year, with repeated sharp price
corrections, hints at investors’ unease with current valuations.
Corporate credit markets were subdued over the past year. Both investment
grade and high-yield credit spreads were higher in May 2016 than a year before in

Liquidity in fixed income markets

Some observers pointed to market developments in 2015 and 2016 as evidence of a structural decline in market
liquidity, particularly in fixed income markets. Large swings in some market segments were seen as evidence that
relatively small changes in positions had the potential to lead to outsize price shifts. Explanations for the apparently
different conditions varied: some argued that post-crisis regulation had hampered banks’ ability to provide liquidity,
while others pointed to the growing influence of complex trading strategies such as high-frequency trading (HFT).
This box takes a closer look at whether, and in what ways, fixed income market liquidity may have evolved.
Chapter VI discusses potential drivers and policy implications.
Market liquidity can be defined as “the ability to rapidly execute large financial transactions at low cost with
limited price impact”. The concept’s multifaceted nature suggests that liquidity should be measured by several
indicators.
Most indicators do not show a significant structural decline of liquidity in fixed income markets, or indeed
most other markets, in recent years. For one, bid-ask spreads, defined as the gaps between the prices at which
dealers are willing to buy and sell securities, have been rather stable and tight in major sovereign bond markets
(Graph II.B, first and second panels). By comparison, quoted depths (the amounts of securities available for trading
at the best prices) and average transaction sizes have fallen in some markets, but are not unusually low by historical
standards (Graph II.B, third and fourth panels).
What appears to have increased is the number of intense, and disorderly, but generally short-lived price
movements. The “flash rally” of 15 October 2014, when the 10-year US Treasury yield fell by 20 bp and then rose by
as much in a matter of minutes, is one such example. In other cases, adverse liquidity effects seemed to last longer.
During the “bund tantrum” of May–June 2015, for example, uncertainties related to the ECB’s asset purchase
programme led to a sharp rise in government bond yields. The 10-year German bund yield, in particular, rose
from 8 bp on 20 April to 98 bp on 10 June (Graph II.4, left-hand panel).
Although the explanations for these sudden changes in market conditions vary, the increased role of market
participants outside the traditional dealer community, such as principal trading firms (PTFs), is likely to have been a
major factor. The shift in trading activity from dealers to PTFs reflects the increasing use of electronic trading

platforms and the proliferation of trading algorithms in a number of key fixed income markets such as those for
major sovereign bonds. PTFs, on the one hand, have contributed to reducing trading costs and supporting liquidity
during normal market conditions. On the other hand, their complex and often opaque trading strategies have raised
questions about risks to market stability, and have created challenges for regulators and supervisors.
Overall, while stress events, such as the “flash rally” or the “bund tantrum”, imposed costs on some participants,
the system as a whole has continued to perform its primary functions – including price discovery, risk management
and asset allocation – rather well. Indeed, the decline in dealers’ risk tolerance and the improved pricing of risks,
supported by the new regulatory environment, should bring the costs of liquidity provision more into line with the
risks they generate for the financial system (Chapter VI).

the United States and the euro area as well as across EMEs (Graph II.1, centre panel),
although euro area spreads benefited from expected ECB purchases of corporate
bonds. In part, the general rise in spreads reflected the weakening economic outlook,
and in particular the rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of the energy sector
(Graph II.3).
Signs of a turn in the default cycle helped widen corporate credit spreads. In
the United States, the rise in the speculative grade default rate that had begun in
early 2015 continued uninterrupted throughout the review period, and credit
spreads followed upwards (Graph II.11, left-hand panel). For instance, according to
Moody’s estimates, having risen from 1.8% at the end of 2014 to 4.4% in April 2016,
the default rate was projected to rise above 6% by the beginning of 2017. In Europe,

the speculative grade default rate also edged up in the past year, albeit less than in
the United States (Graph II.11, centre panel). The sharper rise in the US default rate
was due partly to the relatively stronger importance of the energy sector there: a
greater number of corporate defaults in the United States occurred among energy
firms than in Europe, where only one energy sector default has been recorded in
the last three years (Graph II.11, right-hand panel).
Exchange rate developments also appear to have played a role in the pricing of
credit risk. In periods during which the dollar strengthened strongly relative to the
euro, US investment grade and high-yield spreads tended to rise sharply, and vice
versa (Graph II.12, left-hand and centre panels). This pattern was evident among
corporates in both the energy and non-energy sectors. Moreover, from 2015
onwards, with the euro relatively weak vis-à-vis the dollar, euro high-yield credit
spreads tended to trade significantly below those in the United States (Graph II.12,
right-hand panel). In the preceding years, before the dollar had strengthened
appreciably, euro credit spreads had been instead close to or higher than their
US counterparts. While the strong influence of oil producers on US credit spreads
has played a role, the relationship is also present among non-energy firms.
One possible explanation behind this pattern could be changing perceptions
of the growth outlook – and hence of corporate credit quality – resulting from
exchange rate swings. Similarly, a stronger dollar goes hand in hand with tighter
US financial conditions (Chapter III). Another possibility is that easier monetary policy
in the euro area tends to weaken the euro while at the same time inducing European
investors to seek higher-yielding investments such as euro area corporate bonds.

Market anomalies spread
The years since the Great Financial Crisis have been marked by a number of anomalies
in financial markets. Pricing relationships that in previous times would have been
rapidly eliminated through arbitrage have instead proved surprisingly persistent.

Cross-currency basis swap spreads offer one example (Box II.C). Such spreads
normally adjust to eliminate arbitrage opportunities between a forward position in
a given currency and the same position as constructed by a foreign currency swap
and a forward in a different currency. Indeed, this covered interest parity relationship
is taken for granted in economics textbooks. The relationship broke down during
the crisis, reflecting counterparty risk and funding liquidity shortages in certain
currencies. Since the crisis, concerns about banks’ credit quality and liquidity
shortages have diminished – but the anomaly has persisted.
A second example is US dollar interest rate swaps (Graph II.13). Normally, the
fixed rate offered on swaps against floating rate payments is a small, positive spread
over US Treasury yields. After all, the counterparty credit risk of the banks involved
in the transaction is somewhat higher than that of the US government. During the
crisis, investors’ flight to safety and growing counterparty risk concerns drove these
spreads to high levels. But in 2010, and again in late 2015, the spreads were actually
negative for US dollar swaps, while remaining positive for euro swaps (Graph II.13,
left-hand panel).
These anomalies reflect a combination of factors.
One set of factors relates to supply and demand conditions in underlying asset
markets. For example, central banks’ large-scale purchases of government securities
represented a new and largely price-insensitive source of demand. The end of Fed
purchases, reinforced by sales of Treasury bonds by some EME official reserve
holders, may have created temporary excess supply that drove US bond yields above
dollar swap rates. An indication of these conditions is that dealers’ inventories of
US Treasuries soared as they stepped in to meet the supply (Graph II.13, centre panel).
A second, related set of factors involves hedging demand. Shifts in the perceived
likelihood and timing of higher US rates will shift US dollar borrowers’ demand for
receiving fixed rates via swaps. The same is true for those attempting to hedge
currency risk via cross-currency basis swaps. In currency swap markets, given

exceptionally low yields, there have been signs that large institutional investors
boosted their investments abroad on a currency-hedged basis, putting strains on
the corresponding instruments’ prices. The footprints of hedging demand have also
been visible in the implied volatility of swaptions (options to enter into swaps),
which jumped (particularly in euros) in early 2015 (Graph II.13, right-hand panel).
A third factor relates to a reduced willingness or ability to arbitrage, an activity
that requires both capital and funding, and is balance sheet-intensive. Large dealer
banks play a central role in maintaining these arbitrage relationships, either through
their own position-taking or by providing funding to others such as hedge funds. In
response to the large losses incurred on their trading activities during the Great
Financial Crisis, banks in many jurisdictions have reappraised the risk/return tradeoff of their business lines, including proprietary trading and market-making.
Moreover, structural reforms, such as the US Volcker rule, as well as bank capital
and liquidity requirements, have been tightened to enhance bank resilience and
induce a more accurate pricing of risks, reducing the scope for banks to tightly
price away arbitrage opportunities (Chapter VI).1

See L Andersen, D Duffie and Y Song, “Funding value adjustments”, mimeo, 10 March 2016, who
argue that well documented pricing “anomalies” in derivatives markets can be traced back to
so-called funding value adjustments that incorporate the cost of funding the cash or collateral
needed to enter or maintain unsecured derivatives positions – a reflection of more comprehensive
collateralisation and wider bank funding spreads post-crisis.

Box II.C

Understanding the cross-currency basis: why does covered
interest parity not hold?

One of the most puzzling recent anomalies has been the re-emergence of the cross-currency basis (the basis) or,
equivalently, the widespread violation of covered interest rate parity (CIP). With a non-zero basis, cross-currency
swap counterparties face interest rates that do not match prevailing cash market rates, even though currency risk
has been fully hedged: those borrowing dollars by swapping out of yen or euros pay much more than the prevailing
US money market rates, while those swapping out of Australian dollars pay less (Graph II.C.1, left-hand panel).
As traditional thinking goes, this should open up an arbitrage opportunity, because those with access to both
money markets, typically banks, can “collect the basis” by lending the currencies that command a premium in crosscurrency swaps. Hence, in the past, CIP violations were confined to periods of market stress. During the turmoil of
2007–2012, the basis widened when banks that needed dollars lost access to wholesale funding owing to credit risk
concerns and the withdrawal of US money market funds. The basis then narrowed again when central banks
provided US dollar funding and bank credit risk improved. However, since mid-2014, CIP deviations have reemerged even as counterparty risks and wholesale funding strains have faded.
How can this be? Such anomalies can persist when strong investor demand runs into the market’s capacity to
conduct arbitrage. The demand to raise US dollars in cross-currency funding markets stems largely from banks’
own use of swaps to hedge foreign currency loans and bond holdings as part of their business models, and from
institutional investors’ desire to hedge their US dollar bonds. At the same time, limits to arbitrage appear to have
arisen from banks’ reduced ability or willingness to use their balance sheets to take the other side of the trades in
the forward/swap markets, which would have kept the basis near zero. A difficulty in taking this framework to the
data is that banks are involved at all stages: swapping out of home currencies to fund US dollar lending, hedging
US dollar bond holdings, supplying US dollars via swaps to collect the basis, and simply making markets in currency
swaps. Still, the available evidence is broadly consistent with it.

Drivers of supply-demand imbalances. First, banks’ own demand to hold foreign currency assets on a hedged
basis – or to fund domestic currency assets with hedged foreign currency – pushes the basis away from zero. In the
yen and the euro, banks’ funding of dollar assets reinforces the pressures on the basis stemming from institutional
investors’ hedging of dollar securities. Hence, Japanese and euro area banks pay up for dollar funding in the form of
the basis. (This is exactly the opposite of an arbitrageur who collects that basis by supplying dollar funding via
swaps.) In contrast, Australian banks raise foreign currency abroad to fund domestic currency mortgages, thus

40

BIS 86th Annual Report

supplying US dollars via swaps to Australian institutional investors that need to borrow dollars to hedge their dollar
bonds. As a result, some BIS reporting national banking systems have more on-balance sheet dollar liabilities
than dollar assets, eg Australian banks, while others have more assets than liabilities, eg Japanese and Swiss banks
(Graph II.C.1, centre panel). And indeed, the sign and size of BIS reporting banks’ “dollar funding gaps” are closely
associated with the sign and size of the respective basis against the US dollar (Graph II.C.1, right-hand panel).
Second, record high demand for swapping out of low-yielding euro and yen assets on the part of institutional
investors and corporate bond issuers has increasingly put pressure on the basis. Term- and credit-spread compression
in the euro area and Japan, spurred by central banks’ asset purchases, has led institutional investors there to seek
yield in US dollar bonds hedged back into euros or yen. Such spread compression has at the same time drawn
US firms into issuing euro bonds (€220 billion outstanding in 2015), often to swap back into dollar liabilities, adding
to the pressure. As a result, the cost of swapped US dollar funding has increased, widening the basis (Graph II.C.1,
left-hand panel).
Limits to arbitrage. The record demand for dollar fund-raising via swaps has been met with global banks’
reduced willingness to arbitrage. Before 2007–08, banks not only swapped currencies to meet their own business
models’ cash currency mismatches but also served as active arbitrageurs. They would keep the basis near zero by
borrowing short-term in one currency, exchanging the funds in the currency market and lending the proceeds
short-term, thereby offsetting a customer’s forward position. Moreover, they also used these short-term operations
to offset medium-term customer hedges. Post-crisis, however, shareholders and regulators have constrained
operations that blow up balance sheets and entail mark-to-market risk as well as, depending on the underlying
asset, a degree of credit risk. Another limit to arbitrage arises from slow-moving capital, as the capacity of other
financial institutions, such as supranational bond issuers that can issue US dollar bonds (to then swap the dollars for
other currencies to collect the basis), falls far short of closing the arbitrage opportunity.

A detailed example: yen/dollar basis. Yen/dollar is the most extreme and persistent basis of the major
currencies. First, Japanese banks’ overseas expansion (and the use of the US dollar as a vehicle currency to swap into
higher-yielding regional currencies) has substantially increased their estimated dollar funding gap, defined as dollar
assets in excess of on-balance sheet dollar liabilities (Graph II.C.2, left-hand panel). The Japanese banks’ US dollar

BIS 86th Annual Report

41

funding gap has also been pushed up by the build-up of US dollar securities positions held for other investors in
their trust accounts, with the portion hedged for currency risk putting further pressure on the basis. In this way,
Japanese banks’ business models reduce their capacity to serve as counterparties to non-bank hedgers in crosscurrency markets and to arbitrage the basis. Adding to this, Japanese life insurers’ search for yield overseas has led
them to increase FX-hedged investments in US dollar-denominated bonds (with average hedge ratios of 60–70%).
The associated upsurges in total demand for US dollars via swaps have been pushing out the yen/dollar basis
(Graph II.C.2, left-hand and centre panels).
The role played by constraints on bank balance sheets in limiting arbitrage becomes visible in specific
circumstances. First, because repo markets are an important source of arbitrage funding, the diverging repo spreads
in US dollars and yen have made it increasingly costly to fund the CIP arbitrage involved in lending dollars against
yen. This has led to a wider basis (Graph II.C.2, right-hand panel, rising red line and falling black line). Second, as
reporting and regulatory ratios provided at quarter-end gained importance in 2014, repo spreads in dollar and yen
money markets started to exhibit quarter-end jumps. In particular, counterparties in the US dollar money market
became less willing to lend their dollars at quarter-ends. These spikes in the relative cost of dollars in repos drove
down the swap basis at three-month and shorter maturities. Higher US dollar funding costs via shorter-term swaps
at quarter-ends also put pressure on pricing of longer-maturity swaps, leading to more costly US dollar swap funding
over the quarter.

III. The global economy: realignment under way?

The global economy continued to expand in the year under review, with
unemployment generally falling and global growth of GDP per capita around its
historical average. That said, sharp falls in commodity prices and their subsequent
partial recovery, large exchange rate moves and lower than expected headline
global GDP growth shaped perceptions. These developments are often seen as the
confluence of unrelated negative shocks. But this triplet is, to an important extent,
the result of an economic and financial process that has unfolded over many years.1
Before reviewing these three developments and the realignment they represent, it is
useful to take stock of their connections and the path taken to the current juncture.
The genesis of much of the latest developments lies in the boom years leading
up to the Great Financial Crisis. Stable, low-inflation growth in the 2000s encouraged
easy monetary and financial conditions in the major economies and ample global
liquidity. Easy financing fuelled domestic financial booms in advanced economies,
with credit and property prices soaring. Strong growth in emerging market
economies (EMEs), particularly in China as it reformed and opened its economy,
added to buoyant global demand. Resource-intensive industries in EMEs, including
manufacturing and construction, expanded rapidly, pushing demand for commodities
ever higher. The surge in commodity prices, and in commodity producers’ exchange
rates, encouraged ample and cheap international borrowing, in turn contributing
to the vast investment in commodity production capacity.
The financial crisis brought only a brief pause to these dynamics. The onset of
severe balance sheet recessions in the countries at the core of the crisis, prominently
the United States and parts of Europe, led to highly expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies not only in these economies, but also in those exposed to them
through trade and financial channels, including China. The resulting demand boost
triggered a resurgence in the commodity boom as resource-intensive industries
expanded in key economies, supported by readily available finance. As the crisis-hit
countries recovered only slowly from the balance sheet recession, highly
expansionary monetary policy remained in place for an extended period even as
fiscal policy tightened somewhat. The persistently easy global liquidity conditions
induced spillovers to commodity exporters and other EMEs, boosting broad-based
domestic financial booms in those countries.
More recently, the commodity “supercycle” has turned and global liquidity
conditions have begun to tighten even as crisis-hit economies have continued to
grow at a moderate pace. In the past year, weakness in construction and manufacturing
slowed the growth of resource demand. This softer demand, coupled with supply
expansion, ushered in further commodity price drops, with significant economic
consequences. For some countries, maturing or turning domestic financial cycles
coincided with tighter external financial conditions linked to an appreciating US
dollar. Large exchange rate depreciations have the potential to cushion countries
against external developments, but their beneficial effect can be offset by the
corresponding tightening of financial conditions, as they boost the foreign currency
debt burden. With EMEs accounting for a larger share of the global economy than
ever before, their strains can have larger spillbacks on other economies.

This chapter reviews the lower than expected growth, commodity price falls
and exchange rate moves in the context of the financial and real forces that
delivered this triplet. The first section discusses growth in the global economy,
countries’ evolving financial cycles and the elusive realignment. While growth has
been lower than expected, particularly in EME commodity exporters, the state of
the economy appears much brighter based on growth adjusted for demographic
change and labour market outcomes. The subsequent sections examine the
commodity price falls – the proximate cause of lower growth in many commodity
producers and EMEs – and the associated exchange rate moves. These two relative
price changes can set the basis for more sustainable growth in the long run, but the
short-run drag may be significant. The potential spillovers from EMEs are discussed
next. While EMEs’ increasing share of growth and trade means they are a greater
source of spillovers through trade, financial spillovers largely still emanate from
advanced economies. Notably, though, such financial spillovers can build up in
EMEs, raising the potential for pernicious spillbacks to advanced economies. Finally,
the chapter explores the causes and policy implications of slower structural growth.
The slowing of working age population growth is weighing heavily on growth
potential, but other headwinds from the shadows of financial booms should
eventually recede. These headwinds make it all the more important to pursue
policies that can deliver sustainable growth.

expected as at December 2014, which would have been close to the 1987–2007
average (Graph III.1, left-hand panel). However, taking account of demographic
forces, growth of GDP per working age person was actually slightly above its
historical average. The anticipated rotation in growth, part of the broader
realignment, failed to materialise as the slowdown in some EMEs, in particular
commodity exporters, was not fully offset by a pickup in advanced economies. The
financial cycle turned down in some economies adversely affected by these
economic forces, but remained in an upswing in others (see Box III.A for a discussion
of the measurement of the financial cycle). Growth in most economies was
underpinned by domestic consumption.
In countries at the centre of the financial crisis, including the United States, the
United Kingdom and Spain, growth remained moderate in the wake of the balance
sheet recession, but the financial cycle generally turned up. In the United States,
growth was 2.4% in 2015 and continued at a similar pace in early 2016, constrained
by US dollar appreciation. Real property price and credit growth picked up, gradually
closing the credit-to-GDP gap (Graph III.2, left-hand panel). The euro area saw GDP
expand by 1.6% in 2015, up from 0.9% in 2014. This pace of growth continued in
early 2016 as the financial cycle kept recovering in most euro area economies,
with increasing real property prices and credit-to-GDP gaps still negative. With
consolidation efforts behind, fiscal headwinds waned.
In other advanced economies, developments varied. The expansion in Japan
slowed in the second half of 2015 despite the fall in commodity import prices, with
growth of 0.6% for the year. Canada returned to growth in the second half of 2015
after a mild recession triggered by a collapse in resource investment.
As commodity prices slumped and growth slowed in many EMEs, the domestic
financial cycle remained in an upswing in many of them but turned down in others.

Box III.A

The concept and measurement of the financial cycle

The broad concept of the financial cycle encapsulates joint fluctuations in a wide set of financial variables, including
both quantities and prices (see also Box IV.A in the 84th Annual Report). An obvious analogy is to the business cycle.
The business cycle is often identified with movements in GDP, yet despite many years of research there is no
universal agreement on which method to use. These can include an analysis of the unemployment rate or identifying
turning points in a range of monthly indicators (as done by the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee). Identifying
the financial cycle is more challenging as there is no single aggregate measure of financial activity, even though
a consensus has started to emerge that credit aggregates and asset prices, especially property prices, play a
particularly important role. Methodologically, two different approaches have been proposed to measure the
financial cycle more formally (the first two methods described below). In addition, insights from other strands of the
literature can be used to pinpoint peaks and troughs (the third and fourth methods below). While the exact dates of
turning points differ, the four methods discussed in this box generally coincide in identifying periods of expansion
and contraction.
The turning point method dates the financial cycle with the same technique used by the NBER to date business
cycles. Cyclical peaks and troughs are identified in real credit, the credit-to-GDP ratio and real property prices.
Drehmann et al (2012) identify a turning point in the financial cycle if all these three series turn within a three- to
six-year window.
The filter method uses a statistical filter to extract cyclical fluctuations of real credit, the credit-to-GDP ratio and
real property prices and combines them into a single series. Specifics differ, but Drehmann et al (2012), for
instance, rely on a bandpass filter to extract cyclical fluctuations between eight and 32 years in each of the series.
They then take an average of the medium-term cycles in the three variables.
The early warning indicator (EWI) method builds on the financial crisis early warning indicator literature. In
particular, large deviations of the credit-to-GDP ratio from a long-run trend have been found to provide a reliable
single early warning signal.  And the financial cycle is seen to turn once real residential property prices start to fall.
On the flip side, a trough occurs when the credit-to-GDP gap is negative and property price growth turns positive,
even though there is more uncertainty as property price growth sometimes fluctuates around zero for some time.
The gap method exploits insights from Juselius and Drehmann (2015) to decompose the financial cycle into two
key variables that jointly pin down sustainable levels in the credit-to-GDP ratio. The first is the leverage gap, which

The phases of the financial cycle are identified by the phases in real credit, the credit-to-GDP ratio and real residential property prices when
the minimum length of the cycle is five years. The financial cycle turns if all three series turn within a three- to six-year window. 2 A bandpass
filter is used to extract cyclical fluctuations between eight and 32 years in real credit, the credit-to-GDP ratio and real residential property
prices. Afterwards, an average of the medium-term cycles in the three variables is taken. Peaks (troughs) occur when the growth rate turns
from positive to negative (negative to positive). 3 A peak (trough) in the financial cycle is when credit-to-GDP gaps are positive (negative)
and real residential property prices start to fall (rise) on a sustained basis. 4 An expansion (contraction) of the financial cycle is measured by
a negative (positive) leverage gap. Each phase has to be at least two quarters long.

is the deviation from the long-run equilibrium relationship between the credit-to-GDP ratio and key asset prices
(real residential and commercial property prices and equity prices). The second is the debt service gap, which is the
deviation from the long-run equilibrium relationship between the credit-to-GDP ratio and the average lending rate
on outstanding debt. By embedding the gaps in a vector autoregressive system, the authors find that they are the
key link between financial and real developments. Most importantly, a high debt service gap – when a high fraction
of income is used to pay interest and amortise debt – significantly reduces expenditure. The leverage gap, on the
other hand, is the key determinant of credit growth, boosting it when it is negative, ie when asset prices are high
relative to credit-to-GDP ratios. Given that it embeds both credit and asset price dynamics, a negative (positive)
leverage gap is associated with the expansion (contraction) of the financial cycle.
As an illustration, the expansion and contraction phases of the financial cycle for Spain, the United Kingdom
and the United States generally coincide based on the four methods outlined above (Graph III.A). While close, the
exact timing of turning points differs across methodologies. Otherwise, the only difference between methodologies
emerges during the dotcom bust, after which the gap method identifies a contraction in the financial cycle in the
United Kingdom and the United States, in contrast to the other approaches. This most likely arises because this is
the only method that also includes information from equity prices, which were more volatile at the time.
While the four different methods provide a coherent picture of the financial cycle, in particular in retrospect, it
is clear that none is sufficient to perfectly classify countries into different phases. For instance, currently all methods
suggest that the financial cycle is expanding in the United States, but there remains more ambiguity for Spain and
the United Kingdom. Given the heterogeneity in financial booms and busts, including owing to structural
developments, it could be useful to rely on a broader range of indicators, including credit spreads, risk premia,
default rates and proxies for risk perceptions and risk appetite.

In China, growth eased to 6.9% in 2015 and continued at a similar pace in early 2016,
with the financial cycle in retreat as property prices fell after a large, sustained
increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio (Graph III.2, right-hand panel). The downturn in
manufacturing and construction in China sapped commodity demand. Commodity
price declines saw trade values and growth plunge for commodity exporters,
although exchange rate depreciations cushioned the size of export falls in local
currency terms (Graph III.1, centre panel). In India, growth picked up a little to 7.6%
as the financial cycle gained momentum. In both Brazil and Russia, GDP contracted
sharply, by 4%, and the financial cycle downturn compounded the drop in export
prices and large currency depreciations. In other EMEs, including Turkey and Mexico,
the financial cycle remained in an upturn.
The reduction in spare capacity in the United States and expected gradual
monetary policy tightening boosted dollar appreciation. This coincided with signs of
tighter global liquidity conditions, as US dollar borrowing outside the United States
tapered off in late 2015. As capital inflows ebbed, commodity exporters and EMEs
saw large currency depreciations into the first months of 2016. Subsequently, capital
inflows resumed, and currencies recovered some of the earlier losses.
Overall, labour markets presented a more optimistic view of economic
developments than did GDP. Labour markets tightened in most economies by more
than expected in 2015 despite growth a bit below expectations (Graph III.1, right-hand
panel). Commodity-exporting economies were the exception, with unemployment

rates typically increasing by more than anticipated, in some cases significantly. There
has been a substantial tightening in most labour markets since the crisis and in some
there is only moderate slack, although unemployment rates remain high in many
European economies, particularly for the young.
The fairly bright overall picture painted by labour markets contrasts with the
view that “anaemic” growth characterises the still “ongoing” recovery. That pessimistic
interpretation seems rooted in the expectation of a return to pre-crisis headline (as
opposed to per working age person) output growth if not to the pre-crisis output
path. The questions these contrasting impressions raise about the state of the
economy are critical for guiding the policy response (see below).

Large shifts in relative prices require big adjustments
The large exchange rate shifts and further commodity price falls represent sizeable
changes in the relative prices that have guided investment and financing decisions
for the best part of 15 years. If these changes persist, they will require significant
restructuring in many economies. The transitions and realignments are likely to be
a drag on growth in the near term. But they should eventually allow renewed and,
above all, more sustainable and resilient growth, both in advanced economies and
EMEs.

Commodity prices continued to fall
Oil prices have plummeted since mid-2014, overtaking the drops in other
commodity prices, which have been declining for almost five years (Graph III.3, lefthand panel). The prospect of weaker demand, on top of steadily growing supply, hit

crude markets hard: oil prices extended the slide of the second half of 2015, falling
sharply to below $30 per barrel in mid-January 2016, a price not seen since 2003. In
real terms, this was the largest decrease over any two-year period since the oil price
became market-determined in the early 1970s. By May, the price had rebounded,
but Brent was more than 50% below the high plateau observed between mid-2010
and mid-2014. The price declines for base metals and foodstuffs have been smaller
over the past year, not least because their prices had already dropped substantially.
The surge in real commodity prices from the early 2000s and the subsequent
decline have traced a supercycle comparable to the one in 1973–86. The most
recent boom was driven by the robust growth of resource-intensive industries in
China and other EMEs, supported by global liquidity conditions. The surge was only
briefly interrupted by the sharp price drops at the peak of the crisis in late 2008.
Highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies put in place with the onset of the
crisis and the resulting debt-fuelled spending, notably in China, swiftly brought
commodity prices back to soaring heights. By late 2009, the real prices of all
commodities were again at levels comparable to (or higher than) those seen in 2008.
Continued buoyant investment in infrastructure and construction, boosted
by cheap and readily available borrowing and rapid growth in manufacturing,
sustained the surge in the demand for raw materials. This lifted investment and
growth more generally in commodity-exporting economies, both advanced and
emerging (Graph III.3, centre panel). The resulting increased capacity came on line
as demand growth moderated, especially in manufacturing (Graph III.3, right-hand
panel). Thus, prices dropped, repeating the classic “hog cycle” typical of commodity
markets.
For oil, the increase in demand was broader than for most other commodities,
but the confluence of easy financing conditions and supply expansions was every
bit as prominent. New firms borrowed heavily to increase shale oil production in
the United States. From 2006 to 2014, oil and gas companies’ bonds and syndicated
loans grew at an annual rate of 14%. The high level of debt can have persistent
effects. As credit conditions tighten, highly leveraged producers may maintain, or
even increase, output even as the oil price falls in order to meet interest and debt
repayments. Moreover, they will be more inclined to hedge exposure in derivatives
markets. Dynamic hedging by their counterparts may add downward pressure to
the spot market for some time. Increased supply has clearly contributed to the
sharp price drop since mid-2014, reflecting not only the resilience of US shale oil
production but, crucially, OPEC’s reluctance to curtail output – a game changer.
The borrowing surge extended beyond oil and gas firms to other commodity
producers. The debt issued by a broad range of commodity firms in advanced
economies increased at an annual rate of 12% from 2005 to 2015. For EME firms,
the growth was even higher, at 17%. In total, by December 2015 commodity firms
had $4 trillion of debt outstanding globally. As their revenues sank, the debt service
burden grew, despite historically low interest rates (Graph III.4, left-hand panel). In
some cases, debt sustainability could come into question. But for many economies,
the biggest risk may derive from sharp economic contractions induced by firms’ and
households’ spending retrenchment and, critically, strongly procyclical fiscal policy.

Waiting for the fillip to growth from lower commodity prices
For the world as a whole, the net impact of lower commodity prices induced by a
cheaper and more ample supply of a key production input should be positive. But
the size and timing are uncertain and depend on demand patterns.
Commodity-importing economies should benefit through terms-of-trade gains.
Consumers, in particular, have historically boosted their expenditure. However, in

the past year the expected fillip to growth failed to materialise to the extent
expected. One reason could be that highly leveraged consumers used at least part
of the income windfall to reduce debt. Indeed, over the period of falling oil prices
household consumption growth picked up by about 1.5 percentage points less in
the economies where household debt had increased most rapidly between 2000
and mid-2014 relative to those where it had risen more moderately. For firms, the
uncertainty that has constrained investment in recent years may have contributed
to the muted response.
For commodity producers, most of which are EMEs, the lower commodity
prices are undoubtedly a net headwind. One clear channel is the sharp decline in
investment. In 2015, investment fell by 2.5% for a selection of commodity-exporting
EMEs, a major pullback from the 4.1% growth expected for 2015 as of January
2014, when commodity prices were much higher. And over the course of 2015,
expected investment growth for 2016 was also cut from 3.3% to –0.5%. This would
add to the reduction in consumer spending, as terms-of-trade losses sap real
incomes.
Procyclical government spending was another headwind for EME commodity
exporters. Tax revenue sinks directly with the lower income from governments’
commodity assets and royalties, and indirectly with weaker economic activity.
Historically, it has not been possible to smooth out this revenue shortfall with debt,
as investors’ confidence in the sovereign wanes and both sovereign and corporate
bond spreads widen. This time around, governments in commodity-exporting
countries had partly saved the gains early in the boom. But as growth sputtered

50

BIS 86th Annual Report

post-crisis despite commodity prices remaining high, fiscal consolidation stalled
and debt stabilised or even increased. Overall, as prices fell, oil exporters with
increased spending commitments were badly hit: the oil prices required to achieve
fiscal balance soared (Graph III.4, centre panel).
The fiscal problem reflects in part the inherent difficulty of assessing fiscal
positions during the boom, which depends on imprecise estimates of the cyclical
component of output or the “output gap”. Much like what happens with credit
booms (Chapter V), a commodity price upswing may artificially boost potential
output estimates, thereby concealing weak fiscal positions. The right-hand panel of
Graph III.4 presents real-time estimates of cyclical adjustments to structural fiscal
balances for a group of large Latin American commodity exporters, based on
standard measures of the output gap alongside those adjusted for the commodity
cycle.2 When corrected for commodity price fluctuations, structural fiscal deficits
during 2010–13 are significantly larger than those standard methods suggest. Fiscal
policies were too loose during the boom years.

Floating (and sinking) exchange rates
The past year saw further large exchange rate shifts driven by the US dollar. For
some EMEs, these shifts were outside the interquartile range of yearly changes of
the past 20 years (Graph III.5, left-hand panel). In nominal effective terms, the dollar
appreciated by 9% from May 2015 to January 2016, but then retraced some of
this, so that the appreciation over the year to May was just 4%. Many currencies
depreciated against the dollar and in nominal effective terms. The euro and yen
nominal effective exchange rates appreciated by 5% and 18% over the year to May
despite further monetary easing. EMEs and commodity exporters saw the largest
depreciations. The currencies of Russia, South Africa and Brazil depreciated by 16%,
18% and 5%, respectively, in nominal effective terms, in part reflecting domestic
factors. The renminbi depreciated slightly in nominal effective terms and vis-à-vis
the dollar.
These exchange rate shifts may affect macroeconomic outcomes through at
least two channels. The first works through changes in balance sheets and financial
risk-taking.3 A depreciation tends to weaken the balance sheets of entities that have
net foreign currency liabilities. This may induce spending cuts. It also worsens credit
conditions more broadly as their (bank and non-bank) lenders’ risk-taking capacity
diminishes, curtailing credit to others as well. The second channel works through
trade (expenditure switching): a depreciation should improve net exports and add
to domestic absorption, at least if the central bank does not raise rates to fend off
inflation. Thus, exchange rate changes transfer demand from the appreciating to
the depreciating jurisdictions.

The real-time estimates of the output gaps used for the cyclical adjustment are based on country
data available at the time of estimation; cyclical adjustment is then conducted according to the
OECD methodology described in N Girouard and C André, “Measuring cyclically-adjusted budget
balances for OECD countries”, OECD Economics Department Working Papers, no 434, July 2005. For
further details on the methodology, see E Alberola, R Gondo Mori, M Lombardi and D Urbina,

cycles”, BIS Working Papers, no 568, June 2016.

The risk-taking channel looms large for EMEs
Greater financial integration has probably increased the influence of the exchange
rates of major international funding currencies on global financial conditions,
especially in EMEs. This is highlighted by the substantial growth in the stock of
US dollar-denominated debt of non-banks outside the United States, to $9.7 trillion
at end-2015, with $3.3 trillion of this to EMEs, a doubling since 2009.4
The exchange rate risk-taking channel has both a quantity and a price dimension.
Research has documented a relationship between local currency appreciation
against the dollar and increasing bank leverage, credit growth and bond portfolio
inflows, as well as declining sovereign yield spreads against US Treasuries and CDS
spreads.5
The quantity side works through changes in the credit supply to domestic firms
when the value of their local currency changes. As a local currency depreciation
shrinks the collateral value of domestic firms’ assets to foreign lenders, this reduces
the latter’s capacity to extend credit – for instance, through a value-at-risk (VaR)
constraint.6 While the mechanism is stimulative for appreciations, the retrenchment
may be larger and more abrupt for the depreciations that follow prolonged

appreciations, because of a build-up of a large stock of liabilities and currency
mismatches during the upswing. The expansionary effect for EMEs is illustrated in the
centre panel of Graph III.5. A 1% depreciation of the dollar is associated with a 0.6%
increase in the quarterly growth rate of US dollar-denominated cross-border lending.
The price dimension works through widening credit spreads when the domestic
currency depreciates and risk-taking decreases. This relationship between exchange
rates and financial conditions is illustrated in the right-hand panel of Graph III.5.
When the local currency appreciates, EME local currency sovereign yields fall.
Currency appreciation and looser financial conditions go hand in hand.
This risk-taking channel is potent for EMEs but has no apparent role in
advanced economies (Box III.B). An exchange rate depreciation (against the
international financing currencies) leads to a contraction of GDP in EMEs, but not in
advanced economies. Moreover, the impact in EMEs is quick but recedes somewhat
with time.

The trade channel is more potent in advanced economies than EMEs
An exchange rate depreciation stimulates output through the trade channel, but its
efficacy can depend on a number of factors. For example, the channel will be more
potent the larger the trade share of GDP and the more responsive prices of
tradeable goods are to the exchange rate. The trade channel is found to be
important for both EMEs and advanced economies, even when controlling for the
financial channel (Box III.B). For both groups of countries, the stimulus builds over
time: the boost to growth is smaller in the short than in the long run. Overall, this
evidence suggests that for EMEs the risk-taking channel is a significant offset to the
trade channel, especially in the short run.
Recent studies generally suggest that trade exchange rate elasticities have
declined in response to changes in trade structures, including currency denomination,
hedging and the increasing importance of global value chains. For instance, a
World Bank study finds that manufacturing export exchange rate elasticities almost
halved between 1996 and 2012, with almost half of this decrease due to the
spreading of global supply chains.7 An OECD study also finds small trade elasticities:
in G3 economies, a 10% depreciation increases the trade balance only 0.4–0.6
percentage points.8 By contrast, a recent IMF study argues that exchange rates
continue to have a sizeable effect on the value of net exports – with a 10%
depreciation improving the trade balance by 1.5 percentage points. That said, the
same study does find some evidence that the price elasticity of trade volumes has
declined in recent years.9
Two interrelated financial factors may explain the lessening in trade sensitivities
in advanced economies: the simultaneous nature of deleveraging and the lingering
effects of the crisis. For instance, recent research finds that a boom in household
debt tends to go hand in hand with currency appreciation, a stronger increase in
imports and a bigger deterioration in net trade. After the bust, depreciation and a
boost to net exports typically help offset the deleveraging-induced drag on growth.

Box III.B

Exchange rates: stabilising or destabilising?

Economists have extensively studied the stabilising role of exchange rates through the adjustment of relative prices
and the trade balance. Recent literature has also identified various financial channels through which exchange rates
can affect economic activity. This box presents initial evidence that these financial effects are economically significant
for output in EMEs.
A simple model can shed some light on the relative importance of the trade and financial channels for
advanced and emerging economies. The model is an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) specifying GDP as
a function of both the trade-weighted real effective exchange rate (REER) and a debt-weighted nominal
exchange rate (DWER). The DWER for each country weights its bilateral exchange rates against each of the five
major global funding currencies (US dollar, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and Swiss franc) by the shares of
these global funding currencies in that country’s foreign currency debt (both domestic and international). This is
a conceptual improvement over the practice of using the US dollar bilateral exchange rate to capture financial
effects, because it acknowledges the relative importance of other funding currencies in the liability structure of
each country.
The sample comprises a quarterly panel of 22 EMEs and 21 advanced economies over the period 1980–2015.
In addition to the two exchange rate indices, various controls are included to limit endogeneity concerns.
Table III.B displays the short- and long-run elasticities of GDP growth with respect to the two exchange rate
measures separately for EMEs and advanced economies. There is strong evidence of the stimulative effects of
exchange rate depreciations through the trade channel: for both groups of countries, the elasticity of the tradeweighted exchange rate is negative. The magnitudes are also similar, indicating that a 1 percentage point REER
depreciation leads to an increase in GDP growth of 10–12 basis points on average in the long run. By contrast, only
EMEs show evidence of the financial channel: a 1 percentage point depreciation of the DWER implies a 10 basis
point decrease in their GDP growth in the long run. The corresponding effect is much smaller and not statistically
significant for advanced economies.
The ratios of short- to long-run elasticities reported in Table III.B indicate that the financial channel overshoots
in the short run and has a larger short-run impact than the trade channel. For EMEs, the short-run elasticity of the
DWER is larger than its long-run elasticity, implying that the initial impact fades somewhat over time. By contrast,
for both EMEs and advanced economies, the REER long-run elasticity is larger than the short-run elasticity, meaning
that the trade channel effect builds with time. For EMEs, the DWER’s short-run elasticity is larger in absolute
magnitude than that of the REER. This result provides tentative evidence for EMEs that in the short run, the effects
of the financial channel dominate those of the trade channel so that an equal depreciation of the DWER and REER
may be initially contractionary. For EMEs, a depreciation seems to provide only a small boost to GDP, and only after
some quarters.

Results were qualitatively similar. In terms of magnitude, the median elasticities were higher than the ones obtained with the panel
regressions. For instance, for EMEs the long-run median REER elasticity is –0.28 and the long-run DWER elasticity is 0.31.

But this mechanism may be substantially weaker when several countries deleverage
simultaneously.10 In addition, a depreciation may also have smaller effects on exports
in the aftermath of a financial crisis if lack of funding, resource misallocations and
high uncertainty constrain the output response.

Changing interdependence
With growth in some EMEs slowing and financial strains increasing, it is crucial
to understand the extent to which these developments can spill over globally.
Spillovers from EMEs to advanced economies have increased over time, as EMEs
have accounted for a larger share of global trade and output growth – around 80%
since 2008. While financial linkages have deepened, financial spillovers to EMEs
remain more potent than those in the opposite direction. Spillovers depend not
just on the size of interlinkages but also on the nature of the shocks (common or
country-specific) and on various shock absorbers. The current global slowdown and
risks resulting from the previous run-up in EME external debt and recent tightening
global liquidity conditions are a case in point.

Increasing trade spillovers from EMEs
Increased trade is an important channel of greater spillovers from EMEs to advanced
economies. EMEs now account for around 45% of global trade, up from just over
30% in 2000. The intensity of spillovers will depend on the size and nature of an
economy’s trade flows. Of particular note, China’s rapid growth and increased trade
openness have seen it account for a growing share of many countries’ exports,
particularly commodity exporters (Graph III.6, top panel).
These spillovers are changing as China rebalances from investment-led growth
towards a more service-oriented economy. Slower growth in construction and
industry (the secondary sector) and a fall in the corresponding output prices
resulted in virtually no growth in nominal value added for this sector in 2015. This
is already having large spillovers to both commodity producers and capital goods
exporters through drops in the value of their exports (Graph III.1, centre panel).
Growth that is more services-intensive has smaller spillovers, given that services
account for only around 10% of imports despite being around half of GDP.

In contrast to the significant rise in exports destined for China, the share of
most countries’ exports to the United States has remained stable or declined a little
over the past 15 years (Graph III.6, bottom panel). Despite this, US demand is still
more important than China’s for most countries’ exports.
Trade spillovers can also occur through a third country that imports intermediate
inputs used in the production of its own exports. As a result, for many advanced
and commodity-exporting EMEs the indirect impact of a reduction in US imports is
large relative to the direct effect (the blue bars are large relative to the red bars in
the bottom panel of Graph III.6). Spillovers from other major advanced economies
also remain important for both advanced and emerging market economies.

destination than a source of financial spillovers. However, financial spillovers to
EMEs can cause a gradual accumulation of imbalances which can later result in
substantial spillbacks to advanced economies.
A critical channel for financial spillovers, particularly to EMEs, is external
borrowing, especially in international funding currencies. Most of this borrowing is
in US dollars, increasing the importance of US financial conditions (Graph III.7).
While other advanced economies also borrow in foreign currencies, more of that
borrowing tends to be hedged, reducing vulnerabilities. Swings in the availability
and cost of external borrowing can amplify domestic leverage and have outsize
effects when borrowers face financial distress.
The accumulation of a large stock of foreign currency-denominated debt
in EMEs has heightened the potential for spillbacks to advanced economies. Low
US interest rates and a depreciating dollar have boosted credit, asset prices and
growth in EMEs for quite some time. A turn in global liquidity conditions induced
by prospects of higher US interest rates could trigger a reversal of easy liquidity
conditions, as appeared to be the case during the period under review before
markets regained their balance following the turbulence in early 2016 (Chapter II).
Spillovers to advanced economies from EME ownership of specific advanced
economy assets, such as sovereign bonds, have increased. The reduction in holdings
of US bonds was arguably one factor contributing to moves in US yields over the
past year (Chapter II). By contrast, spillovers to advanced economies through wealth
effects from direct ownership of EME assets are generally small, in line with the
share of EME assets in advanced economy portfolios.
Larger spillovers can occur through the impact on advanced economies’ asset
prices. The sensitivity of equity prices to sharp moves in Chinese equity prices over
the past year (Chapter II) highlights the growing importance of this channel.

A dose of growth realism
Since the financial crisis, headline GDP growth in both advanced and emerging market
economies has consistently fallen short of forecasts and pre-crisis norms. The

resulting debate on the causes and implications of seemingly lacklustre growth is a
critical backdrop for policy considerations. Whether growth is indeed underwhelming
cyclically or structurally, and whether this results from deleveraging (part of the socalled debt supercycle – outsize financial booms gone wrong), factor misallocation,
secular stagnation, technological slowdown or some other cause, influences not just
the appropriate policy response but what policies can plausibly achieve. Unrealistic
expectations of an economy’s growth potential, structural and cyclical, can lead to
excessive reliance on demand management policies. The end result may be an
economy that bears the costs of activist policies without the anticipated benefits.
An economy’s growth potential is conventionally thought to be determined by
the expansion in aggregate supply, with demand having only a short-term influence.
However, secular stagnation posits that protracted weak demand has been a
persistent constraint on growth.11 This section assesses growth potential in the light
of the explanations above, by considering the key determinants of supply and
demand. The causes of low growth are varied, but not least among them is the
impact of the run-up in debt and its legacy.

Slower growth of supply
To a large extent, most economies’ weaker growth in recent years reflects slower
expansion of supply attributable to the factors of production, labour and capital,
and to productivity.
The structural decline in labour force growth due to demographic factors is
reducing potential output growth in almost all countries. The effect is large: while global
GDP growth was 0.5 percentage points below its 1987–2007 average in 2015, growth of
global GDP per working age person was actually 0.2 percentage points above its
average (Graph III.1, left-hand panel). In Europe and other advanced economies, the
baby boom generation is now reaching retirement. As a result, working age population
growth is slowing sharply, by close to 1 percentage point in just a decade, and is already
negative (Graph III.8, left-hand panel). In China, its decline is even more extreme, in
excess of 2 percentage points. In other EMEs, working age population growth has also
slowed, but remains positive (Graph III.8, centre panel). Even accounting for the partly
offsetting influence of greater labour force participation – resulting from various
policies, such as higher retirement ages, social trends and better health – labour’s
contribution to potential output growth has fallen (Graph III.8, right-hand panel).
Slower accumulation of physical capital through investment has also contributed
to weaker potential output growth post-crisis in advanced economies, but not in
EMEs. Despite exceptionally easy financial conditions, firms in advanced economies
have been unwilling to invest. A major reason for this appears to be uncertainty
about future demand and thus profitability.12 For some firms, cash hoarding and
borrowing in order to buy back shares or pay dividends point towards this apparent
dearth of attractive investment opportunities.13 For others, the hangover from the

run-up in debt appears to be restraining investment. While new finance has been
cheap, and easy to obtain for most firms, the need to reduce the high leverage
built up pre-crisis has weighed on investment in some countries.
A productivity growth slowdown over the past decade has also contributed to
slower potential output growth. In addition to the impact of lower investment, some
evidence suggests that one factor may be the persistent impact of the credit boominduced misallocation of labour into weaker productivity growth sectors.14 In addition,
the current exceptionally easy financial conditions can create incentives for banks to
evergreen loans, keeping otherwise unproductive firms alive. Those conditions may
be detrimental to a swift reallocation of capital and labour, and distort competition
across the economy.15 A final, often cited factor might be a slowdown in technological
progress, but this is less useful for explaining the decline in productivity growth that
has also been seen in countries not at the technological frontier.16

Is demand structurally deficient?
GDP growth has been disappointing post-crisis. A key question is whether this is
drawn-out cyclical weakness resulting from the after-effects of excess leverage, or
reflects structurally deficient demand, which could interact harmfully with supply
side factors.
Some structural factors have clearly weighed on demand growth. For instance,
population ageing has meant that more people are in pre-retirement cohorts that
tend to have higher saving rates. Rising wealth and income inequality in some
countries may also foster an increase in savings. In addition, firm investment
demand may be weaker because of the relative growth of less capital-intensive
industries.
However, a number of observations are at odds with the secular stagnation
hypothesis. Notably, job creation and the general improvement in labour markets
post-crisis argue against demand growth being deficient. It is also hard to see
secular stagnation as a global phenomenon. Many EMEs have low capital stocks,
and so their potential demand for investment is substantial. Even in its original
context for the United States, secular stagnation sits at odds with the large US current
account deficit at the time, which saw domestic demand outstripping supply while
global growth was also strong with full employment.
Moreover, other factors contributing to weak demand may be persistent, but
will subside with time. Following the substantial run-up in household debt precrisis, households in many advanced economies have sought to reduce their
leverage or at least take on less new debt, temporarily increasing their saving rate.
Further, persistently low interest rates may have weakened demand from
households whose income relies heavily on interest earnings, or which are trying to
attain a savings target, in particular for retirement.
Finally, supply side constraints may themselves have been weakening demand,
akin to how weak demand can undercut supply through skill loss and slower capital
accumulation. For instance, if resources are able to shift towards their best use
more flexibly, this can unlock effective demand as incomes and investment rise.
And increasing competition or allocating credit more effectively can stimulate both
supply and demand. Thus, the legacy of the previous unsustainable financial boom
may have been weighing on demand also through these channels.

The reality of slower growth, unless…?
Assessing the persistence of other recent headwinds has important implications for
the growth that can realistically be achieved in coming years.
Some headwinds to growth will probably subside with time. The stock of debt
increased greatly in many economies in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis,
and in others in the years since. But the resulting headwinds from deleveraging and
factor misallocation will gradually wane, boosting potential growth. The sharp shifts
of exchange rates and commodity prices are likely to impede growth in some
economies for some time, but this too will subside.
Other headwinds, however, are not expected to disappear. Ageing populations
will continue to weigh on output growth. The slowdown in working age population
growth is substantial and powerful. Abstracting from offsets from higher labour
force participation, it is reducing GDP growth by 1 percentage point over a decade
for a range of countries.
Setting adequate policy priorities requires realistically assessing possible
outcomes. For many economies, potential growth is already lower than in earlier
decades, and will continue to be so in the coming years (Graph III.8, right-hand

60

panel). To counteract these headwinds, it is essential to implement long-run supply
side reforms in order to boost productivity growth (see the 83rd and 84th Annual
Reports). This would also help to reduce the burden on monetary policy to sustain
economic activity across the globe.

IV. Monetary policy: more accommodation, less room

Monetary policy remained very accommodative over the past year as the room for
manoeuvre narrowed. This long-standing exceptional stance was maintained against
the backdrop of stubbornly low headline inflation in many economies, uneven
global economic momentum and maturing domestic financial cycles in a number
of emerging market economies (EMEs) and in some of the advanced economies
least affected by the Great Financial Crisis.
Various domestic and external themes were prominent. Growing uncertainty
about the timing and size of the policy divergence among the major advanced
economies complicated policy and contributed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Declining commodity prices weighed heavily on policy considerations. While these
developments raised questions about the anchoring of inflation expectations,
central banks also had to grapple with conflicting domestic and global inflation
cross-currents of a cyclical and secular nature.
Meanwhile, there were lingering concerns about the declining effectiveness of
domestic channels of monetary policy and about the side effects of persistent
accommodation. The external channels, notably the exchange rate, became more
prominent and raised challenges of their own.
In a broader perspective, another year of very accommodative policy, along
with expectations of a more moderate pace of normalisation, highlighted the
growing tensions between price stability and financial stability. These tensions
heightened interest in evaluating the costs and benefits of more financial stabilityoriented monetary policy frameworks and in their practical implementation.
The first section reviews the past year’s monetary policy and inflation
developments. The second examines challenges associated with the growing
importance of the external channels of monetary policy as domestic channels
wane. The third, taking further the analysis presented in previous years, explores
how monetary policy frameworks can evolve to better account for financial
stability and more effectively address the trade-offs between price stability and
financial stability.

Recent developments
Central banks held nominal policy rates very low (Graph IV.1) amid increased
prospects of a further delay in normalisation. The size of central bank balance
sheets remained near historical highs, and some are poised to expand further. This
transpired against the backdrop of low headline inflation, moderate economic
expansion and tightening labour markets. The main differences across economies
arose from variations in their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, commodity
price swings, financial market volatility and uncertainty about growth prospects.

Monetary policy normalisation delayed further
Central banks from the major advanced economies began the period under review
with policy rates near zero and balance sheets larger than at the outset of the
preceding year (Graph IV.2). With core inflation positive, real policy rates remained
exceptionally low. In fact, real policy rates have not been so low for so long since

volatility led market participants to expect an even slower normalisation of the
policy rate, including with a lower end point. The Federal Reserve’s pace of
normalisation is expected to be unusually gradual by historical standards.
Meanwhile, the ECB and the Bank of Japan eased policy further at the turn of
the year. They cut policy rates and ramped up non-standard monetary measures.
The size of their balance sheets continued to grow.
The ECB held its main policy rate (the rate on its main refinancing operations –
MRO) just above zero for most of the period but cut rates in March 2016. It lowered
the MRO rate to zero and the interest rate on the deposit facility to –40 basis points.
With the euro overnight interest rate (EONIA) tracking the deposit rate, policy
was more accommodative than indicated by the MRO rate alone. The ECB also
launched a set of new measures that boosted the pace of its asset purchase
programme, expanded asset eligibility to include non-financial corporate bonds
and made its targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) more attractive.
The package sought to ease financing conditions, support the economy and address
disinflationary risks.
The Bank of Japan eased policy to achieve its 2% inflation target. With downside
inflation risks emerging, especially from lower oil prices, weak external demand and
yen appreciation, it enhanced its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing
(QQE) programme in December and January. Its balance sheet reached new heights
(Graph IV.2, centre panel). It also adopted negative policy rates for the first time,
applying the negative rate only to marginal increases in current account balances
so as to protect bank profitability (Chapter VI). The objective of the various
measures was to lower the sovereign yield curve and benchmark lending rates.
Central banks outside the major advanced economies faced a more diverse set
of challenges. A roughly equal number cut rates, kept them unchanged or raised
them (Graph IV.3, left-hand panel). Most had policy rates below historical averages.
Deviations from inflation targets were a dominant theme for most central
banks. With sharp commodity price drops pushing headline inflation down, those
central banks already facing low core inflation trends cut rates further from
historically low levels, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway.

Inflation in some of these economies remained below target despite currency
depreciations. At the same time, the growth of credit and house prices raised
financial stability concerns, especially given high household debt.
Economic weakness in China proved to be challenging at home and abroad,
inducing an easing bias, especially in Asia. The People’s Bank of China, also
addressing low inflation and financial stability concerns, cut its interest rates and
the required reserve ratio five times beginning in early 2015. The depreciation of
the renminbi helped soften the blow to the economy but increased the challenges
faced by many of China’s regional and global trading partners. The general
slowdown in EMEs and lower inflation led Indonesia to cut rates and Korea and
Thailand to maintain a very accommodative monetary policy stance.
Most central banks with policy rates at or near the lower bound and facing
very low inflation – including Switzerland, the United Kingdom and some eastern
European economies – kept rates unchanged given their limited policy room. In
Sweden, however, where inflation was well below target despite robust growth, the
central bank pushed rates deeper into negative territory, expanded its purchases of
securities and, at an unscheduled policy meeting, increased its readiness to
intervene in the currency market. Like the Swiss National Bank, the Swedish central
bank expressed concerns about strong mortgage lending growth and residential
property price increases. The Czech Republic maintained its exchange rate floor to
reduce downside inflation risks from currency appreciation. These economies
remained particularly exposed to exchange rate-induced disinflationary spillovers
from the ECB’s accommodative policy.
For others, sharp exchange rate depreciations and the associated higher
inflation led to policy rate hikes. The central banks of South Africa, Turkey and many
commodity-exporting EMEs in Latin America, whose currencies fell sharply, saw
inflation run above target and either raised or maintained high rates despite
deteriorating growth prospects. As a result, inflation was generally expected to
finish 2016 inside the respective target bands of these countries (Graph IV.3, righthand panel). Brazil and Colombia continued to address persistent above-target
inflation with relatively high policy rates. In India, despite inflation running above
the mid-point of the medium-term 4% target, the central bank cut rates, as falling
inflation, albeit from high rates, was seen as consistent with its disinflation “glide
path” announced the previous year.

Inflationary cross-currents
In the period under review, inflation continued to be driven by a complex mix of
near-term, cyclical and secular factors (see also the detailed discussion in the 85th
Annual Report).
As noted above, among the near-term, proximate determinants of inflation,
commodity prices and exchange rates loomed large. The sharp drop in commodity
prices in 2015, especially the oil price, widened the wedge between headline and
core inflation (Graph IV.4, left-hand panel). The large exchange rate changes
influenced inflation to an extent that differed across countries, based in part on the
incidence of second-round effects. Empirical evidence indicates that the passthrough to prices has generally fallen over time, first in advanced economies and
later in EMEs (Graph IV.4, centre panel). Even so, it more recently appears to have
picked up somewhat, possibly reflecting the size and greater persistence of
exchange rate movements (Chapter III, and Graph IV.4, right-hand panel).
Cyclical demand drivers, notably various measures of economic slack, indicate a
modest rise in the momentum of global inflation (Graph IV.5). Measures of slack,
such as unemployment rates and conventionally measured output gaps (domestic

and global), are shrinking. With a lag, tighter labour markets point to incipient wage
pressures.
Secular drivers, such as globalisation and technology, continue to hold down
inflation. In many respects, these forces result in “good” disinflation, ie linked to a
supply side expansion, in contrast to costly cyclical-demand-driven disinflation.
In fact, technological advances and other favourable global supply side forces
appear to have become more prominent. One reason is that cost-cutting
innovations are being transmitted more quickly through expanding global value
chains (GVCs). These forces have kept a lid on prices directly, via low-cost tradable
goods, as well as indirectly, by boosting competitive pressures on tradable and
non-tradable inputs such as labour. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that the
expansion of GVCs has had a significant effect on inflation, helping to account for
the greater role of global slack in determining domestic inflation (Box IV.A).
Trends in long-run inflation expectations also play a role. Over the past year,
persistent deviations of inflation from target – mostly on the low side but in some
cases on the high side – have raised concerns about de-anchoring. For example,
persistently low headline inflation, even if driven by transitory forces, could raise
price stability risks if second-round effects were to take hold and feed into wage
and inflation expectations. Risks would be higher if doubts grew about the ability
of monetary authorities to boost inflation.
This puts the spotlight on the reliability of different indicators of inflation
expectations. So far, survey-based measures suggest that long-term expectations
remain well anchored in most economies (Graph IV.5, right-hand panel). In contrast,
the message coming from financial markets is more mixed. In a number of countries,
asset price indicators have pointed to a possible weakening in the anchor. That said,
there are a number of reasons to question the reliability of these measures. The
financial assets typically used to assess long-term inflation expectations (such as the

Box IV.A

Global value chains and the globalisation of inflation

The rise of global value chains (GVCs) has made them a key channel through which the drivers of domestic inflation
have become more global. GVCs are supply chains in which different stages of production are strategically dispersed
and coordinated around the globe. Their growth has transformed the nature of international production and
trade. The growth is evident in the steady increase over the past several decades in the fraction of the value added
of exports of goods and services due to their import content, which grew from 18% in 1990 to around 25% in 2015
(Graph IV.A, left-hand panel).
This trend has had implications for inflation dynamics. Domestic production costs depend not only on price
developments at home but also on developments abroad, both directly and indirectly. And GVCs provide various
channels through which foreign price pressures are transmitted to domestic inflation. The direct channel is through
price pressures for imported inputs. The indirect channel is through implicit competition at each of the increasing
number of links along the whole supply chain (ie contestability of markets). These channels are relevant for importcompeting goods and services and also for non-tradable inputs, such as labour. Moreover, the trends in GVCs over
time and across countries have strengthened these channels.
The impact of GVCs on inflation dynamics has been significant in recent decades. Recent research finds a strong
positive relationship between the growth of GVCs and the strengthening of global factors influencing domestic
inflation. Over time, the growth of GVCs has coincided with the rising importance of global output gaps in
explaining domestic inflation developments (Graph IV.A, centre panel). This correlation between GVCs and global
output gaps can also be seen cross-sectionally (Graph IV.A, right-hand panel): those countries that are more highly
integrated into GVCs exhibit a stronger association between global output gaps and domestic inflation.

five-year five-year-forward break-even rates) are subject to several distortions. These
include liquidity and term premia, which can be hard to interpret at times. And the
recent strong correlation between the decline in these measures and that in oil prices
remains a puzzle. The oil price decline should not have a lasting effect on inflation
five to 10 years down the road. Hence, the correlation suggests that short-term
market conditions may be having an undue influence.

Shifting from domestic to external monetary policy channels
Global demand has grown only moderately and inflation has remained stubbornly
low in advanced economies and some EMEs despite an extended period of
exceptionally accommodative monetary policy. There is a general sense that postcrisis monetary policy has faced stiff headwinds, which may have sapped its
effectiveness. Several factors have played a role, including large debt overhangs, an
impaired banking system and the need to shift resources away from temporarily
bloated sectors, such as construction and financial services. Simple analyses provide
suggestive supportive evidence. In the United States, for instance, there are signs
that the impact of policy on output via interest rates may have declined (Graph IV.6,
left-hand panel). Policy’s impact on inflation also appears to be more muted, given
indications of a further weakening of the apparent link between measures of slack
and inflation – a well known phenomenon.
These headwinds should have been abating owing to the gradual re-absorption
of debt overhangs and improvements in impaired bank balance sheets. Nevertheless,
the domestic channels through which unconventional monetary policies work may
have become less effective as these measures have intensified and time has worn
on. This could help explain why external channels, ie the exchange rate, have

gained prominence in the policy debate. A greater role for the exchange rate,
however, raises a number of issues that deserve special attention.

The diminishing effectiveness of domestic channels…
Changes in policy rates influence spending through a variety of channels. Lower
interest rates reduce the cost and improve the availability of external funding for
both households and firms, including by boosting asset prices and cash flows. More
generally, they provide incentives to bring spending forward by reducing the return
on savings and hence the amount of future consumption that has to be given up
by consuming more today.
The various types of so-called unconventional monetary policies adopted postcrisis operate in broadly similar ways. Large-scale asset purchases are designed to
boost the price (ie compress the yield) of the corresponding assets and, through
portfolio adjustments, those of others. Lending on favourable terms (ie long
maturities, generous collateral valuations etc) is intended to improve funding
conditions. Signalling the future path of the policy rates (ie forward guidance) seeks
to lower the yield curve, especially over the policy horizon. And driving the policy
rate into negative territory aims at shifting the yield curve downwards.

70

BIS 86th Annual Report

There may be reasons for believing that the effect of these policies on domestic
financial conditions could decline over time. In some cases, declining effectiveness
may reflect improving market conditions. For instance, some argue that balance
sheet measures, such as asset purchase programmes, are likely to be most effective
when financial markets are segmented and dislocated, so that the authorities’
intervention works through alleviating the corresponding stresses. As the crisis forces
waned, the apparent effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases in influencing
output declined (Graph IV.6, centre panel).
In other cases, it is the impact of these measures on financial intermediation that
may be contributing to the decline. A possible example is the impact on the financial
system’s profitability and resilience, and hence on its ability to support the economy.
As rates fall further, possibly becoming negative, and retail bank deposit rates remain
sticky, the compression of banks’ interest margins may reduce their profitability as
well as their ability and incentive to lend (Chapter VI). Some evidence suggests that
the impact of interest rates on lending weakens as they fall to very low levels and
squeeze net interest margins (Graph IV.6, right-hand panel). This might reflect the
lower profitability of the lending business, possibly in combination with scarce capital.
In Switzerland, for example, following the introduction of negative interest rates,
banks initially raised mortgage rates in order to protect their profits (Chapter II).
In yet other cases, broader behavioural factors may be at work. For instance, it
is well known that investment is not very responsive to interest rates: when interest
rates are extraordinarily low, firms may be more tempted to borrow simply in order
to buy back shares or acquire other firms (Chapter II). Similarly, at very low rates the
need to save more for retirement becomes more evident, as highlighted by the
large underfunding of pension funds (Chapter VI). Likewise, households’ confidence
may be shaken by the prospect of negative nominal interest rates, given the
widespread attention paid to nominal variables (ie “money illusion”) and the sense
of direness that adopting negative rates may convey. A recent survey finds that
only a small percentage of households would spend more if faced with negative
rates, while a similar percentage would actually spend less.1
Behavioural factors may also complicate any additional policy easing. To have
a big impact on yields and prices, easing must generally surprise markets. But
surprising them becomes harder once they become used to large doses of
accommodation: the bar rises with every measure taken. As a result, bigger
measures may be needed to generate a given effect. This may be a reason, though
not the only one, why successive large-scale asset purchase programmes appear to
have had a smaller impact on yields for any given size of purchase (Graph IV.7).
More generally, there are natural limits to the process – to how far interest
rates can be pushed into negative territory, central bank balance sheets expanded,
spreads compressed and asset prices boosted. And there are limits to how far
spending can be brought forward from the future. As these limits are approached,
the marginal effect of policy tends to decline, and any side effects – whether strictly
economic or of a political economy nature – tend to rise. This is why central banks
have been closely monitoring these side effects, such as the impact on risk-taking,
market functioning and financial institutions’ profitability.

…and the rising prominence of external channels
As the effectiveness of domestic channels seems to have waned in recent years, a
key external channel – ie the exchange rate – has naturally attracted greater

attention. All else equal, monetary policy easing generally depreciates the currency,
even if only as a by-product.
Indeed, shifts in the monetary policy stance continue to influence exchange
rates. The relationship between exchange rates and interest rate differentials over
the past few years has been fairly stable (Graph IV.8, left-hand panel). Monetary
policy decisions have loomed large in medium-term currency swings in recent years
(Chapter II). Similarly, the more prominent role of the exchange rate is evident from
the greater frequency with which central bank statements make reference to them
(Graph IV.8, centre panel) and from the seemingly larger exchange rate moves in
response to policy announcements (right-hand panel).
From a purely domestic perspective, the exchange rate channel has a number
of advantages for those economies facing stubbornly low inflation and growth. In
the presence of too much debt and an impaired banking system, currency
depreciation boosts demand while at the same time increasing saving (eg firms’
profits). This can help repair balance sheets more quickly. Historically, depreciations
have helped countries recover from crises. In addition, they have a quicker, if
generally temporary, effect on inflation, unlike the weaker and more uncertain
impact through domestic slack.
The de facto more prominent role of exchange rates, however, is not without
problems. One country’s currency depreciation is another‘s appreciation, and that
appreciation may not be welcome. This is especially so in a world in which many
central banks are facing inflation rates stubbornly below target and are seeking to
boost demand and where some have been facing the build-up of financial
imbalances. In this environment, central banks are becoming exposed to risks of
large capital inflows, including in foreign currency (Chapter III). Hence, there has

been a growing emphasis on foreign exchange intervention to stem appreciation
pressures, including by countries that had been reluctant to do so in the past
(Graph IV.9, left-hand and centre panels). The alternative or complement to such
intervention has been easing monetary policy itself. Thus, easing in the large
economies, home to international currencies, has induced easing elsewhere.2
As a result, the exchange rate has not only redistributed global demand, but
has also affected the stance of monetary policy at the global level. This arguably has
contributed to financial imbalances in those countries that have been experiencing
financial booms, notably many EMEs (Chapter III). And as the monetary policy
stance has begun to turn in the United States, commodity prices have plunged and
domestic financial cycles have been maturing, the process has started to reverse.
Thus, depreciation pressures over the past year have prompted many countries to
run down reserves (Graph IV.9). Moreover, for countries with high levels of foreign
currency debt, the hoped-for expansionary effects may not materialise (Chapter III).
All this suggests that limits apply to the effectiveness of the external channel,
especially from a global perspective. Some of the limits simply reflect the fact
that, as discussed before, the domestic measures that result in currency depreciation
in the first place can be pushed only so far and have their own well known side
effects. But others stem from the additional constraints created by the global
interaction of national monetary policies. These are even harder to address, given
the dynamics involved.

Monetary policy frameworks: integrating financial stability
Another year of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy has highlighted the
tension between price stability and financial stability. In many countries, interest
rates have been kept extraordinarily low in order to boost inflation. In some cases,
this has occurred even as strong credit and asset price increases have raised
concerns about the build-up of vulnerabilities. In other cases, concerns about the
impact of low interest rates on the profitability and soundness of financial
institutions have been more prominent (Chapter VI). All this has added fuel to the
debate over whether existing monetary policy frameworks can adequately address
the trade-offs, especially in the light of complications arising from exchange rate
swings.

Factoring in domestic financial cycle considerations
The tensions between price stability and financial stability reflect in part the
different policy horizons over which central banks aim to achieve their primary
goals. Price stability typically focuses on inflation developments over a horizon of
roughly two years or so. Financial stability risks develop over a much longer horizon,
as systemic financial strains emerge only infrequently: the corresponding financial
booms and busts last considerably longer than traditional business cycles. One
lesson from the crisis is the need to look beyond short-term inflation stabilisation
to ensure overall stability: low and stable inflation does not guarantee financial, and
thus macroeconomic, stability.
At least two concerns have been holding back a more systematic incorporation
of financial stability considerations into monetary policy. The first is that, even if
monetary policy did try to incorporate them, doing so would not improve economic

74

BIS 86th Annual Report

outcomes. The second is the lack of operational guides for implementing such a
policy, beyond general indicators of the build-up of financial risks, such as those
used in macroprudential frameworks. On balance, therefore, central banks have
preferred to rely increasingly on macroprudential measures to address financial
stability risks while keeping monetary policy firmly focused on short-term output
and inflation objectives – a kind of separation principle.
The first concern has received particular attention over the past year. Additional
research has found that a policy of “leaning against the wind” is unlikely to produce
net benefits. In this work, a financial stability-oriented monetary policy is interpreted
as one that focuses narrowly on pursuing traditional objectives most of the time: it
deviates at the margin and temporarily only to avert a financial crisis when signs of
financial imbalances emerge, such as unusually rapid credit growth. For a range of
parameter values drawn from empirical studies, this research finds that leaning
against the wind would be counterproductive in terms of deviations of output,
unemployment and inflation from desirable levels.
Such research is very useful. At the same time, there are reasons for believing
that it may underestimate the overall benefits of a financial stability-oriented
monetary policy. Some of these reasons are of a more technical nature. The research
typically assumes that the policy response does not affect the cost of crises, that
these crises occur with a given frequency and that they do not result in permanent
output losses – so that eventually output returns to its pre-crisis trend. These
assumptions tend to reduce the costs of crises and limit the potential benefits of
leaning against the wind. For example, the empirical evidence suggests that recessions
that coincide with financial crises typically lead to permanent output losses and
that growth rates may sometimes be persistently lower thereafter (Chapter V).
Other reasons have to do with the general interpretation of a financial stabilityoriented monetary policy. It is indeed possible that if the policy amounts simply to
responding to signs of financial imbalances at a somewhat advanced stage, it could
end up doing too little too late. It could even be seen as precipitating the crisis it
was supposed to avert. But a financial stability-oriented monetary policy is better
interpreted as one that takes financial stability considerations into account all the
time. In doing so, it would respond systematically to financial conditions to keep
them on an even keel throughout the entire financial cycle. The idea is not to be too
far away for too long from some notion of financial equilibrium.
Two strands of recent BIS research provide some support for this view. They
share the view that financial developments are a core feature of economic
fluctuations, whether these result in crises or not. The research considers the
possible benefits of a financial stability-oriented monetary policy applied over the
whole financial cycle. One strand highlights the analytical case for a leaningagainst-the-wind monetary policy. It argues that persistent swings in financial
booms and busts lend support to the case for leaning. Indeed, this research finds
that in this context the question is not so much whether there are gains, but how
large they are (Box IV.B).
The second strand, of a more empirical nature, estimates a small set of
equations that describe the behaviour of the US economy, drawing on a more
granular description of the financial cycle. It suggests that the implementation of
such a systematic leaning strategy might have resulted in significant output gains
(Box IV.C). Moreover, since, on average, economic slack is estimated to have been
lower in this case, there appears to have been no necessary trade-off in terms
of lower inflation. Any losses in the form of lower output and inflation in the short
run are estimated to be more than offset in the longer run. And, intuitively,
these estimates suggest that the earlier the policy is implemented, the larger are
the gains.

Box IV.B

Analytical case for a “leaning against the wind” monetary policy

A growing body of research is employing numerical simulations to evaluate the benefits and costs of monetary
policy leaning against the build-up of financial imbalances. The various approaches assess the benefits of leaning in
terms of a reduction in the likelihood of a crisis, and in its magnitude; and they assess the costs in terms of lower
output or higher unemployment in the leaning phase. The results are critically sensitive to three sets of factors: (i)
the process driving the evolution of the likelihood of a crisis and its magnitude; (ii) the impact of a tighter
monetary policy during the boom on the likelihood of a crisis and its magnitude; and (iii) how a policy easing
affects output during the bust. This box discusses the sensitivity of cost-benefit assessments to the modelling
approaches.
Clearly, as long as monetary policy cannot completely undo the costs of a crisis by “cleaning up” afterwards
(ie point (iii) above) and it can reduce its probability or magnitude (ie point (ii) above), then leaning would produce
some benefits. Intuitively, it would then pay to sacrifice at the margin a bit of output today to avoid possible future
output losses. Thus, ignoring the potential role of other tools (eg prudential measures) and broader considerations,
the question concerning optimal policies is less about whether to lean than about how much.
Some studies find that the net benefits of leaning are small or – in the case of a one-off policy tightening at
some stage in the boom – even negative. Certain assumptions underpinning the calibration contribute to this
conclusion, including the assumption that there is no permanent loss in output (Chapter V). But a key assumption
involves the evolution of the likelihood of a crisis and its magnitude. Some models assume both that the magnitude
of a crisis is independent of the size of the financial boom ahead of distress and that the crisis risk is not expected to
grow over time. For instance, the typical variable used to track the evolution of the likelihood of a crisis is credit
growth, which itself is naturally mean-reverting. These assumptions effectively imply that there is little or no cost to
delaying to lean. And they encourage consideration of counterfactual experiments in which the authorities simply
deviate temporarily from their policy rule to influence the variable of interest, here credit growth, with a short horizon.
But the dynamics underlying crisis risks may be different. Credit growth has been found to be a good leading
indicator, although by no means the only one. Other indicators put more emphasis on the gradual build-up of
vulnerabilities; these are captured by the cumulative increases in debt stocks and, relatedly, in cumulative deviations
of asset prices, especially property prices, from historical norms. In particular, cumulative deviations of the ratio of
private sector credit to GDP or debt service ratios from such norms have been found to be especially important (see
Box III.A and references therein). The idea of the financial cycle generalises these dynamics: it reflects prolonged
credit and asset price booms followed by busts, with banking stress typically taking place close to the peak of the
cycle. The contrast with the evolution of credit growth is obvious (Graph IV.B). The persistent nature of the stock

The financial cycle is much more persistent than bank credit growth

variables highlights the importance of understanding crisis dynamics, and economic fluctuations more generally,
through the lens of the cumulative process of the financial cycle.
The policy implications are significant. If the evolution of financial stability risks is more akin to the financial
cycle view, then failing to lean has a cost. In the absence of any action, the risks increase over time, and so do the
costs if larger imbalances lead to larger busts. This puts a premium on early action and on a through-the-cycle,
long-term perspective. Recent work has formalised this intuition. By calibrating a model to a stylised financial
cycle, the benefits from leaning can increase considerably relative to those found in other approaches: it pays to
lean early and systematically. This evidence is consistent with that based on a more granular financial cycle
calibration (Box IV.C).
Obviously, the analysis here is a partial one and leaves out many considerations. These include credit growth
associated with financial deepening and innovation; aspects of the uncertainty about the state of the economy and
its behaviour; and the effectiveness of alternative instruments, notably prudential policies. In addition, it abstracts
from the general equilibrium effects, especially important in small open economies, through which monetary policy
can have an impact on exchange rates and capital flows and complicate a leaning strategy (see the main text).
Nevertheless, the analysis sheds light on the importance of properly characterising crisis risks over time when
assessing the costs and benefits of leaning against financial booms and busts. It thus sharpens the questions that
need to be addressed both analytically and empirically.

  Deviations of inflation from target may also be included. But since these studies do not consider the possibility of negative supply side
shocks, there is no trade-off between stabilising output and inflation       See eg L Svensson, “Cost-benefit analysis of leaning against the
wind: are costs larger also with less effective macroprudential policy?”, IMF Working Papers, no WP/16/3, January 2016; and A Ajello,

for leaning against the wind”, BIS, mimeo, 2016.

The second strand of research also yields hints about possible measures of
the financial cycle as policy guides. Two readily available financial measures are
potential candidates (Box III.A): leverage as reflected in the ratio of private sector
debt to assets (property prices and equities); and the debt service burden.
Deviations of these measures from their long-run values help define in more
practical terms the notion of financial equilibrium. For example, responding to
the debt service ratio can play a role in improving macroeconomic outcomes
above and beyond the traditional gauges of inflation and economic activity.
Leaning early to prevent the debt service burden from getting too far out of line
could foster more stable financial conditions; a late response, once the signs of
financial imbalances are all too evident, could precipitate a bust and a costly
recession.
The second strand of research also sheds light on the question of how to think
about the natural, or equilibrium, interest rate. This is the concept to which
policymakers sometimes appeal when assessing the appropriate policy stance. As
commonly estimated, this rate draws heavily on the behaviour of inflation. All else
equal, declines in inflation signal below-potential output and a policy rate above
the natural rate.
The analysis has yielded a number of observations. First, once financial factors
are taken into account, and given a build-up of financial imbalances, the estimates
of natural rates are higher than commonly thought. This is because financial factors,
better than inflation, provide useful information about cyclical fluctuations of
output around potential. Before the financial crisis, for instance, inflation was low
and stable, and it was the outsize financial boom that arguably pointed to output
running consistently ahead of its potential.
A second observation is that, against this benchmark, the policy rate has been
consistently below the estimated natural rate, both pre- and post-crisis. To the

The financial cycle, the natural rate of interest and monetary policy

Box IV.C

How should monetary policy respond to the financial cycle? This box highlights two key insights from recent BIS
research. The first comes from supplementing the standard approach for estimating the natural interest rate by
incorporating explicitly the influence of two financial cycle proxies: the leverage and debt service burdens of the
business and household sectors (see Box III.A for details). Doing so yields what might be termed a finance-neutral
natural rate. The second and related insight comes from a counterfactual experiment that assesses whether a
monetary policy rule that responds systematically to the financial cycle can improve macroeconomic outcomes.

A finance-neutral natural rate
At the heart of the conventional approach is a natural rate of interest with two key characteristics. First, the natural
rate is defined as that which would prevail when actual output equals potential output. Second, inflation is the key
signal of unsustainability. All else equal, if output is above potential, inflation will tend to rise; if it is below, inflation
will tend to fall. However, pre-crisis experience indicates that inflation may be low and stable even if output is
moving along an unsustainable path because financial imbalances are growing. Hence, it may be misleading to rely
heavily on inflation to estimate potential output and its difference from actual output (ie the output gap) – a
common measure of economic slack (Chapter V). This, in turn, can generate distorted estimates of the natural rate.
The alternative approach makes only a small modification, adding the two financial-cycle proxies to estimate
the (finance-neutral) output gap and natural rate simultaneously. It exploits the fact that the deviations of leverage
and the debt service burden from their respective long-run (ie steady state) values have a sizeable influence on
the evolution of expenditures and output and provide a measure of how far the economy is away from financial
equilibrium.
Finance-neutral estimates of the natural rate differ significantly from conventional ones. This is illustrated for
the United States using quarterly data from 1985 to 2015. For example, the finance-neutral natural rate is currently
positive and not below zero, in contrast to what the conventional approach indicates (Graph IV.C, left-hand panel).
In line with the fall in trend output growth, the estimate of the finance-neutral natural rate has declined over time,
but it has nearly always exceeded the conventional estimate, most notably by more than 1.5 percentage points
post-crisis. Interestingly, since 2009, the policy rate adjusted for inflation has been consistently well below the
finance-neutral natural rate.

Responding throughout the financial cycle
A monetary policy rule that responds systematically to the financial cycle draws on the previous estimates of the
natural interest rate and output gap. It starts from a standard rule in which, given the estimate of the natural rate,
the policy rate responds to deviations of inflation from target and to the output gap. The rule is then augmented to
respond to a financial cycle proxy – the deviation of the debt service burden from its long-run equilibrium (ie the
“debt service gap”). The counterfactual experiment relies on a broader econometric system that traces the dynamics
of the economy (a vector autoregression – VAR).
The simulations suggest that a monetary policy which takes financial developments systematically into account
at all times can dampen the financial cycle, leading to significant output gains (Graph IV.C, centre panel). According
to the simulations, implementing the policy starting in 2003 could have resulted in output gains of roughly 1% per
year, or 12% cumulatively. The medium-term gain exceeds the near-term cost during the leaning phase, which
amounts to about 0.35% per year until 2007.
The counterfactual policy rate path indicates that policy leans early against the build-up of the imbalances and,
as a result, gains considerable room for manoeuvre after the bust (centre panel). On average, the policy rate is
1 percentage point higher until mid-2005 as the debt service gap rises alongside credit and property prices. It then
starts to decline, close to the property price peak, as the debt service burden begins to weigh more heavily on
output. Such a policy dampens the financial boom as measured by the leverage and debt service gaps (right-hand
panel). The benefits become fully apparent after the September 2008 Lehman shock (still included in the simulations).
A smaller debt overhang results in a much shallower recession and allows policymakers to start normalising policy
as early as 2011.
The counterfactual exercise also points to a smaller decline in the finance-neutral natural rate (not shown). This
is around 40 basis points higher, on average, after the recession in 2009, suggesting that potential output growth is
more resilient. This, in turn, supports policy normalisation.

Results are based on Borio et al (2016). 2 The finance-neutral natural rate is estimated with a Kalman filter based on Laubach and Williams
(2016) and extended to include the leverage gap in the output gap equation. 3 Updated data provided by Laubach and Williams
(2016). 4 In the counterfactual experiment, monetary policy follows an augmented Taylor rule that takes account of the finance-neutral
natural rate, the finance-neutral output gap, inflation and the debt service burden gap. The counterfactual is implemented using a recursive
procedure. First, the finance-neutral natural rate and output gap are estimated up to a point in time; second, a vector autoregression (VAR)
is used to simulate the economy one period ahead conditional on the augmented monetary policy rule. Residuals from the full-sample VAR,
including the Lehman shock and outliers, are retained for the counterfactual exercise. The counterfactual policy starts in Q1 2003.

In the exercise, the output gains come with little change in overall inflation performance, even though interest
rates are generally higher than in the baseline. This is not too surprising. Confirming well known findings, economic
activity has little traction on inflation in the estimation; and, importantly, output is on average higher and the output
gap lower in the counterfactual. In fact, even though inflation is around 10 basis points lower in the early part of the
counterfactual, it ends up around 25 basis points higher. This suggests that mitigating really bad outcomes could
help with both output and inflation.
The gains are larger if one starts the counterfactual experiment further back in time, eg in 1996. An earlier
implementation succeeds in better containing financial imbalances. In this case, output is cumulatively some 24%
higher (1.2% per year).
This exercise carries a number of important caveats. The most critical one is that the estimated relationships are
assumed to be invariant to the change in the policy rule. Even so, the analysis suggests that a monetary policy
framework that responds systematically to the financial cycle has the potential to promote better output and, as a
result, better inflation performance over the medium term.

retained, including the large negative output residual around the Lehman crisis, which indicates that the VAR cannot fully account for the
fall in output at that point. This also means that, by construction, this residual source of output variation cannot be smoothed out in the
counterfactual exercise.

extent that they may have contributed to the costly financial boom and bust, low
rates in the past can then be seen as one reason for even lower rates today. This
finding underscores the concern about the potential easing bias in current
frameworks. Moreover, had policy succeeded in mitigating the financial cycle, and
therefore its costs, equilibrium rates could also be higher today.

Finally, moving the economy closer to financial equilibrium may require the
policy rate to deviate considerably from the natural rate in the short run – even the
natural rate which incorporates the role of financial factors.
Clearly, any such research is subject to a number of caveats, and counterfactual
exercises are fraught with serious difficulties. Even so, the results are consistent with
the general proposition that a financial stability-oriented strategy means more than
occasionally leaning against the wind. The costs and benefits of the strategy are
best assessed over the course of the full financial cycle. And it suggests that policy
choices at any given time can have important implications for financial developments
both today and in the future, in turn significantly constraining future policy options
(Chapter I).

Factoring in exchange rate considerations
Experience over the past several years has shown that risks to financial stability can
originate both domestically and internationally. As an example, the unsustainable
credit and asset price booms in past decades have been accompanied by waves of
cross-border lending by both banks and non-banks (Chapter III). The impact of external
influences has been felt especially by financially integrated small open economies.
Such dynamics complicate financial stability-oriented monetary policymaking.
The potency of these international forces helps explain why central banks keep
a close eye on global developments. Exchange rate flexibility can help promote
financial stability, but only up to a point. On the one hand, flexibility may reduce
incentives to stoke financial booms through one-sided exchange rate expectations,
thereby helping insulate economies from international financial influences. On the
other hand, prolonged unidirectional swings in the exchange rate are still possible.
These, in turn, can fuel the build-up of financial imbalances, including by
encouraging currency mismatches. A key mechanism operates through the greater
willingness to provide foreign currency funding to domestic borrowers that have
such mismatches: when these borrowers’ foreign currency liabilities exceed their
assets, a local currency appreciation improves their balance sheets (ie the risktaking channel of the exchange rate) (Chapter III). These factors help explain why
central banks are reluctant to see large deviations of their policy rates from those
that prevail in key international currencies, most notably the US dollar.
Of course, when external financial conditions reverse, in response to either
global developments or a turn in domestic financial cycles, they can create serious
economic strains. The currency depreciates, foreign currency debt burdens rise and
spreads soar (Graph IV.10).
The previous discussion suggests that the influence of central banks whose
currencies are used extensively abroad (ie international currencies) extends well
beyond national borders.3 This is not only because the rest of the world can borrow
heavily in those currencies, but also because even financial asset prices denominated
in domestic currencies are especially sensitive to conditions in the core currency
economies. If business cycles are well synchronised, such influences may not be a
major concern. This is also true for financial cycles. However, when they are out of
synch, the concerns become more significant, especially if monetary policies in core
currency economies diverge significantly from each other and from those elsewhere.
This raises tough challenges for small open economies seeking to pursue a
financial stability-oriented monetary policy. The concern is that a tightening of
monetary policy designed to rein in a financial boom may be partly offset by the

induced portfolio adjustments and foreign currency borrowing, thereby leading to
an unwelcome exchange rate appreciation and further foreign currency borrowing.
The ample global liquidity that has prevailed in recent years heightens such risks.
Moreover, the appreciation would also reduce inflation, at least temporarily,
exacerbating the trade-off with price stability whenever inflation fell below
objectives.
There are at least a couple of ways in which this trade-off may be addressed.
One is to lean against the currency appreciation through foreign exchange
intervention. This strategy has been used extensively in the past. It also has a
favourable by-product – the accumulation of foreign exchange reserve buffers. The
buffers would come in handy once the tide reverses. However, the historical record
on the ability of intervention to rein in an appreciation is not clear-cut. And, at
times, uncomfortably large interventions may be necessary.
A second strategy is to rely more on other policies in order to lighten the
burden on monetary policy. Prudential, and in particular macroprudential, policies
are essential in this context. Many countries have chosen this approach. Another
possibility, hardly explored in practice, is to enlist the support of fiscal policy
(Chapter V). As a last resort, one might also envisage temporary and careful use of
capital flow management measures, as long as the imbalances do not reflect
fundamental domestic disequilibria.
In all these strategies, it is important to avoid unbalanced policies that pull in
opposite directions. An obvious example is easing monetary policy with an eye to
currency appreciation while tightening macroprudential measures. This mix might
send conflicting signals about policymakers’ intentions. Experience suggests that
these tools work best when used as complements rather than substitutes (see the
84th Annual Report).
The additional difficulties that arise in pursuing a financial stability-oriented
monetary policy in small open economies raise broader questions about the design
of the international monetary and financial system. As discussed in Chapter V of

BIS 86th Annual Report

81

last year’s Annual Report, there is a need to establish adequate anchors for the
system as a whole. For monetary policy, this means a number of options with
increasing degrees of ambition. One is enlightened self-interest, based on a
thorough exchange of information. For example, when setting domestic policies,
countries would individually seek to take spillovers and spillbacks more
systematically into account; large jurisdictions that are home to international
currencies have a special responsibility. Going one step further (and beyond the
coordination seen during crises), cooperation could extend to occasional joint
decisions on both interest rates and foreign exchange intervention. The third, and
most ambitious, possibility would be to develop and implement new global rules of
the game that would help instil greater discipline in national policies.

V. Towards a financial stability-oriented fiscal policy

Since 2008, policymakers have striven to contain the build-up of new financial
vulnerabilities and to avoid repeating the mistakes that led to the Great Financial
Crisis (GFC). They have tightened prudential regulation and supervision and made
increasing use, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs), of macroprudential
tools. But are these measures enough? Should not fiscal policy, too, be an essential
part of the post-crisis macro-financial stability framework?
Financial stability generally, and financial cycles in particular, hardly feature in
the design of fiscal policy. Yet history shows that financial crises wreak havoc with
public finances. The latest crisis is no exception. Since 2007, public debt in many
advanced economies has reached unprecedented peacetime peaks, in some cases
raising serious doubts about its sustainability. Growing fiscal risks, in turn, weaken
the financial system: they undermine the credibility of deposit guarantees and
other financial backstops; weaken the balance sheets of banks holding public debt;
and reduce the scope for authorities to run countercyclical policies.
The close two-way link between banks and public sector balance sheets also
creates the potential for an adverse feedback loop. In this case, sovereign and
financial risks reinforce each other, as demonstrated in the recent euro area debt
crisis. To weaken this loop, it is essential to move away from the present favourable
treatment of sovereign exposures in bank regulation to a framework that more
accurately reflects sovereign risk. But this, by itself, is not enough. Banks would
continue to be exposed indirectly, through the increased macroeconomic instability
that rising sovereign risks can generate.
Maintaining or rebuilding a sound fiscal position is therefore key and requires
that fiscal policy be run in a prudent and countercyclical way. If sufficient buffers
are built up in a financial boom, room is created to repair balance sheets and
stimulate demand when a crisis occurs. At the same time, a stronger countercyclical
stance may also help contain the rise in credit and asset prices. But the most
important contribution to crisis prevention may come from adjusting the structural
component of fiscal policy: in many countries, the current long-term composition
of taxes and subsidies unduly incentivises debt over equity, leading to excessive
leverage and greater financial fragility.
After reviewing the historical record, this chapter discusses how the financial
sector can be protected from the sovereign – focusing particularly on the treatment
of banks’ sovereign exposures in prudential regulation. It then suggests how a more
active and targeted fiscal policy could be used to safeguard the sovereign from
private sector financial excess.

The historical record
Since the GFC, several studies have parsed the historical record to investigate the
causes and consequences of crises. A key conclusion is that, in both advanced
economies and EMEs, systemic banking crises are often preceded by a large and rapid
rise in private credit and asset prices. In other words, a financial bust is a financial
boom gone wrong. That does not rule out excess public borrowing as a precursor
of banking troubles, as Greece vividly demonstrated in 2009–10 and a number

BIS 86th Annual Report

83

of EMEs did in the 1980s and 1990s. But, at least among advanced economies,
an upsurge in government borrowing has rarely preceded a banking crisis. And
sovereign crises have generally been less frequent than banking crises.1
This observation does not make public debt irrelevant. On the contrary,
another important conclusion is that the level of public debt critically amplifies the
costs of a financial crisis. The higher the public debt at the onset of the crisis, the
deeper the recession and the slower the recovery. Financial crises typically lead to
substantial increases in public debt in their immediate aftermath. If public debt is
already high, this may push debt closer to its limit. If so, sovereign spreads may
soar and stabilisation policies may become severely constrained, worsening private
sector financing conditions and deepening the output shortfall.
What follows considers, in turn, the damage a financial bust causes to public
finances and the channels through which fiscal risks exacerbate financial risk.

The financial sector as a source of sovereign strains
Graph V.1 shows the behaviour of general government debt around banking crises
over the post-Bretton Woods period. Three facts stand out. First, the post-crisis
increase in public debt has been substantial in advanced economies and larger than
in EMEs. The median rise is about 15 percentage points of GDP within three years
in advanced economies (Graph V.1, left-hand panel) and 8 percentage points in
EMEs (Graph V.1, right-hand panel). Second, debt continues to rise after the initial
surge, if only gradually, for several years. Third, public debt is relatively stable
before the crisis, consistent with the view that public borrowing is usually not
responsible for the pre-crisis build-up of vulnerabilities.
Compared with the post-1970 crisis episodes, the GFC has led to larger and
more persistent increases in public debt. After three years, the median debt rise in
advanced economies was about the same as in previous episodes, but it was over
10 percentage points larger after eight years (Graph V.1, left-hand panel). The larger
increase probably reflects the greater severity and, to some extent, the policy
response to the latest crisis. By contrast, only in a few EMEs did banks require public
support during the GFC.
Several factors typically drive the steep post-crisis rise in public debt.
First, the sovereign uses available fiscal resources to support the repair of
banks’ balance sheets (bailout costs). The government’s role is critical, ranging from
purchasing bad assets to recapitalising institutions, sometimes through temporary
ownership. In some cases, the sovereign’s support also extends to non-financial
borrowers, including both corporations and households.
Bailout costs can be quite large, but are difficult to estimate precisely, even ex
post. Depending on the method and time horizon, estimates vary widely. Moreover,
over time, countries may be able to recover some or most of the initial costs,
in some cases even making a small net profit, provided they resolve the crisis
effectively. In EMEs, but not in advanced economies, such costs seem to be the
main source of the debt increase.2

Second, the collapse in output and employment and their slow recovery sap
revenues and boost non-discretionary spending and transfers through automatic
stabilisers. Initial output losses are substantial and surprisingly similar in advanced
economies and EMEs, at least in the post-Bretton Woods period. Measured from
peak to trough or from the peak to the point at which the growth rate returns to
pre-crisis rates, such losses range from 6 to 15% on average across countries,
against less than 4% in recessions not preceded by a financial crisis. In general,
crises usher in weak recoveries: it takes several years for activity to return to its precrisis peak. Above all, there is evidence that these losses are not entirely recouped:
the level of output does not return to its pre-crisis trend.
The one-off permanent loss of output may also go hand in hand with a longlasting decline in trend output growth. Until recently, the literature had generally
failed to find permanent effects on growth. But recent research has found that
productivity growth may slow down for many years.3 High public debt may be one
reason. Lack of fiscal space may imply persistently higher credit spreads and higher
distortionary taxation, which may exert a significant drag on productivity. Moreover,
any reluctance to use fiscal resources to repair balance sheets can prolong the

economy’s weakness. The Japanese experience, in which repair was delayed
following the early 1990s bust, is a cautionary tale.
Third, the policy response may lead to a further deterioration in the fiscal
position. If authorities have room for manoeuvre, they may increase discretionary
spending or cut taxes to prop up aggregate demand. Several advanced economies
did so in the wake of the GFC. In fact, in advanced economies the fiscal expansion,
through either automatic stabilisers or discretionary measures, is frequently the
single most important cause of the debt increase. By contrast, in EMEs the room for
manoeuvre is smaller, most likely due to the tighter financing constraints they
usually face after a crisis.
Fourth, for a given behaviour of output and income, compositional effects may
weaken public finances further. In particular, the collapse in asset prices can play a
key role. For example, empirical studies indicate that 30–40% of the deterioration
of fiscal balances that took place in the United Kingdom and Sweden in the early
1990s was due to asset price effects, especially in the real estate market.4
Finally, exchange rates may play a similar role. This is the case whenever debt is
denominated in a foreign currency and, as often happens, the crisis coincides with
a sharp currency depreciation. Indeed, such concerns have been behind EMEs’
attempts to reduce their reliance on foreign currency borrowing since the crises of
the 1980s and 1990s. Even so, the sovereign may still remain indirectly exposed to
currency mismatches if the private sector indulges in this practice.

The sovereign as a source of financial strains
The euro area debt crisis has reminded us that sovereign defaults are no longer
confined to history or less developed economies. It would be unsafe, however, to
assume that sovereign defaults occur only in countries that have given up their
monetary sovereignty, such as those in the euro area, or in those that have borrowed
in foreign currency. Defaults on domestic debt, albeit less frequent than those on
foreign debt, are far from rare. Often, but not always, domestic defaults accompany
external defaults, tending to occur when countries face harsher economic conditions
and markedly higher inflation. In these circumstances, authorities may view default
as less costly than high inflation, especially when debt is short-term or indexed.5
Moreover, even short of an outright default, an unsustainable fiscal position can
have adverse consequences. One is higher inflation. Inflation volatility and uncertainty
about the possible policy response can be very costly for financial and economic
activity. Another is a sudden stop or abrupt capital flow reversal, which may interact
with the financial damage caused by large currency depreciations. But, even before
any of these scenarios materialises, a loss in the sovereign’s perceived creditworthiness
can have pervasive effects on banks. Several mechanisms may be at work.
First, such a loss can weaken banks’ balance sheets directly.6 It causes capital
losses, whose incidence depends on the amount and duration of the government

See eg C Reinhart and K Rogoff, “The forgotten history of domestic debt”, Economic Journal, vol 121,
2011. Ratings acknowledge that domestic (local currency) debt is not riskless. For the 74 sovereigns
that received first-time local currency sovereign ratings from at least one of the three major rating
agencies between 1995 and 1999, the average gap between local and foreign currency ratings for
the same sovereign narrowed from about 1.8 notches to 0.2 as of end-2015.

bonds held. And it can tighten banks’ funding conditions, weakening them further.
Even if losses are not marked to market, investors will in all probability perceive
banks as riskier. Higher sovereign risk also reduces the value of sovereign securities
that can be pledged as collateral, and that of explicit and implicit government
guarantees. Indeed, sovereign rating downgrades normally translate into lower
ratings for banks too. The sovereign normally represents a “ceiling” for firms’ ratings.7
Second, a loss in creditworthiness can weaken banks indirectly, through its
broader impact on the economy. For one, it can increase the cost of market finance.
Sovereign yields typically set a floor under private market funding costs. Even large
firms with access to foreign capital markets are not spared, unless they have large
operations and sales abroad. In addition, economic weakness can depress credit
demand and boost debt arrears and defaults among bank customers. Both factors
also limit the ability of private non-financial issuers to substitute market debt for
bank debt or equity funding.
Finally, financial repression may also creep in. Faced with rising sovereign risk,
authorities may introduce measures aimed at reducing rollover risks and borrowing
costs (eg cross-border capital controls, financial transaction taxes).8 This erodes
bank profitability and may further dent investor confidence.

The doom loop
This analysis suggests that sovereign risk and financial system risk can be mutually
reinforcing. Empirical studies too have found evidence of significant contagion and
two-way feedback between them (also known as the “doom loop”). The GFC
highlighted this risk. A number of findings stand out.
First, sovereign and bank credit default swap (CDS) spreads tend to co-move
and influence each other. The link is tighter than can be explained by common
factors, such as the state of the economy or market volatility, pointing to a causal
interdependence.9
Second, the size of sovereign and bank CDS spreads and their correlation tend
to be higher in countries that are fiscally weaker. Similarly, weaker banks, as measured
by market-to-book ratios, are associated with high public debt ratios (Graph V.2, lefthand panel). Furthermore, the two-way contagion is stronger for countries with a
larger financial sector and a higher share of bank-intermediated finance.
Third, the higher the share of domestic sovereign debt in banks’ assets, the
stronger is the effect (Graph V.2, centre panel). As an indication that this relationship
does not simply reflect country risk, research has also shown that, within the same
country, banks with larger domestic sovereign exposures cut credit by more than
other banks do in response to increased sovereign risk.10 The characteristics of

Short-term debt issuance usually increases steeply during episodes of fiscal stress, reflecting both
the risk of default and higher future inflation. This increases rollover risks for the sovereign.

individual banks or the banking sector also matter. Sovereign risk more strongly
affects banks that are less capitalised, more reliant on wholesale funding and with
lower loan-to-asset ratios.11
The GFC provides a vivid illustration of the feedback mechanisms at play. When
the crisis began in 2008, bank solvency risk, as measured by CDS spreads, went up
without increasing sovereign risk. After the first bailouts and explicit government
guarantees, bank CDS spreads fell. But soon afterwards, this raised sovereign risk.
And when the euro area crisis broke out in 2010, the co-movement increased strongly
in stressed countries. Confronted by high debt and a lack of fiscal space, financial
market participants viewed risks as intertwined (Graph V.2, right-hand panel).

Protecting the financial sector from sovereign risk
In many countries, domestic government securities constitute a significant share of
bank and non-bank assets, directly exposing them to sovereign risk. This is true of
both banks and non-bank financial institutions, such as pension funds, insurance
firms and collective investment vehicles. How can prudential regulation help protect

them from sovereign risk? What follows focuses first and foremost on banks, given
their critical role in systemic risk and macroeconomic stability. That said, a fuller
treatment would also need to address other types of institution, not least given
their growing importance in the financial system (Chapter VI).

Bank exposures to sovereign risk
Banks’ exposures to the domestic sovereign differ significantly across countries. For
example, as a share of bank assets, exposures are now relatively large in Brazil,
India, Italy, Japan and Mexico, but small in Canada, Chile, Sweden and Switzerland
(Graph V.3, left-hand panel). In general, they tend to be larger in EMEs than in
advanced economies.
Such cross-country differences tend to persist over time, reflecting in part
structural factors. One such factor is financial depth. For example, in several EMEs
government bonds are the only high-grade domestic security. A second is public
debt. Banks in countries with high public debt, such as Brazil, India, Italy and Japan,
naturally exhibit relatively higher sovereign exposures. A third is the central bank
market operations framework, which defines eligible collateral. In some countries,
for instance, only public sector securities are eligible. Finally, regulatory constraints
differ across countries. Yet, over time and especially post-crisis, regulation has
become increasingly harmonised, generally in the direction of favouring public
debt over private debt. A good example is the new international standards for
liquidity regulation, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) (Chapter VI).
Sovereign exposures also vary significantly over time within countries, reflecting
both secular and cyclical forces (Graph V.3, centre panel). In EMEs, exposures (as a
share of assets) have been on a declining trend, interrupted only temporarily by the
GFC. This trend partly echoes the increasing financial sophistication and integration
of EMEs, but also financial booms and hence strong private credit growth. In

advanced economies too, sovereign exposures were on a downward trend before
the GFC. Yet, as the financial cycle turned and public debt rose sharply, exposures
began to rise again (Graph V.3, centre panel). Unsurprisingly, when credit demand
declines and risk appetite is low, there may be no better alternatives to domestic
public debt in terms of liquidity and safety.
The post-crisis increase in exposures has not been uniform across countries.
Particularly in the euro area, cross-country dispersion and the home bias have risen.
Moreover, the home bias has risen relatively more in countries that were under
fiscal stress (Graph V.3, right-hand panel). This seems paradoxical. To be sure, banks
profit from the higher spread between their own sovereign and their funding costs.
But this does not explain why investors in other countries do not take advantage of
it. One possibility is that domestic banks’ equity holders and managers are able to
shift part of the additional risk onto bank creditors and the taxpayer (risk-shifting).
In the case of a sovereign default, the lack of a backstop would affect all domestic
banks, even those with little exposure to domestic debt. Another possibility is moral
suasion. During market stress, authorities may induce banks to play a stabilising
role as contrarian investors. Over time, however, this would risk tightening the link
between banks and sovereigns unless policymakers took advantage of calmer
market conditions to strengthen public finances.

Treatment of sovereign risk in prudential regulation
The Basel risk-weighted capital framework prescribes minimum capital requirements
commensurate with the underlying credit risk, in line with the objective of ensuring
risk sensitivity. This applies to sovereign debt too. There are, however, exceptions
to the general rule.12 Under the Standardised Approach for credit risk and market
risk, sovereign exposures are risk-weighted according to their external ratings,
with positive risk weights prescribed for debt rated at under AA–. But national
supervisors can, at their discretion, apply a lower or even zero weight to domestic
sovereign debt, provided it is denominated and funded in domestic currency. Under
the alternative method for credit risk, the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach,
banks are permitted to use their own models to estimate default probabilities and
loss-given-default. In this case, sovereign debt is exempt from the 3 basis point
floor under the default probability prescribed for private issuers with broadly similar
characteristics. In fact, the risk weights typically applied to domestic sovereign debt
are often close to zero. Another key aspect of the present regulation is that sovereign
debt is also exempt from the large exposure requirement that limits exposures to any
single counterparty or group of connected counterparties to 25% of eligible capital.
The standard argument for treating sovereign debt as if it were (almost) riskfree is that a sovereign can always meet the nominal repayment by issuing more
of its own currency. This argument is vulnerable to three criticisms. First, debt
monetisation may not be feasible due to institutional constraints, as in the euro area,
or it may not always be the least costly option, as indicated by several past cases,
especially in EMEs. Second, within a country, subnational entities (eg municipal or
regional governments) or state-owned enterprises can and do default. This is
normally reflected in different market prices for their debt. Finally, volatility in bond
prices driven by changing perceptions of fiscal risks can hurt banks, even short of
default (see above). This is true even when credit risk in a narrow sense is ruled out
and investors worry only about higher inflation or currency devaluation.

Eliminating the present favourable treatment of sovereign exposures would
have several benefits.13 Ex ante, it would discourage the build-up of large bank
exposures in domestic sovereign bonds, thus also limiting moral hazard on the part
of banks and regulators. Ex post, it would make banks better capitalised and able
to withstand financial distress. These factors should promote both better risk
management and greater macroeconomic resilience, not least by attenuating the
“doom loop”. This could ultimately translate into lower long-term funding costs for
both banks and the government.14 Moreover, by reducing distortions among asset
classes, it could also increase the supply of credit to private non-financial corporates.
These benefits need to be weighed against potential adverse effects on the
functioning of the financial system. At least three are relevant.
First, banks may have less room to act as buffers or contrarian investors at times
of market stress. Critics argue that self-fulfilling liquidity crises may become more
likely; and by limiting the room for countercyclical fiscal policy, country risk and
hence the health of banks may deteriorate. However, reducing the scope for banks
to play this role could improve the ex ante incentives towards sound fiscal policy,
thus making market stress less likely in the first place. Policymakers will have to
tread a fine line between avoiding bad outcomes ex post and providing the right
incentives ex ante.
Second, bond market liquidity may be lower even outside periods of market
stress. Regulatory capital charges on government securities may increase bank
intermediation costs in both the cash and repo markets for sovereign securities, as
dealers reduce inventories. Yet, if banks become more resilient and market stress
less likely, market liquidity should become more robust and central banks would
have to provide emergency liquidity less frequently (Chapter VI).
Third, monetary policy transmission may become less effective. Government
bonds are a key source of collateral in repo markets, which facilitates arbitrage by
enhancing bank liquidity and flexibility to fund positions. By inhibiting bond
holdings, regulation may therefore lead to less arbitrage and greater interest rate
volatility, hence weakening the impact of policy rate changes on long-term yields.
Yet this is no sure conclusion. Non-bank institutions, too, may ensure sufficient
arbitrage along the yield curve. And central banks could further help by adding
such institutions to their list of eligible counterparties. Furthermore, by improving
banks’ resilience, regulation may reduce interest rate volatility on average, making
the transmission mechanism more stable over the cycle.
The strength of these potentially adverse effects depends, to a significant extent,
on the financial system’s structure and sophistication. In less developed financial
systems, banks tend to have less room for diversification domestically. Their nonbank investor base may be relatively small. And diversifying away from home debt
would expose banks to currency risk, which may be costly to hedge. Another
important factor is the size of outstanding public debt. Countries with very high
levels of public debt may find it difficult or impossible to impose strict limits on bank
holdings. That said, financial systems operate with quite different levels of sovereign
exposure, as noted above, suggesting that these are issues for the transition to a
stricter regulation, but not necessarily an argument against regulation per se.
Against this backdrop, any change to the current treatment of sovereign
exposures would have to take into account a number of issues.

The first is how to measure sovereign risk. Most sovereigns, especially among
advanced economies, have not defaulted in the last few decades. While the recent
historical record does not imply zero default probability or zero loss-given-default,
it provides little information for estimating these two parameters under the IRB
Approach. Under the Standardised Approach, instead, risk weights are based on
ratings provided by external agencies (or, in jurisdictions where this is not possible,
on alternative metrics). Credit ratings summarise a large amount of information and
are supposed to be forward-looking. They are also readily available and known to
provide reliable ordinal rankings of risk. Yet they also tend to change infrequently
and abruptly, as rating agencies seek to avoid ratings volatility. Moreover, authorities
in various countries have outlawed, or are now actively discouraging, their use for
regulatory purposes.
Alternative measures could be based on market or non-market indicators. The
former, such as CDS spreads, are readily available and easy to translate into familiar
risk measures such as default probabilities. But their pricing is also affected by
liquidity risk premia and shifts in investors’ risk appetite (Chapter II), making them
highly volatile. Furthermore, the necessary data may not be available for all
countries. This leaves more standard non-market metrics such as debt-to-GDP
ratios and other indicators of fiscal sustainability or country risk. Still, the translation
of these indicators into risk weights is inevitably sensitive to modelling assumptions.
The second issue is what regulatory instruments to use: risk weights, large
exposure limits or a combination of the two? Higher risk weights raise the required
capital on each unit of investment in sovereign bonds, aiming to ensure that banks
are sufficiently capitalised to withstand eventual losses. Large exposure limits
constrain risk concentration more directly. Soft limits – increasing risk weights based
on a bank’s concentration of sovereign exposures – are also possible, making them
more similar to risk weights. For instance, an increasing capital charge may be
imposed for exposures above the limit or for step-wise thresholds.
The third issue concerns the consistency of credit risk regulation with the
treatment of other risks. For example, sovereign debt tends to be held in the
banking book, which does not require Pillar 1 capital charges for interest rate risk.
The treatment of these holdings is therefore inconsistent with the use of zero risk
weights in the credit risk framework, which effectively assume that the government
can monetise its debt – which would necessarily translate into market risk. In
addition, government securities are eligible for the LCR. This indicates that they can
be sold at any time; moreover, even when used as collateral, they are subject to
haircuts. Consistency would then suggest that they be held in the trading book.
Requiring banks to reallocate their holdings accordingly would address both
inconsistencies and would help to better align banks’ risk-taking incentives, albeit
at the cost of potentially larger reductions in capital at times of sovereign stress.
The final issue is how to handle the transition to any new sovereign risk
requirement. Non-zero risk weights would require banks in several jurisdictions to
raise their capital ratios and strict exposure limits to scale down exposures, especially
in countries with high public debt. To prevent any adverse impact, the transition to
any new treatment would have to be gradual. And regardless of the letter of the
regulation, experience suggests that banks might try to front-load the reduction in
exposures. Where diversification possibilities are limited, such as in several EMEs,
complementary measures to broaden the investor base would also help.
In conclusion, the current prudential treatment of sovereign exposures is no
longer tenable. Moving to a more balanced treatment that acknowledges the risky
nature of public debt would provide a clear signal that no asset is truly defaultfree. It would also reduce distortions by respecting proportionality to risks, and
weaken the adverse feedback loop between the sovereign and banks. That said,

92

BIS 86th Annual Report

any change would also need to take into account the special role of sovereign
debt in the financial system – as a source of liquidity and a potential buffer for the
macroeconomy. Moreover, the risk of possible side or unintended effects, especially
during the transition, needs to be addressed.
Even then, though, banks would still be exposed to sovereign risk indirectly.
And the sovereign is the ultimate backstop for the banking system. Hence,
prudential regulation is a useful complement to sound fiscal finances, but not a
substitute for them.

Protecting the sovereign from financial sector risk
Recognising and measuring the flattering effect of financial booms
The first step towards protecting the sovereign from financial sector risk is to
recognise that fiscal positions, as typically measured, may provide a misleading
view of a country’s actual fiscal situation. This is especially the case during a financial
boom, in particular if accompanied by a commodity upswing, notably in EMEs
(Chapter III). Potential output and potential growth are overestimated. Compositional
effects, especially those associated with rises in asset or commodity prices, boost
revenues further.15 And nominal exchange rates may appreciate, temporarily
reducing the domestic currency equivalent of foreign exchange-denominated debt
and the corresponding interest payments. A further complication is that, under
political economy pressure, policymakers may feel encouraged to relax fiscal policy
further.
Standard measures of the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance do not account for
these effects. One possible, yet partial, remedy is to adjust the fiscal balance using
measures of the output gap that incorporate information about credit and financial
developments. Box V.A explains and illustrates the method. The comparison with
ordinary measures is striking. In the boom that preceded the GFC, fiscal balances
adjusted according to standard measures of the output gap were stronger than the
corresponding unadjusted fiscal balance (Graph V.A, red bars). In comparison with
either of these measures, fiscal balances adjusted using the finance-neutral output
gap (a measure that incorporates information on the financial cycle) were weaker
(blue bars). Between 2003 and 2008, the cyclical adjustment to the fiscal balance
was negative and amounted to almost 0.70 percentage points of GDP in the United
States, almost 1 in Spain and around 0.25 in Italy. Alternatively, for countries that
rely heavily on commodity exports, the cyclical correction of fiscal balances can be
made using information about commodity prices (Chapter III).
Correcting fiscal balances in this way helps, but is not sufficient. To obtain a
fully neutral measure of the fiscal balance over the financial boom-bust cycle
requires other elements to be taken into account, including the compositional
effects of asset price booms (for a given output level), exchange rate-induced
effects on the valuation of debt, and systematic patterns in interest rate behaviour.
Importantly, such a measure would also have to incorporate the expected realisation
of contingent liabilities. In practice, contingent liabilities are hard to measure. Some
are explicit and known ex ante, but most are not. Even when they are explicit and
their full scope could be defined, the information is rarely aggregated. As to implicit
liabilities, their scope is difficult to define ex ante. The historical record can provide

Asset price booms can affect personal and corporate income taxes as well as rental income
through sales or the accrual of capital gains. In addition, taxes are also paid on transactions. Since
turnover intensifies during a boom, revenues tend to increase for a given level of asset prices.

Box V.A

Fiscal balances and the financial cycle

A key indicator of the fiscal stance is the budget balance, ie government revenues minus current expenditure.
However, since an upswing of the business cycle naturally boosts revenues and reduces expenditure, fiscal balances
need to be adjusted in order to measure the underlying solidity of fiscal positions. Such an adjustment is normally
based on standard measures of the difference between actual and potential output (the “output gap”). However,
since these measures do not account for financial conditions, they may misestimate potential output. BIS research
has developed an alternative measure of potential output obtained by augmenting a standard method (the HodrickPrescott (HP) filter) with information from credit and property prices (a “finance-neutral” measure). Such a measure
can help to recognise in real time the economy’s disguised overheating due to unsustainable financial booms, and
the flattering effect on fiscal balances. This box illustrates how to obtain a finance-neutral measure of the fiscal
balance by a simple modification of the cyclical adjustment procedure in use at the OECD.
According to the OECD methodology, cyclically adjusted balances are constructed by adjusting government
revenues and expenditure by the position of output relative to potential. In formal terms, the cyclically adjusted
fiscal balance B* is defined as:
�∗ � �∑���� �� �� ∗ ⁄����� � ��� ∗ ⁄���� � ��⁄� ∗ ,

where Y and Y* denote, respectively, actual and potential output; Ti are revenues from different types of tax (personal
and corporate income taxes, social security contributions and indirect taxes); G is primary government expenditure;
and X is non-tax revenues. Tax revenues and government expenditure are adjusted by means of their elasticities
with respect to the output gap, denoted, respectively, by ηTi and ηG.
Naturally, estimates of the output gap play a key role in the formula. This is illustrated in Graph V.A, which
compares cyclical adjustments based on the finance-neutral output gap with those based on the HP filter during the
run-up to the Great Recession. The results are striking: the HP-filtered cyclical adjustments consistently improve the
apparent fiscal strength for all countries, while those based on the finance-neutral measure worsen it in all cases.
The average of the pre-crisis adjustment under the finance-neutral approach accounts for almost 1% of GDP in
Spain and more than ½% in the United States and the United Kingdom, while it is around ¼% for Italy. The effects
of the financial cycle on estimates of fiscal solidity are also visible for EMEs, although they are somewhat less
sizeable. The average pre-crisis adjustment is about ½% for Hungary and South Africa, while it is close to zero for
Poland, although this result compares with the positive adjustment of almost ½% suggested by the HP filter.
The method illustrated above to correct potential output for the effects of the financial cycle has the advantage
of simplicity, parsimony and transparency. Yet it also has drawbacks. One is that it only slowly recognises the
permanent loss of output that appears to be a stylised feature of financial crises. Moreover, it does not adjust
entirely for the effects of the financial cycle. These effects include the likely use of public sector money to support

some clues as to the possible losses. Direct bailout costs tend to increase with the
size of the financial sector as well as the duration and scale of the financial boom.
Even so, estimates based on past banking crises are subject to considerable
uncertainty.
This analysis also has implications for any assessment of fiscal space at the
present moment (Box V.B), suggesting that the need for an additional buffer to
address financial stability risks should be explicitly taken into account. This is
especially important in countries that have recently been experiencing financial
booms. But it also applies to those that have not: from a structural, long-run
perspective, the extra buffer is an essential ingredient of macro-financial stability
frameworks, regardless of specific cyclical conditions. Furthermore, interest rates
have sunk to exceptionally and persistently low levels (Chapter II), which may lead
policymakers and investors to overestimate fiscal sustainability.

Can fiscal policy be used to contain financial sector risks?
Fiscal policy could also be employed to actively restrain financial booms and
stabilise output around a sustainable level, rather than simply containing a boom’s
fallout as it turns to bust. This could be done in two ways: by adjusting the cyclical
stance of fiscal policy; or by modifying its structural component.
At the cyclical level, fiscal policy could usefully help monetary and
macroprudential policy to lean against the wind. Recent research suggests that
tighter fiscal policy has, on average, materially restrained private credit growth with
relatively small output costs (Graph V.4). And, at least compared with monetary
policy, it could be more targeted (eg through taxes specific to the housing sector)
and may avoid or at least limit the currency appreciation (and possible surge in
capital inflows) that typically accompanies higher interest rates (Chapter IV).
A key challenge is timing. Discretionary fiscal policy normally involves
significant lags in decision-making and implementation. And political pressures
towards a looser stance might also be especially strong. These problems could be
mitigated by designing automatic stabilisers or budget rules that define ex ante
how and under what conditions certain taxes or subsidies should be adjusted.

Removing the bias towards debt accumulation
The structure of taxes and subsidies can influence private sector decisions on
leverage. Yet, at present, fiscal incentives often do more to encourage greater
leverage than they do to support financial stability. Examples include underpriced
government guarantees of debt liabilities and tax systems that favour debt over
equity.
Government guarantees for financial risks redistribute tail risks from the private
to the government sector. Guarantees can help stabilise the financial sector at times

Fiscal room for manoeuvre?

Public debt is at record highs in advanced economies: its median value has increased by over 30 percentage
points of GDP since 2007 and now stands at nearly 100% (Annex Table A.3). Furthermore, headline deficits are still
large in several countries, pointing to higher debt in the next few years. In EMEs, the debt increase has been less
dramatic, from 34% to 44%. But fiscal deficits and funding conditions there have worsened since 2015, reflecting
in particular the sharp drop in commodity prices, currency depreciations and tighter global financial conditions
(Chapter III).
Despite high and rising public debt, calls abound in advanced economies for fiscal stimulus and, in particular,
for greater public investment. According to some recent estimates, several countries still seem to have ample fiscal
space – that is, room to raise debt without provoking adverse investor reactions – and should therefore take
advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs. But how much can we rely on these estimates? Fiscal space is an
abstract concept that depends on market participants’ perceptions of fiscal sustainability and liquidity. As such, any
measure would inevitably be characterised by a large degree of uncertainty.
Market perceptions of solvency will crucially depend on at least three factors. The first is the government’s
ability to impose higher taxes. This, in turn, depends on the economy’s structure and potential growth. Taxes create
distortions, creating Laffer curve effects: beyond a certain point, further tax increases may lead to output losses
large enough to push down overall revenues. Moreover, politically tolerable taxation levels may be even lower than
Laffer curves would suggest. And population ageing too is likely to weigh on future growth (Chapter III). The second
factor is how far expenditure can be cut. Economies require some minimum level of government expenditure to
function, and most societies have adopted social compacts that put a floor under spending of considerably more
than that minimum. Increasing demands related to population ageing may, in particular, pose significant challenges.
The third factor is the (growth-adjusted) interest rate on debt that is expected to prevail in the future. Risk premia
on public debt are currently deeply negative in many advanced economies, but fluctuate widely and may at some
point return to more normal levels (Chapter II). Their evolution, in turn, depends on market perceptions of the
previous factors and on global financial market conditions. A final factor is the size of any future contingent liabilities
due to a possible future financial crisis or even a natural catastrophe.
That said, fiscal sustainability depends not only on a country’s fundamentals, but also on investors’ beliefs and
behaviour. This creates the potential for debt crises to be, at least partially, self-fulfilling: agents may want to sell off

debt because they believe others might do the same. This type of crisis is more likely to break out when debt is
high, especially in foreign currency, and when policy credibility is low.
A country’s debt limit therefore depends not only on structural factors, but also on the interaction between
government choices, market expectations and intrinsic randomness. Recent general equilibrium models that attempt
to capture this complexity are promising, but their use is limited by computational complexity. In practice, simpler
methods are often used. The most straightforward one consists in computing the steady-state debt level based on
hypothetical long-run average values of the primary surplus and growth-adjusted interest rates (the gap between
the average borrowing cost and growth). But these measures do not consider whether, in response to adverse fiscal
shocks, a country would succeed in bringing debt back onto a sustainable path. This issue has been partially
addressed by estimating fiscal reaction functions: in this case, debt is stable if the primary balance responds to
increases in debt by more than the interest rate. There are, of course, limits to how much the primary surplus can
increase, due to the factors mentioned above. Historically, countries have struggled to maintain primary surpluses of
more than 5% of GDP for long.
Recent methodologies have tried to take into account the diminishing ability to generate fiscal surpluses – or
“fiscal fatigue”. One popular approach is to use a non-linear reaction function – for example, one with a cubic shape
– which amounts to postulating that, for sufficiently high debt levels, the response of the fiscal authorities diminishes
as debt increases (see eg Ghosh et al (2013)). This approach finds debt limits of over 150% of GDP (Table V.B, first
row) in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, which, given current debt levels (fifth row), indicates
that relatively ample fiscal space exists in these countries. By contrast, the estimated fiscal response is insufficient to
stabilise debt in Japan and Italy, suggesting a lack of fiscal space there.
That said, these estimates of debt limits are subject to considerable uncertainty and should therefore be taken
with great caution. For one, future interest rates and GDP growth are uncertain. Baseline estimates are based on
historical averages of the growth-adjusted interest rate. Yet using projected values of the growth-adjusted interest
rate (Table V.B, second row) leads to differences in estimated debt limits of about 20 percentage points. Another
source of uncertainty is the shape of the non-linear relationship between the primary balance and the debt-to-GDP
ratio. Since the reaction function is estimated on historical data, the parameters that determine the shape of this
relationship are subject to sample uncertainty. To illustrate how this uncertainty translates into uncertainty about
the effective debt limit, two alternative scenarios are constructed. The first scenario is a benign one and refers to a
“more reactive” fiscal reaction function. This is obtained by raising the coefficients’ point estimates by one standard
deviation. The alternative scenario instead postulates a “less reactive” fiscal response, obtained by reducing the
coefficients symmetrically by one standard deviation. The benign scenario (third row) implies much higher debt
limits for all countries, in the region of 260% of GDP. By contrast, under the pessimistic scenario, the fiscal reaction is
not sufficient to stabilise debt for any country, indicating no fiscal space (not shown in the table). A somewhat more
reactive reaction function, obtained by cutting the coefficients by just 0.15 times the standard deviation, succeeds in
making debt sustainable for three countries, but at considerably lower levels; those in Japan and Italy, however, remain
on an unsustainable path (fourth row). Cutting coefficients by more than 0.15 times the standard deviation would make
debt unsustainable in a greater number of countries. It is striking that current debt levels can be either sustainable
or unsustainable depending on parameters being just one standard deviation away from their point estimates.
There are additional reasons why debt limit estimates should be treated with great caution. First, the estimates
are largely based on extrapolation, as few countries have ever experienced debt levels anywhere close to those
limits. Little is known about how governments or financial markets would react if debt rose that high or if
governments were to communicate that they would only try to consolidate opportunistically – that is, only if growth
were to pick up substantially. Importantly, it would be unsafe to assume that debt levels could reach their estimated
limits without triggering a sharp increase in interest rates (which would, in turn, invalidate those estimates). Second,
estimates largely ignore the risk that economic conditions may deteriorate and expectations of debt sustainability
suddenly shift. In particular, a country’s debt limit should naturally depend on a government’s ability to sustain debt
not only under average economic and financial conditions, but also under stressed ones – that is, for example, when
tax revenues are low and/or interest rates high. Third, a future financial crisis cannot be safely assumed away. When
contingent liabilities are taken into account, fiscal space would be reduced. Finally, and most importantly, the
estimates do not explicitly incorporate the additional demands on fiscal resources from expected increases in agerelated spending, which loom large in many countries. Existing methods have yet to capture these concerns
satisfactorily.
All in all, the above analysis and considerations indicate that the debt limits should not be interpreted as
boundaries that can be safely tested. Prudent policymakers should try to keep debt levels well away from them: the
estimated fiscal space is not space that can be entirely spent. That is why, for instance, Moody’s recommends that
countries maintain a buffer of 125 percentage points of GDP below the limit it estimates. While it is unclear how this
threshold has been set and why it should be identical across countries, it does seem to have a relationship with

credit ratings: Moody’s reports that all sovereigns rated Aaa have at least 125 percentage points of fiscal space,
while those rated Baa or less have less space or none. To be sure, it is still an open question how best to determine
the buffer’s optimal size, given a country’s characteristics. But, at a minimum, the buffer indicates that the “safe”
limit may be far below the “estimated” one. That is, policymakers should be aware that having fiscal space – as
determined by current methods – does not mean it is possible or advisable to use it all.

of severe distress, but are also hard to price. As a result, explicit guarantees are
likely to be underpriced, while implicit ones are essentially free. Underpricing
encourages socially excessive debt accumulation and financial risk-taking. And
guarantees can be pervasive. In the United States, for example, the government is
estimated to have explicitly guaranteed no less than a third of financial sector
liabilities in 2014, and a further 26% implicitly (Graph V.5, left-hand panel).
Globally, bank creditors also benefit from implicit government support. The
centre panel of Graph V.5 shows the ratings uplift that bank bonds gain from
implicit sovereign support. Around the time of the GFC, implicit support boosted
bank credit ratings by 2–3 notches on average. At end-2011, such support
lowered the spreads that banks had to pay on long-term bonds by an estimated
1–2 percentage points. The implicit degree of support has since declined, but bank
bonds continue to benefit from an estimated subsidy of 30 basis points. Recent

Mortgage interest tax relief (lhs)
Household debt to disposable income
in 2014 (rhs)

1
Difference between stand-alone and all-in rating. 2 Gap between market interest rate and after-tax debt financing costs. This takes into
account if interest payments on mortgage debt are deductible from taxable income and if there are any limits on the allowed period of
deduction or the deductible amount, and if tax credits for loans are available. For countries that have no tax relief on debt financing costs,
this indicator equals zero.

banks aim to curtail the need for government support of the financial sector in
periods of stress and hence to reduce this implicit subsidy.
In most countries, tax systems favour debt over equity. Removing this debt bias
would increase the resilience of private sector balance sheets and help reduce the
likelihood and cost of crises (Box V.C).
Many countries provide tax relief on mortgage interest payments, often to
encourage home ownership. Yet these policies also encourage households to
leverage up, increasing their vulnerability. The OECD estimates that the tax relief
wedge on mortgage interest payments is particularly large in Denmark, the
Netherlands and Norway, three countries with household debt in excess of 200% of
disposable income (Graph V.5, right-hand panel). Removing such tax relief may help
to reduce leverage. That said, leverage is also relatively high in countries that have
no such tax relief (eg Australia and the United Kingdom), indicating that other
factors are also important, including inelastic housing supply, interest rates and
credit conditions.16
In the corporate sector, the asymmetrical tax treatment of different funding
sources has no strong economic rationale. Yet corporate income taxes generally
allow interest payments to be deducted when determining taxable profits, whereas
the return-on-equity, either through dividends or capital gains, is typically not

Debt bias in taxation, firm leverage and the cost of financial crises

Box V.C

The preferential tax treatment of debt over equity affects firms’ funding choices, potentially increasing the likelihood
and cost of financial crises. Firms have an incentive to increase leverage to reduce their tax burden, which may
heighten their own vulnerability and that of the corporate sector as a whole. This box briefly reviews evidence
concerning the impact of the tax code on firms’ financing decisions.
Early empirical studies based on the use of non-debt tax shields (eg depreciation and investment tax credits)
failed to find a strong link between taxes and leverage. Yet, thanks to better measurement of marginal tax rates,
subsequent work in the 1990s and 2000s succeeded in pinpointing a statistically significant yet modest relationship:
meta-analysis based on many studies finds that a 1 percentage point lower tax on corporate income reduces the
debt-to-asset ratio in non-financial corporations by only 0.27 percentage points. For banks, the literature found a
broadly similar effect, although for larger banks the effect seemed weaker. However, these studies are crosssectional. As such, they may not fully capture the causal effect of tax changes.
The latest stream of research has addressed this concern by exploiting tax changes within countries. For
example, since 2006, changes in tax laws have enabled firms in Belgium to deduct a notional interest expense from
their return on equity. For non-financial firms and banks, the effect of these changes on leverage is similar to that
found in the previous literature. That said, the latest empirical work also finds other financial stability benefits in
the banking sector from reducing the tax debt bias. For example, following a reduction in the tax discrimination
against equity, banks started to manage their risks against return more conservatively, in that weakly capitalised
banks directed new lending to firms with lower default probabilities.
The broad benefits from eliminating the debt bias appear substantial. A number of studies calculate, first, how
much bank leverage would fall; then, how much the probability of a crisis diminishes as a result; and, finally, the
corresponding GDP gains. For example, De Mooij et al (2014) estimate gains of between 0.5 and 11.9% of GDP,
depending on the initial level of bank leverage. Langedijk et al (2015) find that the direct bailout cost of a systemic
financial crisis on public finances could be reduced by between 17 and 77% in European economies. All in all, this
evidence suggests that removing, or at least reducing, the debt bias in taxation could be a key ingredient of a
macro-financial stability framework.

deductible.17 Across most major economies, the tax savings from debt relative to
equity issuance appear large. For instance, estimates indicate that in, say, the United
States, Japan and France the marginal effective tax rate on debt is over 12 percentage
points lower than that on equity (Graph V.6, left-hand panel).
Evidence indicates that such tax advantages can have significant effects on
firms’ leverage (Box V.C). Firms tend to have higher leverage in countries with
higher effective tax rates on corporate income (Graph V.6, centre panel). As with
mortgage debt, the significant dispersion of corporate leverage, both within and
between sectors, is a clear indication that other factors matter. These include the
pledgeability of assets as collateral, revenue volatility, and broader aspects of legal
and governance frameworks. Even so, changes in the tax code could make a
difference, especially in the financial sector, where leverage ratios are particularly
high (Graph V.6, right-hand panel).

Also, personal income taxes on capital gains and dividends magnify debt bias. However, personal
income taxes on interest income can reduce it.

VI. The financial sector: time to move on

The Basel III framework is nearing completion. In addition to finalising the
remaining calibration decisions, consistent and thorough implementation is now
key, alongside more rigorous supervision. With regulatory uncertainty receding,
banks need to keep adjusting their business models to the new market environment.
This includes addressing legacy problems, such as those related to non-performing
loans (NPLs). Once financial sector repair is completed, safer and stronger banks
will unambiguously contribute to a more resilient economy.
Any remaining adjustments to bank business models will have to be implemented
in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Various factors, such as low or, in
some cases, negative interest rates (Chapter II), will complicate adjustment for those
banks that have yet to fully implement balance sheet repair.
Institutional asset managers, particularly life insurers and pension funds, are
subject to very similar pressures. Since their performance is driven largely by the
interest rate environment and their product mix, persistently low rates make it more
difficult to maintain target returns and traditional asset-liability structures. As risks
continue to migrate from banks to these and other non-bank players, additional
prudential challenges arise. Key areas include insurance supervision and mutual
fund regulation.
This chapter investigates the challenges the financial sector is facing. First, it
reviews recent developments among international banks as well as in the insurance
and pension fund sectors. It then discusses the nearing completion of the Basel III
regulatory framework and assesses the macroeconomic impact of the resulting
transition to a more robust, better capitalised banking system. It ends with a
discussion of the prudential implications for the non-bank sector.

Coping with a challenging environment
Banks: dealing with stiff headwinds
The process of strengthening bank balance sheets continues. Banks, most notably
in Europe, have further raised their capital ratios, reducing balance sheet leverage
(Graph VI.1, left-hand panel). A variety of forces are driving this adjustment. Clearly,
the phasing-in of the new regulatory framework is an important one. In addition,
the losses incurred during the recent crises have enhanced investor incentives to
scrutinise banks’ risk-return trade-offs, favouring higher levels of capitalisation.
Banks have opted for different adjustment strategies to improve capital ratios,
reflecting the varied economic environment they faced (Graph VI.1, centre panel).
While retained earnings have represented an important source of capital for most
banks, capital ratios in Europe, for example, have tended to improve in a context of
balance sheet compression. By contrast, large banks in North America and many
emerging market economies (EMEs) have generally improved their ratios against
the backdrop of growing balance sheets and robust loan demand.
Bank funding models have also been put on a more stable footing, further
adding to bank resilience. Reliance on short-term wholesale funding, a key channel
of contagion during recent crises, has declined markedly in many advanced
economies (Graph VI.1, right-hand panel). Likewise, banks’ holdings of high-quality

liquid assets (HQLA) have continued to grow, providing additional buffers. The
majority of banks monitored by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(BCBS) already meet the fully phased-in Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement,
well ahead of its full implementation on 1 January 2019.1
Given the progress made in transitioning to stronger bank balance sheets,
ensuring sustained profitability is now the key issue in maintaining the sector’s
resilience. Empirical evidence suggests that better capitalised banks enjoy lower
funding costs and lend more (Box VI.A). Yet equity investors remain generally cautious
about the outlook for bank profitability, suggesting that the necessary adjustments
to business models have so far proceeded unevenly. Price-based indicators
highlight that bank equity valuations of many advanced economy banks, in
particular, have yet to recover from their collapse during the Great Financial Crisis,
with market values below book values in a number of economies (Graph VI.2, lefthand panel).
A complicating factor is that efforts to complete balance sheet repair and
bolster profitability face a confluence of both cyclical and structural headwinds. Key
challenges include the prospect of persistently low interest rates amid an often
subdued growth outlook. These factors can affect bank profitability through a

Box VI.A

Bank capital and lending behaviour: empirical evidence

Discussions of the macroeconomic impact of higher bank capital sometimes presume that higher bank capital
increases total (equity plus debt) funding costs, which then translate into higher lending spreads and less lending.
The argument invokes observed deviations from the Modigliani-Miller (MM) theorem, which posits that the capital
structure is irrelevant for the cost of funding.
Deviations from the MM theorem are indeed well documented, but this is not sufficient to establish that
higher bank capital entails reduced lending. Indeed, recent research suggests the opposite may be true: higher bank
capital goes hand in hand with higher lending. For one, a study by the EBA (2015) finds substantial positive credit
supply effects from higher bank capital for a sample of European banks. In addition, Michelangeli and Sette (2016),
using granular data on internet-brokered mortgages, show that better capitalised banks lend more.
One potential mechanism driving the positive relationship between loan supply and bank capital is the lower
borrowing costs of better capitalised banks. Gambacorta and Shin (2016) find that a 1 percentage point increase in
the equity-to-total assets ratio is associated with a 4 basis point reduction in borrowing (non-equity funding) costs.
Given that non-equity funding represents, on average, around 86% of total bank liabilities, the resulting effects on
the overall cost of funding can be sizeable and will mitigate any assumed cost of raising additional equity.

Graph VI.A plots average levels of leverage (defined as the ratio of equity to total assets) for a sample of banks
over the period 1995–2012. The three panels show how bank leverage is related to non-equity funding costs (lefthand panel), non-equity funding (centre) and lending (right-hand panel). Being based on raw data without statistical
controls, the scatter plots overstate the noise in the observed relationships. Yet it is apparent that lower leverage is
associated with lower debt funding costs and a higher growth rate of both non-equity funding and lending.

variety of channels2 whose strength depends on the individual bank’s balance sheet
composition, its business model and the surrounding macroeconomic environment.
Reflecting differences among these factors, major banks’ profitability has recently
improved in some jurisdictions, while showing persistent signs of weakness in others.
One channel through which low interest rates are affecting bank profitability is
via their impact on net interest margins, the main source of revenue for many banks.
Weak credit demand, paired with declining interest rates on new loans or existing
floating rate loans, compresses banks’ interest revenue. Unless counterbalanced by
other factors, this can squeeze margins, as is apparent for major banks in several
economies (Table VI.1).
Pressures on net interest margins are particularly pronounced among banks
from jurisdictions that now face negative short-term rates (Chapter II, Box II.A). Many
banks in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, for example, have experienced declining
net interest margins over recent years, with the compression in interest income
often outpacing the reduction in interest expenses (Graph VI.3, left-hand panel).
More recently, banks have typically refrained from cutting retail deposit rates
below zero in order to retain customers. By contrast, passing through negative rates
to institutional clients has generally been easier. Thus, banks that rely heavily on
retail deposits have seen their interest expenses decline less than their more
wholesale-funded peers (Graph VI.3, centre panel). Yet many banks have still
managed to protect their profits by tapping other revenue sources, for example by
encouraging retail clients to shift to fee-generating investment products.

In some cases, revenues have also been supported by a buoyant housing
market and strong demand for mortgage loans. But, while boosting income in the
short run, increasing such exposures may eventually weigh on earnings via high
loan write-offs, especially if balance sheet expansion coincides with declining
lending standards or aggressive pricing.
A second channel through which low interest rates are affecting profitability is
banks’ capital market activities (Table VI.1 and Graph VI.3, right-hand panel). Over
the past few years, with corporate issuers seeking to lock in favourable market
funding, the persistent expansion in non-financial corporate bond issuance has
bolstered banks’ underwriting business and trading revenues. In addition, banks in
many jurisdictions have benefited from mark-to-market gains on their securities
portfolios, with the global decline in interest rates pushing asset valuations to new
highs. The flip side, however, is that these valuation gains are one-off and bound to

reverse if the underlying assets are held to maturity. Growing holdings of low
coupon bonds, in turn, will weigh on banks’ future portfolio returns. Rising issuance
of such bonds has increased substantially the duration of outstanding securities,
making unhedged securities positions vulnerable to mark-to-market losses even for
small increases in yields. Indeed, banking sectors in a number of economies posted
declining revenues from fees and trading over the last year, reflecting volatile
conditions and weaker client activity in several major bond markets (Chapter II).
Cyclical factors are adding to concerns about legacy assets, particularly in the
euro area. A sluggish recovery continues to weigh on borrowers’ repayment capacity
in a number of euro area countries, as rising non-performing loans (NPLs) remain
unresolved. In this context, low interest rates may initially mask looming credit risks
by compressing borrowers’ debt service burdens. They also provide incentives for
banks to postpone write-offs by lowering the cost of keeping troubled borrowers
afloat. While some progress has been made to address NPLs, recent data from
the European Banking Authority highlight that such exposures remain a major
impediment to European banks’ profitability (Graph VI.2, centre panel).3 They can
also make banks more vulnerable to borrowers’ fortunes and restrain new lending.
Varied NPL patterns suggest that there are no “one size fits all” solutions. Past
experience shows that authorities can help improve banks’ incentives via changes
to the tax code, by reducing impediments to collateral sales, and by addressing
obstacles to debt restructuring. This includes the use of public sector funds, subject
to strict conditions and proper incentives – an effective catalyst of balance sheet

For several large banks, legacy issues also include dealing with litigation related to past misconduct.
For major UK banks, for example, supervisory fines and similar conduct costs were equivalent to
some 3% of their equity between 2011 and 2015.

repair in past crises.4 In making the relevant policy decisions, the benefits of
reducing systemic risks and unlocking economic activity are likely to dominate any
constraints implied by competition policy considerations.
With the global growth outlook softening, rising NPLs are also expected to
weigh on EME banks’ performance. Most vulnerable are banks in countries where
financial booms have been turning or are in the late stages, such as China and
other East Asian economies (Chapter III), or where large exposures to commodityand energy-related sectors bulk large. NPLs and other borrower risk metrics in
some major EMEs have already worsened, requiring banks to step up their loan loss
provisioning (Table VI.1) as equity price-to-book ratios have weakened (Graph VI.2,
left-hand panel).
Exposures to commodity risks extend beyond EME banks. A number of regional
financial institutions in Canada and the United States, in particular, have a relatively
high concentration of lending to the energy sector. And internationally active banks
had energy-related syndicated loan commitments (including undrawn facilities)
amounting to some $2.2 trillion at end-May 2016. Geographical diversification of
such loans may turn out to be ineffective in mitigating risk if commodity price
weakness is prolonged (Graph VI.2, right-hand panel).
Persistent structural challenges to bank profitability are reinforcing the effect
of these cyclical factors. One such challenge is the ongoing shift in intermediation
towards non-banks (see below), which, in the medium term, could be further
amplified by new financial technologies (Box VI.B). Maintaining profitability will
therefore require banks to identify overcapacity and cut costs, while seeking to reap
the efficiency gains of technological innovation.
Advances in this area have been mixed. For many banking systems, cost-toincome ratios have broadly remained on an upward path post-crisis (Graph VI.4,

Digitalisation in the financial sector: opportunities and challenges

Box VI.B

Digitalisation and “fintech” are umbrella terms that encompass a wide range of technological innovations affecting
the financial sector. A shared feature of all these innovations is that the volume of related activities remains small,
while being potentially transformative in terms of banks’ business models and corporate cultures. They all tend to
provide new ways to communicate, store and process information, and to access financial services. As such, they are
changing the way banks interact with each other and with their customers. In addition, many of these new
technologies were created by non-financial firms and, in some cases, provide ways for customers to access financial
services without bank involvement, adding to competition. Digitalisation thus provides the banking sector with both
opportunities and challenges.
Matching services. One area of particular importance to the banking industry is matching technologies. Over
the last few years, several electronic venues have started offering services providing such matching, often referred
to as “crowdfunding” or “peer-to-peer” lending. Under a pure matching model, the firms providing these services
do not actually borrow or lend themselves and thus do not take any risk onto their own balance sheets. Some
crowdfunding services have begun to move beyond debt contracts, expanding into services such as equity financing
and even some types of structured financial products, and are thus competing more directly with traditional bankintermediated products. In response, some banks have started to integrate crowdfunding technologies into their
business models, for example by entering into formal partnerships with matching platforms or similar venues.
Big data. This term refers to huge data sets that contain massive amounts of detailed information on a large
number of individuals, often in the form of multiple linked databases. To the extent that banks accumulate such
data on their customers, big data technology can be used to tailor banks’ services more effectively (eg by evaluating
the credit quality of their borrowers on a larger number of metrics). As a result, individual loan terms and risk factors
are likely to be better aligned, improving risk management and pricing. However, as non-financial companies are
accumulating big data sets about their own customers and are building the capacity to analyse them, they may be
able to compete with banks to offer financial services, putting pressure on bank margins.
Digital payments. In digital payments, smartphones and other electronic devices are now providing access to
various banking services and the established payments system. Even though the payment service components of
these applications are typically routed through the banking sector, service providers may offer additional financial
services, such as means of saving or storing funds. This can increase competition and the cost pressures banks face.
Distributed ledgers. A potentially more substantial development in the payments area is the more widespread
use of distributed ledger and blockchain technologies. This innovation provides an alternative means of recording
financial information without recourse to trusted intermediaries. With a distributed ledger, it is possible for
everyone in a given financial network to know the resources of all parties in the network as well as the history of all
transactions. This technological ability to uniquely and verifiably execute transactions could be applied to a wide
range of financial products. Some financial institutions, for example, have experimented with distributed ledgers to
place and trade certain types of securities, such as syndicated loans, or are considering offering features such as
“smart contracts” that allow automated execution and verification once certain conditions are met. In general, the
decentralised nature of distributed ledgers would reduce the need for certain record keeping and back office
services, suggesting that trading and settlement might be provided more quickly and at a lower cost.
Digitalisation trends are evolving rapidly and any net effects remain unclear. While some aspects of digitalisation
appear to increase competition for banks, significant resources are already invested in these technologies so as to
utilise them to enhance bank business models and cut costs. Authorities will have to monitor these effects with a
view to expanding the sectoral scope of regulation should less regulated service providers gain a significant foothold
in the provision of digitally based financial services.

on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Digital currencies, November 2015.

left-hand panel). Often, subdued revenues and the associated downward pressure
on banks’ ratings have offset cost-cutting gains (Graph VI.4, centre panel).
Improving cost efficiency will thus require a mix of strategies. These will include
further operational enhancements, such as raising the efficiency of back office
functions, as well as continuous evaluation of the product and service portfolio.

110

BIS 86th Annual Report

Another key element is strengthening bank resilience, which can help offset the
impact of reduced implicit government guarantees on bank funding costs.
In all this, it will be critical to cut excess capacity. One gauge of potential
overcapacity is the density of bank branches. This measure, while broadly declining
post-crisis, is still high for several European countries by international standards
(Graph VI.4, right-hand panel). And the overall scale of the adjustment so far
appears rather limited compared with historical crisis experience. After the onset of
the Nordic crisis in 1991, for example, banks in Finland reduced the number of
branches by more than 40% within four years, while cutting operating expenses by
more than 50%.

Other financials: more of the same?
Financial institutions outside the banking sector face challenges from the same
macro-financial factors as their bank peers. The current low interest rate
environment, in particular, makes it more difficult for insurers to maintain targeted
profitability levels, by reducing demand for their life insurance products and their
fee-charging ability. As a result, traditional savings products are waning and some
insurers have responded by shifting to so-called unit-linked (ie mutual fund-style)
products. Defined benefit (DB) pension plans (whose liabilities reflect member
benefits that accrue over a long period of time after retirement) are facing similar
pressures.
A key challenge to balance sheet management for insurers and pension funds
(IPFs) is the interest rate sensitivity of their liabilities, which tend to be very longterm. Fixed income securities on the asset side, in contrast, typically have shorter
maturities. This gives rise to a duration mismatch. As a result, the present discounted
values of these client claims can be rather volatile and, unless immunised (eg via
the use of derivatives), move more strongly than those of the corresponding assets.
This applies to life insurance and DB pension plans, but also to products such as
long-term care and disability insurance. Thus, risk profiles in both sectors depend
primarily on the interest rate environment and firms’ product mix.
Recent developments in DB pension schemes illustrate some of these balance
sheet pressures. Given the discounting of projected financial obligations with
market yields and the underlying duration mismatches, lower interest rates have
boosted pension fund liabilities relative to assets, generating large deficits in some
cases. In the United Kingdom, for example, 82% of a sample of about 6,000 private
company DB schemes were underfunded at the end of the first quarter of 2016,
with the aggregate deficit at around £302 billion (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel) in
March. Likewise, S&P 500 companies’ estimated pension deficits totalled about
$455 billion at the end of the same quarter. Developments in other jurisdictions
have been similar.
In response, firms have begun to adjust their product mix and asset
composition. In insurance, this has added to the general shift towards unit-linked
products, which generate higher fees and are less capital-intensive because
investment risks are not borne by the insurance company. Pension funds, in turn,
have continued to shift towards defined contribution (DC) schemes, which, like
unit-linked insurance, shift investment risks onto pension plan members (Graph VI.5,
centre panel). The resulting flows into mutual funds and similar investment vehicles
have further boosted their assets under management – a trend that predates the
financial crisis (Graph VI.6, left-hand panel).
As shifts in the product mix take time, the low interest rate environment has
so far left its imprint mainly on the asset side of IPFs’ balance sheets. For one,
across various jurisdictions, low rates have depressed portfolio yields as well as

premium growth and, hence, earnings (Table VI.2). Because substantial parts of
IPFs’ investment portfolios are allocated to fixed income instruments, persistently
low rates make it much more difficult for them to invest at original yields as
investments mature. This encourages them to search for yield (as discussed in last
year’s Annual Report), especially if they have to generate returns above those
guaranteed on liabilities (see below). They could also respond by reaching for
longer duration (eg low coupon bonds or equities) to better match liabilities and
hence reduce risk.
Some European IPFs, for example, have sought to counter growing liabilities
durations by shifting into sovereign bonds. These bonds typically have longer
maturities and, hence, durations than corporate bonds and are more liquid. The
entry into force of the new Solvency II regulatory standard on January 2016, in turn,
strengthened such incentives for European insurers, given relatively favourable risk
weights for sovereign and certain corporate exposures (Box VI.C). As a result,
according to EU flow of funds statistics, the IPFs’ share of euro area government
debt outstanding rose from about 19% in 2009 to 23% at end-2015. As yields have
been declining, this has been hurting interest rate income and profitability, possibly
contributing to feedback effects and short-term asset price volatility.5
The performance of the sector has differed across institutions and jurisdictions,
reflecting differences in market structures and product mix.6 For one, despite their
interest rate risk immunisation attempts, life insurers in most European countries
continue to have negative duration gaps, implying net valuation losses if interest

rates decline further. Many of these insurers also face an investment return mismatch
(eg in France, Germany and Sweden). That is, the embedded return guarantees on
their liabilities exceed the returns on their assets, raising questions about the
sustainability of their business models in the current low interest rate environment
(Graph VI.5, right-hand panel). UK insurers, by contrast, appear to be less exposed –
in part because of their greater reliance on unit-linked products.

Box VI.C

Solvency II: overview of key elements

Solvency II is the new regulatory framework for insurance undertakings in the European Economic Area (comprising
the EU countries as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). It was first adopted in 2009.  The new rules seek to
harmonise the regulation of insurers across the EEA, while introducing the concept of risk-based solvency
requirements. In doing so, Solvency II adopts a total balance sheet approach that aims to reflect the full range of
risks on both the asset and liability side of insurers’ balance sheets, based on market-consistent valuations. The new
rules apply at both group and solo insurance levels. They are due to be phased in over an extended period,
beginning in January 2016, and are expected to significantly affect insurers’ asset allocations and reserving.
Risk-based capital requirements. Much like banking regulation, Solvency II organises capital requirements in
three pillars: quantitative requirements (pillar 1), qualitative aspects and supervisory review (pillar 2), and disclosure
requirements (pillar 3). Capital adequacy is part of the first pillar and based on two sets of rules: the Solvency Capital
Requirement (SCR) and the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR), along with a “ladder of intervention” for supervisors
tied to both capital measures. The SCR can be regarded as a solvency buffer which, when breached, triggers
supervisory intervention; the MCR is the minimum level of capital below which a firm is put into run-off. The SCR
stipulates that an insurer is sufficiently capitalised when it covers unexpected losses with a probability of 99.5% over
a one-year horizon. Eligible capital items are classified into three tiers, according to their loss-absorbing capacity. As
under Basel II/III, insurance undertakings can calculate SCR charges through internal models, subject to regulatory
approval, or apply standardised formulae.
Risk modules. Risks are divided into six risk modules – market, counterparty (default), life, non-life, health and
intangible risk – and each module is further divided into sub-modules. Diversification effects between these risks are
recognised, which will tend to benefit insurance conglomerates. In addition, there is a capital charge for operational
risk and an adjustment for loss-absorbing effects (eg from deferred taxes). The design of market risk charges is
perhaps the most important innovation in the new framework. The market risk module is itself divided into seven
sub-modules: equity, spread, interest rate, property, currency, concentration and illiquidity risk (relating to the
illiquidity premium in the discount rate). Given the relevance of fixed income products for insurance portfolios, the
spread and interest rate sub-modules are key. In the spread risk module, which covers the risk of a change in value
due to a deviation of the actual from the expected market price of credit risk, capital requirements under the
standardised formula are mainly driven by external ratings and duration. Both sovereign and (investment grade as
well as unrated) corporate bonds receive relatively favourable treatment.   The interest rate risk (ie changes in
value caused by a deviation of actual interest rates from expected ones) sub-module, in turn, addresses risks on
both the asset and liability side. In order to assess net interest rate risk, all relevant exposures are stress-tested by
applying up-/downward stress to the yield curve. Capital charges are then calculated on this basis.
Market-consistent valuations. While many assets are traded in markets deep enough to yield reliable prices
and market values, the same may not apply to liabilities. In determining the value of insurance liabilities, Solvency II
thus requires insurers to forecast expected future liability-related cash flows and discount them with a risk-free
interest rate (plus a risk margin) to obtain market-consistent values. Because different discount rates for matched
assets and liabilities can create a valuation mismatch and cause artificial balance sheet volatility, matching
adjustments to insurers’ discount rates may then be used to offset part of this impact of short-term asset price
fluctuations.
New disclosures, the first-time use of internal models and national regulators’ different interpretations of
individual rules may complicate the transition to the new standard from a stakeholder perspective. A key question
concerns the extent to which capital positions and thus solvency margins will turn out to be more volatile than
under previous standards. In addition, with group-based and solo treatment placed on the same footing, the new
standard is likely to generate significant diversification benefits for large insurers, adding to consolidation pressures.
Questions about international equivalence, in turn, should provide additional impetus to the finalisation of the
globally harmonised Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
(IAIS).

  See European Commission, Directive 2009/138/EC and Directive 2014/51/EU.      See Committee on the Global Financial System, Fixed
income strategies of insurance companies and pension funds, July 2011.      See CGFS (2011); bonds issued by member states’ central

governments and central banks denominated and funded in the governments’ domestic currency receive a zero risk charge, irrespective of
their external rating.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Going forward, countries with insurance sectors that suffer from both duration
and return mismatches appear particularly vulnerable. This will tend to weigh on
the profitability of sectors with a larger share of traditional guaranteed-return
savings products and with smaller, standalone life insurers. Authorities there may
have to exploit any available leeway to help adjust IPFs’ minimum return guarantees.
Supervisors, in turn, may have to increase their scrutiny of the insurance sector’s
duration and return mismatches, especially for smaller players, while standing ready
to accommodate the consolidation pressures that weakening profitability generates.
In Europe, the adoption of Solvency II, by introducing market-consistent valuations,
might accelerate this consolidation process via the diversification benefits that
derive from group-level regulation and by encouraging a secondary market in
insurance liabilities (Box VI.C).

Finalising the post-crisis reforms
Finishing the job on banking regulation
The overhaul of the Basel regulatory framework is nearing completion. The BCBS
has committed to finalise its post-crisis reforms by end-2016, with the phase-in
extending to 2019.7 Other regulatory measures, such as new or enhanced resolution
regimes, will be implemented in parallel. This will help to gradually remove regulatory
uncertainty and support banks’ capital and liquidity planning. In taking the final
calibration decisions, the BCBS will focus on not significantly increasing overall
capital requirements. However, ample room is available for national authorities to
further raise regulatory capital, providing sufficient flexibility to activate countercyclical
capital buffers and similar requirements, as needed. The result will be a stronger and
more resilient banking system, which ensures individual institutions are less likely to
fail and reduces the impact on the economy in case they do. Banks will also be able
to support the real economy through greater lending than otherwise. Hence, even
under very conservative assumptions, the substantial longer-term benefits for the
real economy should outweigh any short-term transitional adjustment costs.
Following the January 2016 decision on the calibration of the minimum leverage
ratio (LR) and the subsequent publication of the BCBS’s new market risk standard,
the post-crisis bank regulatory framework is now almost complete. To be sure,
work on specific items is continuing, notably on new standardised approaches for
credit and operational risk as well as on risk weight floors and the treatment of
sovereign exposures (Chapter V). But the main calibration decisions are due by
year-end.
The new framework addresses important weaknesses of the international
banking system revealed by the 2007–09 financial crisis. Uppermost among these
are insufficient loss-absorbing bank capital and liquidity buffers. As part of
enhanced risk-weighted capital requirements (RWRs), banks now have to comply
with a minimum ratio of 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to risk-weighted
assets (RWAs) and a 6% Tier 1 capital ratio (comprising a broader capital definition).
They also have to maintain an additional CET1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.
As a result, the new framework sets significantly higher loss absorption requirements
and puts greater emphasis on capital quality, while broadening the coverage of
bank risks.

its governing body“, press release, 11 January 2016.

BIS 86th Annual Report

115

The RWRs are complemented with a number of additional requirements. These
include: (i) the new minimum LR requirement that backstops the existing RWRs with
a simple, non-risk-based measure; (ii) capital surcharges for systemic risk (eg the
countercyclical capital buffer and additional requirements for global systemically
important banks (G-SIBs)); and (iii) standards for short-term funding and maturity
transformation risk (ie the LCR and NSFR). Complementary measures to these core
elements comprise improved resolution regimes that support authorities in dealing
with failing financial institutions, including via a requirement for G-SIBs to have
greater Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) in resolution.8
While the full phase-in of these requirements will take several years, many
banks have already completed most of the adjustment. As a result, capital levels
have increased and reliance on wholesale funding has declined (Graph VI.1).
Remaining capital shortfalls are now at or close to zero on most measures
(Table VI.3). For example, even on a fully phased-in “target” basis (ie ignoring any
transitional arrangements and including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer and
G-SIB capital surcharges, where they apply), the aggregate CET1 shortfall is now
only €0.2 billion. Moreover, all of it is due to the smaller of the 230 banks the BCBS
monitors. In terms of total capital requirements, which include CET1 as well as
additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments, the aggregate capital shortfall has
declined to €29.2 billion. This is equivalent to less than 0.1% of banks’ total RWAs,
according to the most recent BCBS (2016) data.
Importantly, raising capital has been achieved without much sign of an adverse
shorter-term impact on bank lending to the real economy. For example, bank
lending to the private non-financial sector as a share of GDP has continued to grow
in many jurisdictions (Graph VI.7, left-hand panel). That is, any short-term impact of
the new regulations was either small to begin with, or has been mitigated by
offsetting macroeconomic policies.9

Macroeconomic impact
A key policy question is whether these higher target capitalisation levels are likely
to be beneficial from a macroeconomic perspective. The BCBS’s long-term economic
impact (LEI) assessment provides a suitable framework to formulate an answer.
On this basis, analysing the effects of higher bank capital levels comprises three
main elements (see Box VI.D for details): (i) an estimate of the increase in capital
associated with the new minimum requirements (the implied “capital shortfall”);
(ii) the benefits from higher capital in the form of lower (expected) crisis costs
(ie the reduction in the crisis probability times costs in terms of output losses for a
given increase in bank capital); and (iii) the possible output loss from any increase in
lending spreads that might result from the same increase in bank capital. The LEI
provides very conservative estimates for the latter two elements. Once adjusted for
more stringent capital definitions and RWA calculations under Basel III, these can
then be combined into a net benefits schedule that indicates the estimated
macroeconomic impact from rising minimum CET1/RWA requirements.

As of 1 January 2022, all G-SIBs will be required to have eligible TLAC instruments equal to a
minimum of at least 18% of their RWAs, not including any applicable regulatory capital buffers.
TLAC will also need to be equivalent to at least 6.75% of the Basel III leverage ratio exposure
measure. For more details, see Financial Stability Board, Summary of findings from the TLAC impact
assessment studies, November 2015.

Graph VI.7 (right-hand panel) depicts two sets of marginal net benefit schedules,
given alternative crisis cost estimates and a starting point of 7% CET1/RWA (as per
Table VI.3). The first schedule (solid red line) reports the baseline results from the
original LEI, which are based on moderate crisis costs of 63% of GDP in net present
value terms. The second one (solid black line) uses a higher cost estimate of 100%
of GDP, which seeks to incorporate also the more recent – very costly – crises. Even
for the moderate crisis cost estimate, the benefits of rather large additional
minimum regulatory requirements clearly outweigh the costs.
Notably, these figures intentionally overstate the likely cost of higher capital
ratios, while failing to reflect the effects of the new TLAC requirement for G-SIBs.
The LEI estimates assume away the reduction in borrowing costs linked to higher
capital, confirmed by recent BIS research (Box VI.A). The two alternative schedules
(Graph VI.7, right-hand panel, dotted lines) seek to take at least part of this effect
into account by applying a capital cost “offset” of 50%, as the academic literature
suggests (Box VI.D). This halves the estimated impact on output. They also adjust
marginal benefits for the effects of TLAC, which is likely to reduce both crisis costs
and probabilities for any given capitalisation level.10
The resulting range of estimates suggests that there is ample room for the
BCBS to make its final calibration decisions. The net economic benefits (measured

TLAC is estimated to reduce crisis costs by 5.4 percentage points of GDP, whereas the probability of
systemic crises is reduced by 26% relative to the LEI estimates. See BIS, Assessing the economic costs

by the impact on the level of output per year) of higher capital requirements
are exhausted only after a substantial increase from the baseline level of 7% for
the CET1/RWA ratio. Within that range, more stringent regulatory standards are
growth-friendly, in particular if phased in gradually.

Shifting the prudential focus
As bank prudential reform is nearing completion, regulatory attention is being
refocused. One key area comprises efforts to end regulatory fragmentation.
Another relates to the interplay of banking regulation with financial markets,
and how banking sector developments may interact with those in the non-bank
sector.
Regulatory fragmentation is likely to remain an issue for internationally active
insurance groups for some time, but efforts to address it are progressing. In Europe,
Solvency II is establishing a new harmonised regulatory regime for the entire
insurance sector (Box VI.C). While this will eventually end fragmentation for
European insurers, the new rules allow rather stretched-out phase-in arrangements
subject to regulatory approval, which can lead to transitional implementation
differences. In this context, both insurance company managements and investors
will have to adjust to the volatility of capital positions and, hence, of solvency
margins that the new standard implies. At the international level, efforts to establish
a new global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) seek to address fragmentation
by establishing broad-based equivalence among national regulations. Technical
development continues. Once finalised, the ICS would be the first comprehensive,
group-wide capital standard that is broadly applicable to internationally active

Box VI.D

The long-term economic impact (LEI) of stronger capital and liquidity requirements
The LEI methodology proceeds in two steps: (i) it assesses the long-term expected benefits of higher bank capital
requirements via the reduction in expected output losses from systemic banking crises; and (ii) it compares these
benefits with the expected costs in terms of forgone output. In deriving these estimates, the LEI adopts an explicitly
very conservative approach by making assumptions that overestimate costs and downplay expected benefits.
Expected benefits. Conceptually, the expected benefits are based on multiplying the probability of systemic
banking crises, given different minimum capital ratios, by the expected macroeconomic costs (lost output) of such
crises should they occur. To link crisis probabilities with capitalisation levels, the LEI uses a range of models and
credit risk analyses. Averaging the results from these models, it then derives a benefit schedule. The schedule
exhibits diminishing marginal returns (ie the extra effect of additional capital declines as the capital level increases).
For the starting capital ratio of 7% CET1/RWA (see main text), this yields a crisis probability of 1.6%, after taking the
effects of the NSFR into account. Later studies broadly confirm these results.
Crisis cost estimates are derived from academic studies of crisis experiences. The LEI report finds that the
median output cost of systemic banking crises is 63% of GDP in net present value terms. Yet the variation in cost
estimates is large, as subsequent studies have confirmed. A shortcoming of most of these studies is that they rely
only on pre-2007 data, missing the impact of the most recent crisis episode. An exception is Ball (2014), with results
that imply a weighted average cumulative loss across all OECD countries of about 180% of pre-crisis GDP.  Adding
this estimate to the pre-crisis median will increase crisis costs. The analysis here assumes an updated cost estimate
of 100%.
Expected costs. If higher bank capital requirements raise banks’ costs, banks may respond by raising their
lending spreads to offset the decline in their return on equity (ROE). As a result, borrowing costs for households and
firms may rise, leading to lower investment and output. To estimate the size of this effect in the long run, the LEI
assumed that banks maintain a constant ROE by passing on to their customers all additional costs due to higher
capital requirements. The estimated increases in lending spreads were then fed into a variety of macroeconomic
models to assess the resulting impact on GDP.
The headline result of this exercise is that a 1 percentage point increase in the CET1/RWA ratio translates into a
0.12% median decline in the level of output relative to its baseline, if converted into Basel III terms (with the
corresponding value for the liquidity requirements being a one-off 0.08% output decline).  By design, these results
are likely to overstate the true costs, given that the LEI methodology abstracts from Modigliani-Miller effects.  In
practice, banks’ required ROE can be expected to decline as their leverage and the risks to their shareholders fall.
Other factors. The conservative nature of the LEI approach also implies that any indirect effects of increased
bank capital requirements are unlikely to materially affect the overall impact assessment. One such effect could arise
from any regulatory impact on banks’ market-making activities (see main text). Any reduction in such activity might
imply higher liquidity premia and, ultimately, increased costs of issuing debt in normal times. For banks, however,
these costs are counterbalanced by reduced balance sheet risk. For non-bank issuers, in turn, any increase in costs
would be expected to be smaller than the LEI-implied increase in bank lending spreads. This is because these issuers
can revert to banks as an alternative source of funding. The impact on both crisis costs and probabilities, finally,
would depend on the degree to which non-bank investors underestimate the cost of having to liquidate assets
during stressed market conditions (“liquidity illusion”) – a risk that should decline as liquidity premia increase.

insurance groups. Implementation is planned for 2019, following an initial testing
and refinement process.11
In addition, concerns over market liquidity have come to the fore (Chapter II).
They have highlighted the role that institutional investors and collective investment
vehicles may play in future market adjustments. Given these institutions’ growing
allocations to corporate bonds and other comparatively illiquid assets, their portfolio
decisions may challenge market liquidity under stress. This raises the question of
whether regulation has kept pace with these players’ increasing importance.
A key structural feature of fixed income and, in particular, corporate bond
markets is their continued reliance on market-makers. Market liquidity generally
hinges on whether these specialised dealers respond to temporary imbalances in
supply and demand by stepping in as trading counterparts. Market liquidity
conditions in fixed income and repo markets have tightened somewhat over the last
few years, at least on some metrics and when compared with pre-crisis times of
overly ample market liquidity and compressed liquidity premia. While the overall
evidence for any structural change in market liquidity remains scant, it is apparent
that market-maker behaviour is changing (Chapter II).12 Less clear are the underlying
causes and implications for regulation, if any.
There are both supply and demand factors at play, with net effects likely to
differ across market segments. On the supply side, market-makers appear to be
raising the price for their services, even though this may not be readily visible in
the usual market liquidity indicators. This adjustment reflects both cyclical and
structural factors. As regards cyclical ones, dealer banks in many jurisdictions have
reportedly reappraised their risk tolerance in the wake of the financial crisis, cutting
back on various activities, including market-making. Given that dealers adjust their
leverage procyclically, financial markets tend to exhibit cycles in liquidity conditions.
Monetary policy will influence these cyclical effects, both by supporting market
confidence and by easing banks’ funding conditions. The latter, if passed through,
also support the financing of other (non-bank) market-makers. At the same time,
the current environment of low yields and rising market risks is affecting the riskreturn trade-off of market-makers by reducing revenues from carrying inventory,
while raising their exposure to interest rate movements. This will offset at least part
of the supporting effect of ample bank funding.
On the structural side, in addition to the recent growth in electronic trading
and non-bank intermediation (Chapter II), bank regulators are requiring key marketmaking institutions to strengthen their balance sheets and funding models. By
preventing the build-up of excessive leverage and funding mismatches, the new
regulatory framework aims at containing the risk that banks are forced to suddenly
compress their balance sheets in response to adverse shocks, as was, for example,
the case for US broker-dealers at the onset of the Great Financial Crisis.13 Such
structural improvements also protect the financial system more broadly, by reducing
the risk that liquidity crises and any associated “fire sales” spread contagiously across
institutions and markets. This will support the robustness of market liquidity, though

possibly at the cost of somewhat lower activity in normal times.14 That is, stronger
market-makers make for more robust market liquidity.
Importantly, these developments are taking place just as demand for, and
dependence on, market liquidity are on the rise. Asset managers’ assets under
management have been growing steadily in recent years (Graph VI.6, left-hand
panel), signalling a large increase in the potential demand for liquidity. Funds that
promise daily redemptions have been quite prominent, as suggested by the
increasing presence of open-end mutual funds in corporate bond markets. In the
United States, for example, they now hold some 22% of corporate debt according
to financial accounts data – up from about 8% in 2005. Investors may thus find that
liquidating positions proves more difficult than expected, particularly when market
sentiment turns.15 An example is the May–July 2013 “taper tantrum” (Chapter II),
when bond funds faced significant redemption pressures (Graph VI.6, right-hand
panel).
What do these developments imply for regulation? A key point is that,
regardless of regulatory constraints, market-makers will not be “catching a falling
knife”.16 That is, in transitioning to an environment that avoids unduly compressed
liquidity premia, it is investors, not market-makers, who need to internalise the risk
that liquidity will evaporate whenever everybody heads for the exits. For this, liquidity
risk management needs to be up to the task. Market-based initiatives, such as
liquidity stress tests and associated disclosures, are a vital tool. This should help
market participants better understand each other’s behaviour, which would also help
inform their own responses. Regulatory measures can provide support, for example,
by developing standardised disclosures or guidance for liquidity management.17
In addition, regulators may also want to more directly incentivise investors to
better align their asset holdings and liquidity risks. One example is recent regulatory
measures targeting open-end US mutual funds. The measures aim to address
externalities (eg from fire sales) that may be arising from the redemption risks the
industry faces.18 The new rules would require fund managers to hold a minimum
amount of liquid assets that can be sold within three days to satisfy immediate
liquidity needs, similar in spirit to the Basel III LCR requirement, along with a cap on
illiquid assets. In addition, the new regulations would allow, but not require,
implementation of “swing pricing” – a mechanism to pass on the trading costs
associated with redemptions to those investors that are redeeming their positions
in order to protect other investors from net asset value dilution. The feature is well

14

Empirical research on the impact of recent regulatory changes on market liquidity remains
inconclusive. While J Dick-Nielson (“Dealer inventory and the cost of immediacy”, paper presented
at the Midwest Finance Association Annual Meeting, 2013) conjectures that recent regulatory
adjustments may have raised transaction costs for US corporate bonds, F Trebbi and K Xiao
(“Regulation and market liquidity”, mimeo, 2016) find no evidence of negative effects from
US regulatory action on US fixed income market liquidity.

variants of swing pricing for some time. Available disclosures, however, have
generally been limited, making it difficult to reliably assess the effectiveness of the
mechanism. Going forward, regulators will need to keep monitoring the impact of
these measures on the mutual fund sector, while considering the implementation of
similar requirements in other parts of the asset management industry, as needed.

For the credit-to-GDP gap, data up to Q4 2015 except for Bulgaria, Lithuania and the Philippines, for which data end in Q1 2016; for the
property price gap, data up to Q4 2015 except for France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore,
South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom, for which data end in Q1 2016; for the debt service ratio, data up to
Q4 2015.
  Thresholds for red cells are chosen by minimising false alarms conditional on capturing at least two thirds of the crises over a cumulative
three-year horizon. A signal is correct if a crisis occurs in any of the three years ahead. The noise is measured by the wrong predictions outside
this horizon. Beige cells for the credit-to-GDP gap are based on guidelines for countercyclical capital buffers under Basel III. Beige cells for the
debt service ratio (DSR) are based on critical thresholds if a two-year forecast horizon is used. For a derivation of critical thresholds for creditto-GDP gaps and property price gaps, see M Drehmann, C Borio and K Tsatsaronis, “Anchoring countercyclical capital buffers: the role of credit
aggregates”, International Journal of Central Banking, vol 7, no 4, 2011, pp 189–240. Country aggregates are simple averages.    2  Difference
of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-run, real-time trend calculated with a one-sided HP filter using a smoothing factor of 400,000, in
percentage points.    3  Deviations of real residential property prices from their long-run trend calculated with a one-sided HP filter using a
smoothing factor of 400,000, in per cent.     4  For the DSR series and methodology, see www.bis.org/statistics/dsr/index.htm. Difference of DSRs
from country-specific long-run averages since 1999 or later depending on data availability and when five-year average inflation fell below
10%, in percentage points.    5  Assuming that interest rates increase 2.50 percentage points and all the other components of the DSR stay
fixed.    6  Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand; excluding the Philippines and Singapore for the DSR
and its forecast.    7  Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Russia; excluding the Czech Republic
and Romania for the real property price gap; excluding Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania for the DSR and its forecast.     8  Finland,
Norway and Sweden.

BIS 86th Annual Report

The BIS: mission, activities, governance and
financial results

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) serves central banks in their pursuit of
monetary and financial stability, fosters international cooperation in those areas
and acts as a bank for central banks. In outline, the BIS pursues this mission by:
•
facilitating dialogue and collaboration among central banks and other authorities
that are responsible for promoting financial stability;
•
conducting research on policy issues confronting central banks and financial
supervisory authorities;
•
acting as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
•
serving as an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The BIS has its head office in Basel, Switzerland, and representative offices in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China
(Hong Kong SAR) and in Mexico City.
In the light of the above aims, this chapter reviews the BIS’s activities, and those
of the groups it hosts, for the financial year 2015/16; describes the institutional
framework that supports their work; and presents the year’s financial results.

The meetings programmes and the Basel Process
The BIS promotes international cooperation among monetary authorities and
financial supervisory officials through its meetings programmes and through the
Basel Process – hosting and supporting international groups pursuing global
financial stability (such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the
Financial Stability Board) and facilitating their interaction.

Bimonthly meetings and other regular consultations
Governors and other senior officials of BIS member central banks hold bimonthly
meetings, normally in Basel, to discuss current developments and the outlook for
the world economy and financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences
on issues of interest to central banks.

Global Economy Meeting
The Global Economy Meeting (GEM) comprises the Governors of 30 BIS member
central banks in major advanced and emerging market economies that account
for about four fifths of global GDP. The Governors of another 19 central banks
attend the GEM as observers.1 Chaired by Agustín Carstens, Governor of the Bank

1

The members of the GEM are from the central banks of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States and also the ECB. The
observers are from the central banks of Algeria, Austria, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the
Philippines, Portugal, Romania and the United Arab Emirates.

BIS 86th Annual Report

135

of Mexico, the GEM has two main roles: (i) monitoring and assessing developments,
risks and opportunities in the world economy and the global financial system; and
(ii) providing guidance to three BIS-based central bank committees – the Committee
on the Global Financial System, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures
and the Markets Committee.
The GEM’s economic discussions focus on current macroeconomic and financial
developments in major advanced and emerging market economies. Specific topics
discussed by the GEM over the past year included: the appropriate mix of monetary,
fiscal and structural policies at the current juncture; the natural rate of interest;
implications of recent large movements in exchange rates; risks to real and financial
globalisation; and changing drivers of global growth.

Economic Consultative Committee
The Economic Consultative Committee (ECC) is an 18-member group that supports
the work of the GEM. Also led by the GEM Chairman and comprising all Governors
participating in the BIS Board meeting and the BIS General Manager, the ECC
conducts analyses and prepares proposals for the GEM’s consideration. In addition,
the ECC Chairman makes recommendations to the GEM on the appointment of
Chairs of the three central bank committees mentioned above and on the
composition and organisation of those committees.

All Governors’ Meeting
The All Governors’ Meeting comprises the Governors of the 60 BIS member central
banks and is chaired by the Chairman of the Board. It convenes to discuss selected
topics of general interest to its members. In 2015/16, the topics discussed were
inequality and monetary policy; whether innovation has peaked; central clearing –
trends and current issues; issues for central banks arising from financial inclusion
and education; liquidity assistance by central banks; and climate change and the
financial system.
By agreement with the GEM and the BIS Board, the All Governors’ Meeting is
responsible for overseeing the work of two other groups that have a broader
network or membership than the GEM. These are the Central Bank Governance
Group, which also meets during the bimonthly meetings, and the Irving Fisher
Committee on Central Bank Statistics.

Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision
The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) is a highlevel forum responsible for international collaboration on banking supervision.
Chaired by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, the GHOS meets periodically to
decide on global banking regulations and oversee the work of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (see page 138).

Other meetings of Governors
The central bank Governors of major emerging market economies (EMEs) meet
three times a year – during the January, May and September bimonthly meetings –
to discuss issues of importance to their economies. The topics discussed in 2015/16
included global asset management companies and emerging market asset classes;
international currencies and the international monetary system; and the implications
for EMEs of exchange rate and commodity price developments.

136

BIS 86th Annual Report

Regular meetings were also held for the Governors of central banks in small
open economies.

Other consultations
In addition, the Bank regularly organises various meetings that bring together
senior central bank officials and, occasionally, representatives from other financial
authorities, the private financial sector and the academic community to discuss
topics of shared interest.
During the past year, these events included:
•
the annual meetings of the working parties on monetary policy, held in Basel
but also hosted at a regional level by central banks in Asia, central and eastern
Europe, and Latin America;
•
a meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies on inflation
mechanisms; and
•
the high-level meetings organised by the Financial Stability Institute in various
regions of the world for Governors and Deputy Governors and heads of
supervisory authorities.

The Basel Process
The Basel Process refers to the BIS’s role in hosting and supporting international groups
– six committees and three associations – engaged in standard setting and the pursuit
of financial stability. Co-location at the BIS facilitates communication and collaboration
among these groups as well as their interaction with central bank Governors and other
senior officials in the context of the BIS’s regular meetings programme. The BIS also
supports the work of these committees and associations with its expertise in economic
research and statistics and its practical experience in banking.
The hosted committees, whose agendas are guided by various sets of central
banks and supervisory authorities, are as follows:
•
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): develops global
regulatory standards for banks and seeks to strengthen micro- and
macroprudential supervision;
•
the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS): monitors and analyses
issues relating to financial markets and systems;
•
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI): analyses and
sets standards for payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures;
•
the Markets Committee: monitors developments in financial markets and their
implications for central bank operations;
•
the Central Bank Governance Group: examines issues related to the design and
operation of central banks; and
•
the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC): addresses statistical
issues relating to economic, monetary and financial stability.
The hosted associations are as follows:
•
the Financial Stability Board (FSB): an association including finance ministries,
central banks and other financial authorities in 24 countries; coordinates at the
international level the work of national authorities and international standard
setters and develops policies to enhance financial stability;
•
the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI): sets global standards
for deposit insurance systems and promotes cooperation on deposit insurance
and bank resolution arrangements; and
•
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): sets standards for
the insurance sector to promote globally consistent supervision.

BIS 86th Annual Report

137

The Bank’s own Financial Stability Institute (FSI) facilitates the dissemination of
the standard-setting bodies’ work to central banks and financial sector supervisory
and regulatory agencies through its extensive programme of meetings, seminars
and online tutorials.
The Basel Process is based on three key features: synergies of co-location;
flexibility and openness in the exchange of information; and support from the BIS’s
expertise in economics, statistics, banking and regulation.

Synergies
The physical proximity of the nine committees and associations at the BIS creates
synergies that produce a broad and fruitful exchange of ideas. In addition, each
group’s costs of operation are reduced through economies of scale.

Flexibility
The limited size of these groups is conducive to flexibility and openness in the
exchange of information, thereby facilitating coordination and preventing overlaps
and gaps in their work programmes. At the same time, their output is much larger
than their size would suggest, as they are able to leverage the expertise of the
international community of central bankers, financial regulators and supervisors,
and other international and national public authorities.

Support from the BIS’s economic expertise and banking experience
The work of the Basel-based committees is informed by the BIS’s economic research
and statistics and, where appropriate, by the practical experience it gains from the
implementation of regulatory standards and financial controls in its banking
activities.

Activities of BIS-hosted committees and the FSI
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the six committees hosted by
the BIS and of the Financial Stability Institute.

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) seeks to enhance supervisory
cooperation and improve the quality of banking supervision worldwide. Its mandate
is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks for the purpose
of enhancing financial stability. The Committee supports supervisors by providing a
forum for exchanging information on national supervisory arrangements, improving
the effectiveness of techniques for supervising banks, and setting minimum
supervisory and regulatory standards.
The Committee consists of senior representatives of banking supervisory
authorities and central banks responsible for banking supervision or financial
stability in the Committee’s member jurisdictions. It is chaired by Stefan Ingves,
Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, and generally meets four times a year. The
Committee seeks the endorsement of the Group of Governors and Heads of
Supervision (GHOS), its governing body, for its major decisions and its work
programme.

138

BIS 86th Annual Report

Current work programme
During 2015, the Basel Committee made substantial progress towards finalising its
post-crisis policy reforms; promoting globally consistent implementation of the
agreed regulatory framework; and identifying emerging issues in supervision.
The Committee’s 2016 work programme is focused on finalising its financial
crisis-related reform agenda and addressing the problem of excessive variability in
risk-weighted assets (RWAs). This programme includes the following key elements:
(i) the removal of internal model approaches for certain risks (eg the Advanced
Measurement Approaches for operational risk); and (ii) imposing additional
constraints on the use of internal model approaches for credit risk, in particular
through the use of minimum capital requirements based on standardised
approaches (ie capital floors). The GHOS will review the Committee’s proposals on
the risk-weighted framework and the design and calibration of capital floors around
the end of 2016.
In January 2016, the GHOS agreed that the leverage ratio should be based on
a Tier 1 definition of capital and should comprise a minimum level of 3%. Additional
elements may be required for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Over
the coming year, the Committee will finalise the design and calibration of the
leverage ratio for G-SIBs to allow sufficient time for it to be implemented as a
Pillar 1 measure by 1 January 2018.

Policy reform
During the year, the Committee consulted on proposed revisions to the standardised
approaches for credit risk and operational risk, and finalised the revised market risk
framework. Ongoing work on the calibration of the capital floors based on
standardised approaches is closely linked to the finalisation of the overall package
of reforms to enhance the comparability of risk-weighted assets calculated using
internal ratings-based approaches for credit risk.
The Committee finalised or issued for consultation a number of global
standards for banks during the year.
Margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. In March 2015, the
Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
revised the framework for margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.
Interest rate risk in the banking book. In June 2015, the Committee proposed
changes to the regulatory capital treatment and supervision of interest rate risk in
the banking book (IRRBB). These expand upon, and are intended to ultimately
replace, the Basel Committee’s 2004 Principles for the management and supervision
of interest rate risk. The review of the regulatory treatment of IRRBB will, first, help
to ensure that banks have appropriate capital to cover potential losses from
exposures to changes in interest rates. Second, it is intended to limit capital
arbitrage between the trading book and the banking book, as well as between
banking book portfolios that are subject to different accounting treatments.
Net Stable Funding Ratio disclosure standards. In June 2015, the Committee finalised
the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) disclosure standards, following the publication
of the NSFR standard in October 2014. The disclosure requirements are designed to
improve the transparency of regulatory funding requirements, reinforce the
Principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision, strengthen market
discipline, and reduce market uncertainty as the NSFR standard is implemented. To

BIS 86th Annual Report

139

that end, internationally active banks in all Basel Committee member jurisdictions
will be required to publish their NSFRs according to a common template. Banks are
required to comply with the disclosure standards from their first reporting period
after 1 January 2018.
Review of the Credit Valuation Adjustment risk framework. In July 2015, the
Committee issued a consultative paper on its Review of the Credit Valuation
Adjustment risk framework with the aim of (i) ensuring that all important drivers
of credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and CVA hedges are covered in the
Basel regulatory capital standard; (ii) aligning the capital standard with the
fair value measurement of CVA employed under various accounting regimes; and
(iii) ensuring consistency with the proposed revisions to the market risk framework
under the Basel Committee’s Fundamental review of the trading book. In parallel,
the Committee undertook a quantitative impact study in the second half of 2015 to
inform deliberations on the final calibration of the framework.
Criteria for identifying simple, transparent and comparable securitisations. In July
2015, the Committee and IOSCO released their final criteria to assist in the
development of simple, transparent and comparable (STC) securitisation structures.
In November 2015, the Committee issued for consultation additional criteria for the
specific purpose of differentiating the capital treatment of STC securitisations from
that of other securitisation transactions. The Committee is proposing to reduce
minimum capital requirements for such STC securitisations by reducing the risk
weight floor for senior exposures, and by rescaling risk weights for other exposures.
Haircut floors for non-centrally cleared securities financing transactions. In
November 2015, the Committee issued a consultative proposal for incorporating
the FSB’s policy framework for haircut floors for non-centrally cleared securities
financing transactions into the Basel III framework. The proposal is designed to
create incentives for banks to set their collateral haircuts above the floors rather
than hold more capital.
TLAC holdings. In November 2015, the Committee issued for consultation its
proposed prudential treatment of banks’ investments in Total Loss-Absorbing
Capacity (TLAC) instruments, following the FSB’s publication of its relevant principles
and TLAC term sheet. Applicable to all banks subject to national regulations that
are based on the Basel Committee’s standards, including non-G-SIBs, the proposed
treatment is for banks to deduct from their regulatory capital their holdings of
TLAC instruments, subject to thresholds. The aim is to support the TLAC regime by
reducing the risk of contagion should a G-SIB enter resolution. The TLAC regime
also necessitates changes to Basel III to specify how G-SIBs must take account of
the TLAC requirement when calculating their regulatory capital buffers.
Revisions to the Standardised Approach for credit risk. In December 2015, the
Committee released a second consultative document on Revisions to the
Standardised Approach for credit risk, which forms part of the Committee’s broader
review of the capital framework to balance simplicity and risk sensitivity, and to
reduce variability in banks’ risk-weighted assets. This revised proposal reintroduces
the use of credit ratings, in a non-mechanistic manner, for exposures to banks and
corporates; includes alternative approaches for jurisdictions that do not allow the
use of external ratings for regulatory purposes; modifies the proposed risk
weighting of real estate loans; and includes proposals for exposures to multilateral
development banks, retail and defaulted exposures, and off-balance sheet items.

140

BIS 86th Annual Report

Identification and measurement of step-in risk. In December 2015, the Committee
released proposals to identify and measure the risk that a bank will provide financial
support to a stressed entity beyond, or in the absence of, its contractual obligations.
The proposals fall within the G20 initiative to strengthen the oversight and
regulation of the shadow banking system and mitigate the associated risks. The
Committee will assess the potential impacts of the proposals, particularly as to
whether they adequately capture entities posing potential step-in risk.
Minimum capital requirements for market risk. In January 2016, the Committee
issued the revised minimum capital requirements for market risk as agreed by the
GHOS. A key component of the Basel Committee’s overall reform efforts, the revised
framework is designed to ensure that the standardised and internal model
approaches to market risk deliver credible capital outcomes and promote consistent
implementation of the standards across jurisdictions. The final standard incorporates
changes that have been made following two consultative documents published in
2013 and 2014 and several quantitative impact studies.
Frequently asked questions. To promote consistent global implementation of
Basel III, the Committee periodically reviews frequently asked questions (FAQs) and
publishes answers along with any necessary technical elaboration of the rules text
and interpretative guidance. FAQs were published on the Basel III leverage ratio
framework in July 2015, on the standardised approach for measuring counterparty
credit risk exposures in August, and on the Basel III Countercyclical Capital Buffer in
October.

Policy implementation
Implementation of the regulatory framework is a key priority for the Committee.
The Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) monitors the Committee’s
member jurisdictions’ progress on implementation and assesses the consistency
and completeness of the adopted standards. The RCAP also facilitates dialogue
among Committee members and assists the Committee in developing standards.
During the year, RCAP jurisdictional assessments were conducted for India,
Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Reviews are under way to assess the consistency of
capital and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) regulations in Argentina, Indonesia,
Korea, Russia and Turkey and of the frameworks for systemically important banks
(SIBs) in the member jurisdictions that are home to G-SIBs (China, the European
Union, Japan, Switzerland and the United States).
Four years after the RCAP was launched, the Committee is reviewing the
programme and considering how its effectiveness could be further enhanced. For
example, the Committee has revised its monitoring template and report to take
into account new or revised standards. It has also commissioned a study to review
the progress of the RCAP and the strategic direction of the Committee’s
implementation mandate.
In addition, the Committee published several other reports relating to the
implementation of the Basel framework.
RCAP-Report on risk-weighted assets for counterparty credit risk (CCR). In October
2015, the Committee published a report on the regulatory consistency of RWAs for
counterparty credit risk. The report presents the findings from a hypothetical
portfolio exercise to examine variability in banks’ modelling of derivatives, and
specifically in exposure modelling. The report focuses on the internal models
method and the advanced CVA risk capital charge for over-the-counter (OTC)

derivative trades. This exercise completes the Committee’s review of trading-related
internal models.
Basel III Monitoring Report. Published twice a year, the study is based on the
rigorous reporting process to periodically review the implications of the Basel III
standards. The results of the monitoring exercise assume that the final Basel III
package is fully in force and do not take account of any transitional arrangements,
such as the gradual phase-in of deductions from regulatory capital.
The March 2016 report shows that all large internationally active banks meet the
Basel III risk-based minimum capital requirements as well as the Common Equity
Tier 1 (CET1) target level of 7.0% (plus the surcharges for G-SIBs, as applicable). The
reports also collect bank data on Basel III’s liquidity requirement. Regarding the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which came into effect on 1 January 2015, all banks in
the LCR sample reported an LCR at or above the 60% minimum requirement that was
in place for 2015, while 84% reported a ratio that met or exceeded 100%. As for the
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which will become a minimum standard by
1 January 2018, 79% of the Group 1 banks and 83% of the Group 2 banks in the
NSFR sample reported a ratio that met or exceeded 100%, while 92% of the Group 1
banks and 94% of the Group 2 banks reported an NSFR at or above 90%.2
Progress report on adoption of the Basel regulatory framework. This updated
progress report provides a high-level view of Basel Committee members’ progress
in adopting Basel III regulations as of end-September 2015. It focuses on the status
of domestic rule-making processes to ensure that the Basel standards are
transformed into national law or regulation according to the internationally agreed
time frames. The report covers the risk-based capital standards, the liquidity
standards (LCR and NSFR), the framework for SIBs, the leverage ratio, the revised
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the large exposure framework.
Quantitative impact studies. In November 2015, the Committee published a
quantitative impact study on TLAC, focusing on shortfall analyses. The purpose was
to assess whether G-SIBs can meet the TLAC standard. The Committee also
published the results of its interim impact analysis of its fundamental review of the
trading book in November 2015. The report assesses the impact of proposed
revisions to the market risk framework set out in two consultative documents of
October 2013 and December 2014.
Progress reports. In July 2015, the Committee issued a progress report on the
implementation of principles for effective supervisory colleges, highlighting the
challenges faced by supervisors in running effective supervisory colleges as well as
the practical approaches taken to address them. In December 2015, the Committee
also published its third progress report on banks’ adoption of the Committee’s
2013 Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting.
Reports to the G20. In November 2015, the Committee reported to the G20 Leaders
on its progress in finalising post-crisis reforms and on the implementation status of
the Basel III reforms since November 2014. The report summarises the steps taken
by member jurisdictions to adopt the Basel III standards, banks’ progress in
bolstering their capital and liquidity positions, the consistency of implementation in

jurisdictions assessed since the Committee’s last report, and the Committee’s
implementation work plan.

Supervision
During the year, the Committee published several documents to aid supervisors in
undertaking effective supervision of banks.
Developments in credit risk management across sectors: current practices and
recommendations. In June 2015, the Committee published a report on the current
supervisory framework for credit risk, the state of credit risk management and
implications for the supervisory and regulatory treatments of credit risk. It is based
on a survey that was conducted with supervisors and firms in the banking, securities
and insurance sectors worldwide.
Report on the impact and accountability of banking supervision. In July 2015, the
Committee published a range-of-practice study on how supervisors around the
world define, evaluate and manage the impact of their policies and actions, and
then account for it to their stakeholders. The report shows how a well designed
system of accountability can support operational independence and enhance
transparency while safeguarding confidential, institution-specific information.
Corporate governance principles for banks. In July 2015, the Committee published a
revised set of principles on corporate governance. The guidelines elaborate the
importance of risk governance as part of a bank’s overall corporate governance
framework and promote the value of effective boards and board committees
together with strong control functions. They also provide guidance for bank
supervisors in evaluating the processes used by banks to select board members and
senior management.
Guidelines for identifying and dealing with weak banks. In July 2015, the Committee
published updated guidelines building on the Committee’s 2002 guidance. These
cover the underlying supervisory preconditions for dealing with weak banks and
set out techniques for identifying problems as well as corrective measures and, for
resolution authorities, tools for dealing with failing or failed banks.
General guide to account opening. In July 2015, the Committee issued for public
consultation a revised version of the General guide to account opening and customer
identification, first published in 2003. The customer information collected and
verified at the account-opening stage is crucial for the bank to fulfil its obligations
under anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
rules. When finalised, the revised version will become an annex to the Committee’s
Sound management of risks related to money laundering and financing of terrorism,
published in January 2014.
Guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses. Issued in December
2015, this guidance replaces the Committee’s Sound credit risk assessment and
valuation for loans published in 2006. The guidance sets out supervisory
expectations for banks relating to sound credit risk practices associated with
implementing and applying an expected credit loss (ECL) accounting framework.
Guidance on the application of the Core principles for effective banking supervision
to the regulation and supervision of institutions relevant to financial inclusion.

BIS 86th Annual Report

143

Published in December 2015, the consultative document sets out additional
guidance on the application of the Core principles for effective banking
supervision to the supervision of financial institutions serving the financially
excluded. It includes a report on the range of practice in the regulation and
supervision of institutions relevant to financial inclusion, and expands on
microfinance activities.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) monitors financial market
developments for the Governors of the BIS Global Economy Meeting and analyses
the implications for financial stability and central bank policy. Chaired by William C
Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Committee
comprises Deputy Governors and other senior officials from 23 central banks of
major advanced and emerging market economies, as well as the Head of the BIS’s
Monetary and Economic Department and its Economic Adviser.
Among the topics discussed by the Committee during the past year were the
challenges posed to international financial stability by divergent monetary policy
across currency areas, as well as the impact from a slowdown in EME growth
prospects. In its regular monitoring of global liquidity trends, the Committee
focused on the potential risks posed by the build-up of financial imbalances among
countries that had so far been relatively unaffected by the global financial crisis. It
also discussed the potential risks from the compression of risk premia in different
asset markets earlier in the year, and the implications of increased asset price
volatility. Finally, the Committee organised a workshop where experts reviewed
member jurisdictions’ experiences with macroprudential policymaking to identify
areas where further study could be beneficial.
Additionally, in-depth studies are commissioned from groups of central bank
experts. Two such reports were published this year.
Fixed income market liquidity. Confirming the findings of a 2014 report on marketmaking and proprietary trading, the January 2016 report established that diverging
supply and demand trends for liquidity services may have made liquidity conditions
more fragile. As key drivers, the report identified the rise of electronic trading,
dealer deleveraging, possibly reinforced by regulatory reform, and unconventional
monetary policy. It concluded that, in the medium term, more stringent capital
requirements and other measures taken to bolster market intermediaries’ riskabsorption capacity will strengthen systemic stability, not least by ensuring a more
sustainable supply of immediacy services. Overall, the report underscores the need
for a close monitoring of liquidity conditions as well as an ongoing assessment of
how new liquidity providers and trading platforms will affect the distribution of
risks among market participants.
Regulatory change and monetary policy. Issued jointly with the Markets Committee
in May 2015, this report focused on the likely effects of new financial regulation on
financial system structure and financial intermediaries, and how central banks will
need to take these changes into account when implementing monetary policy.
Based on information from central bank case studies and structured interviews with
private sector market participants, among other sources, the report argues that the
effect on monetary policy operations and transmission should be limited and
manageable. It concludes that central banks should be able to adjust their existing

Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures
The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) promotes the
safety and efficiency of payment, clearing, settlement and reporting systems and
arrangements, thereby supporting financial stability and the wider economy.
Comprising senior officials from 25 central banks, the CPMI is a global standard
setter that aims to strengthen regulation, policy and practice in this field worldwide.
It also serves as a forum for central banks to monitor and analyse developments in
payment, clearing, settlement and reporting within and across jurisdictions and to
cooperate in related oversight, policy and operational matters, including the
provision of central bank services. The Committee Chair is Benoît Cœuré, a member
of the ECB’s Executive Board.

Monitoring implementation of standards for financial market infrastructures
The CPMI-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI), published in
April 2012, set out international regulatory standards for systemically important
financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and specify the responsibilities for the
authorities that oversee, supervise or regulate them.
Monitoring the implementation of the PFMI, a high priority for the CPMI,
involves three phases: Level 1, on the adoption of the PFMI in domestic regulatory
frameworks; Level 2, on the completeness and consistency of these regulatory
frameworks; and Level 3, on the consistency in the outcomes of the PFMI
implementation across jurisdictions.
Level 1: In June 2015, the CPMI and IOSCO published a second update to the Level 1
assessments, which showed that the 28 participating jurisdictions are continuing to
make good progress in implementing the PFMI. In particular, the report highlighted
significant progress on implementation measures applicable to central securities
depositories and securities settlement systems.
Level 2: In December 2015, the CPMI and IOSCO published a Level 2 assessment
report on implementation measures applicable to central counterparties (CCPs) and
trade repositories in Australia. In November 2015, they published a Level 2 report
on the assessment of the completeness and consistency of frameworks and
outcomes of jurisdictions’ implementation of the PFMI’s “Responsibilities of
authorities”.
Level 3: In June 2015, the CPMI and IOSCO initiated a Level 3 assessment focusing
on a subset of PFMI requirements that relate to CCPs’ financial risk management.
Covering certain governance, stress-testing, margin, liquidity, collateral and
recovery practices, the assessment looks at the outcomes achieved by a number of
globally and locally active CCPs that clear exchange-traded and OTC derivative
products. A report presenting the results of this assessment is expected to be
published in 2016.

CCP resilience and recovery
In April 2015, the BCBS, CPMI, FSB and IOSCO agreed on a workplan to coordinate
their respective international policy work aimed at enhancing the overall resilience,
recovery planning and resolvability of CCPs and to work in close collaboration.3 The
workplan also calls for better understanding of the interdependencies between CCPs
and their direct and indirect members. Jointly with IOSCO, the CPMI is responsible
for the work related to strengthening CCP resilience and recovery, and is working
closely with the other committees on CCP resolution and interdependencies.
Taking into account the findings from the implementation monitoring of the
PFMI, the CPMI and IOSCO started work on the strengthening of CCP resilience and
recovery in mid-2015, paying particular attention to the adequacy of existing
standards. A consultative report on the findings from this analysis is set for
publication in 2016.

Harmonisation of OTC derivatives data
In November 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO set up a working group to develop
guidance on the harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data, including uniform
transaction and product identifiers. Consultative reports published so far include
the Harmonisation of the Unique Transaction Identifier in August 2015, the
Harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data elements (other than UTI and UPI) – first
batch in September 2015, and the Harmonisation of the Unique Product Identifier in
December 2015. The working group will conduct additional public consultations
with a view to fulfilling its mandate by end-2017.

Retail payments
The CPMI’s report on Digital currencies, published in November 2015, analyses the
impact on financial markets and the wider economy that could accrue from digital
currency schemes with an embedded decentralised transfer mechanism based on
distributed ledger technology.

Correspondent banking
The CPMI’s consultative report on Correspondent banking, published in October
2015, reviews technical measures relating to know-your-customer (KYC) utilities; the
increased use of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI); information-sharing mechanisms;
and improvements in payment messages. It also puts forward four recommendations
for consideration by the industry and authorities.

Cyber resilience in FMIs
A consultative report on Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market
infrastructures was published in November 2015, with a final report envisaged in
2016. These publications follow up the CPMI’s November 2014 report on Cyber
resilience in financial market infrastructures, which noted the importance of an
integrated and comprehensive approach to the cyber resilience of FMIs and the
need for international cooperation in this area. The report aimed to raise awareness
of the systemic implications of cyber attacks on FMIs. Building on their previous

3

BIS 86th Annual Report

separate work on cyber resilience, the CPMI and IOSCO established a joint working
group on cyber resilience for FMIs in December 2014 to consider additional
guidance and identify other relevant issues.

Payment aspects of financial inclusion
The CPMI and the World Bank Group set up a joint task force in mid-2014 to
examine demand and supply factors affecting financial inclusion in the context of
payment systems and services, and to suggest measures that could be taken to
address these issues. A consultative report was published in September 2015 on the
payment aspects of financial inclusion and set out guiding principles designed to
assist countries that seek to advance financial inclusion in their markets through
payments. A final report is expected in 2016.

Red Book statistics
After launching a revision of the statistical methodology in June 2015, the CPMI
published in December 2015 its annual update of the Statistics on payment, clearing
and settlement systems in the CPMI countries.

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee is a forum where senior central bank officials jointly
monitor developments in financial markets and assess their implications for market
functioning and central bank operations. With a membership comprising 21 central
banks, the Committee is chaired by Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor of the Reserve
Bank of Australia.
The Committee’s discussions during the year were shaped by the divergent
monetary policy settings of the major central banks as well as by market
developments in emerging economies. Among the topics discussed were negative
policy rates, and the implications of monetary policy measures and exchange rate
movements for market functioning.
In addition to monitoring near-term developments, the Committee considered
longer-term structural and operational issues. Topics included the evolving structure
of the US Treasury market, as well as market intelligence-gathering and the
provision of custody and banking services by central banks.
One special project undertaken by the Committee in May 2015 was to set up a
working group to support the establishment of a single global code of conduct for
the foreign exchange market and to promote adherence to the new standards and
principles. This work is being undertaken in collaboration with a group of market
participants from the major financial centres in both advanced and emerging
market economies. The target date for the code’s finalisation, as well as for the
proposals to ensure greater adherence, is May 2017.
In January 2016, the Committee held a workshop with private sector participants
on industry-led initiatives to create independent netting and execution facilities for
orders used to set price benchmarks (fix orders) in the foreign exchange market.
The Committee’s report on Electronic trading in fixed income markets, issued in
January 2016, examines how electronic trading has transformed the structure of the
fixed income markets, including price discovery and the nature of liquidity
provision. The report finds that electronic trading has underpinned strong growth
in algorithmic and high-frequency trading in the most liquid market segments.

Central Bank Governance Group
The Central Bank Governance Group serves as a venue for the exchange of views
among Governors on matters relating to the design and operation of their institutions.
The focus is on the institutional and organisational setting in which central banks
pursue monetary and financial policies, including their functions, independence
and decision-making structures. The group comprises nine Governors and is chaired
by Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia.
Discussions are informed by information flows through the Central Bank
Governance Network, comprising almost 50 of the BIS member central banks.
Information on institutional design and governance collected via the Network and
other research are made available to central bank officials. Selected examples of
this research are published.
In 2015/16, the Governance Group convened during several BIS bimonthly
meetings to discuss, among other topics, the evolution of liquidity assistance
policies and their legal foundations; reasons why central banks might create senior
executive positions along the lines of private sector chief officer posts; issues
around changing central bank law; and the commission by central banks of special
purpose reviews of their own performance and arrangements. The information and
insights provided help central banks assess the effectiveness of their own
arrangements as well as the alternatives available.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC) is a forum for central
bank economists and statisticians to address statistical topics related to monetary
and financial stability. Governed by the international central banking community, it
is hosted by the BIS and associated with the International Statistical Institute (ISI).
The IFC has 83 institutional members, including almost all BIS shareholder central
banks, and is currently chaired by Turalay Kenç, Deputy Governor of the Central
Bank of the Republic of Turkey.
The IFC organised several activities in 2015/16 with the support of its member
central banks and a number of international organisations. A significant part of this
work was conducted in cooperation with the G20-endorsed international Data
Gaps Initiative (DGI) to enhance economic and financial statistics. One important
outcome in 2015 was the reference document Consolidation and corporate groups:
an overview of methodological and practical issues, which draws on the outcome of
an IFC workshop on residency/local and nationality/global views of financial
positions. Published by the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics
(IAG), the report completes the DGI recommendation to investigate the issue of
monitoring and measuring cross-border exposures of corporations.
Another key DGI recommendation is to develop and improve sectoral financial
accounts. To that end, the IFC has continued to organise regional workshops for
central banks, including one at the Bank of Algeria for the African region in early
2016. In a third DGI-related area, the IFC has followed up on data-sharing issues
and good practices between statistical and supervisory authorities.

148

BIS 86th Annual Report

The Committee also continued its work on financial stability analysis and
balance of payments issues as well as on other topics relevant to the central banking
statistical community. In particular, following the publication of a specific IFC
Bulletin on financial inclusion indicators, it surveyed its members on national
practices and projects related to financial inclusion in 2015. It also reviewed central
banks’ experience and interest in exploring big data as well as their use of the
SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) standard, with the publication of
two reports on these topics.
In terms of meetings, the IFC organised a seminar on the assessment of postcrisis international capital flows in cooperation with the Central Bank of Brazil and
the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA). Together with Narodowy
Bank Polski (the central bank of Poland), it also held a workshop on combining micro
and macro statistical data for financial stability analysis. Finally, the IFC sponsored
several sessions at the ISI’s 60th biennial World Statistics Congress in 2015 on topics
such as central bank sources and uses of derivatives statistics; improving government
debt statistics; the use of surveys by central banks; developing and improving
sectoral accounts; and micro data for multipurpose data provision.

Financial Stability Institute
The Financial Stability Institute (FSI) assists supervisors worldwide in strengthening
their financial systems by disseminating global financial standards. The FSI carries
out this task through high-level meetings; policy and implementation meetings;
conferences and seminars; FSI Connect, the BIS’s online information resource and
learning tool; and by monitoring the implementation of Basel standards in nonBCBS member jurisdictions.

High-level meetings
The FSI organises high-level meetings jointly with the BCBS in all major regions of
the world. These meetings are designed for the Deputy Governors of central banks
and heads of supervisory authorities, and focus on policy discussions relating
to global banking standards, emerging financial developments, and regional
implementation issues. In 2015, 286 heads of supervision in Africa, Asia-Pacific,
central and eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa
attended FSI high-level meetings.
The topics discussed included the recent BCBS policy work to mitigate riskweighted asset variability through the enhancement of standardised approaches;
the impact of Basel III on bank business models; bank governance and culture; the
FSB’s new Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements; and emerging cyber
risks in the financial industry.

Policy and implementation meetings
In 2015, the FSI introduced policy and implementation meetings for senior officials
who play a key decision-making role in implementing regulatory reforms at the
national level (ie divisional/departmental heads at financial authorities). The
purpose is to discuss policy and supervisory issues related to new aspects of the
Basel III framework. Held in Lima and Hong Kong, the first such meetings focused
on revisions to the standardised approach for credit risk.

BIS 86th Annual Report

149

Conferences and seminars
These events provide a venue for supervisors around the world to confer on core
aspects of financial sector regulation and supervision. Separate events cover
banking, insurance, and cross-sectoral areas.
On the banking side, the FSI organised 30 seminars and conferences in 2015.
These included 10 events in Switzerland and 20 in other jurisdictions, which were
organised in cooperation with 14 regional supervisory groups.4 The main topics
covered at these events included supervisory techniques and bank practices on
stress testing; supervisory approaches to dealing with regional and domestic
systemically important banks; liquidity risk management and supervision; and the
implementation of the Basel III Countercyclical Capital Buffer.
The FSI held eight insurance-related seminars, of which five were in
collaboration with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The
main topics covered were the new solvency and capital standards for insurers; the
policy framework for global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs); and the
emerging resolution framework for insurers. The FSI, in collaboration with the IAIS,
also organised a virtual seminar for 189 insurance supervisors from 59 jurisdictions,
involving a series of seven webinars and selected FSI Connect tutorials covering
topics on the key elements of insurance supervision.
In 2015, the FSI organised two cross-sectoral events, one jointly with IOSCO
and another with International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI). The joint
event with IOSCO covered cross-sectoral issues relating to the trading book, market
infrastructure and the culture of compliance. The event co-organised with IADI
focused on current and emerging issues related to bank resolution, crisis management
and deposit insurance.
In total, 1,544 central bankers and financial sector supervisors attended FSI
conferences and seminars.

FSI Connect
FSI Connect offers over 260 tutorials covering a wide range of regulatory policy and
supervisory topics. It now has about 10,000 subscribers from over 300 central banks
and other public sector financial authorities.
In 2015, the FSI released 29 new and updated tutorials on topics such as the
leverage ratio; the standardised approach to counterparty credit risk; external audit;
the new accounting standards on financial instrument impairment; regulation and
supervision of inclusive insurance markets; basic capital requirements and marketadjusted valuation for G-SIIs; and the Core principles for effective deposit insurance
systems.

Monitoring implementation of Basel standards in non-BCBS member­
jurisdictions
The FSI annually surveys non-BCBS member jurisdictions on their implementation
of the Basel III framework. The results of this survey are part of the annual BCBS
report to the G20 Leaders. The 2015 survey results showed that 121 countries
worldwide, including BCBS member jurisdictions, had implemented or were in the
process of implementing Basel III.5

Activities of BIS-hosted associations
This section reviews the year’s principal activities of the three associations hosted
by the BIS in Basel.

Financial Stability Board
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates at the international level the financial
stability work of national authorities and international standard-setting bodies, and
develops and promotes financial sector policies to enhance global financial stability.
The FSB’s mandate, membership and framework of committees and management
are set out in its Annual Report. The FSB is chaired by Mark Carney, Governor of the
Bank of England.
The FSB continued its policy work to address the causes of the financial crisis,
increased its work to analyse the implementation and effects of these reforms, and
continued to monitor emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system.

Reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial institutions
The FSB finalised important elements of its policy agenda to address the moral
hazard risks posed by global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs).
Resolution of SIFIs. In November 2015, the FSB published the final Total LossAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) standard to ensure that failing G-SIBs will have sufficient
loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity for authorities to implement an orderly
resolution that mitigates the impact on financial stability, maintains the continuity
of critical bank functions and avoids the use of public funds.
In November 2015, the FSB published Principles for Cross-border Effectiveness
of Resolution Actions, which provides principles on statutory and contractual
mechanisms that jurisdictions should consider including in their legal frameworks
to give cross-border effect to resolution actions. In November 2015, the FSB also
published guidance on cooperation and information-sharing between supervisors
in Crisis Management Groups (CMGs) for G-SIFIs and authorities from jurisdictions
not represented on a CMG where a firm is systemic for their market.
In November 2015, the FSB published a progress report for the G20 on its
ongoing resolution work. The report set out the results of the first round of the
Resolvability Assessment Process (RAP) and ongoing policy work to promote the full

implementation of the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial
Institutions. In the same month, the FSB also issued consultative documents on
funding in resolution and on arrangements to support operational continuity in
resolution, and on effective resolution strategies for systemic insurers. In March
2016, the FSB published its second thematic peer review on resolution regimes for
banks in FSB member jurisdictions.
In July 2015, the FSB announced it would wait to finalise the assessment
methodologies for identifying non-bank non-insurer global systemically important
financial institutions (NBNI G-SIFIs) until work on the financial stability risks posed
by asset management activities was completed. This allowed for further time to
analyse these activities and will inform the decision on further steps to take on the
revised assessment methodology.
The FSB, BCBS, CPMI and IOSCO continued their work to enhance the resilience,
recovery planning and resolvability of central counterparties.
SIFI identification and higher loss absorbency. The FSB published new lists for G-SIBs
and G-SIIs in November 2015. In the same month, the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) consulted on revisions to the G-SII methodology and
changes to the definition of non-traditional, non-insurance (NTNI) activities. Both
efforts will be instrumental for a revised G-SII methodology that can appropriately
address all types of insurance, reinsurance and other financial activities of global
insurers. The 2016 G-SII list is expected to use the agreed new methodology.
In October 2015, the IAIS published the first version of its Higher Loss
Absorbency (HLA) requirement for G-SIIs, which was endorsed by the FSB Plenary
in September.
More intense supervisory oversight. In May 2015, the FSB published a thematic peer
review on supervisory frameworks and approaches for systemically important
banks. The review concluded that national authorities have taken significant steps
to enhance supervisory effectiveness. More work is needed to further enhance
effectiveness, in particular by strengthening cross-border supervisory cooperation.

Improving the OTC derivatives markets
In November 2015, the FSB published its 10th progress report on the
implementation of OTC derivatives market reforms. In the same month, the FSB also
published a thematic peer review on OTC derivatives trade reporting; this report
found that, while good progress has been made in implementing these
requirements, further work needs to be undertaken (including by addressing legal
barriers to reporting and access) to ensure data collected by trade repositories can
be effectively used by regulators.

Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance
Also in November 2015, the FSB published its fifth shadow banking monitoring
report, which included a new activity-based “economic function” approach to
narrow the focus to parts of the non-bank financial sector where shadow banking
risks may arise and may need appropriate policy responses. The report was
published together with a progress report on the FSB’s work on Transforming
Shadow Banking into Resilient Market-based Finance. In the same month, to address
financial stability risks, the FSB also published final policy recommendations for
haircuts on certain non-bank-to-non-bank, non-centrally cleared securities financing
transactions.

152

BIS 86th Annual Report

In November 2015, the FSB also published Standards and Processes for Global
Securities Financing Data Collection and Aggregation, which set out details about
enhanced data collection on securities financing markets to obtain a more timely
and comprehensive perspective on developments in these markets and so detect
financial stability risks.

Measures to reduce misconduct risk
The FSB coordinated several workstreams addressing misconduct in the financial
sector and published a progress report to the G20 in November 2015. The
workstreams included considering whether post-crisis reforms to incentives are
sufficient to address misconduct risks; and whether steps are needed to improve
global standards of conduct in the fixed income, commodity and currency (FICC)
markets, including improvements in the integrity and reliability of benchmarks. A
further update on the use of governance frameworks and various compensation
tools for addressing misconduct risk will be provided by the time of the G20
Leaders’ Summit in September 2016.
In July 2015, the FSB published a progress report on steps being taken by
authorities to reform interest rate benchmarks in key currencies. These included
steps to improve major interest rate benchmarks (such as Libor, Euribor and Tibor),
as well as the development and introduction of near risk-free interest rate
benchmarks in several jurisdictions. The FSB also published a progress report on
reforms to foreign exchange benchmarks in October 2015.

Addressing the decline in correspondent banking
The FSB initiated work to examine the extent and causes of banks’ withdrawal from
correspondent banking and the implications for affected jurisdictions. The resulting
Report to the G20 on actions taken to assess and address the decline in correspondent
banking published in November 2015 presented a four-point action plan that will be
implemented in partnership with other organisations. The work will further examine
the reasons for the decline in correspondent banking relationships and implications
for financial inclusion and financial stability; clarify regulatory expectations, including
through additional guidance by the Financial Action Task Force; support domestic
capacity-building in jurisdictions that are home to affected respondent banks; and
strengthen tools for due diligence by correspondent banks.

Addressing data gaps
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the FSB published their sixth annual
progress report on the implementation of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative in September
2015. The report noted significant progress in addressing the data gaps identified
after the financial crisis. The IMF and FSB proposed a second phase with a five-year
horizon with more specific objectives that promote the regular flow of high-quality
statistics for policy use. This was endorsed by the G20.

Advancing transparency through the Legal Entity Identifier
The objective of the global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system is to provide unique
identification of parties to financial transactions across the globe. Over 415,000
entities in 195 countries have received unique identifiers for financial transactions.
Authorities in several FSB jurisdictions are already using the LEI to support regulatory
actions, as described in the progress report of the LEI Regulatory Oversight

BIS 86th Annual Report

153

Committee (LEI ROC). The FSB is providing secretariat services to the LEI ROC and
will continue to promote LEI uses to support regulatory actions and data quality.

Strengthening accounting standards
The FSB supports the work of the International Forum of Independent Audit
Regulators (IFIAR) to enhance audit quality. In September 2015, it publicly expressed
encouragement for the IFIAR’s work with the big six audit firms to promote greater
consistency of audit quality in G-SIFIs.

Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF)
The EDTF was a private sector initiative to enhance the risk disclosure practices of
major banks. It has issued principles and recommendations for such disclosures and
has conducted three annual surveys on the level and quality of implementation in
the major banks’ annual reports. The last survey was published in December 2015
and showed significant progress in implementing the recommendations.
At the FSB’s request, the EDTF published in December 2015 a report on the
Impact of Expected Credit Loss Approaches on Bank Risk Disclosures, which
recommends changes banks will need to make to their financial disclosures with
the implementation of the new accounting standards for expected credit loss.
The EDTF’s work has now been completed, and the Task Force has been
formally disbanded.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)
In December 2015, the FSB established the TCFD to develop voluntary, consistent
climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing
information to lenders, insurers, investors and other stakeholders. The Task Force
will consider the physical, liability and transition risks associated with climate
change, and what constitutes effective financial disclosures in this area. The FSB
announced the initial membership of the Task Force in January 2016 and presented
its Phase 1 report to the FSB in March.

Corporate funding structures and incentives
The FSB coordinated work to consider the factors that shape the liability structure
of corporates, focusing on the implications for financial stability. The report to the
G20 highlighted the growth of non-financial corporate debt in many countries over
the past 15 years, including an acceleration in emerging economies since the
financial crisis.

Monitoring implementation and the effects of reforms
Implementation monitoring of agreed standards and the analysis of the effects of
the G20 reforms are a key part of the FSB’s work. In November 2015, the FSB
published its first annual report to the G20 on the implementation and effects of
financial regulatory reforms. The report found that implementation progress has
been steady but uneven; that the most tangible effect of the reforms has been to
make the banking sector more resilient; and that this improved resilience has been
achieved while maintaining the overall provision of credit to the real economy.
In addition to periodic progress reports, the FSB monitors the implementation
and effectiveness of international financial standards and policies via its peer review

154

programme. Over the past year, the FSB published country peer reviews of China,
Saudi Arabia and Turkey, as well as a thematic review on supervisory frameworks
and approaches for SIBs in May 2015. During the year, it started work on the
country review of India and a thematic review on shadow banking.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) is the global standardsetting body for deposit insurance systems. IADI contributes to the stability of
financial systems by advancing standards and guidance for effective deposit
insurance systems and promoting international cooperation among deposit
insurers, bank resolution authorities and other safety net organisations.
The number of organisations affiliated with IADI stands at 102, comprising
80 deposit insurers as members, nine central banks and bank supervisors as
associates, and 13 institutional partners. Thus, almost 70% of all jurisdictions with
explicit deposit insurance systems are represented within IADI’s membership.
In 2015, Thomas M Hoenig, Vice President of the US Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, was appointed as IADI’s President and Chair of its Executive Council,
succeeding Jerzy Pruski, President of the Management Board of Poland’s Bank
Guarantee Fund.

Strategic goals
IADI revised its strategic goals for 2015–18, adopting three new objectives: promoting
compliance with the IADI Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems;
advancing deposit insurance research and policy development; and providing IADI
members with technical support to modernise and upgrade their systems.
IADI’s Core Principles are incorporated in the FSB’s Key Standards for Sound
Financial Systems, and are used in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
reviews conducted by the IMF and the World Bank.
After updating the Core Principles in 2014, IADI updated its Core Principles
Assessment Handbook. The Handbook is used for ensuring accurate interpretation
and understanding of each Principle when conducting the assessment process
against IADI standards.
In support of the strategic goals, the Association has undertaken a review of its
governance structure and funding arrangements, with a strong emphasis on
building a long-term funding model that would adequately resource the planned
framework of IADI’s initiatives for policy development and technical assistance.

International conferences and events
IADI’s Third Biennial Research Conference, held in June 2015 at the BIS in Basel,
provided a forum for researchers and safety net practitioners to advance their
knowledge on a wide range of issues facing contemporary deposit insurers.
In September 2015, IADI and the FSI held their fifth annual joint seminar on
bank resolution, crisis management and deposit insurance issues. Since 2008, IADI,
in cooperation with the FSI, has produced eight online tutorials on deposit
insurance systems.
Crisis management, together with the challenges deposit insurers face in
responding to upcoming crises, was the focus of IADI’s 14th Annual Conference,
held in October 2015 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

BIS 86th Annual Report

155

IADI also hosted global and regional seminars in a wide variety of locations, on
topics identified in IADI member survey results, including funding, claims management,
legal frameworks, and Islamic and integrated deposit insurance systems.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is the global standardsetting body for the insurance sector. Its mission is to promote effective and
globally consistent insurance supervision and to contribute to global financial
stability so that policyholders benefit from fair, safe and stable insurance markets.
Victoria Saporta, Director of Financial Policy of the Prudential Regulation Authority
at the Bank of England, chairs the IAIS Executive Committee.

ComFrame
Since 2011, the IAIS has been designing ComFrame, a common framework for the
supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs). It provides a set of
international supervisory requirements focusing on effective group-wide supervision
of IAIGs. These requirements expand upon those in the IAIS Insurance Core
Principles. Field-testing of ComFrame started in 2014 and will continue through
2019, when it is scheduled for formal adoption. Members will begin implementing
it shortly thereafter.
In February 2016, the IAIS completed field-testing of the qualitative requirements
for IAIGs set out in ComFrame. These covered legal and management structures, in
addition to governance and enterprise risk management. Field-testing results will
be taken into account in future drafts for further public consultation later in 2016.

Assessment methodology for global systemically important insurers
Global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs) are insurance entities whose distress
or disorderly failure would cause significant disruption to the global financial
system and economic activity. Throughout 2015 and continuing into 2016, the IAIS
undertook its first three-year review of the 2013 initial assessment methodology
used by the FSB to identify G-SIIs and, in November 2015, issued a consultation
document reflecting improvements and refinements drawn from the application of
the initial assessment methodology. The IAIS is expected to approve a revised
methodology later in 2016.

Global insurance capital standards
In November 2015, the IAIS adopted its initial version of the higher loss absorbency
requirements for G-SIIs, which G20 leaders subsequently endorsed. This followed
Executive Committee approval and FSB endorsement in October 2015.
In September 2015, IAIS workgroups completed the second annual fieldtesting exercise for the development of the first two insurance capital standards –
the basic capital requirement and higher loss absorbency for G-SIIs. These
workgroups have also drafted field-testing packages for launch in May 2016 and
consultation for launch in July 2016.

Insurance Core Principles
Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) developed by the IAIS provide a globally accepted
framework for the regulation and supervision of the insurance sector. In November
2015, the IAIS adopted revisions to Licensing (ICP 4), Suitability of Persons (ICP5),
Corporate Governance (ICP 7), Risk Management and Internal Control (ICP 8),
Group-wide Supervision (ICP 23) and Supervisory Cooperation and Coordination
(ICP 25). These changes followed the comprehensive self-assessments and peer
reviews, taking into account recent developments in group supervision, corporate
governance and risk management, as well as standards and guidance issued by
other standard-setting bodies.

International accounting and auditing
As part of the revisions to Insurance Core Principle 7 adopted in November 2015,
the IAIS strengthened supervisory expectations of insurer boards in overseeing
external audit processes. The IAIS also submitted comments to the International
Accounting and Auditing Standards Board concerning its proposal on “Enhancing
audit quality in the public interest”.

Macroprudential policy and surveillance framework
In January 2016, the IAIS released its 2015 Global Insurance Market Report covering
the global insurance sector from a supervisory perspective with a focus on sector
performance and key risks. This report is a key component of the IAIS macroprudential
policy and surveillance framework. The report found that the global (re)insurance
sector remains stable in the midst of a challenging economic and financial
environment with surging merger and acquisition activity in the sector.

Supporting materials
Over the course of the year, the IAIS published papers on the regulation and
supervision of captive insurers, conduct of business risk and its management, and
conduct of business in inclusive insurance.

Self-assessment and peer reviews
As part of a comprehensive thematic review of the Insurance Core Principles, the
IAIS released its aggregate report on Supervisory Measures in October 2015. This
report included a review of Supervisory Review and Reporting (ICP 9), Preventative
and Corrective Measures (ICP 10) and Enforcement (ICP 11). These assessment
results help identify areas for potential revision and feed into IAIS standard-setting
and implementation efforts.

Multilateral memorandum of understanding
Insurance supervisor signatories to the IAIS Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding
(MMoU) participate in a global framework for cooperation and information
exchange. The memorandum sets the minimum standards required of signatories.
Supervisors participating in the MMoU are in a better position to promote the
financial stability of cross-border insurance operations for the benefit of consumers.
Twelve new signatories joined the MMoU, bringing the number of signatories to
55 jurisdictions representing more than 65% of worldwide premium volume.

Coordinated implementation framework
The Coordinated Implementation Framework guides the implementation of the
IAIS supervisory material work programme. Last year, the IAIS provided online
training for 177 new supervisors from 46 jurisdictions in partnership with the
Financial Stability Institute. It also launched an update of the Core Curriculum with
the World Bank, continued its regional capacity-building programme with the Asian
Development Bank, and collaborated with the Access to Insurance Initiative, to
advance capacity-building in inclusive insurance markets, a key focus for standardsetting bodies under the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.

Economic analysis, research and statistics
The BIS’s economic analysis and research on monetary and financial stability policy
issues are conducted by its Monetary and Economic Department (MED). Economists
are located at the head office in Basel and at the BIS Representative Offices in Hong
Kong SAR and Mexico City. The BIS also compiles and disseminates international
statistics on financial institutions and markets. Through its economic analysis,
research and statistics, the BIS helps to meet the needs of monetary and supervisory
authorities for policy insight and data.

Analysis and research in the Basel Process
Analysis and research at the BIS are the basis of its background notes for meetings,
analytical support for the Basel-based Committees, and the Bank’s own publications.
Research seeks to strike a balance between responsiveness to short-term issues and
proactiveness in identifying what will become key themes in future.
Collaborative efforts with central bank and academic researchers around the
world stimulate broad dialogue on the policy questions that merit deeper study. To
strengthen research collaboration with senior professionals from academia and
research institutions, the BIS in 2015 launched the Alexandre Lamfalussy Senior
Research Fellowship. This fellowship complements the visiting fellows programme
for academic researchers and the Central Bank Research Fellowship (CBRF)
Programme. Moreover, the BIS has set up an Advisory Panel, consisting of
distinguished academics with established reputations, that serves as an independent
sounding board for BIS research and analysis, provides connections between
subject areas and offers new insights on current research topics.
The BIS also organises conferences and workshops to bring together
participants from policy, research and business. The flagship event for central bank
Governors is the BIS Annual Conference. In June 2015, the 14th BIS Annual
Conference focused on financial markets, taking stock of post-crisis lessons about
the way they function and exploring if they were evolving towards a “new normal”.
Moreover, the semiannual meetings of the BIS Research Network provide an
opportunity to discuss current macroeconomic and financial topics.
Most BIS analysis and research is published on the Bank’s website, and in the
Annual Report, the BIS Quarterly Review, BIS Papers and BIS Working Papers. BIS
economists also publish in professional journals and other external publications.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Research topics
Reflecting the Bank’s mission, BIS research centres on monetary and financial
stability. The key areas of research are currently changes in financial intermediation;
new frameworks for monetary and financial stability policy; and the global economy
and spillovers. Under these headings, the specific topics taken up in the year
included the evolution of non-bank financial intermediaries and the implications
for systemic risk; the effectiveness of current monetary policies; pre- and postboom resource misallocations; determinants of global liquidity; and the risk-taking
channel of the exchange rate.
The research on financial intermediation aims at clarifying the interaction
between financial institutions and markets. Analysing the way different intermediaries
operate and markets function is an important foundation for this work. The
perspectives gained help policymakers evaluate changes in the financial system for
financial stability and monetary policies, both nationally and internationally. They
also underpin the monitoring of financial vulnerabilities and cross-border spillovers,
and inform the design of regulation and supervision, crisis management tools and
resolution techniques as well as various aspects of monetary policy frameworks,
including strategy, tactics and day-to-day implementation.
Over the past year, work in this area included research on the behaviour of
asset managers and other non-bank financial intermediaries; the impact of monetary
policy on bank profitability and the portfolio choices of long-term investors; the
determinants of long-term debt issuance; and the implications of negative interest
rates for market functioning.
Research on post-crisis monetary and financial stability policy frameworks aims
to strengthen the analytical foundations of central bank policy. The gap between
the theory and practice of central bank policy has widened as central banks have
adopted increasingly unconventional measures, and the lines between policies
targeting financial, macroeconomic and price stability have become increasingly
blurred.
During the past year, specific projects in this area studied the impact of credit
cycles on resource allocation; leverage and debt service ratios as drivers of financial
cycles; and the effectiveness of macroprudential policies and their relationship with
monetary policy.
Research on the global economy and spillovers focuses on how monetary and
financial stability is affected by the tight real and financial integration of the global
economy. The importance of such spillovers is reflected in the increasingly popular
notion of “global liquidity”, in both academic and policy circles.
One main focus of research in this area during the year was the risk-taking
channel of the exchange rate. Others included policy dilemmas for emerging
economies resulting from dollar borrowing; international reserves and capital flow
dynamics; and the financial stability and macroeconomic implications of foreign
currency borrowing. The BIS international banking statistics provide key information
for these studies.

International statistical initiatives
The BIS’s unique set of international banking and financial statistics underpins the
Basel Process by supporting the analysis of global financial stability. This involves
close cooperation with other financial international organisations, especially
through the BIS’s participation in the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and

BIS 86th Annual Report

159

Financial Statistics (IAG).6 This is the body tasked with coordinating and monitoring
the implementation of the recommendations to address the data gaps revealed by
the financial crisis, in accord with the FSB and IMF proposals to the G20. Following
the completion of the initiative’s first phase in 2015, a second five-year phase is
now under way with the aim of implementing the regular collection and
dissemination of comparable, timely, integrated, high-quality and standardised
statistics for policy use.
To close the data gaps related to international banking activities, the CGFS
approved in 2011–12 enhancements to a key set of BIS data, the international
banking statistics (IBS) reported by central banks under the guidance of the CGFS.
These enhancements, finalised in 2015, have extended the coverage of the
locational and consolidated banking statistics from banks’ international activities to
their domestic positions and the provision of information on banks’ counterparties,
specifically on their location and sector. As part of the second phase, the BIS has
now started work with all reporting countries to close reporting gaps, review
options for improving the consistency between the consolidated IBS and
supervisory data, and support efforts to make data more widely available.
In addition to banking statistics, the BIS is also expanding the variety of the
other statistics published on its website, including property prices, debt securities,
debt service ratios, credit to the private and public sectors, global liquidity, effective
exchange rates, foreign exchange markets, derivatives and payment systems. This
statistical work focuses on long-term financial stability indicators to support the
BIS’s own research agenda as well as the initiatives of the Basel Process and the
G20. It relies extensively on the BIS Data Bank, which contains, in particular, key
economic indicators shared among BIS member central banks.
As part of these efforts, the BIS significantly expanded its statistical releases
with the launch in September 2015 of the BIS Statistical Bulletin, now published
concurrently with the BIS Quarterly Review and accompanied with informative
charts illustrating the latest developments. The new bulletin comprises, in particular,
the enhanced data on international banking and debt securities issuance as well as
the new BIS series on government debt and estimates of debt service ratios for
selected sectors. To complement the enhanced BIS Statistics Warehouse, a search
tool for customised statistical queries was set up: the BIS Statistics Explorer is a new
browsing tool for pre-defined views of the most current data.
Finally, the BIS hosts the International Data Hub, where information about
systemically important financial institutions is stored and analysed on behalf of a
limited number of participating supervisory authorities. The analysis supports
participating supervisors in their engagement with G-SIBs and by enriching the
dialogue between supervisors across jurisdictions. The first phase of this initiative,
covering firms’ credit exposures, was completed in 2013. The second phase, now
under way, involves the gathering of data covering these firms’ funding
dependencies. The third phase will lead to the collection of additional information
on the consolidated balance sheet of individual G-SIBs.

The IAG comprises the BIS, the ECB, Eurostat, the IMF, the OECD, the United Nations and the World
Bank (www.principalglobalindicators.org). These organisations also sponsor the Statistical Data and
Metadata eXchange (SDMX), whose standards the BIS uses for its collection, processing and
dissemination of statistics (www.sdmx.org).

BIS 86th Annual Report

Other areas of international cooperation
The BIS participates in international forums such as the G20 and collaborates with
key international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank Group. The BIS also contributes to the activities of central banks
and regional central bank organisations by participating in their events as well as
occasionally hosting joint events. During the past year, it co-organised events or
collaborated with the following regional organisations on the topics outlined below:
•
CEMLA (Center for Latin American Monetary Studies) – foreign exchange
intervention, financial information, payment and settlement systems, regional
banking integration, and reserves management;
•
EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) – foreign
exchange and other financial markets;
•
FLAR (Latin American Reserve Fund) – reserves management;
•
MEFMI (Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and
Southern Africa) – macroprudential surveillance and reserves management; and
•
SEACEN (South East Asian Central Banks) Research and Training Centre – stress
testing, payment and settlement systems, macroeconomic and monetary policy
management, financial stability and banking supervision.

Financial services
Through its Banking Department, the BIS offers a wide range of financial services
designed to support the reserves management activities of central banks and other
official monetary authorities, and to foster international cooperation in this area.
Some 140 institutions, as well as a number of international organisations, make use
of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of BIS credit intermediation, which
is supported by rigorous internal risk management. Independent control units
reporting directly to the BIS Deputy General Manager monitor and control the
related risks. A compliance and operational risk unit monitors operational risk, while
financial risks – ie credit, liquidity and market risks – are overseen by a risk control
unit that is also responsible for ensuring an integrated approach to risk management.
BIS financial services are provided from two linked trading rooms: one in Basel,
at the Bank’s head office; and one in Hong Kong SAR, at its Representative Office
for Asia and the Pacific.

Scope of services
As an institution owned and governed by central banks, the BIS is well placed to
understand the needs of reserves managers – their primary focus on safety and
liquidity as well as the evolving need to diversify their exposures. To meet those
needs, the BIS offers investments that vary by currency, maturity and liquidity. In
addition, the Bank provides short-term liquidity facilities and extends credit to
central banks, usually on a collateralised basis. Moreover, the Bank can act as
trustee and collateral agent in connection with international financial operations.
Tradable instruments are available in maturities ranging from one week to five
years, in the form of Fixed-Rate Investments at the BIS (FIXBIS), Medium-Term
Instruments (MTIs) and products with embedded optionality (Callable MTIs). These
instruments can be bought or sold throughout the Bank’s dealing hours. Also
offered are money market placements, such as sight/notice accounts and fixedterm deposits.

On 31 March 2016, total deposits stood at SDR 189 billion, of which about 95%
were denominated in currencies and the remainder in gold (see graph).
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers,
thereby providing access to a large liquidity base in the context of their rebalancing
of reserve portfolios. The Bank’s foreign exchange services encompass spot
transactions in major currencies and Special Drawing Rights (SDR), as well as swaps,
outright forwards, options and dual currency deposits (DCDs). In addition, the
Bank provides gold services that include buying and selling, sight accounts, fixedterm deposits, earmarked accounts, quality upgrading, refining and location
exchanges.
The BIS provides asset management products in the form of (i) dedicated
portfolio management mandates tailored to each customer’s preferences; or (ii) BIS
Investment Pools (BISIPs), which are open-end fund structures that allow customers
to invest in a common pool of assets. The BISIP structure is also used for the Asian
Bond Fund (ABF) initiative sponsored by EMEAP to foster the development of local
currency bond markets. Also based on this structure are the following initiatives
developed with a group of advising central banks: the BISIP ILF1 (a US inflationprotected government securities fund); the BISIP CNY (a domestic Chinese
sovereign fixed income fund); and the BISIP KRW (a domestic Korean sovereign
fixed income fund).
The BIS Banking Department hosts global and regional meetings, as well
as seminars and workshops on reserves management issues. These gatherings
facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among reserves managers
and promote the development of investment and risk management capabilities in
central banks and international organisations. The Department also occasionally
supports central banks in reviewing and assessing their reserves management
practices.

Representative Offices
The BIS has a Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (the Asian Office),
located in Hong Kong SAR, and a Representative Office for the Americas (the

162

BIS 86th Annual Report

Americas Office), located in Mexico City. The Representative Offices promote
cooperation and foster the exchange of information and data within each region
by organising meetings, supporting regional institutions and Basel-based
committees, and conducting research. The Asian Office also provides banking
services to the region’s monetary authorities. It is also through the office in Hong
Kong that the Financial Stability Institute delivers a programme of meetings and
seminars in the region that are closely tailored to local priorities.
As part of the overall BIS research programme, economists in the Representative
Offices work with academics from around the world. In addition, both offices have
developed secondment programmes to deepen research collaboration with
member central banks in their respective regions. Papers based on research carried
out in the Representative Offices, and published in BIS reports or external journals,
have been used to inform policy discussions in various central bank meetings.

The Asian Office
The Asian Office’s research activities are guided by the Asian Consultative Council
(ACC), comprising the Governors of the 12 BIS member central banks in the AsiaPacific region.7 Governor Graeme Wheeler of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
succeeded Governor Amando Tetangco of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as the Council’s
Chair in April 2016.
Economists in the Asian Office carried out research on two themes endorsed
by the ACC. On the monetary policy side, the theme was ”Expanding the boundaries
of monetary policy in Asia and the Pacific”. The highlights of the research findings
were discussed at a conference held in Jakarta in August 2015. On the financial
stability side, the theme for the 2016 research conference is “Financial systems and
the real economy”.
At an ACC meeting in February 2016, the Council endorsed a new research
theme on exchange rates. Topics such as the effect of currency movements on
output and inflation and the risk-taking channel of exchange rates will be covered.
The Asian Office organised nine high-level BIS policy meetings. Most of these
were organised jointly with a central bank or with either the Executives’ Meeting of
East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) or the South East Asian Central Banks
(SEACEN).
In February 2016, the ACC convened with other Governors from around the
world in a meeting that combined the Special Governors’ Meeting and BIS
bimonthly meeting. This was held in Shanghai with the People’s Bank of China as
host. For the sixth consecutive year, the event included a roundtable with the chief
executive officers of large financial institutions. The discussions covered issues
arising from asset valuations in financial markets and the possible impact of digital
technologies on the financial industry.
Other policy discussions organised by the Asian Office included the abovementioned research conference in Jakarta; the 18th meeting of the Working Party
on Monetary Policy in Asia, hosted by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in May 2015 in
Manila; the 10th Meeting on Monetary Policy Operating Procedures, held in June
2015 in Hong Kong; a meeting of the EMEAP-BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange
Markets, held in the same month in Hong Kong; the Workshop on Financial Systems
and the Real Economy, held in July 2015 in Hong Kong; the SEACEN-BIS Exco
Seminar, held in October in Port Moresby; the Meeting of the EMEAP-BIS Forum on

The Americas Office
The Americas Office conducts its cooperative activities under the guidance of the
Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA), comprising the Governors of eight BIS
member central banks in the region.8 Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of
Canada, has chaired the CCA since January 2016, succeeding José Darío Uribe,
Governor of the Bank of the Republic, Colombia. The work of the Americas Office
centres on three main areas: research, central bank operations and financial stability.
It also engages in outreach activities.
Research activities are organised mainly through an annual research conference
and research networks, under the direction of a Scientific Committee. In April 2015,
the Bank of Mexico hosted the Sixth Annual CCA research conference on “Detecting
vulnerabilities, monetary policy normalisation and policy frameworks” in Mexico City.
The new research network on “The commodity cycle: macroeconomic and financial
stability implications” held a workshop in October 2015, hosted by the Americas Office
in Mexico City. The network is expected to conclude its work by the end of 2016.
The Consultative Group of Directors of Operations (CGDO) holds regular
teleconferences to exchange views on financial market developments and central
bank operations. At their annual meeting, hosted by the Central Reserve Bank of
Peru in Lima in November 2015, the CGDO discussed derivatives markets in the
region. This meeting took place back to back with that of the Working Party on
Markets in Latin America, which brought together the members of the CGDO, the
BIS Markets Committee and private sector participants. A new study group has
been set up to analyse liquidity in forex markets in the Americas.
The Consultative Group of Directors of Financial Stability (CGDFS) deals with
financial stability issues of interest to the CCA members, focusing on research. Its
annual meeting took place in September 2015 in Vancouver, hosted by the Bank of
Canada, where each central bank’s main topics of interest were reviewed. Group
members were also updated on the working group studying the effectiveness of
macroprudential policies based on credit registry data. The working group held a
workshop in Mexico City in August 2015, hosted by the Americas Office, and is
expected to conclude its work by mid-2016.
Another activity related to financial stability was the Second Roundtable of
CCA Governors and chief executive officers of large financial institutions, which was
held in May 2015 in Cancún, hosted by the Bank of Mexico. The topics discussed
included the challenges arising from falling commodity prices, corporate leverage,
liquidity strains and the potential effects of regulation on the financial sector.
As for outreach activities, in August 2015 the Americas Office co-organised
with CEMLA a roundtable in Paraguay on the changing patterns of financial
intermediation. Furthermore, it organised two sessions at the Annual Meeting of
LACEA (Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association), the main economic
academic conference in the region.

The General Meeting of BIS member central banks
Sixty central banks and monetary authorities are currently members of the BIS and
have rights of voting and representation at General Meetings. The Annual General
Meeting (AGM) is held no later than four months after 31 March, the end of the BIS
financial year. The AGM approves the annual report and the accounts of the Bank,
decides on the distribution of a dividend and elects the Bank’s auditor.

The BIS Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for determining the strategic and policy direction of the
BIS, supervising Management and fulfilling the specific tasks given to it by the
Bank’s Statutes. The Board meets at least six times a year.
The Board may have up to 21 members, including six ex officio Directors
comprising the central bank Governors of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
United Kingdom and the United States. Each ex officio member may appoint
another member of the same nationality. Nine Governors of other member central
banks may be elected to the Board.9 The Board elects a Chairman from among its
members for a three-year term and may elect a Vice-Chairman. In September 2015,
the Board elected Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, as its
Chairman, to succeed Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France. Two months
later, Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, was elected as the
Bank’s Vice-Chairman, also with effect from November 2015.
Four advisory committees, established pursuant to Article 43 of the Bank’s
Statutes, assist the Board in its work:
•
The Administrative Committee reviews key areas of the Bank’s administration,
such as budget and expenditures, human resources policies and information
technology. The Committee meets at least four times a year. Its Chairman is
Haruhiko Kuroda.
•
The Audit Committee meets with internal and external auditors, as well as with
the compliance unit. Among its duties is the examination of matters related to
the Bank’s internal control systems and financial reporting. The Committee
meets at least four times a year and is chaired by Stephen S Poloz.
•
The Banking and Risk Management Committee reviews and assesses the Bank’s
financial objectives, the business model for BIS banking operations and the risk
management frameworks of the BIS. The Committee meets at least once a year.
Its Chairman is Stefan Ingves.
•
The Nomination Committee deals with the appointment of members of the BIS
Executive Committee and meets on an ad hoc basis. It is chaired by the Board’s
Chairman, Jens Weidmann.

BIS budget policy
Management begins preparing the annual BIS expenditure budget by establishing
an overall business plan and financial framework. Within that context, business
areas specify their detailed plans and resource requirements. The process of
reconciling detailed business plans, objectives and overall resources culminates in
a draft budget, which must be approved by the Board before the start of the
financial year.
The budget distinguishes between administrative and capital expenditures. In
2015/16, these expenditures collectively amounted to CHF 309.7 million. The Bank’s
overall administrative expense amounted to CHF 285.2 million.11 Management and
staff expense – including remuneration, pensions, and health and accident insurance
– amounts to around 70% of administrative expenditure, comparable to the ratio
seen in organisations similar to the BIS. New staff positions were added during
the year in accordance with the Bank’s business plan, which emphasised mainly
economic research and the Basel Process.
The other major categories of administrative spending are information
technology (IT), buildings and equipment, and general operational costs, each
accounting for about 10%.
Capital spending, relating mainly to buildings and IT investment, can vary
significantly from year to year depending on projects in progress. For 2015/16,
capital expenditure amounted to CHF 24.5 million.

BIS remuneration policy
At the end of the 2015/16 financial year, the BIS employed 632 staff members12
from 58 countries. The jobs performed by staff members are classified into job
grades associated with a structure of salary ranges. The salaries of individual staff
members move within the ranges of the structure on the basis of performance.
Every three years, a comprehensive survey benchmarks BIS salaries against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments, with adjustments
taking place as of 1 July in the following year. In benchmarking, the Bank focuses
on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly qualified staff.
11

The financial statements report a total administrative expense of CHF 359.8 million. That figure
consists of the CHF 285.2 million actual administrative expense reported here plus CHF 74.6 million
of financial accounting adjustments for post-employment benefit obligations. This additional
expense is not included in the budget for the coming financial year because it depends on actuarial
valuations as at 31 March, which in turn are not finalised until April, after the budget has been set
by the Board.

12

This corresponds to 602.1 full-time equivalent positions. At the end of the 2014/15 financial year,
the Bank employed 623 staff members, corresponding to 600.1 full-time equivalent positions.
Including positions related to hosted organisations and not funded by the Bank, the number of
staff was 668 in 2014/15 and 683 in 2015/16.

BIS 86th Annual Report

The analysis takes into account the differing rates of taxation on compensation at
the surveyed institutions.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is adjusted
as of 1 July on the basis of Switzerland’s inflation rate and the weighted average
real wage development in industrial countries. As of 1 July 2015, this adjustment
produced an increase of 0.65% in the salary structure.
The salaries of senior officials are also regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. As of 1 July 2015,
the annual remuneration of senior officials, before expatriation allowances, is based
on the salary structure of CHF 743,410 for the General Manager;13 CHF 629,040 for
the Deputy General Manager; and CHF 571,850 for Heads of Department.
BIS staff members have access to a contributory health insurance plan and a
contributory defined benefit pension plan. At the Bank’s headquarters, non-Swiss
staff members recruited from abroad, including senior officials, are entitled to an
expatriation allowance as well as an education allowance for their children, subject
to certain conditions.
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members of the
Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place at regular intervals. The total
fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors was CHF 1,143,784 as of
1 April 2016. In addition, Board members receive an attendance fee for each Board
meeting in which they participate. Assuming that the full Board is represented in all
Board meetings, the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to CHF 1,065,120.

Financial activities and results
The Bank’s balance sheet
The Bank’s balance sheet increased by SDR 14.5 billion over the year, following a
decrease of SDR 5.7 billion in 2014/15. The balance sheet total on 31 March 2016
was SDR 231.4 billion.
Deposits, primarily from central banks, constitute the largest share of the Bank’s
liabilities. About 95% of the deposits are denominated in currencies, with the
remainder in gold. On 31 March 2016, total deposits amounted to SDR 189.0 billion,
compared with SDR 186.7 billion at the end of March 2015.
Currency deposits at 31 March 2016 stood at SDR 178.8 billion, which was
SDR 1.9 billion higher than at the previous year-end. Notwithstanding this increase,
deposits held during 2015/16 were on average SDR 14 billion lower than in the
previous financial year. The currency composition of deposits remained stable, with
deposits in US dollars at 76%, in euros at 12% and in sterling at 7%. Gold deposits
stood at SDR 10.2 billion on 31 March 2016, an increase of SDR 370 million over the
financial year.
Funds received from deposit liabilities are invested in assets that are managed
in a conservative manner. At 31 March 2016, 52% of total assets comprised
government and other securities or treasury bills. Reverse repurchase agreements
(primarily with commercial banks using sovereign bonds as collateral) made up a
further 24%, with unsecured commercial bank assets and gold accounting for 9%
and 5%, respectively. The gold balances include 104 tonnes in the Bank’s own
investment portfolio.

In addition to the basic salary, the General Manager receives an annual representation allowance
and enhanced pension rights.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Financial performance
Operating profit
The BIS’s financial results for 2015/16 were shaped by continuing low interest rates
together with higher volatility in key financial markets. This environment led to
lower interest income on the Bank’s own fund investment assets, and while the net
interest margin on the customer banking business improved, this was on a lower
level of deposits and in a more volatile environment. As a result, overall net interest
and valuation income decreased by 20% to SDR 525.9 million.
The Bank recorded a foreign exchange loss of SDR 1.2 million, compared with a
gain in the previous financial year of SDR 38.8 million, while net fee and commission
income was relatively stable at SDR 5.1 million. The Bank’s administrative expense,
which is denominated mainly in Swiss francs, amounted to CHF 359.8 million, 1.0%
higher than in the previous year. In SDR terms, however, the expenditure was 2.7%
higher, at SDR 265.4 million, owing to the Swiss franc’s appreciation. Depreciation
was SDR 15.5 million, bringing the total operating expense for 2015/16 to
SDR 280.9 million.
As a result of these developments, the operating profit, at SDR 248.9 million,
was 41% lower than last year.

Net profit and total comprehensive income
Net profit comprises operating profit plus the realised gains, or losses, from sales of
gold and securities held in the Bank’s own fund portfolios. During the year, the
Bank sold 4 tonnes of its own gold, realising a gain of SDR 84.3 million. In addition,
the Bank’s own funds securities portfolio produced realised gains of SDR 79.7 million
when securities were sold as part of the regular rebalancing to benchmarks. As a
result, net profit for 2015/16 was SDR 412.9 million (2014/15: SDR 542.9 million),
representing a return of 2.3% on average equity (2014/15: 3.0%).
Other comprehensive income includes unrealised valuation movements on the
Bank’s own gold and investment securities as well as re-measurements of the
actuarial liabilities for post-employment benefit obligations. The valuation of the
Bank’s own gold decreased by SDR 36.4 million following the sale of 4 tonnes,
partly offset by a 1.9% increase in the SDR gold price. In addition, the Bank recorded
a revaluation gain of SDR 16.8 million on its investment securities, reflecting
marginally lower interest rates. There was a loss on the re-measurement of defined
benefit obligations of SDR 162.2 million. As a result, total comprehensive income,
which combines net profit and other comprehensive income, was SDR 231.1 million
for 2015/16.

Allocation and distribution of profit
Proposed dividend
Consistent with the BIS’s dividend policy, it is proposed to declare a dividend of
SDR 215 per share for the financial year 2015/16. The dividend is payable on
558,125 shares, and will result in a total payment of SDR 120.0 million. After
payment of the dividend, SDR 292.9 million would be available for allocation to
reserves.

BIS 86th Annual Report

171

Proposed allocation of net profit for 2015/16
In accordance with Article 51 of the BIS Statutes, the Board of Directors recommends
that the General Meeting allocate the 2015/16 net profit of SDR 412.9 million in the
following manner:
(a) SDR 120.0 million to be paid as a dividend of SDR 215 per share;
(b) SDR 14.6 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund; and
(c) SDR 278.3 million, representing the remainder of the available profit, to be
transferred to the free reserve fund.

Independent auditor
Election of the auditor
In accordance with Article 46 of the BIS Statutes, the Annual General Meeting is
invited to elect an independent auditor for the ensuing year and to fix the auditor’s
remuneration. The Board policy is to rotate the auditor on a regular basis. The
financial year ended 31 March 2016 was the fourth consecutive year of Ernst &
Young’s term as auditor.

Report of the auditor
The BIS financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 have been audited
by Ernst & Young, who confirm that they give a true and fair view of the Bank’s
financial position and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year
then ended. The audit report can be found on page 246.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is an
international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930 as well
as the Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes.
The headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2,
4002 Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific), and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its Statutes,
are to promote cooperation among central banks, to provide
additional facilities for international financial operations and to
act as trustee or agent for international financial settlements. In
the course of its activities, the Bank accepts deposits from
customers, which it then invests. The Bank also invests its own
equity.
Sixty central banks are currently members of the Bank. The
governance and management of the BIS are discussed in “The
BIS: mission, activities, governance and financial results” in this
Annual Report.

Accounting policies

All figures in these financial statements are presented in SDR
millions unless otherwise stated. Amounts are subject to
rounding and consequently there may be small differences
both within and between disclosures.

2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
As currently calculated, one SDR is equivalent to the sum of
USD 0.660, EUR 0.423, JPY 12.1 and GBP 0.111. The composition
of the SDR is subject to periodic review and following a review
by the IMF during 2015, changes will be made to the SDR
basket effective from 1 October 2016, including the addition of
the Chinese renminbi to the basket.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at the
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other assets
and liabilities and profits and losses are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of transactions are
included as net foreign exchange gains or losses in the profit
and loss account.

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise stated.

3. Presentation of interest

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements recognise all assets and liabilities that
are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the economic
benefits, as well as any rights and obligations, lie with the Bank.
As part of its activities, the BIS undertakes financial transactions
in its own name but for the economic benefit of other parties.
These include transactions on a custodial or agency basis, such
as those undertaken on behalf of investment entities operated
by the Bank and on behalf of the staff pension fund, which do
not have separate legal personality from the BIS. Unless otherwise
stated, such transactions are not included in these financial
statements.
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Bank’s
Management to make assumptions and use estimates to arrive
at reported amounts. In doing so, Management exercises
judgment based on reliable information. Actual results could
differ significantly from these estimates.
The notes to the financial statements containing the areas of
estimation uncertainty considered to require critical judgment
and which have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements are: note 12, “Postemployment benefit obligations”; note 28, “Fair value hierarchy”;
and note 31, “Contingent liabilities”.

BIS 86th Annual Report

In the profit and loss account, interest income includes
“negative” interest on liabilities while interest expense includes
“negative” interest on assets. Interest on derivatives is presented
as interest income. Notes to the financial statements separately
analyse components of interest income and interest expense.
The presentation of prior year items has been amended to
reflect this practice.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition, the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•

Available for sale financial assets

•

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the nature
of the financial instrument and the purpose for which it was
entered into, as described in Section 5 below.

183

The resulting designation of each financial instrument determines
the accounting methodology that is applied, as described in
the accounting policies below. Where the financial instrument
is designated as held at fair value through profit and loss, the
Bank does not subsequently change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of portfolios:

7. Notice accounts
Notice accounts are short-term monetary assets, including
balances at futures clearing brokers. These typically have notice
periods of three days or less and are included under the
balance sheet heading “Loans and advances”. They are
considered cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement
of cash flows.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as loans and receivables. They are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest.
Interest is included in interest income on an accruals basis.

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and related
banking assets and derivatives.

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold on
behalf of its customers. In this business, the Bank is exposed to
credit and market risks. The extent of these exposures is limited
by the Bank’s risk management approach.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days or
less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in its
banking portfolios (other than cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, and sight and notice deposit account
liabilities) as held at fair value through profit and loss. The use
of fair values in the currency banking portfolios is described in
Section 9 below.

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
They are included in the balance sheet at their principal value
plus accrued interest. Interest is included in interest expense on
an accruals basis.

All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated as
loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

B. Investment portfolios
These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.
The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR, which
are managed by comparison to a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
Currency assets in investment portfolios, with the exception of
cash and notice accounts (Sections 6 and 7 below) and those in
more actively traded portfolios, are designated as available for
sale.
The currency investment assets maintained in more actively
traded portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated
as held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The Bank’s
own gold holdings are designated as available for sale.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts as a
market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities. As a
result of this activity, the Bank incurs realised profits and losses
on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies, the
market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an overall
fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in its currency banking portfolios. The realised and
unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are
thus largely offset by realised and unrealised losses or profits
on the related currency banking assets and derivatives, or on
other currency deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would otherwise
arise from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios as
held at fair value through profit and loss.

6. Cash and sight accounts
Cash and sight accounts are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest where applicable.

184

BIS 86th Annual Report

10. Securities purchased under resale
agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan
transactions by which the Bank lends cash and receives an
irrevocable commitment from the counterparty to return the
cash, plus interest, at a specified date in the future. As part of
these agreements, the Bank receives collateral in the form of
securities to which it has full legal title, but must return
equivalent securities to the counterparty at the end of the
agreement, subject to the counterparty’s repayment of the
cash. As the Bank does not acquire the risks or rewards
associated with ownership of these collateral securities, they are
not recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
The collateralised loans relating to securities purchased under
resale agreements are currency assets. The accounting
treatment is determined by whether the transaction involves
currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
(Section 11 below) or currency investment assets available for
sale (Section 13 below).

13. Currency investment assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.
The Bank designates as available for sale all of the relevant
assets in its currency investment portfolios, except for those
assets in the Bank’s more actively traded investment portfolios.
Available for sale investment assets are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in the profit and loss account under “Interest income”
on an effective interest rate basis.
After trade date, the currency investment assets are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised movements included in the securities
revaluation account, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of available for sale
securities”. Realised profits on disposal are included in the profit
and loss account under “Net gain on sales of available for sale
securities”.

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss

14. Short positions in currency assets

Currency assets include treasury bills, securities purchased
under resale agreements, loans and advances, and government
and other securities.

Short positions in currency assets are included in the balance
sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at fair value on a
trade date basis.

As described in Section 9 above, the Bank designates all of the
relevant assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. These currency assets are initially
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and discounts
received are included in the profit and loss account under
“Interest income” on an effective interest rate basis. After initial
measurement, the currency assets are revalued to fair value,
with all realised and unrealised movements in fair value
included under “Net valuation movement”.

12. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair value
through profit and loss

15. Gold
Gold comprises gold bar assets held in custody at central banks
and sight accounts denominated in gold. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on a
settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold are
treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 17 below.

All currency deposit liabilities, with the exception of sight and
notice deposit account liabilities, are designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in the
balance sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest to
be paid and amortisation of premiums received and discounts
paid are included under the profit and loss account heading
“Interest expense” on an effective interest rate basis.
After initial measurement, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised movements
in fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

BIS 86th Annual Report

16. Gold loans
Gold loans comprise fixed-term gold loans. Gold loans are
included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis at their
weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and USD
exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest.

185

Accrued interest on gold loans is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest income” on an effective interest rate
basis.

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposits and
related gold banking assets
The Bank designates gold loans in its banking portfolios as
loans and receivables and gold deposits as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost. The gold derivatives included in
the portfolios are designated as held at fair value through profit
and loss.
Gains or losses on derivative transactions in gold are included
in the profit and loss account under “Net foreign exchange
movement” as net transaction gains or losses.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in gold
in the banking portfolios are included under “Net foreign
exchange movement” as net translation gains or losses.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold investment
assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and accounted
for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment assets
over their deemed cost are taken to the gold revaluation
account in equity, which is reported under the balance sheet
heading “Other equity accounts”. The movement in fair value is
included in the statement of comprehensive income under the
heading “Net movement on revaluation of gold investment
assets”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when the
Bank changed its functional and presentation currency from
the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is approximately
SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of USD 208 per ounce
that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a decision by the
Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the 31 March 2003
exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment assets
are included in the profit and loss account as “Net gain on sales
of gold investment assets”.

186

18. Gold deposits
Gold deposits comprise unallocated sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks.
Unallocated gold deposits provide customers with a general
claim on the Bank for delivery of gold of the same weight and
quality as that delivered by the customer to the Bank, but do
not provide the right to specific gold bars. Unallocated gold
deposits are included in the balance sheet on a trade date basis
at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and
USD exchange rate into SDR) plus accrued interest. Accrued
interest on gold deposits is included in the profit and loss
account under “Interest expense” on an effective interest rate
basis.
Allocated (or “earmarked”) gold deposits provide depositors
with a claim for delivery of the specific gold bars deposited by
the customer with the Bank on a custody basis. Beneficial
ownership and risk remain with the customer. As such, allocated
gold deposit liabilities and the related gold bar assets are not
included on the Bank’s balance sheet. They are disclosed as offbalance sheet items (see note 26).

19. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase
agreements”) are recognised as collateralised deposit
transactions by which the Bank receives cash and provides an
irrevocable commitment to return the cash, plus interest, at a
specified date in the future. As part of these agreements, the
BIS transfers legal title of collateral securities to the counterparty.
At the end of the contract the counterparty must return
equivalent securities to the Bank, subject to the Bank’s
repayment of the cash. Because the BIS retains the risks and
rewards associated with ownership of these securities, they
continue to be recognised as assets in the Bank’s balance sheet.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with currency
assets available for sale, the collateralised deposit transaction is
designated as a financial liability measured at amortised cost.
Where the repurchase agreement is associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through profit
and loss, the collateralised deposit transaction is designated as
a financial instrument held at fair value through profit and loss.
The collateralised deposits relating to securities sold under
repurchase agreements are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis. The accrual of interest is included
in the profit and loss account under “Interest expense” on an
effective interest rate basis. After initial measurement, the
transactions designated as held at fair value through profit and
loss are revalued to fair value with all unrealised movements in
fair value included under “Net valuation movement”.

BIS 86th Annual Report

20. Derivatives

22. Impairment of financial assets

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market risk
or for trading purposes. They are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.

Financial assets, other than those designated as held at fair
value through profit and loss, are assessed for indications of
impairment at each balance sheet date. A financial asset is
impaired when there is objective evidence that the estimated
future cash flows of the asset have been reduced as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the asset. Evidence of impairment could include significant
financial difficulty, default or probable bankruptcy / financial
reorganisation of the counterparty or issuer.

Derivatives are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis. Where applicable, the accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums and discounts are included in the
profit and loss account under “Interest income” on an effective
interest rate basis.
After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with all
realised and unrealised movements in value included under
“Net valuation movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities, depending
on whether the contract has a positive or a negative fair value
for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host contract
which is not accounted for as held at fair value through profit
and loss, it is separated from the host contract for accounting
purposes and treated as though it were a standalone derivative
as described above.

Impairment losses are recognised to the extent that a decline in
fair value below amortised cost is considered significant or
prolonged. Impairment of currency assets is included in the
profit and loss account under “Net valuation movement”, with
impairment of gold loans included under “Interest income”. If
the amount of the impairment loss decreases in a subsequent
period, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
through profit and loss to the extent that the carrying amount
of the investment does not exceed that which it would have
been had the impairment not been recognised.

23. Accounts receivable and accounts payable

21. Valuation policy
The Bank’s designation of each financial instrument determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. The majority of
the financial instruments on the balance sheet are included
at fair value. The BIS defines fair value as the exit price of
an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active markets
as the best evidence of fair value. Where no published price
quotations exist, the BIS determines fair values using a valuation
technique appropriate to the particular financial instrument.
Such valuation techniques may involve using market prices of
recent arm’s length market transactions in similar instruments
or may make use of financial models. Where financial models
are used, the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs as appropriate, and relies as little as possible on
its own estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.
The Bank values its positions at their exit price, so that assets
are valued at the bid price and liabilities at the offer price.
Derivative financial instruments are valued on a bid-offer basis,
with valuation reserves, where necessary, included in derivative
financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities that are not
valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

BIS 86th Annual Report

Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally very
short-term amounts relating to the settlement of financial
transactions. They are initially recognised at fair value and
subsequently included in the balance sheet at amortised cost.

24. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is capitalised
and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:
•

Buildings – 50 years

•

Building installations and machinery – 15 years

•

Information technology equipment – up to 4 years

•

Other equipment – 4 to 10 years

The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and equipment.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the
lower value.

187

25. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of events arising before the
balance sheet date and it is probable that economic resources
will be required to settle the obligation, provided that a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Best
estimates and assumptions are used when determining the
amount to be recognised as a provision.

26. Taxation
The Bank’s special legal status in Switzerland is set out
principally in its Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss
Federal Council. Under the terms of this document the Bank is
exempted from virtually all direct and indirect taxes at both
federal and local government level in Switzerland.
Similar agreements exist with the government of the People’s
Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong Kong SAR and
with the Mexican government for the Americas Office.
However, some income and gains received by the Bank may be
subject to tax imposed in the country of origin. Such income
and gains are recognised on a gross basis with the corresponding
tax recognised as an expense.

The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the sum of the current service cost of the benefits accruing for
the year under the scheme, and interest at the discount rate on
the net of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of
the fund assets. Past service costs from plan amendments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. Gains and losses
arising from re-measurement of the obligations, such as
experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is different
from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes
in actuarial assumptions are charged to other comprehensive
income in the year in which the re-measurement is applied.
They are not subsequently included in profit and loss in future
years.

B. Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit arrangement
for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined benefit obligation
and amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect
of the Directors’ pension arrangement are calculated on a
similar basis to that used for the staff pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health and
accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability, benefit
obligation and amount charged to the profit and loss account
in respect of the health and accident benefit arrangement are
calculated on a similar basis to that used for the staff pension
fund.

27. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit arrangements,
respectively, for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions, and health
and accident insurance for current and former staff members.
An independent actuarial valuation is performed annually for
each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions
The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without a separate
legal personality from the BIS, out of which benefits are paid.
The fund assets are administered by the Bank for the sole
benefit of current and former members of staff who participate
in the arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.

28. Statement of cash flows
The Bank’s statement of cash flows is prepared using an indirect
method. It is based on the movements in the Bank’s balance
sheet, adjusted for changes in financial transactions awaiting
settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight and notice
accounts with banks, which are very short-term financial assets
that typically have notice periods of three days or less.

The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on the
present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the fund assets, both at the balance sheet date. The
defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined from the estimated future cash
outflows. The rate used to discount the cash flows is determined
by the Bank based on the market yield of highly rated corporate
debt securities in Swiss francs which have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related liability.

3. Currency assets
Currency assets comprise the following products:
Treasury bills are short-term debt securities issued by governments on a discount basis.
Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) are recognised as collateralised loan transactions. Interest
receivable on the transaction is fixed at the start of the agreement. During the term of the agreement the Bank monitors the fair value of
the loan and related collateral securities, and may call for additional collateral (or be required to return collateral) based on movements in
market value.
Loans and advances comprise fixed-term loans to commercial banks, advances and notice accounts. Advances relate to committed and
uncommitted standby facilities which the Bank provides for its customers. Notice accounts are very short-term financial assets, typically
having a notice period of three days or less.
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public sector institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, fixed and floating rate bonds, covered bonds and
asset-backed securities.

4. Derivative financial instruments
The main types of derivative instruments used by the Bank for economic hedging and trading purposes are:
Interest rate and bond futures are contractual agreements to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest rates or bond prices
at a future date. Futures contracts are settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin payments are settled by cash or marketable
securities.
Currency and gold options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to either
buy (call option) or sell (put option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration,
the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps are bilateral contractual agreements to exchange cash flows related
to currencies, gold or interest rates (for example, fixed rate for floating rate). Cross-currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of
cash flows related to a combination of interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Except for certain currency and gold swaps and crosscurrency interest rate swaps, no exchange of principal takes place.
Currency and gold forwards are bilateral contractual agreements involving the exchange of foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.
Forward rate agreements are bilateral interest rate forward contracts that result in cash settlement at a future date for the difference
between a contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.
Swaptions are bilateral options under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a currency or
interest rate swap at a predetermined price by or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a premium from the purchaser.
The Bank sells products to its customers which contain embedded derivatives (see note 8). The gold currency options embedded in gold
dual currency deposits are included within derivatives as currency and gold options.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts in its name, including where the economic benefit lies with a third party. In such circumstances,
the Bank recognises both an external contract and an exactly offsetting derivative transaction with the beneficial party.

of SDR 0.2 million (2015: nil). The amount of retired assets removed from the historical cost and accumulated depreciation for the year
ended 31 March 2016 was SDR 5.2 million (2015: SDR 39.6 million).

7. Gold deposits
Gold deposit liabilities placed with the Bank originate entirely from central banks. They are all designated as financial liabilities measured
at amortised cost.

192

BIS 86th Annual Report

8. Currency deposits
Currency deposits comprise the following products:
Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three days or less.
Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate investments at the Bank issued with initial quarterly maturities of between one and 10 years.
Callable MTIs (CMTIs) are MTIs that are callable at the option of the Bank at an exercise price of par. At 31 March 2016 all options on
outstanding CMTIs had expired (in 2015 all options on CMTIs had expired). The balance sheet total for CMTIs includes the fair value of the
embedded interest rate option.
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the Bank for any maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the Bank with maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate is reset in line with prevailing
market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the Bank, typically with an initial maturity of less than one year.
Dual Currency Deposits (DCDs) are fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank. The balance sheet total for DCDs includes the fair value of the embedded foreign
exchange option. These deposits all mature between April 2016 and May 2016 (2015: in April 2015 and June 2015).
The Bank acts as the sole market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay some of these financial
instruments at fair value, in whole or in part, at one to two business days’ notice.
The amount the Bank is contractually obliged to pay at maturity in respect of its total currency deposits including interest accrued to
31 March 2016 is SDR 178,433.9 million (2015: SDR 176,649.4 million).
Sight and notice deposit accounts are included on an amortised cost basis, while all other deposits are included at their fair value.

12. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A defined benefit pension arrangement for its staff in the event of retirement, disability or death. Under this arrangement, benefits accrue
according to years of participation and pensionable remuneration. These benefits are paid out of a fund, without separate legal personality.
Contributions are made to this fund by the Bank and by staff and the fund is the beneficial owner of assets on which it receives a return.
These assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of participants in the arrangement. Except as shown in this note, these assets
are not recognised as assets of the Bank. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum service period of 49 months.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident benefit arrangement for its staff and their dependents. Employees who leave the
Bank after becoming eligible for early retirement benefits from the pension arrangement are eligible for post-employment health and
accident benefits.
All three arrangements operate in Swiss francs and are valued annually by an independent actuary. During 2016/17, the Bank expects to
make contributions of SDR 33.0 million to its post-employment arrangements.

I. Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions
The Bank is exposed to risks from these obligations and arrangements including investment risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk,
longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment risk is the risk that plan assets will not generate returns at the expected level.
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads.
A decrease in interest rates will increase the present value of these obligations. However, in the case of the staff pension arrangement this
may be offset, either fully or partly, by an increase in value of the interest-bearing securities held by the fund.
Foreign exchange risk is the exposure of the post-employment benefit obligations to adverse movements in exchange rates between the
Swiss franc, which is the operating currency of the post-employment benefit arrangements, and the SDR, which is the functional currency
of the Bank.
Longevity risk is the risk that actual outcomes differ from actuarial estimates of life expectancy.
Salary risk is the risk that higher than expected salary rises increase the cost of providing a salary-related pension.

14. Statutory reserves
The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s annual net profit, by the Annual General Meeting at the proposal of the Board of
Directors, to three specific reserve funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and the special dividend reserve fund; the
remainder of the net profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated to the free reserve fund.
Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at 10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 5% of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently must be allocated to the
general reserve fund.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special dividend reserve fund,
which shall be available, in case of need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the
Bank’s net profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally transferred to the free
reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of the Bank’s shares are allocated to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully funded, with the
remainder being credited to the general reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses incurred by the Bank. In
the event of liquidation of the Bank, the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the liabilities of the Bank and the costs of
liquidation) would be divided among the Bank’s shareholders.
The table below analyses the movements in the Bank’s statutory reserves over the last two years:

Gold bars held under earmark arrangements comprise specific gold bars which have been deposited with the Bank on a custody basis. They
are included at their weight in gold (translated at the gold market price and the USD exchange rate into SDR). At 31 March 2016 gold bars
held under earmark amounted to 443 tonnes of gold (2015: 443 tonnes).
Portfolio management mandates include BIS Investment Pools (BISIPs) and dedicated mandates.
The BISIPs are a range of open-ended investment funds created by the Bank and managed using entities that do not have a separate legal
personality from the Bank. The Bank has an agency relationship with the BISIPs, such that the assets of the BISIPs are held in the name of
the BIS, but the economic benefit lies with central bank customers. The Bank does not invest for its own account in the BISIPs.
Dedicated mandates are portfolios which are managed by the Bank in accordance with investment guidelines set by the customer. They are
held for the financial benefit of the central bank customer.
For both the BISIPs and the dedicated mandates, the Bank is remunerated by a management fee which is included within net fee and
commission income in the profit and loss account.

27. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby facilities for its customers on a collateralised or uncollateralised basis. At 31 March 2016
all of the outstanding commitments were collateralised and amounted to SDR 3,121.6 million (2015: SDR 3,096.5 million). The BIS is
committed to supporting the operations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) and
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). In each case, the Bank has a separate agreement specifying the terms of
support and commitment. The Bank is the legal employer of FSB, IADI and IAIS staff, with the regular ongoing staff costs borne by each
association. The commitment by the BIS to IADI is subject to an annual budgetary decision of the Board. The agreement with the FSB is
under an initial five-year term ending in January 2018. The agreement with the IAIS is under a five-year term ending in 2019.

28. Fair value hierarchy
The Bank categorises its financial instrument fair value measurements using a hierarchy that reflects the observability of inputs used in
measuring that value. A valuation level is assigned according to the least observable input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. The fair value hierarchy used by the Bank comprises the following levels:
Level 1 – Instruments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.
Level 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using inputs which are observable for the financial instrument either directly (ie as
a price) or indirectly (ie derived from prices for similar financial instruments). This includes observable interest rates, spreads and volatilities.
Level 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques where the inputs are not observable in financial markets.
At 31 March 2016 the Bank had no financial instruments categorised as level 3 (31 March 2015: nil).

A. Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy
Of the assets categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2016, SDR 1,443.7 million related to assets that were categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2015.
Of the assets categorised as level 2 at 31 March 2016, SDR 1,141.5 million related to assets that had been categorised as level 1 at 31 March 2015.
The transfer of assets between levels 1 and 2 reflected specific market conditions existing at the reporting dates that affected the observability
of the market prices as defined above. No liabilities were transferred between fair value hierarchy levels.

B. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value level 3
During the financial years ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 the Bank did not classify any assets or liabilities as level 3 in the fair
value hierarchy.

C. Financial instruments not measured at fair value
The Bank accounts for certain financial instruments at amortised cost. Using the same valuation techniques for amortised cost financial
instruments as are applied to fair valued financial instruments, the Bank estimates that their fair values would be materially the same as the
carrying values shown in these financial statements for both 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015. If these instruments were included in the
fair value hierarchy, the valuation of “Gold loans” and “Securities sold under repurchase agreements” would be considered level 2. All other
amortised cost financial instruments would be considered level 1.

212

BIS 86th Annual Report

D. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities may be affected by any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated, the
value of its liabilities should decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a valuation movement in the profit and loss account.
The Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its creditworthiness did
not indicate a change which could have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities during the period under review.

E. The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
Certain of the Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which require estimation of appropriate
valuation parameters. Changes in estimates of these parameters could significantly affect the reported fair values. The valuation impact of
a 1 basis point change in spread assumptions of key financial instruments is shown in the table below:

or senior officials of the Bank during the financial year are included in the table above as other outflows.
In addition, the Bank operates a blocked personal deposit account for certain staff members who were previously members of the Bank’s
savings fund, which closed on 1 April 2003. The terms of these blocked accounts are such that staff members cannot make further deposits
or withdrawals and the balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the Bank based
on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank on staff accounts plus 1%. The total balance of blocked accounts at 31 March 2016 was
SDR 12.9 million (2015: SDR 14.4 million). They are reported under the balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

B. Related party customers
The BIS provides banking services to its customers, which are predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial
institutions. In fulfilling this role, the Bank, in the normal course of business, enters into transactions with customers which are related parties
(as defined above). These transactions include making advances, and taking currency and gold deposits. It is the Bank’s policy to enter into
transactions with related party customers on similar terms and conditions to transactions with other, non-related party customers. The
following tables show balances relating to these transactions. The Bank believes these are representative of the general level of business
undertaken with related party customers during the year.

Capital adequacy

1. Capital adequacy frameworks
As an international financial institution that is overseen by a Board composed of Governors of major central banks and that has no national
supervisor, the Bank is committed to maintaining its superior credit quality and financial strength, in particular in situations of financial
stress.
The Bank continuously assesses its capital adequacy based on an annual capital planning process that focuses on two elements: an economic
capital framework and a financial leverage framework. The disclosures in this section related to credit, market, operational and liquidity risk
are based on the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy derived in accordance with these two BIS frameworks. Regulatory capital ratios
are not used as indicators of BIS capital adequacy because key aspects of the business model for the BIS banking activities are not
adequately captured. In the main, these relate to the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank as well as the way regulatory capital ratios
reflect portfolio concentrations and interest rate risk in the banking book.
To facilitate comparability, the Bank has implemented a framework that is consistent with the revised International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in June 2006.
Following that framework, the Bank discloses a Tier 1 capital ratio (Pillar 1), risk-weighted assets and more detailed related information. In
addition, the Bank calculates for reference a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio and Liquidity Coverage Ratio taking account
of banking supervisory recommendations related to Basel III. The Bank maintains a capital position substantially in excess of the regulatory
minimum requirement in order to ensure its superior credit quality.

2. Economic capital
The Bank’s economic capital methodology relates its risk-taking capacity to the amount of economic capital needed to absorb potential
losses arising from its exposures. The risk-taking capacity is defined as allocatable economic capital that is derived following a prudent
assessment of the components of the Bank’s equity, which are set out in the table below:

Allocatable economic capital is determined following a prudent evaluation of the Bank’s equity components for their loss absorption
capacity and sustainability. The components of capital with long-term risk-bearing capacity are the Bank’s Tier 1 capital and the sustainable
portion of the securities and gold revaluation reserves (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Only this “allocatable capital” is available for
allocation to the various categories of risk. The portion of revaluation reserves that is considered more transitory in nature is assigned to
the “capital filter” together with the profit accrued during the financial period under review.

Allocatable capital

As part of the annual capital planning process, Management allocates economic capital to risk categories within the amount of allocatable
capital. As a first step, capital is assigned to an “economic capital cushion” that provides an additional margin of safety and is sufficient to
sustain a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocation to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings
of assets. The level of the economic capital cushion is determined based on stress tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events.
Allocations are then made to each category of financial risk (ie credit, market and “other risks”) as well as operational risk. “Other risks” are
risks that have been identified but that are not taken account of in the economic capital utilisation calculations, and include model risk and
residual basis risk. Reflecting the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic capital
to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year horizon, except for settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and other
risks. The amount of economic capital set aside for settlement risk and other risks is based on an assessment by Management. The Bank’s
economic capital framework is subject to regular review and calibration.
The following table summarises the Bank’s economic capital allocation and utilisation for credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other
risks:

3. Financial leverage
The Bank complements its capital adequacy assessment with a prudently managed financial leverage framework. The Bank monitors its
financial leverage using a ratio that compares the BIS adjusted common equity with its total exposure. However, to reflect the scope and
nature of its banking activities, the definition of the BIS adjusted common equity limits the recognition of revaluation reserves to the
proportion of the gold and securities revaluation reserves that is considered sustainable (“sustainable supplementary capital”). Further, the
exposure measure is supplemented by the inclusion of committed and uncommitted facilities, and pension fund assets.
The table below shows the calculation of the Bank’s financial leverage ratio:

The Bank also calculates a leverage ratio that is consistent with Basel III recommendations. The Bank’s Basel III leverage ratio differs
from the BIS leverage ratio in using Common Equity Tier 1 as its capital measure instead of BIS adjusted common equity as defined above.
The calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital is included in note 4B. At 31 March 2016 the Bank’s Basel III leverage ratio stood at 7.6%
(2015: 8.0%).

BIS 86th Annual Report

4. Capital ratios
The economic capital framework and the financial leverage framework described above are the main tools used for assessing the Bank’s
capital adequacy. Risk-weighted assets, minimum capital requirements and capital ratios are disclosed to facilitate comparability. Guidance
issued by the BCBS includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital requirements.
In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.
For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures. Under this approach,
the risk weighting for a transaction is determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs.
Expected loss is calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced internal ratings-based approach. The expected loss is calculated
at the balance sheet date taking into account any impairment provision which is reflected in the Bank’s financial statements. The Bank had
no impaired financial assets at 31 March 2016 (2015: nil). In accordance with the requirements of the Basel framework, the expected loss is
compared with the impairment provision and any shortfall is deducted from the Bank’s Tier 1 capital. For securitisation exposures and
relevant other assets, the Bank has adopted the standardised approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following an internal models approach. For operational risk, the advanced measurement
approach is used. Both these approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies.
More details on the assumptions underlying the calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central banks, monetary authorities and international financial institutions, in the
management of their reserves and related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the Bank’s objectives and ensure its financial strength and independence. The BIS
engages in banking activities that are customer-related as well as activities that are related to the investment of its equity, each of which
may give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational risk.
Within the risk frameworks defined by the Board of Directors, the Management of the Bank has established risk management policies
designed to ensure that risks are identified, appropriately measured and controlled as well as monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•
•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•

maintaining a high level of liquidity.

investing its assets predominantly in high credit quality financial instruments;
seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;
adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market risk-taking and carefully managing market risk associated with the Bank’s strategic
positions, which include its gold holdings; and

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General Manager is responsible to the Board for the management of the Bank, and is assisted
by the Deputy General Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for the Bank’s independent risk control and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General Manager are supported by senior management advisory committees.
The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee and the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee.
The first two committees are chaired by the General Manager and the third by the Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the Bank’s strategic planning and
the allocation of resources, as well as on decisions related to the broad financial objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General Manager on the financial management and policy issues related to the banking
business, including the allocation of economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and Operational Risk Committee acts as an
advisory committee to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the coordination of compliance matters and operational risk management
throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent operational risk control
function is shared between Risk Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification, and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit.
Both units report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of this function is to provide
reasonable assurance that the activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s
Code of Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff on compliance issues. The
Head of the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee
to the Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an independent valuation
control function, produces the Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s expenditure by setting and monitoring the annual budget.
The objective of the independent valuation control function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with its valuation policy and
procedures. The Finance unit reports to the Deputy General Manager and the Secretary General.

224

BIS 86th Annual Report

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s activities. The Legal Service has
a direct reporting line to the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control procedures and reports on how they comply with internal standards and industry best
practices. The scope of internal audit work includes the review of risk management procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has reporting lines to the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager, and to the Audit
Committee.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the relevant units.
Financial risk and compliance reports aimed at various management levels are provided regularly to enable Management to adequately
assess the Bank’s risk profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the Board of Directors on a monthly and a quarterly basis. Furthermore, the Audit
Committee receives regular reports from Internal Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the Finance unit. The Banking and
Risk Management Committee, another advisory committee to the Board, receives regular reports from the Risk Control unit. The preparation
of reports is subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial instruments to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its valuations monthly, taking into account
necessary adjustments for impairment. It uses a comprehensive range of quantitative methodologies for valuing financial instruments and
for measuring risk to its net profit and equity. The Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light of its changing risk environment
and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles and responsibilities and processes related to the implementation of new or materially
changed risk and valuation models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on value-at-risk (VaR)
techniques. VaR expresses the statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the current positions of the Bank measured to a
specified level of confidence and a specified time horizon. VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the quality of available market
data and, while forward-looking, they extrapolate from past events. VaR models may underestimate potential losses if changes in risk factors
fail to align with the distribution assumptions. VaR figures do not provide any information on losses that may occur beyond the assumed
confidence level.
The Bank’s economic capital framework covers credit risk, market risk, operational risk and other risks. As part of the annual capital planning
process, the Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk categories commensurate with principles set by the Board and taking account
of the business strategy. Reflecting the high level of solvency targeted by the Bank, the economic capital framework measures economic
capital to a 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. An additional amount of economic capital is set aside for
settlement risk (included in the utilisation for credit risk) and “other risks” based on Management’s assessment of risks which are not
reflected in the economic capital calculations. Moreover, capital is also allocated to an “economic capital cushion” that is based on stress
tests that explore extreme but still plausible default events. The economic capital cushion provides an additional margin of safety to sustain
a potential material loss without the need to reduce the capital allocated to individual risk categories or to liquidate any holdings of assets.
The management of the Bank’s capital adequacy is complemented by a comprehensive stress testing framework, and a prudent financial
leverage framework. The stress testing framework supplements the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic capital calculations
for financial risk. The Bank’s key market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested. The stress testing includes the analysis of severe
historical and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible movements of the key
risk factors identified. The Bank also performs stress tests related to liquidity risk. The financial leverage framework focuses on a ratio that
sets the BIS adjusted common equity in relation to its total balance sheet exposure.

BIS 86th Annual Report

225

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual terms and conditions.
A financial asset is considered past due when a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and policies set by the Board of Directors and Management. These are complemented by
more detailed guidelines and procedures at the level of the independent risk control function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty and an aggregated level. As part of the independent risk control function,
individual counterparty credit assessments are performed subject to a well defined internal rating process, involving 18 rating grades. As
part of this process, counterparty financial statements and market information are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of credit limits covering
individual counterparties and countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties. In principle, the ratings and related limits are
reviewed at least annually. The main assessment criterion in these reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest and principal
repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by the Board of Directors.
On an aggregated level, credit risk, including default and country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and controlled based on the Bank’s
economic capital calculation for credit risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank uses a portfolio VaR model. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

B. Default risk
The following tables show the exposure of the Bank to default risk, without taking into account any collateral held or other credit
enhancements available to the Bank. Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and legally enforceable netting or setoff
agreements. The corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the balance sheet.
The exposures set out in the tables below are based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance sheet as categorised by sector,
geographical region and credit quality. The carrying value is the fair value of the financial instruments, including derivatives, except in the
case of very short-term financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold, which are shown at amortised cost net of any impairment
charge. Commitments are reported at their notional amounts. Gold and gold loans exclude gold bar assets held in custody, and accounts
receivable do not include unsettled liability issues, because these items do not represent credit exposures of the Bank.
The vast majority of the Bank’s assets are invested in securities issued by governments and financial institutions rated A– or above by at
least one of the major external credit assessment institutions. Limitations on the number of high-quality counterparties in these sectors
mean that the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.
The Bank conducts an annual review for impairment at the date of each balance sheet. At 31 March 2016 the Bank did not have any financial
assets that were considered to be impaired (2015: nil). At 31 March 2016 no financial assets were considered past due (2015: nil). No credit
loss was recognised in the current period (2015: nil).

C. Credit risk mitigation

Netting
Netting agreements give the Bank a legally enforceable right to net transactions with counterparties under potential future conditions,
notably an event of default. Such master netting or similar agreements apply to counterparties with whom the Bank conducts most of its
derivative transactions, as well as to counterparties used for repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement transactions. Where required,
netting is applied when determining the amount of collateral to be requested or provided, but the Bank does not settle assets and liabilities
on a net basis during the normal course of business. As such, the amounts shown on the Bank’s balance sheet are the gross amounts.

Collateral
The Bank mitigates credit risk by requiring counterparties to provide collateral. The Bank receives collateral in respect of most derivative
contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and for advances made under collateralised facility agreements. During the term of these
transactions, further collateral may be called or collateral may be released based on the movements in value of both the underlying
instrument and the collateral that has been received. The Bank is required to provide collateral in respect of repurchase agreements.
For derivative contracts and reverse repurchase agreements, the Bank accepts as collateral high-quality sovereign, state agency and
supranational securities and, in a limited number of cases, cash. For advances made under collateralised facility agreements, collateral
accepted includes currency deposits with the Bank as well as units in the BIS Investment Pools.
Under the terms of its collateral arrangements, the Bank is permitted to sell (“re-hypothecate”) collateral received on derivative contracts
and reverse repurchase agreements, but upon expiry of the transaction must return equivalent financial instruments to the counterparty. At
31 March 2016 the Bank had not sold any of the collateral it held (2015: nil).
The fair value of collateral held which the Bank had the right to sell was:

Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting or collateralisation
The tables below show the categories of assets and liabilities which are subject to collateralisation and for which netting agreements
potentially apply, eg in the event of default of a counterparty.
The amount of collateral required is usually based on valuations performed on the previous business day, whereas the Bank’s balance sheet
reflects the valuations of the reporting date. Due to this timing difference, the valuation of collateral can be higher than the valuation of
the underlying contract in the Bank’s balance sheet. The amount of the collateral obtained is also impacted by thresholds, minimum transfer
amounts and valuation adjustments (“haircuts”) specified in the contracts. In these tables, the mitigating effect of collateral has been limited
to the balance sheet value of the underlying net asset.

D. Economic capital for credit risk
The Bank determines economic capital for credit risk, except for settlement risk, using a VaR methodology on the basis of a portfolio VaR
model, assuming a one-year time horizon and a 99.995% confidence level. The amount of economic capital for settlement risk included in
the credit risk utilisation reflects an amount assessed by Management.

E. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk

Exposure to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted an approach that is
consistent with the advanced internal ratings-based approach.
As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures with risk weights derived
from the relevant Basel II risk weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant
to the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank determines the EAD as the
notional amount of on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures, except for securities and derivative contracts. The EAD for derivatives is
calculated using an approach consistent with the internal models method proposed under the Basel II framework. In line with this methodology,
the Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the framework.
Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as the estimated loss-givendefault (LGD) and maturity for each transaction.
Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and the conservative credit risk management process at the BIS, the Bank is not in
a position to estimate PDs and LGDs based on its own default experience. The Bank calibrates each counterparty PD estimate through a
mapping of internal rating grades to external credit assessments taking external default data into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are
derived from external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effects of collateral obtained giving
consideration to market price volatility, re-margining and revaluation frequency. The recognition of the risk-reducing effects of collateral
obtained for derivative contracts, reverse repurchase agreements and collateralised advances is accounted for in calculating the EAD.
The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and collateral benefits into
account. The total amount of exposures reported in the table as at 31 March 2016 includes SDR 118.9 million for interest rate contracts
(2015: SDR 184.5 million) and SDR 283.5 million for FX and gold contracts (2015: SDR 1,229.5 million). In line with the Basel II framework,
the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.

Securitisation exposures
The Bank invests in highly rated securitisation exposures based on traditional, ie non-synthetic, securitisation structures. Given the scope of
the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II framework are determined according to the standardised approach for
securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments of the securities are used to determine the relevant risk weights. External
credit assessment institutions used for this purpose are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets
are then derived as the product of the market values of the exposures and the associated risk weights. In line with the Basel II framework,
the minimum capital requirement is determined as 8% of risk-weighted assets.
The following table shows the Bank’s investments in securitisation analysed by type of securitised assets:

4. Market risk
The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse movements in market prices. The main components of the Bank’s market risk are gold
price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Bank measures market risk and calculates economic capital based on a VaR
methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities and correlations are estimated, subject to an exponential
weighting scheme, over a six-year observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes sensitivities to certain market risk factors.
In line with the Bank’s objective of maintaining its superior credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995% confidence level
assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis of a stressed market
data set. The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic capital usage within a framework set by the Board of Directors. VaR limits
are supplemented by operating limits.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank has established a comprehensive
regular backtesting framework, comparing daily performance with corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed and reported to
Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement based on VaR modelling and related economic capital calculations with a series of
stress tests. These include severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold price,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

234

BIS 86th Annual Report

A. Gold price risk
Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.
The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to 104 tonnes
(2015: 108 tonnes). These gold investment assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with commercial banks. At 31 March 2016 the
Bank’s net gold investment assets amounted to SDR 2,944.6 million (2015: SDR 2,998.3 million), approximately 16% of its equity (2015: 16%).
The Bank sometimes also has small exposures to gold price risk arising from its banking activities with central and commercial banks. Gold
price risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology, including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates including credit spreads. The Bank
is exposed to interest rate risk through the interest-bearing assets relating to the management of its equity held in its investment portfolios
and investments relating to its banking portfolios. The investment portfolios are managed using a fixed-duration benchmark of bonds.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into account movements in
relevant money market rates, government bond yields, swap rates and credit spreads.
The tables below show the impact on the Bank’s equity of a 1% upward shift in the relevant yield curve per time band:

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and GBP. Currency risk is the
exposure of the Bank’s financial condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily
through the assets relating to the management of its equity. The Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through managing its
customer deposits and through acting as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions. The Bank reduces its foreign exchange exposures
by matching the relevant assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from
customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction intermediation.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange and gold position in
these tables therefore includes the Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net foreign exchange exposure, the gold amounts need
to be removed. The SDR-neutral position is then deducted from the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive at the net
currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR-neutral basis.

D. Economic capital for market risk
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations between risk
factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the 99.995% confidence
level and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank calculates the economic capital utilisation for market risk on the basis of a stressed
market data set. The stressed data set is subject to regular review and calibrated to take account of the Bank’s key market risk exposures
and market risk drivers.
The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from
changes in the USD exchange rate versus the SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. The table below shows the key
figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years:

E. Minimum capital requirements for market risk
For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II framework, the Bank has adopted a banking book
approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets are determined for gold
price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement is derived using the VaR-based
internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR methodology, assuming a 99% confidence
level and a 10-day holding period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily VaR
measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three plus a
potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers observed
remained within the range where no add-on is required. The table below summarises the market risk development relevant to the calculation
of minimum capital requirements and the related risk-weighted assets over the reporting period.

5. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both, resulting from one or more
risk causes, as outlined below:

•

Human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training and development, inadequate
supervision, loss of key personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of integrity or ethical standards.

•

Failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented, understood, implemented,
followed or enforced.

•
•

Failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not operate as intended.
External events: the occurrence of an event having an adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework, policies and procedures comprise the management and measurement of operational
risk, including the determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs, business continuity planning and the monitoring of key risk
indicators.
The Bank has established a procedure of immediate reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The Compliance and Operational Risk
Unit develops action plans with the respective units and follows up on their implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk economic capital and operational risk-weighted assets, the Bank has adopted a VaR approach using
a Monte Carlo simulation technique that is consistent with the advanced measurement approach proposed under the Basel II framework.
In line with the assumptions of the Basel II framework, the quantification of operational risk does not take reputational risk into account.
Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the business and control environment
of the Bank are key inputs in the calculations. In quantifying its operational risk, the Bank does not take potential protection it may obtain
from insurance into account.

A. Economic capital for operational risk
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of economic capital for financial risk, the Bank measures economic capital for
operational risk to the 99.995% confidence level assuming a one-year holding period. The table below shows the key figures of the Bank’s
exposure to operational risk in terms of economic capital utilisation over the past two financial years:

6. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and collateral needs
without affecting its daily operations or its financial condition.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from central banks and international institutions, comprise 89% (2015: 94%) of its total
liabilities. At 31 March 2016 currency and gold deposits originated from 167 depositors (2015: 166 depositors). Within these deposits, there
are significant individual customer concentrations, with five customers each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a settlement date
basis (2015: four customers).
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits from central banks, international organisations and other public institutions are the
key drivers of the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank is exposed to funding liquidity risk mainly because of the short-term nature of
its deposits and because it undertakes to repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit instruments at one or two business days’
notice. In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain a high level of liquidity, it has developed a liquidity management framework, including
a ratio, based on conservative assumptions for estimating the liquidity available and the liquidity required.

A. Maturity profile of cash flows
The following tables show the maturity profile of cash flows for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the undiscounted cash flows
to which the Bank is committed. Options are included in the table at fair value and are shown in the “Up to 1 month” category.

B. Liquidity ratio
The Bank has adopted a liquidity risk framework taking into account regulatory guidance issued by the BCBS related to the Liquidity
Coverage Ratio (LCR). The framework is based on a liquidity ratio that compares the Bank’s available liquidity to a liquidity requirement over
a one-month time horizon assuming a stress scenario. In line with the Basel III liquidity framework, the underlying stress scenario combines
an idiosyncratic and a market crisis. However, the liquidity ratio differs in construction from the LCR to reflect the nature and scope of the
BIS banking activities − in particular, the short-term nature of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. Within the Bank’s liquidity framework, the
Board of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio which requires the liquidity available to be at least 100% of the potential
liquidity requirement.
The table below provides information on the development of the Bank’s liquidity ratio for the last two years:

At 31 March

The liquidity available is determined as the cash inflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, along with potential additional
liquidity which could be generated from the disposal of highly liquid securities, or by entering into sale and repurchase agreements for a
part of the Bank’s remaining unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. In calculating the amount of potential additional liquidity an
assessment is performed to identify securities which are of high credit quality and highly liquid. This is followed by a projection of the
amounts that could reasonably be generated through selling these securities or entering into repurchase transactions.
The Bank determines the liquidity required as the sum of the cash outflow from financial instruments over a one-month horizon, the
estimated early withdrawal of currency deposits and the estimated drawings of undrawn facilities. As regards currency deposits, it is assumed
that all deposits that mature within the time horizon are not rolled over and that a proportion of non-maturing currency deposits is
withdrawn from the Bank prior to contractual maturity. At 31 March 2016, the estimated outflow of currency deposits in response to the
stress scenario amounted to 49.8% (2015: 41.3%) of the total stock of currency deposits. Moreover, it is assumed that undrawn facilities
committed by the Bank would be fully drawn by customers, along with a proportion of undrawn uncommitted facilities.

For reference, the Bank also calculates an LCR following the principles set out in the guidance issued by the BCBS. At 31 March 2016 the
Bank’s LCR stood at 208.5% (2015: 262.7%).

Independent auditor’s report
To the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Bank for International Settlements (pages
177–245), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 March 2016, the related profit and loss account,
statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows and movements in the Bank’s equity for
the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial statements and the Statutes of the
Bank. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system
relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error. Management is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting
policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we
comply with ethical responsibilities and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the
entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016 give a true and fair view of
the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the accounting principles described in the financial
statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
