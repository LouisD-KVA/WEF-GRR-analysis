The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
The multiple dimensions of food security

Key messages

A total of 842 million people in 2011–13, or around
one in eight people in the world, were estimated to be
suffering from chronic hunger, regularly not getting
enough food to conduct an active life. This figure is
lower than the 868 million reported with reference to
2010–12. The total number of undernourished has
fallen by 17 percent since 1990–92.
Developing regions as a whole have registered
significant progress towards the MDG 1 hunger target.
If the average annual decline of the past 21 years
continues to 2015, the prevalence of
undernourishment will reach a level close to the target.
Meeting it would require considerable and immediate
additional efforts.
Growth can raise incomes and reduce hunger, but
higher economic growth may not reach everyone. It
may not lead to more and better jobs for all, unless
policies specifically target the poor, especially those in
rural areas. In poor countries, hunger and poverty
reduction will only be achieved with growth that is not
only sustained, but also broadly shared.
Despite overall progress, marked differences across
regions persist. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region
with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, with
modest progress in recent years. Western Asia shows no
progress, while Southern Asia and Northern Africa show
slow progress. Significant reductions in both the
estimated number and prevalence of undernourishment
have occurred in most countries of Eastern and South
Eastern Asia, as well as in Latin America.

NOTES for Annex 1

Policies aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity
and increasing food availability, especially when
smallholders are targeted, can achieve hunger
reduction even where poverty is widespread. When
they are combined with social protection and other
measures that increase the incomes of poor families to
buy food, they can have an even more positive
effective and spur rural development, by creating
vibrant markets and employment opportunities,
making possible equitable economic growth.
Remittances, which have globally become three times
larger than official development assistance, have had
significant impacts on poverty and food security. This
report suggests that remittances can help to reduce
poverty, leading to reduced hunger, better diets and,
given appropriate policies, increased on-farm
investment.

Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as
the latest reported period. The same holds for population data of the
United Nations. Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of
undernourishment accordingly. Therefore, users are advised to refer to
changes in estimates over time only within the same edition of The
State of Food Insecurity in the World and refrain from comparing data
published in editions for different years.

World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015,
the number of undernourished people.
Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between
1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from
hunger. Indicator 1.9 Proportion of population below minimum
level of dietary energy consumption (undernourishment). The
results are obtained following a harmonized methodology
described in Annex 2 and are based on the latest globally
available data averaged over three years. Some countries may
have more recent data, which, if used, could lead to different
estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment and
consequently of the progress achieved.
Projections.
Change from 1990–92 baseline. For countries that did not exist
in the baseline period, the 1990–92 proportion of
undernourished is based on 1993–95 and the number of
undernourished is based on this proportion applied to their
1990–92 population.
The colour indicator shows the progress that is projected to be
achieved by year 2015, if current trends continue:
WFS target

Long-term commitment to mainstreaming food
security and nutrition in public policies and
programmes is key to hunger reduction. Keeping food
security and agriculture high on the development
agenda, through comprehensive reforms,
improvements in the investment climate, supported by
sustained social protection, is crucial for achieving
major reductions in poverty and undernourishment.

Food security is a complex condition. Its dimensions –
availability, access, utilization and stability – are better
understood when presented through a suite of
indicators.
Undernourishment and undernutrition can coexist.
However, in some countries, undernutrition rates, as
indicated by the proportion of stunted children, are
considerably higher than the prevalence of
undernourishment, as indicated by inadequacy of
dietary energy supply. In these countries,
nutrition-enhancing interventions are crucial to
improve the nutritional aspects of food security.
Improvements require a range of food security and
nutrition-enhancing interventions in agriculture,
health, hygiene, water supply and education,
particularly targeting women.

hirteen years ago, world leaders came together to adopt the United Nations Millennium
Declaration. They committed their nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme
poverty and hunger, setting out a series of targets to be met by 2015, which have
become known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These goals express the world’s
commitment to improve the lives of billions of people and to address development challenges.
Under MDG 1, which aims to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, the world sought to
halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. With only two
years remaining, 38 countries have reached this target, 18 of which have also achieved the even
more stringent goal, established during the 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) in Rome, of halving
the absolute number of hungry in the same time period.
These successes demonstrate that, with political commitment, effective institutions, good
policies, a comprehensive approach and adequate levels of investment, we can win the fight
against hunger and poverty, a necessary first step to arrive at the other development milestones
set by the MDGs.
As with every edition, the 2013 report of The State of Food Insecurity in the World updates
progress towards the MDG and WFS hunger goals: globally, by region and by individual country.
For developing regions as a whole, the latest assessment suggests that further progress has been
made towards the 2015 MDG target. The same progress, assessed against the more ambitious
WFS goal, obviously appears much more modest. A total of 842 million people, or 12 percent of
the world’s population, were experiencing chronic hunger in 2011–13, 26 million fewer than the
number reported last year and down from 1 015 million in 1990–92.
The updated assessment also suggests that the MDG 2015 hunger goal remains within reach.
With new estimates for the entire MDG horizon, the starting level for undernourishment in the
1990–92 base year was 23.6 percent in developing regions, implying an MDG target of
11.8 percent for 2015. Assuming that the average annual decline over the past 21 years
continues to 2015, the prevalence of undernourishment in developing regions would approach
13 percent, a share slightly above the MDG target. With a final push in the next couple of years,
we can still reach it.
The 2013 report goes beyond measuring chronic food deprivation. It presents a broader suite
of indicators that aims to capture the multidimensional nature of food insecurity, its determinants
and outcomes. This suite, compiled for every country, allows a more nuanced picture of their
food security status, guiding policy-makers in the design and implementation of targeted and
effective policy measures that can contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and
malnutrition.
Drawing on the suite of indicators, the report also examines the diverse experiences of six
countries. These experiences show that other forms of malnutrition can sometimes be more
significant than undernourishment. In such circumstances, policy interventions to improve food
security need to include nutrition-sensitive interventions in agriculture and the food system as a
whole, as well as in public health and education, especially of women. Nutrition-focused social
protection may need to target the most vulnerable, including pregnant women, adolescent girls
and children.
Policies aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and increasing food availability, especially
when smallholders are targeted, can achieve hunger reduction even where poverty is widespread.
When they are combined with social protection and other measures that increase the incomes of
poor families, they can have an even more positive effect and spur rural development, by creating
vibrant markets and employment opportunities, resulting in equitable economic growth.
Not surprisingly, the specific country experiences suggest that high poverty levels generally go
hand in hand with high levels of undernourishment. But undernourishment can also be more
severe than poverty, especially when both are at high levels. As food is one of the most incomeresponsive of all basic necessities, higher incomes can therefore expedite reductions in
undernourishment.

Ultimately, political stability, effective governance and, most importantly, uninterrupted longterm commitments to mainstreaming food security and nutrition in policies and programmes are
key to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition. FAO, IFAD and WFP are committed to keeping
food security high on the development agenda and ensuring that it is firmly embedded in the
post-2015 vision currently being developed. They must be supported and sustained by
improvements in agriculture and in the investment climate, twinned with social protection. Only
then will we be able to reach well beyond the MDG targets to achieve major reductions in
poverty and undernourishment.

AO’s most recent estimates indicate that, globally,
842 million people – 12 percent of the global
population – were unable to meet their dietary
energy requirements in 2011–13, down from 868 million
reported for the 2010–12 period in last year’s report. Thus,
around one in eight people in the world are likely to have

suffered from chronic hunger, not having enough food for
an active and healthy life. The vast majority of hungry
people – 827 million of them – live in developing regions,
where the prevalence of undernourishment is now
estimated at 14.3 percent in 2011–13 (Table 1).

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

Undernourishment around the world in 2013

…but is insufficient overall to achieve
the hunger reduction goals
While the estimated number of undernourished people
has continued to decrease, the rate of progress appears
insufficient to reach international goals for hunger
reduction. There are two established targets against which
progress in reducing hunger is assessed. One is the 1996
World Food Summit (WFS) target, which is to halve the
number of hungry people; the other is the 2001
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) hunger target,
which is to halve the proportion of hungry people in the
total population. Both targets have 1990 as the starting
year and 2015 as the target year. Given the often high
rates of population growth in many hunger-affected
countries, the WFS target is the more ambitious goal. The
deviation of actual progress from the target trajectory is
therefore growing more rapidly for the WFS target than for
the MDG one, at least for developing regions as a whole
(Figure 1). To meet the WFS target, the number of hungry
people in developing regions would have to be reduced to
498 million by 2015, a goal that is out of reach at the
global level. However, many individual countries are on
track to meet the WFS target: indeed, 18 countries1* had
already met it in 2012 and received a special recognition
during the 2013 FAO Conference.

The MDG target could still be reached,
but more efforts are needed
The MDG hunger target of halving the proportion of people
who are undernourished is less ambitious than the WFS
target, and the deviation from its trajectory appears relatively
small (Figure 1). The current assessment pegs
undernourishment in developing regions at around
24 percent of the population in 1990–92, thus implying an
MDG target of 12 percent. Assuming that the average

annual decline over the past 21 years continues to 2015, the
prevalence of undernourishment in developing regions
would be 13 percent, marginally above the MDG target.
Nevertheless, the target can be met, provided that additional
efforts to reduce hunger are brought underway, both to
address immediate needs and to sustain longer-term
progress.

Undernourishment around the world in 2013

As the target year is fast approaching, there is a need for
programmes that deliver quick results. Measures to improve
access to food through safety nets and similar interventions
can do this. They also promise to have longer-lasting positive
effects on food availability by raising local demand, thus
stimulating food production. Such programmes include, inter
alia, cash transfers and cash-and-voucher schemes. Initial
results of these programmes suggest that they can lead not
only to higher consumption, but also to increased
investments in agricultural assets, including farm implements
and livestock, and more food from own production. There is
also evidence that such programmes can create significant
income multiplier effects through trade and production
linkages. Over the longer term, they can generate positive
feedback whereby demand created through safety nets
stimulates smallholder food production and thus helps both
poor consumers and producers. These programmes lie at the
heart of the twin-track approach to reducing hunger,

stimulating food demand, which, in turn, provides
incentives to increase production and more incomegenerating opportunities for smallholder production.
To sustain their longer-term viability, demand-enhancing
efforts need to be supplemented by effective supply-side
measures. This is particularly important when hunger
reduction programmes aim to reach large rural populations
in the absence of adequate physical and institutional
infrastructure. The 2012 edition of The State of Food and
Agriculture made a powerful case for investing in
agriculture to reduce poverty and hunger. It showed that
investing in agriculture contributes strongly to increasing
food security, which in turn helps promote economic
diversification and growth. Increased agricultural
productivity generates higher incomes and creates incomegenerating opportunities for otherwise destitute population
groups, offering a recognized way to escape the poverty
trap in many rural areas.

Large differences in hunger persist
across regions
Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of
undernourishment, with around one in four people
estimated to be undernourished. Levels and trends in
undernourishment differ within the continent. While subSaharan Africa has the highest prevalence of undernourishment, there has been some improvement over
the last two decades, with the prevalence of undernourishment declining from 32.7 percent to 24.8 percent.
Northern Africa, by contrast, is characterized by a much
lower prevalence of undernourishment and by much faster
progress than sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the region
is not on track to achieve the MDG hunger target,
reflecting too little progress in both parts of the continent
(Figure 2).

Both the number and proportion of people
undernourished have decreased significantly in most
countries in Asia, particularly in South-Eastern Asia, but
progress in Southern Asia has been slower, especially in terms
of the number of people undernourished. The prevalence of
undernourishment is lower in Western Asia than in other
parts of the region but has risen steadily since 1990–92. With
a decline in prevalence from 31.1 to 10.7 percent, the most
rapid progress was recorded in South-Eastern Asia, followed
by Eastern Asia. The Asia region as a whole is nearly on track
to achieve the MDG hunger target. The MDG target has
already been reached in the Caucasus and Central Asia, East
Asia and South-Eastern Asia, while it has nearly been reached
in Latin America and the Caribbean (Figure 3).

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

11

Undernourishment around the world in 2013

Why do hunger trends differ across regions?
Progress in reducing hunger reflects country and regional
specificities in terms of economic conditions, infrastructure,
the organization of food production, the presence of social
provisions and political and institutional stability. In Western
Asia, the worsening undernourishment trend appears to be
mostly related to food price inflation and political instability.
In Northern Africa, where progress has been slow, the same
factors are relevant. Lack of natural resources, especially
good-quality cropland and renewable water resources, also
limit the regions’ food production potential. Meeting the
food needs of these regions’ rapidly growing populations
has been possible only through importing large quantities
of cereals. Some of these cereal imports are financed by
petroleum exports; simply put, these regions export
hydrocarbons and import carbohydrates to ensure their
food security. Both food and energy are made more
affordable domestically through large, untargeted
subsidies.
The regions’ dependency on food imports and oil exports
make them susceptible to price swings on world commodity
markets. The most precarious food security situations arise in

countries where proceeds from hydrocarbon exports have
slowed or stalled, food subsidies are circumscribed by
growing fiscal deficits or civil unrest has disrupted domestic
food chains.
While at the global level there has been an overall
reduction in the number of undernourished between
1990–92 and 2011–13 (Figure 4), different rates of progress
across regions have led to changes in the distribution of
undernourished people in the world. Most of the world’s
undernourished people are still to be found in Southern
Asia, closely followed by sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern
Asia. The regional share has declined most in Eastern Asia
and South-Eastern Asia, and to a lesser extent in Latin
America and the Caribbean and in the Caucasus and
Central Asia. Meanwhile, the share has increased in
Southern Asia, in sub-Saharan Africa and in Western Asia
and Northern Africa.
Many countries have experienced higher economic
growth over the last few years, a key reason for progress in
hunger reduction. Still, growth does not reach its potential,
owing to structural constraints. Arguably the most

important is the often woefully inadequate infrastructure
that plagues vast areas of rural Africa. Much improved
communication and broader access to information
technology may, to some extent, have helped overcome
traditional infrastructure constraints, and promoted market
integration. Also encouraging is the pick-up in agricultural
productivity growth, buttressed by increased public
investment, incentives generated by higher food prices and
renewed interest of private investors in agriculture. In some
countries, remittance inflows from migrants have helped
spur domestic growth. Remittances have increased smallscale investment, which was particularly beneficial to growth
where food production and distribution still rely on smallscale and local networks. This holds in particular for subSaharan African countries, where a combination of higher
crop yields and increased livestock production have led to a
reduction of undernourishment.
Many countries in Eastern Asia have benefited from
continuous and often rapid economic growth. In general,

they were less affected by the economic slow-downs that
engulfed many other developing countries in the past
decade and member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the
late 2000s. Countries in South-Eastern Asia have shown
considerable inflows of remittances from the West and
some oil-rich countries in Western Asia. These transfers
have often driven small-scale investment in sectors such as
agriculture and construction. Robust income growth, in
conjunction with relatively high income responsiveness on
the demand side and policies to increase agricultural
productivity, has helped reduce the undernourishment
burden in these regions.
Similar factors seem to explain the good progress
recorded by most countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean. Economic growth, political and institutional
stability, incentives to raise agricultural productivity and
overall economic development have been the main sources
of progress.

What was the impact of price volatility
observed over recent years?
The evolution of the prevalence of undernourishment
estimates capture trends in chronic hunger. Because of the
characteristics of the data on which it is based, the
prevalence of undernourishment indicator does not reflect
acute, short-term changes in malnutrition resulting from
short-term changes in the economic environment. The large
swings in primary food prices observed since 2008, often
measured by the FAO Food Price Index (FPI), are a prominent
example of such short-term shocks. Price and income swings
affect the food security of poor and hungry people more
than the steady trend in the prevalence of undernourishment suggests. But recent data on global and
regional food consumer price indices (food CPIs) suggest that
food price hikes at the primary commodity level generally
have little effect on consumer prices and that the swings in
consumer prices were much more muted than those faced
by agricultural producers or recorded in international trade.
Overall, the new data on food prices at the consumer
level give rise to two basic findings.
The first is that increases in the FPI translate into higher
consumer prices only to a very limited degree and with a
time lag of a few months. The lag in transmission from
international prices (as captured by the FPI) to consumer
prices (food CPI) is explained, in large measure, by the time

needed to harvest, ship and then process primary products
into final food items for consumers. The lag is highlighted if
the two indicators are plotted on different scales (Figure 5,
left). The limited transmission is explained by a combination
of factors that determine vertical price transmission in every
food economy, including mark-ups for transportation,
processing and marketing, and by any subsidies at the
consumer level. The limited nature of this price transmission
is well illustrated by plotting both indicators on the same
scale (Figure 5, right).
The second finding is that regional differences in price
transmission are surprisingly small. This means that, even in
regions characterized by short supply chains and high levels
of subsistence production, changes in producer prices of
primary products have only a limited effect on final
consumer prices (Figure 6). The only noticeable exception is
Eastern Africa, where price transmission is high and
consumers have been exposed more fully to swings in prices
of primary food products. This is also the case for lowincome, food-importing countries, in which poor consumers
may allocate more than 75 percent of their expenditure to
food; in these countries, increases in producer prices can
significantly reduce the ability of consumers to meet their
food needs.

In addition, the impact of price swings on undernourishment can be reduced by consumers switching
between food items. When prices rise, consumers often shift
from more expensive and more nutritious foodstuffs to lessexpensive but often also less-nutritious foods. While this
allows consumers to maintain their dietary energy intake, it
heightens the risk of other forms of malnutrition, such as
micronutrient deficiencies. Consuming less nutritious food
can have adverse long-term effects on food utilization,
resulting in undernutrition (see Annex 3: Glossary of selected
terms used in this report for definitions of these terms).

Key messages
• A total of 842 million people in 2011–13, or
around one in eight people in the world, were
estimated to be suffering from chronic hunger,
regularly not getting enough food to conduct an
active life. This figure is lower than the
868 million reported with reference to 2010–12.
The total number of undernourished has fallen by
17 percent since 1990–92.
• Developing regions as a whole have registered
significant progress towards the MDG 1 hunger
target. If the average annual decline of the past
21 years continues to 2015, the prevalence of
undernourishment will reach a level close to the
target. Meeting it would require considerable and
immediate additional efforts.
• Growth can raise incomes and reduce hunger,
but higher economic growth may not reach
everyone. It may not lead to more and better
jobs for all, unless policies specifically target the
poor, especially those in rural areas. In poor
countries, hunger and poverty reduction will
only be achieved with growth that is not only
sustained, but also broadly shared.

People’s health and productivity can also be impaired.
These changes, however, are unlikely to be captured by the
prevalence of undernourishment indicator: almost
unchanged prevalence of undernourishment can mask
changes in other forms of malnutrition. This underlines the
complexity of food security, and the need for a
comprehensive approach to its measurement. The next
section will discuss such an approach, and present a suite
of indicators that captures more fully the various causes or
determinants of food security, as well as its manifestations
or outcomes.

• Despite overall progress, marked differences
across regions persist. Sub-Saharan Africa
remains the region with the highest prevalence
of undernourishment, with modest progress in
recent years. Western Asia shows no progress,
while Southern Asia and Northern Africa show
slow progress. Significant reductions in both the
number of people who are undernourished and
the prevalence of undernourishment have
occurred in most countries of Eastern and SouthEastern Asia, as well as in Latin America.
• Price and income swings can significantly affect
the poor and hungry. However, recent data on
global and regional food consumer price indices
suggest that price hikes in primary food markets
had a limited effect on consumer prices, and that
price swings in consumer prices were more
muted than those faced by producers. When
prices rise, however, consumers often shift to
cheaper, less-nutritious foods, heightening the
risks of micronutrient deficiencies and other
forms of malnutrition, which can have long-term
adverse effects on people’s health, development
and productivity.

dietary needs and food preferences for an active and
healthy life.” 2
Based on this definition, four food security dimensions
can be identified: food availability, economic and physical
access to food, food utilization and stability (vulnerability
and shocks) over time. Each food security dimension is
described by specific indicators. Figure 7 provides an

overview of the suite of indicators and their organization into
the four dimensions of food security.
Measuring the complexity of food security is part of a broader
debate that currently takes place in the preparation process of the
post-2015 development agenda. These broader measurement
challenges, as well as the processes under way and the new
proposals for food security monitoring, are summarized in Box 1.

BOX 1

A monitoring framework for the post-2015 development agenda

Beyond the MDGs
A new global development agenda for the period beyond
2015 is currently being shaped. One major international
forum driving this process is the 30-member Open
Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals,
established by the General Assembly of the United
Nations (UN) on 22 January 2013. The Group will deliver
a proposal to be considered by the General Assembly in
September 2014. Meanwhile, the High-Level Panel of
Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda,
appointed in July 2012 by the UN Secretary-General,
delivered its report on the post-2015 development
agenda on 30 May 2013.1 The UN system has been
contributing to the definition of the post-2015 agenda
through the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN
Development Agenda.
One lesson that has emerged from the current
discussions of the development agenda is the need to
improve monitoring. Good monitoring requires a
combination of approaches, and the ability to produce
regular updates of indicators. The new monitoring
system should combine monitoring of human
development – “people-focused” metrics – and of the
resource base, its use and related stresses – “planetfocused” indicators. A link between these two sets of
metrics should be embedded in the design of the new
monitoring system at the outset. Data can be collected
through a combination of periodic in-depth surveys and
lighter, flexible and more frequent experience-based
surveys (in which respondents self-report on their
experiences).
The three Rome-based agencies (FAO, IFAD and WFP)
are well positioned to contribute to the post-2015
development agenda. Their work programmes are
largely inspired by the Zero Hunger Challenge proposed
by the UN Secretary-General. As emphasized in the
recent report of the High-Level Panel (p. 30), this has five
targets:

• end hunger and protect the right of everyone to
access sufficient, safe, affordable, and nutritious food;
• reduce stunting by x%, wasting by y%, and anaemia
by z% for all children under five;
• increase agricultural productivity by x%, with a focus
on sustainably increasing smallholder yields and
access to irrigation;
• adopt sustainable agricultural and ocean and
freshwater fishery practices and rebuild designated
fish stocks to sustainable levels; and
• reduce postharvest loss and food waste by x%.
The Panel emphasized sustainability as a necessary
basis for efforts aimed at building lasting prosperity
for youth. The Panel also advocates a “data
revolution” for sustainable development, noting the
potential of open and accessible data to contribute to
sustainable development and the need to use nontraditional data sources (e.g. crowd sourcing). The
report also stresses the need to disaggregate data by
gender, location, income, ethnicity, disability and other
categories.
Increased demands on the global statistical system
The need for improved monitoring poses enormous
challenges to the global statistical system. Data sources
and survey instruments currently employed in global and
national monitoring cannot provide real-time data and
finely disaggregated data. The capacity of many
developing countries to monitor several MDG indicators
is still weak and often dependent on the support or
initiatives of international organizations. The post-2015
development agenda will put a lot of additional demands
on the statistical systems of developing countries.
FAO’s Voices of the Hungry project
The report of the High-level Panel recommends a foodand nutrition-specific sustainable development goal,
with five targets. The first target calls for ending

hunger. FAO’s Voices of the Hungry project will provide
an innovative monitoring tool in this area.
The Voices of the Hungry project aims to establish a
new global standard for measuring food insecurity
using a food insecurity experience scale. The
approach is based on eight questions designed to
establish the respondent’s positions on a food
insecurity experience scale (mild, moderate and
severely food-insecure). The project will strengthen
FAO’s capacity for monitoring global food security, by
collecting data globally and annually through the
Gallup World Poll. Information is gathered at the
individual level, hence allowing disparities in food
access based on gender and other characteristics to
be observed. FAO has already started working closely

with four countries of the Renewed Partnership for a
Unified Approach to End Hunger in Africa: Angola,
Ethiopia, Malawi and the Niger.
With the Voices of the Hungry project, FAO will set a
baseline for measuring progress in reducing food
insecurity in all countries of the world by 2015.

Food security and its four dimensions
■■ Food availability: much improved, but progress
is uneven across regions and over time
Food availability plays a prominent role in food security.
Supplying enough food to a given population is a necessary,
albeit not a sufficient, condition to ensure that people have
adequate access to food. Over the last two decades, food
supplies have grown faster than the population in
developing countries, resulting in rising food availability per
person. Dietary energy supplies have also risen faster than
average dietary energy requirements, resulting in higher
levels of energy adequacy in most developing regions, bar
Western Asia (Table 2). Average dietary energy supply
adequacy – dietary energy supply as a percentage of the
average dietary energy requirement – has risen by almost
10 percent over the last two decades in developing regions
as a whole. This improvement is consistent with the
reduction in undernourishment from about 24 percent to
14 percent of total population between 1990–92 and
2011–13.
The quality of diets has also improved. This is reflected,
for instance, in the decline in the share of dietary energy
derived from cereals and roots and tubers in most regions
since 1990–92 (Figure 8). Overall, the diets of developing
regions have seen a number of improvements over the last
two decades. For example, per capita availability of fruits

18

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

and vegetables, livestock products and vegetable oils
increased by 90, 70 and 32 percent, respectively, since
1990–92. This has translated into generally improved diets,
including a 20 percent increase in protein availability per
person. Only Africa and Southern Asia did not benefit fully
from these improvements; diets in these regions remain
imbalanced and heavily dependent on cereals and roots
and tubers.
Major contributions to food availability come not only
from agriculture, but also from fisheries, aquaculture and
forest products. It is estimated that between 15 and
20 percent of all animal protein consumed is derived from
aquatic animals, which are highly nutritious and serve as a
valuable supplement to diets lacking essential vitamins and
minerals. Forests provide a wide range of highly nutritious
foods, in the form of leaves, seeds, nuts, honey, fruits,
mushrooms, insects and wild animals. In Burkina Faso, for
example, tree foods constitute an important share of rural
diets. It has been reported that 100 grams of a fruit from
the baobab tree correspond to 100 percent of a child’s
recommended daily allowance of iron and potassium,
92 percent of the recommended daily allowance of copper
and 40 percent of the recommended daily allowance of
calcium. An estimated 2.4 billion people, or about one-third
of the population in developing regions, depend on
fuelwood for cooking, sterilizing water and preserving food.

Measuring different dimensions of food security

FIGURE 9

■■ Access to food: significantly improved, in line
with poverty reduction
The ability to access food rests on two pillars: economic and
physical access. Economic access is determined by disposable
income, food prices and the provision of and access to social
support. Physical access is determined by the availability and
quality of infrastructure, including ports, roads, railways,
communication and food storage facilities and other
installations that facilitate the functioning of markets. Incomes
earned in agriculture, forests, fisheries and aquaculture play a
primary role in determining food security outcomes.
Improvements in economic access to food can be
reflected by reduction in poverty rates. Poverty and
undernourishment have both declined over the past 20
years, albeit at different rates. Between 1990 and 2010
undernourishment rates declined from 24 percent to
15 percent in developing regions as a whole, while poverty
rates fell from 47 percent to 24 percent in 2008 (Figure 9).
Economic access to food is also determined by food
prices and people’s purchasing power. The domestic food
price index, defined as the ratio of food purchasing power
parity (PPP) to general PPP, captures the cost of food relative
to total consumption. The ratio has been on an increasing
trend since 2001, but is now found to be at levels consistent
with longer-term trends for most regions (Figure 10).

Measuring different dimensions of food security

■■ Food utilization: marked improvements are
evident in both determinants and outcomes
Food utilization includes two distinct dimensions. The first is
captured by anthropometric indicators affected by
undernutrition that are widely available for children under
five years of age. These include wasting (being too thin for
one’s height), stunting (being too short for one’s age) and
underweight (being too thin for one’s age). Measurements
of children under five years of age are considered effective
approximations of the nutritional status of the entire
population. The second dimension is captured by a number
of determinants or input indicators that reflect food quality
and preparations, health and hygiene conditions,
determining how effectively available food can be utilized.
Outcome indicators of food utilization convey the impact
of inadequate food intake and poor health. Wasting, for
instance, is the result of short-term inadequacy of food
intake, an illness or an infection, whereas stunting is often
caused by prolonged inadequacy of food intake, repeated
episodes of infections and/or repeated episodes of acute
undernutrition.
Prevalence rates for stunting and underweight in
children under five years of age have declined in all
developing regions since 1990, indicating improved
nutrition resulting from enhanced access to and availability
of food (Figure 11). Figure 11 shows that progress in
reducing the prevalence of stunting has been slightly more
limited than for underweight for most regions. However,
many countries in Africa still report prevalence rates of
30 percent or more, which the World Health Organization
(WHO) classifies as high or very high.3 The worst-affected
countries are concentrated in Eastern Africa and the Sahel.
A few countries in Southern Asia also report stunting rates
of up to 50 percent.
Progress in terms of food access and availability is not
always accompanied by progress in food utilization. This
reflects, to some extent, the nature of malnutrition and its
associated anthropometric indicators, which capture not
only the effects of food insecurity but also those of poor
health and diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria, HIV/AIDS
and tuberculosis. Stunting, in particular, is a largely
irreversible symptom of undernutrition; hence
improvements will only be visible over a longer period
of time.
Underweight is a much more sensitive and more direct
indicator of food utilization, showing improvements more
promptly than does stunting. But again, changes at the
global level mask considerable differences among regions.
Much of the reduction in the prevalence of underweight in
children under the age of five can be attributed to
improvements in Asian countries. While Asia as a region still
exhibits the highest prevalence of underweight in preschool
children, Asia also recorded the greatest improvement since
1990, with prevalence rates falling from 33 percent in 1990

to 20 percent in 2010. Progress has been much slower in
Africa, where prevalence rates declined from 23 percent in
1990 to 18 percent in 2010 (Figure 11).
Food utilization is also influenced by the way in which
food is handled, prepared and stored. Good health is a
prerequisite for the human body to absorb nutrients
effectively, and hygienic food helps maintain a healthy body.
Access to clean water is crucial to preparation of clean,
healthy food and maintaining a healthy body.
The last 20 years have seen significant progress in this
area. By 2010, the share of the world’s population without
access to adequate drinking water has fallen to 12 percent
from 24 percent in 1990; thus, the MDG target of halving
the proportion of the population without sustainable access
to safe drinking water and basic sanitation has already been
reached at the global level. Again, however, progress has
been uneven across regions and limited in sub-Saharan
Africa (Figure 12). The most recent data available suggest
that only 61 percent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa
has access to improved water supply, compared with
90 percent in Northern Africa, Latin America and most of
Asia. Similar disparities are found within countries and, in
particular, between urban and rural areas.

■■ Stability: exposure to short-term risks may
endanger long-term progress
Two types of indicator have been identified to measure the
extent and exposure to risk. Key indicators for exposure to
risk include the area equipped for irrigation, which provides
a measure of the extent of exposure to climatic shocks such
as droughts, and the share of food imports in total
merchandise exports, which captures the adequacy of
foreign exchange reserves to pay for food imports. A second
group of indicators captures risks or shocks that directly
affect food security, such as swings in food and input prices,
production and supply. The suite of indicators covers a
number of stability measures, including an indicator of
political instability available from the World Bank.
A thorough and comprehensive review of stability
measures is not possible here because of space constraints.
The content that follows takes a limited and more focused
look at two important aspects of stability, namely those that
pertain to food supply and food price stability.
The recent vagaries of international food markets have
moved vulnerability to food insecurity to the forefront of the
food policy debate. However, newly available data on
changes in consumer prices for food suggest that the
changes in prices on international commodity markets may
have had less impact on consumer prices than initially
expected (see What was the impact of price volatility
observed over recent years?, page 13). Where world price

22

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

shocks induced high domestic volatility, food producers
risked losing the inputs and capital they had invested. The
low capacity of small-scale producers, such as smallholder
farmers, to cope with large swings in input and output
prices makes them risk-averse, lowers their propensity to
adopt and invest in new technologies and ultimately results
in lower overall production.
Together with swings in prices, food supplies have seen
larger-than-normal variability in recent years. However, there
is also evidence that production variability is lower than
price variability, and that consumption variability is smaller
than both production and price variability. Among the main
regions, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean have
experienced the widest fluctuation in food supply since
1990, while variability has been smaller in Asia. Variability in
food production per capita was greatest in Africa and Latin
America and the Caribbean (Figure 13).
The vulnerability dimension of food security is increasingly
cast in the context of climate change. The number of extreme
events such as droughts, floods and hurricanes has increased in
recent years, as has the unpredictability of weather patterns,
leading to substantial losses in production and lower incomes
in vulnerable areas. Changeable weather patterns have played
a part in increasing food price levels and variability. Smallholder
farmers, pastoralists and poor consumers have been particularly
badly affected by these sudden changes.
Climate change may play an even more prominent role in
the coming decades. Mitigating its impacts and preserving

natural resources will be major objectives, especially in
connection with the management of land, water, soil
nutrients and genetic resources. Improved management of
natural resources should focus on reducing variability in
agricultural outputs and increasing resilience to shocks and
long-term climate change.
The pressing need to improve natural resources
management extends well beyond agriculture. Forests and
trees outside forests play a large part in protecting soil and
water resources. They promote soil fertility, regulate climate

and provide habitat for wild pollinators and the predators of
agricultural pests. They can help stabilize agricultural output
and provide protection from extreme weather events.
According to FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010,4
8 percent of the world’s forests (330 million hectares) are
managed specifically to address soil and water conservation
objectives. They not only provide a wide range of nutritious
foods on a regular basis, but they also help protect access to
food in the form of dietary supplements during times of poor
yields, natural calamities and economic hardships.

Highlighting links in the suite of indicators
The next section, Food security dimensions at the national
level, pages 29–41, dives deeper into the relationship
between various food security indicators. A starting point is
the matrix of correlations between indicators (Figure 14).5
This is followed by an analysis at country level of the main
associations and divergences between indicators. For
instance, high rates of food availability occurring together
with low rates of utilization would raise the question of

what impedes the effective use of available food. Likewise,
high rates of undernourishment in the presence of low
rates of poverty would raise the question of why the poor
fail to get access to food. Divergences can also expose
possible measurement problems. Whatever the case,
deviations help shape a research agenda into the causes
and consequences of food insecurity or related
measurement issues.

number of reasons, including the fact that they often show
deviations from typical associations between two food
security indicators.

24

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

■■ Q1: Does improved access to food also mean
better utilization?
In many countries this is the case. A low level of dietary
energy intake, as shown by a high prevalence of
undernourishment, commonly corresponds to high rates of
other forms of malnutrition. A reduction in
undernourishment is generally associated with

Measuring different dimensions of food security

improvements in the overall nutritional status of the
population (Figure 15), although the association is rather
weak, with an R2 of only 28 percent.
The low R2 reflects the frequent exceptions to the lowundernourishment/low-stunting rule, with many outlier
countries in Northern Africa, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa. One such outlier in sub-Saharan Africa is Ghana,
where the prevalence of undernourishment was less than
5 percent in 2011–13, but more than 29 percent of children
under five years of age were reported to be stunted. A
similar picture emerges for Nepal. Mali is an extreme case:
prevalence of undernourishment was estimated at 7 percent
in 2011–13, while 38 percent of children under five years of
age were stunted. The same is true for Viet Nam, with a
prevalence of undernourishment of 8 percent in 2011–13,
but more than 32 percent of children under five years old
were stunted.
Instances of relatively low undernourishment but high
malnutrition may call for policy measures and related
programmes aimed at improving access to safe and
nutritious food, promoting dietary diversity, improving food
safety and supporting hygiene. Stunting, in particular, could
be the outcome of repeated episodes of wasting, which
may have occurred recently enough for the impacts to still
be visible, despite an overall improvement in food security.
Such conditions may arise in countries in which
undernourishment has declined significantly in a short
period of time.

■■ Q2: Does high food availability imply lower
undernourishment?
By and large, countries in which food supplies generally
exceed the amount of food required by the population also
show low levels of undernourishment and undernutrition.
This is evident, for instance, when the prevalence of
undernourishment is plotted against the adequacy of
average dietary energy supply (Figure 16), and confirmed in
the detailed country analyses presented in the next section.
The association between food availability, as measured by
adequacy of average dietary energy supply, and the prevalence
of undernourishment is partly related to the construction of the
indicators. The adequacy of average dietary energy supply
expresses the dietary energy supply as a percentage of the
average dietary energy requirement, and thus this indicator
captures elements applied in measuring undernourishment. The
remaining divergences reflect differences in access
(distributional measures in the prevalence of undernourishment
indicator) and the fact that the prevalence of undernourishment
is based on minimum dietary energy requirements.

■■ Q3: Does high food availability imply better
food utilization?

FIGURE 16

In many countries a similar association holds when
indicators related to the utilization of food, such as the
percentage of children under the age of five who are

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

25

Measuring different dimensions of food security

stunted, are compared with food availability indicators, such
as adequacy of dietary energy supply (Figure 17). This is the
case in most countries discussed in next section, especially in
Bangladesh, Ghana and Nepal. But it also holds for several
other African countries, including Benin, Guinea-Bissau,
Mali and the Niger, all of which have stunting rates of up to
50 percent. In these cases, abundant food supplies have not
translated into better utilization of food and improved
nutrition. This suggests that policy interventions that
improve these aspects of food security may render high
returns. Depending on local context, such measures could
include policies aimed at improving nutrition, support to
increased dietary diversity and food supplementation
programmes.
Country-level results suggest that poor dietary quality is
often associated with poor utilization outcomes, in particular
with high stunting rates (Figure 18). This finding is confirmed
by the more in-depth analysis presented in the country case
studies which appear later in this report. The exception is
Uganda, where diets are traditionally diverse and energy is
derived from foods other than cereals, roots and tubers, such
as matooke, a type of banana.
Other exceptions include Burundi and Pakistan, where
calories from staples account for less than 50 percent of
dietary energy supply, yet the prevalence of stunting is high:
58 percent in Burundi, and 43 percent in Pakistan. In
Pakistan, balanced diets are not available to the poorer
segments of the population, which rely heavily on a few

carbohydrate-rich staples. Policies may therefore be needed
to further support safety nets and access to more diverse and
nutritious food for the poor. Investments in education and
health services are also needed. Best practices for
breastfeeding and the provision of fortified foods may also
be important. In Burundi, however, the overall amount of
food available is low, and even an equally distributed food
supply may not help avoid adverse anthropometric
outcomes, such as a high prevalence of stunting. In this
context, policies to consider include prioritizing increases in
food supplies through increased production and, possibly,
imports.

■■ Q4: Does poverty reduction always imply
hunger reduction?
Poverty plays an important role in the access dimension of
food security. Extreme poverty, as measured by the
proportion of people living on $1.25 a day or less, has
declined considerably since 1990, albeit unevenly across
regions and countries.6 In 1990, the share of people living in
absolute poverty was as high as 48 percent in the developing
regions. Declines were greatest in China and other East Asian
countries but much less in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern
Asia. Overall, preliminary estimates suggest that the
developing world reached the MDG target of halving the
proportion of people living in extreme poverty in 2008, with
24 percent of people living on $1.25 a day or less.

Measuring different dimensions of food security

Higher levels of poverty are linked with higher prevalence
of undernourishment (Figure 19), although there is not a
one-to-one correlation between hunger and extreme
poverty. Low levels of extreme poverty, for instance, do not
necessarily mean low levels of undernourishment, as seen in
the case of Tajikistan. The country is characterized by a low
level of agricultural productivity and, at the same time, food
appears to play a prominent role among essential goods for
large shares of the population. In such circumstances,
enhancing productivity, the effectiveness of food
distribution systems and their ability to deliver enough safe
and nutritious food that consumers can access may result in
quick wins in the fight against both poverty and hunger.
In other countries, high levels of extreme poverty are
associated with low levels of food utilization as a result of
factors such as lack of access to safe water and sanitation.
Examples include Bangladesh and Ghana among the
countries discussed in the next section, along with, for
instance, Chad, Haiti, Liberia and Mozambique. In countries
in which the prevalence of undernourishment is relatively
low, large percentages of the population are approaching
an income level at which their demand for food safety and
hygiene starts rising faster than their demand for additional
basic calories.
There are also countries showing high levels of extreme
poverty and relatively low levels of undernourishment: these
include, inter alia, Nepal, Swaziland and Viet Nam. This
combination tends to be more common than that in which
food insecurity is higher than poverty. In these countries,
the root causes of poverty are less directly related to food
production and distribution systems, and more likely linked
to other economic activities. Therefore, poverty reduction
strategies may need to focus on entry points other than
food and agriculture.
Where food insecurity is more pervasive, its association
with poverty becomes weaker. The reasons for this are
varied. Relatively better-off consumers may, for instance,
use some of their additional income to purchase non-food
items such as cellular phones (an increasingly essential
communication tool), or to shift to more expensive foods,
for example from cassava to rice or from cereals to livestock
products. Some of these shifts may do nothing to increase
energy intake or improve nutrition.
Finally, a close inspection of the available country data
also points to possible measurement problems. For
example, in Nicaragua in 2005, the proportion of people

living in extreme poverty was estimated at 12 percent,
while 25.5 percent of the people were chronically
undernourished in 2005–07. There is evidence that this
disparity reflects a peculiarity in the distribution of people
around the extreme poverty threshold – $1.25 a day – and
their energy intake. For many people, small amounts of
money may help them escape extreme poverty, but not
hunger. For example, in Nicaragua in 2005, those in
extreme poverty lived on just over 9 córdobas a day, the
equivalent of $1.25, which on average bought only
1 459 kcal, as compared with FAO’s minimum dietary
energy requirement of 1 819 kcal per day. But many
people find themselves just over the extreme poverty
threshold: about 32 percent of the population of
Nicaragua lived on 14.6 córdobas ($2) or less in 2005.
Thus, about 20 percent of the population were between
the extreme poverty and the poverty thresholds. On
average, in 2005 14.6 córdobas could buy 1 792 kcal, still
less than the minimum amount needed for light activity
and minimum acceptable weight.

Measuring different dimensions of food security

Key messages
• Food security is a complex condition. Its
dimensions – availability, access, utilization and
stability – are better understood when presented
through a suite of indicators.
• Over the last 20 years, food availability in
developing regions has risen faster than the
average dietary energy requirements, while the
quality of diets has improved. Better economic
access to food is reflected by changes in poverty
rates, which have fallen along with
undernourishment over this period, albeit at
different speeds. The recent vagaries of
international food markets have moved
vulnerability to the forefront of discussions of
food insecurity. The impact of price variability
and spikes on consumers may have been more
limited than initially expected, while food
producers faced high risks.
• Hunger tends to be widespread in countries
with high poverty levels. Hunger is likely to be
more severe than poverty, especially when both
are at elevated levels. As food is one of the

28

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

most income-responsive of all basic necessities,
boosting incomes and providing social safety
nets reduce hunger. Where undernourishment
is less prevalent than poverty, interventions to
improve food utilization are required.
• Ample food availability does not necessarily
enable better food access and utilization.
When poor access and utilization occur, despite
sufficient food availability, social protection, as
well as improvements in food distribution and
supplementation programmes, should be
prioritized.
• Undernourishment and undernutrition can
coexist. However, in some countries,
undernutrition rates, as indicated by the
proportion of stunted children, are
considerably higher than the prevalence of
undernourishment, as indicated by inadequacy
of dietary energy supply. In these countries,
nutrition-enhancing interventions are crucial to
improve the nutritional aspects of food
security. Improvements require a range of food
security and nutrition-enhancing interventions
in agriculture, health, hygiene, water supply
and education, particularly targeting women.

Food security dimensions at
the national level

A

lthough the 2015 MDG hunger goal remains
within reach, progress is not even and many
countries are unlikely to meet the goal of halving
the prevalence of undernourishment by 2015. Many of these
countries face severe constraints. For example, countries that
have experienced conflict during the past two decades are
more likely to have seen significant setbacks in reducing
hunger. Landlocked countries often lag behind coastal
countries as they face persistent challenges in accessing
world markets, while developing countries with poor
infrastructure and weak institutions find it difficult to
implement policies to increase agricultural productivity and
address inequities of access to food.
This section looks at six countries – Bangladesh, Ghana,
Nepal, Nicaragua, Tajikistan and Uganda – in more detail,
finding a mixed picture of progress and setbacks, successes
and shortfalls in the fight against hunger. Reducing poverty
and hunger requires successful efforts over a long period of
time, but the conditions – environmental, social, economic
and political – that leave people vulnerable vary considerably
from one country to another.
Bangladesh, Ghana and Nicaragua have all managed to
halve the prevalence of undernourishment since the

beginning of the 1990s. This achievement is the result of a
combination of factors, such as robust economic growth
over decades, freer trade and, for Ghana and Nicaragua,
political stability and favourable international market
conditions characterized by high export prices. But, above all,
it was the commitment of consecutive governments to longterm rural development and poverty-reducing plans that has
shaped the dynamics of change.
Nepal experienced a period of prolonged conflict and
political uncertainty which weakened the effectiveness of its
institutions in both producing food and improving access to it.
Nevertheless, the country seems on track to reach the MDG
hunger goal by 2015. Tajikistan, landlocked and with poor
infrastructure and little additional land to bring into
agricultural production, looks unlikely to reach the hunger
target. Incomplete land reform in Tajikistan has slowed growth
in agricultural productivity and incomes, but this has to some
extent been offset by inflow of remittances from migrants.
Uganda still faces significant challenges in undernourishment. With one of the highest population growth rates
in the world, low agricultural productivity growth and a large
part of the population living on $1.25 a day or less, the country
seems unlikely to reach the 2015 hunger target.

Bangladesh: Long-term commitment
to food security spurs significant progress
Food security in Bangladesh is challenged by a host of factors
ranging from the country’s ever-increasing population
density, climate change, scarce natural resources (with nearly
no agricultural land left untilled), vulnerability to price shocks
and persistent poverty. In spite of these constraints,
Bangladesh has already met the MDG hunger target

(Figure 20). This remarkable feat was achieved in the context
of rapid economic growth in the 1990s spurred by significant
growth in agricultural productivity7 and driven by a
combination of factors including macroeconomic stability,
liberalization of input markets and opening up of the
economy.

However, some 25 million people remain undernourished,
and the prevalence of undernourishment has been rising slowly
since the mid-2000s. Food security therefore remains high on
the agenda of the government, and is being mainstreamed in
policies. A comprehensive National Food Policy developed in
2008 was followed in 2011 by the Country Investment Plan,
which provides stakeholders with a clear roadmap for
investment in agriculture, food security and nutrition.
Agricultural productivity has increased substantially, with
average yields and the value of food production per capita
rising significantly since the mid-1990s (Figure 20). Private
seed firms are being encouraged to enter the agricultural
seed sector and regulatory frameworks are being
strengthened.8 Irrigation has spread widely through
sustained public infrastructure development programmes,
but the focus has now shifted to promoting water-saving
farming practices to deal with declining aquifer levels and
the increasing cost of irrigation.9 Bangladesh Bank is
increasing credit supply to farmers in an attempt to boost
agricultural production; special attention is given to the
needs of small-scale farmers because the vast and vibrant
microfinance sector is unable to reach the poorest sections.10
The commitment of successive governments to poverty
alleviation has resulted in considerable progress in poverty
reduction, which mirrors growth in GDP per capita
(Figure 21). The decline in poverty has been matched by
similar declines in undernutrition, and Bangladesh appears to
be on track to achieve its MDG target of reducing the
percentage of children who are underweight to 33 percent
by 2015 (Figure 21). However, considerable regional

30

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

disparities exist and progress in tackling undernutrition has
been slowing in recent years. This indicates that higher
incomes alone are not sufficient to reduce undernutrition.
In 2009, cereals still provided 78.3 percent of all calories
consumed. Moving away from cereals and into a variety of
high-value food products would not only make more
nutritious food available, but would also create an
opportunity to increase farmers’ incomes. The Country
Investment Plan therefore gives priority to developing
sustainable and diversified agriculture. The development
of biofortified crops through programmes such as
HarvestPlus and the Golden Rice Project is an example of
how nutrition and agriculture can be integrated to tackle
these issues.
Little progress has been made in reducing the proportion
of women who are anaemic (42 percent in 2011 compared
with 45 percent in 2004), and anaemia still constitutes a
severe public health problem in the country. Gender-based
differences, notably in wages and in access to inputs and
markets, also have an impact on food security and
nutrition.11 Many households have chosen international and
national migration as a livelihood strategy. From the early
1990s onwards, almost a quarter of a million people
migrated abroad every year, generating an income inflow
from remittances amounting to some 10 percent of GDP in
2011–12.12
Bangladesh has in place a significant safety net
programme complemented by efforts of numerous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to help those who are
unable to reap the benefits from emerging productive

opportunities and the decline in poverty. This programme has
been quite responsive to the adverse effects of price volatility
on the poor. In reaction to the 2007–08 price crisis, for
example, an employment generation programme was
designed to provide financial relief to the most vulnerable
during the lean seasons while building infrastructure. An
improved version of this programme, together with other
safety nets and NGO programmes, such as the multidonor
Chars Livelihoods Programme, has succeeded in recent years
in eradicating the often acute seasonal hunger experienced
in the northwest of the country.

Problems of mistargeting and inefficiencies do exist,
however, leaving some households outside of safety net
assistance.13 To deal with such issues, the government is
developing a national social protection strategy, building on
the success of existing programmes and including
innovations meant to help the poor to graduate out of
poverty.14 The Country Investment Plan also aims to develop
institutions and capacity to enhance the effectiveness of
safety nets, calling for strengthening of partnerships with
NGOs, some of which are experimenting with models that
facilitate the graduation of households out of poverty.

Ghana: Impressive and broadly shared economic
growth fuels food security achievement
Ghana is considered a success story in Africa for its robust
economic growth over the past three decades – GDP grew
by an average of 4.5 percent a year since 1983 and by an
impressive 14 percent in 201115 (Figure 22). This has been
fostered by political stability (Figure 23), market reforms,
favourable terms of trade (higher gold and cocoa prices)
and a good investment climate. The success of the

economic programmes and reforms show what sustained
political commitment and partnership with the donor
community can achieve.16 Ghana is well on track to meet
its MDG poverty target before 2015, and had met its 2015
MDG hunger target by 2000–02 (Figure 23). In 2011–13
less than 5 percent of the population were
undernourished.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

Food security dimensions at the national level

Ghana’s economy depends heavily on agriculture; more
than half of the country’s workforce is involved in this
sector. In the 1990s, a series of policies and institutional
reforms, together with a corresponding set of investments,
led to sustained increases in food production by Ghana’s
smallholder farmers.17 Per capita food production increased
by 55 percent between 1990–92 and 2008–10. Reforming
the cocoa sector, which was implicitly taxed, played a
crucial role in agricultural growth. Investments in research
and development on roots and tubers and extension efforts
were also successful in introducing innovative production
methods, leading to yield increases and the development of
new, more resilient varieties.18
Ghana’s impressive GDP growth, averaging 5 percent per
year since 2001, has reached a large part of the population,
with extreme poverty declining from 51.7 percent in 1991 to
28.5 percent in 2006 (Figure 22). About 5 million people
have been lifted out of poverty in just 15 years because the
benefits of the rapid economic growth were broadly shared,
especially with people in rural areas, who benefited from
increased production and the creation of vibrant markets.
The major beneficiaries of rising rural incomes were smallscale producers of cocoa and farmers producing fruits and
vegetables.
Despite rapid progress in reducing poverty and hunger,
Ghana has made less progress in reducing undernutrition
(Figure 22). Although the proportion of children under five
years of age who are underweight has been nearly halved
since 1993–95, less progress has been made in reducing

prevalence of stunting, and about 23 percent of children
under five years of age were stunted in 2011. Underlying
causes of undernutrition include poverty, high disease burden
and lack of access to deworming medication, lack of
adequate child feeding practices at key stages of
development and poor sanitation facilities. Inadequate access
to sanitation facilities is a major cause of waterborne chronic
diseases, acute infections and infant or child mortality.
Despite considerable improvement in access to safe water
sources over the past three decades, access to adequate
sanitation facilities is still very poor.
Considerable differences still exist in poverty and nutrition
at the regional level. Overall, rural people are up to four
times more likely to live below the poverty line than are
people in urban areas. The prevalence of poverty is the
highest in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions,
which are characterized agro-ecologically as rural savannah.19
These disparities are reflected in diets. People from
worse-off areas consume a diet that is much less diverse
and contains much less protein in the form of meat, fish,
eggs or milk than do people in better-off areas.
The National Social Protection Strategy launched in 2007
is an integrated social protection framework that addresses
the needs of vulnerable groups that have not benefited
from economic growth. It targets policies to the extreme
poor and highly vulnerable, notably through its main
programme, Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty, a
conditional cash transfer programme.20

Nepal: Political stability is necessary to make
progress sustainable and more evenly distributed
Nepal has made great strides in its fight against hunger since
1990–92, with the prevalence of undernourishment
declining from 25.4 percent in 1990–92 to 16.0 percent in
2011–13. If it continues to progress at this rate, it will reach
the MDG target on hunger by 2015 (Figure 24). This
progress is all the more remarkable given the civil strife from
the mid-1990s to 2006, the weakness of the country’s
infrastructure and the relatively low state of development of
agriculture. In spite of progress in the fight against hunger,
however, undernutrition is still widespread. The prevalences
of underweight and stunting in children are among the
highest in the world. Between 1995 and 2011, the
prevalence of underweight in children declined from 44 to
29 percent, while the prevalence of stunting declined from
64 to 40 percent (Figure 24). Combating undernutrition
poses great challenges for both short-term (e.g. implementation
of safety nets) and long-term (e.g. structural development)
policy measures.
Nepal is a predominantly mountainous country with poor
transport, communication and power infrastructure.

Agriculture, the mainstay of its economy, is hindered by
relatively low productivity as compared with other countries
in the region, and by a limited land resource base. Lack of
roads, inadequate capital, insufficient access to output and
input markets and poor access to affordable credit hinder
the adoption of modern and productive farming
technologies, resulting in producers relying on traditional
agriculture.
Although policies have been in place to promote
agricultural research, technology adoption and infrastructure
development, their impact was diluted by both the years of
conflict and the prolonged political transition that followed
(see Figure 23), both of which resulted in a decline in the
effectiveness of some institutions and programmes.
Nevertheless, the average dietary energy supply in the
country has been adequate to meet the food requirements
of the population (Figure 25), partly as a result of modest
increases in food production since 1990–92 (the value of
food production per capita has increased by 12 percent) and
partly because of increased food imports.

Given that there is enough food in the country,
undernourishment is mainly caused by problems in economic
access. At the national level, Nepal has met the MDG
poverty target, having reduced extreme poverty rates from
68 percent in 1996 to 25 percent in 2010. Nevertheless,
the country is still one of the poorest in the world.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

However, reduction in poverty, and therefore hunger, in
Nepal is not so much the result of the development of
Nepal’s economy but of a large increase in remittances
from migrant workers; in 2011–12 these amounted to
23 percent of GDP.21 While remittance income has helped
significantly reduce poverty and food insecurity, the

Food security dimensions at the national level

migration on which it is based has adversely affected
agricultural productivity, as those who out-migrate are
usually the male members of farm families. Women are
left to do all the farm management and labour on their
own. It is estimated that around 30 percent of the poor
are in female-headed households, most of them engaged
in agriculture. Given this important role of women in food
production, policies should be put in place to enable them
to enhance productivity and to encourage efficient use of
remittances for investment.
Progress in the fight against poverty and hunger has
been extremely uneven across the country. For example, in
2010 the incidence of poverty ranged from 9 percent of the
urban population in the Hills region to 42 percent of the
rural population in the Mountains region.22 Economic and
physical constraints to access to food render many
households unable to acquire enough food to meet their
minimum needs. Physical constraints are significant. Nepal
has few roads, and most of these are of poor quality: the
country’s road density in 2008 was about 13.5 kilometres
per 100 square kilometres of land area, as compared with
an average of 72 kilometres per 100 square kilometres in
Southern Asia as a whole. In remote areas there are few
markets and commodity prices are high because of high

transportation costs. For example, rice in difficult-to-access
regions can cost three times as much as in Terai, a region
bordering India and the most productive agricultural zone
in the country.23
Food security varies across the country. In the Mountains
region, staples provide more than 75 percent of calories in
60 percent of households, compared with only 13 percent
of households in urban Kathmandu. Lack of diversity in
diets results in undernutrition being prevalent even among
children younger than six months of age, suggesting that
poor nutrition constrains growth even before birth. Indeed,
maternal undernutrition is a serious problem in Nepal:
35 percent of women of reproductive age and 46 percent
of children are anaemic.24
With food prices in the country increasing since 2004,
poor and food-insecure households have become more and
more food-insecure as high food prices have put increasing
stress on family budgets. On average, households in Nepal
spend 60 percent of their income on food; poor and very
poor households spend an even larger proportion on food.
Almost a quarter of the population, mostly rural, allocates
more than 75 percent of their budget to food, making
them extremely vulnerable to price spikes such as those
experienced since 2008.

Nicaragua: Economic and political stability
and sound policies addressing smallholders
and the vulnerable pay off
Since the early 1990s, the adequacy of average dietary
energy supply has increased steadily in Nicaragua while the
prevalence of undernourishment fell from 55 percent in
1990–92 to less than 22 percent in 2011–13 (Figure 26).
Nicaragua achieved the 2015 MDG hunger target between
2000–02 and 2005–07. However, this is no reason for
complacency as the current prevalence of undernourishment
is still a high 22 percent.
Much of this progress is the result of the period of
economic and political stability experienced after several
years of political and economic turmoil in the 1980s and a
succession of costly natural disasters. This stability allowed
the government to shift the focus from short-term
emergency relief to long-term development and povertytargeting plans.
Well-targeted policies, diversified food production,
increased access to new international markets through

participation in the Central America Free Trade Agreement
and, at least for some periods, beneficial terms of trade
partially cushioned the effects of the natural disasters and
allowed the agriculture sector to start developing. The per
capita value of food production has increased by
68 percent since 1990–92, bringing dietary energy supply
adequacy above 100 percent by the beginning of the new
millennium (Figure 26). Increased supplies of beans and
vegetables have raised the daily average protein supply
from 46 grams per capita in 1990–92 to 65 grams per
capita in 2007–09.
Most of Nicaragua’s agriculture is small scale, labour
intensive and characterized by constraints in raising its
productivity. The proportion of arable land equipped for
irrigation remains extremely low (3.2 percent in 2007–09)
and adoption of more modern productive technologies is
hampered by low incomes, low educational levels and

limited access to credit. In an effort to overcome these
constraints, the government has developed programmes such
as the Agro-seeds Programme which promotes technology
transfer and the Productive Food Programme which has given
about 75 000 poor rural households access to land and other
productive assets, such as animals, seeds and fertilizer.25
Economic growth since the early 1990s has been
insufficient to reduce poverty levels substantially, but some
progress was registered after 2005 thanks to higher growth
rates and an improved distribution of income.26 In 2005,
32 percent of the population still lived on $2 a day or less
(Figure 27). Poverty rates differed markedly between regions
and were up to four times as high in rural areas as in urban
areas. The proportion of people living in extreme poverty
($1.25 per day or less) declined from 18 percent in 1993 to
12 percent in 2005. If this rate of decline continues, the
country is on track to meet the MDG target of halving the
prevalence of extreme poverty by 2015. Despite the
widespread poverty, the enhancement of agricultural
productivity, especially that of smallholder farmers, and the
resultant increase in the availability of food has contributed
significantly to reducing the prevalence of hunger. Article 69
of Nicaragua´s Constitution makes explicit provisions for the
right of people to be protected against hunger and the role
of the state to promote availability of food and equitable
access to it. In 2009, Parliament passed a Food and Nutrition
Security and Sovereignty Law, establishing the institutional
and governance framework for food security and nutrition in
order to protect and guarantee people’s right to adequate
food, define the mechanisms for intersectoral and

36

multistakeholder coordination and the main policy areas to
be addressed.27
Prevalence of undernutrition has declined since 1990
but 23 percent of children under five years old were
recorded as stunted in 2007, albeit down from nearly
30 percent in 1993 (Figure 27).
Marked differences are observed in nutritional levels
depending on income group and geographic location,
reflecting variations in access to antenatal and child care
and to adequate sanitation. The government has put in
place a number of programmes to address these problems,
such as the Red de Protección Social. This conditional cash
transfer programme implemented from 2000 to 2006
resulted in a five percentage point decline in stunting in
under-fives after just two years of implementation.28
Nicaragua’s geographical position and geomorphology
make it especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Over the last
30 years, storms, floods and other disasters have killed more
than 4 000 people and caused much economic loss. Poor
farming households, most of which are reliant on rainfed
agriculture, are particularly vulnerable to disasters and
unpredictable weather. Lessons have been learned, however,
and disasters in the 2000s have caused much less economic
damage than those in the 1980s or 1990s. Nicaragua’s
comprehensive and multisectoral approach to disaster risk
management includes programmes that help households cope
with the immediate effects of disasters, but also offer them
the option to be involved in new and more economically
rewarding opportunities that have long-term impact on their
earnings and increase their resilience to weather shocks.29

Tajikistan: Structural changes in agriculture
are needed to create resilience against external
shocks and programmes are needed to ensure
adequate diets for the vulnerable
During the 1990s, Tajikistan, a landlocked country in Central
Asia, experienced a difficult transition from a centrallyplanned to a market economy and a civil war from 1992 to
1997, resulting in little progress in reducing poverty and
hunger (Figure 28). However, the economy grew by up to
9 percent per year between 2000 and 2008 as a result of
improved policies, public investment, donor assistance, a
favourable external environment, with high world prices for
the country’s main exports (cotton and aluminium), and
increasing remittances from migrants. Nevertheless, Tajikistan
remains one of the poorest countries in the region, with GDP
per capita only recently recovering to a level comparable
with pre-war levels in real terms.
Although progress in reducing undernourishment since the
early 2000s has been good, almost one in three people is still
chronically undernourished according to the most recent

estimate. Since 1999, the percentage of children who are
stunted has declined only marginally, reflecting sustained periods
of undernutrition (Figure 28). The country’s main challenges
remain addressing long-term agricultural development needs,
and achieving the high and sustainable levels of economic
growth necessary to reduce poverty and hunger.
During the 1990s, agricultural production was severely
affected by the civil war and the dismantling of the centrallyplanned economy, but since the early 2000s it has increased
by nearly 6 percent per year. Most of the increase was the
result of productivity gains in the private farm sector and on
household plots, which together account for some 82 percent
of agricultural land in Tajikistan (59 percent on private farms
and 23 percent on household plots).30 By 2006, family-run
household plots were producing 50 percent of the country’s
crops and 94 percent of its aggregate livestock output.

Food security dimensions at the national level

Delays in reforming the agriculture sector and lack of clarity
concerning property rights weakened incentives for farmers to
invest and increase agricultural productivity. Currently, the
reform process is being deepened by shifting local authorities’
functions away from intervening in farm activities and
production decisions and towards helping farmers to respond to
price signals through the provision of information, training and
development of agricultural input markets and rural finance.31

Vigorous and sustained economic growth since 2000 has led
to a fivefold increase in GDP per capita (albeit from an extremely
low base of US$178 in 1999). This, together with large
increases in remittances over the same period, resulted in a
large decline in extreme poverty, from over half of the
population in 1999 to about 6.5 percent in 2009 (Figure 29).
Progress in poverty reduction is, however, very uneven over the
various regions within the country. Partly as a result of

incomplete land reform, high rates of poverty still prevail in rural
areas; in several regions about half of the people were still poor
in 2009 and more that 15 percent lived below the extreme
poverty threshold, with limited access to nutritious food.32
Poor transport infrastructure, especially in mountainous
regions, limits access to nutritious food in many parts of the
country. Poor children derive about 60 percent of their
calorie intake from bread and flour products and 16 percent
from fats and oils, with meat and vegetables providing a
mere 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Lack of dietary
diversity results in widespread vitamin and mineral
deficiencies; these can have serious and long-lasting
consequences for individual welfare and for the country’s
socio-economic development.
As a result of the low productivity of its agriculture,
Tajikistan depends heavily on food imports. According to the

most recent estimate, the country imports about half of the
cereals it consumes, and the cost of food imports is absorbing
a gradually increasing share of total merchandise export
revenue. The global economic recession that followed the
food price surge in 2007–08 resulted in a temporary but
significant decline in the inflow of remittances, which
accounted for nearly half of Tajikistan’s GDP in 2008, and a fall
in export earnings from cotton and aluminium, the country’s
two main exports. The resultant decrease in both national and
household income seriously hampered progress towards
poverty reduction and food security (Figure 29). Remittances
have since increased again, reaching 50 percent of GDP in
2011, sustaining the fight against poverty and hunger.
However, this underlines the country’s vulnerability to external
shocks.

Uganda: Sluggish growth in agricultural
productivity results in setbacks
Since the early 2000s, the prevalence of undernourishment in
Uganda has been increasing and the country is unlikely to
achieve the MDG hunger target by 2015 (Figure 30). The
upward trend in the prevalence of undernourishment is the
result of growth in food production failing to keep up with
population growth, which, with an annual rate of more than
3.2 percent, is among the highest in the world.
Food production per capita has been declining since
2002–04 (Figure 30).33 Dietary energy supply, which includes
the energy supplied by imported food, has also declined
since 2003–05, but remains – on average – adequate to
meet the energy requirements of the population. However,
unequal distribution and access to food mean that almost
one-third of the population remains chronically
undernourished.
The low productivity growth in Ugandan agriculture is,
at least partly, the result of the limited use of modern
technology and inputs. Given the country’s high population
density –173 people per square kilometre – intensive
methods of farming are becoming increasingly necessary.
To tackle this challenge the government has initiated a
number of policies aimed at facilitating the adoption of
modern technologies by smallholder farmers. For example,
the National Agricultural Advisory Services programme, a
public–private approach to extension service delivery, has
been successful in promoting adoption of improved
varieties of crops and some other yield-enhancing
technologies.34

Under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Programme, the Government of Uganda has committed
itself to increasing public spending on agriculture to
10 percent of the national budget. In 2010–11, however,
government spending on agriculture amounted to only
5 percent, down from 7.6 percent in the previous year.35 If
Uganda is to realize its agricultural potential, the government
must provide public goods such as extension services and
irrigation, transport and communication infrastructure to
allow smallholder farmers, who account for over 95 percent
of all farms, to increase their productivity. Increasing
agricultural productivity will not only contribute towards
increased food security, but will also allow the country to
produce a surplus, particularly of cereals, for export to fooddeficit regions in Africa.
Per capita food production is much more variable in
Uganda than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, largely
because of limited use of irrigation (Figure 31). With less
than 1 percent of the land being irrigated, Ugandan
agriculture relies almost exclusively on rainfed production.
Crop yields, and therefore prices, reflect fluctuations in
rainfall.
Over the last decade, the country has seen an increase in
the variability of rainfall and a higher frequency of extreme
climate events. For example, the 2010–11 rainfall deficits
caused an estimated loss of US$1.2 billion or 7.5 percent of
the country’s GDP. In the north-eastern Karamoja region,
consecutive years of poor weather conditions and below-

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

Food insecurity is more prevalent in rural areas than in
urban areas and considerable differences are observed across
the country. Since 1997, government expenditure on health
care has increased, with more people, especially the poorest,
using government health centres.37 Better health care and
child care practices, together with reductions in poverty and

Food security dimensions at the national level

improvements in water and sanitation under the
government’s Poverty Eradication Action Plan, have
contributed towards improved nutrition in recent years.38 The
percentage of stunted children declined from 44.8 percent in
2001 to 33.4 percent in 2011, and the prevalence of
underweight children decreased from 21.5 percent in 1995
to 13.8 percent in 2011.

Key messages
• Policies aimed at enhancing agricultural
productivity and increasing food availability,
especially when smallholders are targeted, can
achieve hunger reduction even where poverty is
widespread. When they are combined with
social protection and other measures that
increase the incomes of poor families to buy
food, they can have an even more positive
impact and spur rural development, by creating
vibrant markets and employment opportunities,
making possible equitable economic growth.

Regional differences in nutrition outcomes are significant.
Across regions, high rates of poverty and poor access to
clean water and sanitation are reflected in high
undernutrition rates; in Karamoja, for example, in 2011,
32 percent of children under five years of age were
underweight, compared with only 6 percent in Kampala, the
country’s capital.

• Remittances, which have globally become three
times larger than official development
assistance, have had significant impacts on
poverty and food security. This report suggests
that remittances can help to reduce poverty,
leading to reduced hunger, better diets and,
given appropriate policies, increased on-farm
investment.
• Long-term commitment to mainstreaming food
security and nutrition in public policies and
programmes is key to hunger reduction.
Keeping food security and agriculture high on
the development agenda, through
comprehensive reforms, improvements in the
investment climate, supported by sustained
social protection, is crucial for achieving major
reductions in poverty and undernourishment.

Annex 2
The prevalence of undernourishment indicator
What is the prevalence of
undernourishment indicator?
The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator is a longestablished measure, maintained by the FAO Statistics Division.
The indicator was first presented in 1963, with the Third World
Food Survey and then progressively refined.39
The methodology for estimating the PoU is based on the
comparison of a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary
energy consumption, f(x), and a threshold level, called the
minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). Both are based on
the notion of an average individual in the reference population.40
Formally, the PoU is estimated as follows:
(1)
In other words, the PoU is the probability that, after randomly
selecting one individual from the population, (s)he is found to be
consuming an amount of dietary energy that is insufficient to
cover his or her requirement for an active and healthy life. This
probability is taken as an estimate of the likely proportion of
people that are undernourished in the population. An estimate of
the number of undernourished (NoU) is then produced by
multiplying the estimated PoU by the population size. The PoU
and NoU have been adopted as indicators used to monitor
progress towards the targets set by the Millennium Development
Goals (in particular, the hunger target of MDG 1) and at the
World Food Summit, respectively.
It is worth emphasizing that the probability distribution used to
draw inference on the habitual levels of dietary energy
consumption in a population, f(x), refers to a typical level of daily
energy consumption during a year. As such, f(x) does not reflect
possible implications of insufficient food consumption levels that
may prevail over shorter periods of time. If, and only if, the
average food consumption over such a period is below
requirement, the indicator would signal a condition of
undernourishment.
Moreover, given that both the probability distribution f(x) and
the threshold level in (1) are associated with the representative
individual of the population – that is, a statistical construct
corresponding to an individual of average age, sex, stature and
physical activity level – they do not represent, respectively, the
empirical distribution of per capita food in the population and a
threshold level that is meaningful for any actual individual in the
population.

Three frequent critiques
In recent years the FAO methodology has been exposed to three
major critiques:
1. The indicator is based on a narrow definition of “hunger”,
covering only chronic conditions of inadequate dietary energy

46

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

intake. Other aspects of food inadequacy, for example
micronutrient deficiencies, are not captured.
2. The PoU indicator systematically underestimates
undernourishment, as it assumes a minimum level of physical
activity, typical of a sedentary lifestyle. Hence the indicator
neglects the fact that many poor people are engaged in
demanding physical activities.
3. The methodology is complex and based on allegedly weak
macro data, whereas household surveys alone allow for a direct
and more accurate measurement of undernourishment.
The first concern is indeed justified. The PoU indicator is designed
to capture a clearly – and narrowly – defined concept of
undernourishment, namely a state of dietary energy deprivation
lasting over a year. This report is addressing this limitation by
presenting and discussing measures of different dimensions of food
security, through the FAO suite of food security indicators. The suite
comprises numerous indicators that reflect aspects associated with
the elements of a broader concept of food insecurity and hunger.
The second criticism is unfounded as the object of the criticism
is actually a virtue of the methodology that is not always and not
easily appreciated. As already mentioned, the FAO methodology is
based on a probabilistic approach and a representative individual.
Ideally, the adequacy of dietary energy intake, and thus the
condition of being undernourished, would be assessed at the
individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with
individual energy intake. This would allow the prevalence of
undernourishment to be estimated by counting the number of
people who are classified as undernourished. Such a “headcount”
approach, however, is not feasible for two reasons. First, individual
energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard
data collection methods.41 Second, individual food consumption
cannot be measured precisely because of disparities in intrahousehold food allocation, the variability of individual energy
requirements, and the day-to-day variability of food consumption
that can arise for reasons that are independent from food
insecurity (including different workloads or lifestyles, or cultural
and religious habits).
Given that it is practically impossible to proceed with a
headcount approach, the solution adopted by FAO has been to
apply the PoU, which is an estimator that refers to the population
as a whole, summarized by the statistical device of a
“representative” individual. Obviously, when considering the
population as a whole, it must be recognized that, as body
weight, metabolic efficiency and physical activity levels will vary in
the represented population, there is a range of values for energy
requirements that are compatible with healthy status. It follows
that only values below the minimum of such a range can be
associated with undernourishment, in a probabilistic sense. Hence,
for the PoU to indicate that a randomly selected individual in a
population is undernourished, the appropriate threshold must be
set at the lower end of the range of normal energy requirements.
The third criticism ignores the high costs of implementing
surveys capable of properly estimating undernourishment for the
vast majority of the countries monitored by FAO. At a minimum,

Annex 2
these surveys should capture food consumption at the individual
level and should contain sufficient information to assess habitual
consumption levels, as well as information on the anthropometric
characteristics and activity levels of each surveyed individual that
would enable the relevant individual energy requirement
threshold to be estimated. These data requirements suggest that
specific surveys, different from and more expensive than existing
household surveys, would need to be designed for this purpose. By
contrast, the FAO PoU methodology allows the integration of
information from household surveys with macro data sources,
such as food balances, censuses and demographic surveys.

Computing the PoU in practice
Estimating equation (1) requires an analytic expression for f(x),
and the identification of the MDER threshold.
The functional form for the probability distribution f(x) is chosen
from a parametric family. Its characterization is obtained by
estimating parameters for the mean, the coefficient of variation
(CV) and the coefficient of skewness. Improving estimates of these
parameters based on available data from various sources is a
continuing endeavour of the FAO Statistics Division.

■■ The choice of a model for the distribution
Starting with the estimates produced for the Sixth World Food
Survey in 1996, the distribution was assumed to be lognormal.
This model is very convenient from the analytic point of view, but
has limited flexibility, especially in capturing the skewness of the
distribution.
During the revision of the methodology conducted in 2011
and 2012, attention was drawn to the fact that raising the mean
while keeping the CV constant under the lognormal distribution
would result in non-negligible probability of unreasonably high
levels of energy consumption. Rather, it seems more plausible
that an increase in mean food consumption would make the
distribution less skewed, as the relative increase in consumption
among those who already consume above the average is likely to
be smaller than for those consuming below the average.
The search for a more flexible model led to the adoption of
the skew-normal and skew-lognormal families of distributions
introduced by Azzalini,42 with the results published in The State
of Food Insecurity in the World 2012.

■■ Estimating mean food consumption
To estimate per capita dietary energy consumption in a country,
FAO has traditionally relied on its own food balance sheets, which
are available for more than 180 countries. This choice was mainly
due to a lack of suitable surveys conducted on a regular basis in
most countries. Through data on production, trade and utilization
of food commodities, the total amount of dietary energy
available for human consumption in a country for a one-year
period is derived using food composition data, allowing
computation of per capita dietary energy supply (DES).

During the revision conducted in 2011 and 2012, it was noted
that losses of otherwise available food might occur after the food
has been produced and made available for consumption, most
notably during distribution at the retail level.43 A first step toward
addressing this problem was taken in 2012, by introducing a
parameter that captures food losses during distribution at the
retail level. Region-specific values of average calorie losses have
been estimated based on data provided in a recent FAO study of
food losses,44 ranging from 2 percent of the quantity distributed
for dry grains, up to 10 percent for perishable products such as
fresh fruit and vegetables.45

■■ Estimating the coefficients of variation and
skewness
Data from representative national household surveys are the only
reliable source for directly estimating the other parameters of
food consumption distributions.46
Different types of household survey, including income,
expenditure and living standard measurement surveys, collect
information on food acquisition (commonly referred to as
“consumption” by economists). Their features and the quality of
the information collected have implications for the estimates of
habitual dietary energy consumption. In this connection, two
main issues are noteworthy.
First, while undernourishment is considered an individual
condition, data on food consumption are usually available only at
the household level. Hence, individual food consumption can
only be approximated by dividing available food by the number
of household members.
Second, in most cases surveys collect data in terms of
quantities of food acquired over a reference period. From these
quantities, one needs to infer the levels of individual energy
intake. The conversion of food quantities into dietary energy and
making the distinction between acquisition and consumption
often require large approximations. As these result in
overestimation of the level of individual dietary energy intake in
some cases and underestimation in others,47 the simple sample
variance of food consumption would not be a proper estimator
of the variance of habitual food consumption in the population,
which is needed to estimate of the CV of food consumption of
the representative individual.
To control for such excessive variation in the data, in the past
per capita caloric consumption figures were tabulated by
household income class and the variation in average caloric
consumption between income classes was calculated.48 The
resulting CV – labelled as “due to income” (
) – excludes
variability in habitual food consumption that is uncorrelated to
household income. The “total” CV of habitual food consumption
for the representative individual was then obtained using the
following equation:

where
reflects variation caused by factors that induce
variability in food consumption and are not correlated to
income.49 With the 2011–12 revision of the methodology, a more
advanced method for estimating the CV and skewness in food

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

47

Annex 2
consumption has been implemented. This is based on regression
analysis that decomposes the total variation of food consumption
into two components: one that reflects the variability of habitual
food consumption and another that, due to the variability of
observed consumption around its mean, is unrelated to the
concept of food insecurity that informs the PoU estimator.
Research is continuing within the FAO Statistics Division on how to
decompose most effectively the total variation present in food
consumption data from available surveys.

■■ Estimating the MDER threshold
To calculate the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER)
threshold, FAO employs normative energy requirement standards
based on the result of the joint FAO/WHO/UNU expert
consultation that produced the most up-to-date reference for
human energy requirements.50 These standards are obtained by
calculating the needs for basic metabolism (i.e. the energy
expended by the human body in a state of rest) and multiplying
the latter by a factor greater than one, to take into account the

physical activity associated with a normal and active life (referred
to as the PAL [physical activity level] index).
As individual metabolic efficiency and physical activity levels are
variable within groups of the same age and sex, energy
requirements can only be expressed as ranges for such groups. To
derive the MDER threshold, the minimum of each range for adults
and adolescents is specified on the basis of the distribution of
ideal body weights and the midpoint of the values of the PAL
index associated with sedentary lifestyle (1.55). The lowest body
weight for a given height that is compatible with good health is
estimated on the basis of the fifth percentile of the distribution of
body mass indices in healthy populations.51 Once the minimum
requirement for each sex-age group has been established, the
population-level MDER threshold is obtained as a weighted
average, considering the relative frequency of individuals in each
group as weights.
That the threshold is determined with reference to light
physical activity (as normally associated with a sedentary lifestyle)
does not negate the fact that the population also includes persons
engaged in moderate and intense physical activity. It is just one

BOX A2.1

Early projections misjudged number of undernourished in 2009–10

In the early months of 2008, the FAO Food Price Index had
reached a new and pronounced high. This food price crisis,
coupled with what appeared to be a worldwide economic crisis,
led to concerns that the number of food-insecure people in the
world would increase substantially. FAO was put under
considerable pressure to provide early estimates of what the
likely impacts on undernourishment might be, before the actual
data needed to inform the PoU estimate were available. In
response to such pressure, new ad hoc methods to gauge the
likely increase in the number of undernourished people were
devised. In the 2008 edition of The State of Food Insecurity in
the World,1 FAO predicted an increase of 75 million
undernourished people in 2008 (almost 9 percent of the last
available figure), bringing the total to 913 million. These
estimates assumed a rather pessimistic evolution of global food
supply. The following year, a further increase of about
11 percent of the number of undernourished was foreseen.
This was based on the prediction of a model developed by the
United States Department of Agriculture and a bleak global
macroeconomic outlook – shared by all major international
organizations – that predicted reduced export growth and
capital inflows in developing countries, assuming that the
financial crisis would lower the availability of foreign direct
investment, remittances and, possibly, official development
assistance.
The 20 percent increase over the 848 million undernourished
people estimated for 2003–05 meant that the number of
hungry people in 2009 could have exceeded the one billion
mark.

48

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

As actual data on food availability and utilization for 2007–
09 become available, it also became evident that the worstcase predictions that had informed the 2009 and 2010 editions
of The State of Food Insecurity in the World,2 had not
materialized. Estimates produced with the traditional
methodology in 2010 put the figure for the number of
undernourished for 2005–07 back to 847.5 million; this figure
did not change by much the following year, when an estimate
of 850 million was produced for the 2006–08 period, well
below the 913 million estimate for 2008 issued two years
earlier. It also started to become evident that both the food
price spike of 2007–08 and the ensuing economic crisis had not
been as dire as previously assumed, at least in much of the
developing world. Moreover, the pass-through of international
prices for primary food products to final consumer prices was
much more muted than previously feared. Analysis of food
price transmission from the international market to domestic
markets shows that many, though not all, developing countries
managed to shelter their consumers from the international
food price hikes. And finally, many developing countries
recovered quickly from the impacts of the global recession or
were not much affected by the financial crisis that had engulfed
many developed countries.

way to avoid overestimating food inadequacy when only food
consumption levels are observed that cannot be individually
matched to the varying requirements.
A frequent misconception when assessing food inadequacy
based on observed food consumption data is to refer to the midpoint in the overall range of requirements (that is, with reference
to a PAL of 1.85) as the threshold to identify inadequate energy
consumption within the population. Unfortunately, such reasoning
would lead to gross bias. To appreciate why, notice that even in
groups composed of only well-nourished people, roughly half of
these will have intake levels below mean requirements, as there
will be people engaged in low physical activity. Using the mean
requirement as a threshold would certainly produce an
overestimate, as all adequately nourished individuals with less
than average requirements would be misclassified as
undernourished.52
The value of the MDER threshold for all monitored countries is
updated by FAO every two years, based on regular revisions of the
population assessments of the UN Population Division as well as
data on population heights from various sources, most notably the
Monitoring and Evaluation to Assess and Use Results of the
Demographic and Health Surveys (MEASURE DHS) project
coordinated by USAID (http://www.measuredhs.com). When data
on population heights are not available, reference is made either
to data on heights from countries where similar ethnicities
prevails, or to models that use partial information to estimate
heights for various sex and age classes.

What the PoU measures
(and what it does not)
The terms “undernourishment” and “hunger” implicitly refer to
situations of a continued inability to obtain enough food. Often,
the FAO undernourishment figures have been interpreted as if
they provided an indication on the broader concept of food
insecurity. This is certainly misleading. Four points are worth
highlighting in this context.
First of all, while there may be various ways to measure
quantities of food, the FAO method is defined with respect to
dietary energy. It is very likely that a diet that provides insufficient

energy also does not guarantee sufficient protein and
micronutrient intake. The reverse, however, is not true, as there
may be micronutrient deficiencies associated with energyabundant diets. This means that the PoU estimates will not reflect
the full extent of malnutrition, which is still an important
dimension of food insecurity, as explained in the discussion on the
suite of food security indicators presented in this report.
A related point concerns the fact that the term
“undernourishment” as used in naming the indicator, being based
on food “consumption” data, refers to access to food, rather than
to its utilization. This has sometimes been an additional source of
confusion.53
Moreover, it should be emphasized that the degree of
inadequacy measured by the PoU is relative to the habitual
consumption level. The PoU refers to the likely proportion of
individuals in a population in such a condition over the period
covered by the assessment. As data used to estimate average
consumption are recorded with reference to one year, the
indicator can only be interpreted as capturing the extent of
chronic food deprivation. It does not reflect the effects of
temporary food shortages or of short-lived crises, unless such
crises have long-lasting effects on peoples’ ability to access food.
This also means that it does not capture, for example, the
economic and social costs associated with food procurement,
which may have a strong impact on the quality of life of people
who are striving to maintain adequate dietary energy intake, even
if they do not become undernourished.
Finally, as extensively explained in this annex, the PoU indicator
only provides a measure of the likely prevalence of food
deprivation for the entire population, and not separately for
different population groups. The national figures published in this
report cannot easily be disaggregated to provide a picture of the
state of undernourishment for particular geographic areas or for
socio-economic groups within a country.
An important consequence of all this is that, for a more
complete description of the state of food insecurity, the PoU
indicator should be complemented by other indicators. A broader
suite of food security indicators, capturing the various facets of
food insecurity in a country and within its population, would also
allow decision-makers to design and implement more targeted
policy measures. The second section of this report presents an
initial attempt at defining such a suite.

Annex 3
Glossary of selected terms used in the report
Anthropometry. Use of human body measurements to obtain information
about nutritional status.
Body mass index (BMI). The ratio of weight-for-height measured as the
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres.
Dietary energy intake. The energy content of food consumed.
Dietary energy requirement (DER). The amount of dietary energy required
by an individual to maintain body functions, health and normal activity.
Dietary energy supply (DES). Food available for human consumption,
expressed in kilocalories per person per day (kcal/person/day). At
country level, it is calculated as the food remaining for human use after
deduction of all non-food utilizations (i.e. food = production +
imports + stock withdrawals − exports − industrial use − animal feed –
seed – wastage − additions to stock). Wastage includes losses of usable
products occurring along distribution chains from farm gate (or port of
import) up to the retail level.
Dietary energy supply adequacy. Dietary energy supply as a percentage of
the average dietary energy requirement.
Food insecurity. A situation that exists when people lack secure access to
sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and
development and an active and healthy life. It may be caused by the
unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate
distribution or inadequate use of food at the household level. Food
insecurity, poor conditions of health and sanitation and inappropriate
care and feeding practices are the major causes of poor nutritional
status. Food insecurity may be chronic, seasonal or transitory.
Food security. A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious
food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active
and healthy life. Based on this definition, four food security dimensions
can be identified: food availability, economic and physical access to
food, food utilization and stability over time.
Hunger. In this report the term hunger is used as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment.
Kilocalorie (kcal). A unit of measurement of energy. One kilocalorie equals
1 000 calories. In the International System of Units (SI), the universal
unit of energy is the joule (J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ).
Macronutrients. In this document, the proteins, carbohydrates and fats that
are available to be used for energy. They are measured in grams.
Malnutrition. An abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate,
unbalanced or excessive consumption of macronutrients and/or
micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition and overnutrition
as well as micronutrient deficiencies.
Micronutrients. Vitamins, minerals and certain other substances that are
required by the body in small amounts. They are measured in
milligrams or micrograms.

THE STATE OF FOOD INSECURITY IN THE WORLD 2013

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). In a specified age/sex category,
the minimum amount of dietary energy per person that is considered
adequate to meet the energy needs at a minimum acceptable BMI of an
individual engaged in low physical activity. If referring to an entire
population, the minimum energy requirement is the weighted average of
the minimum energy requirements of the different age/sex groups. It is
expressed as kilocalories per person per day.
Nutrition security. A situation that exists when secure access to an
appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with a sanitary environment,
adequate health services and care, in order to ensure a healthy and
active life for all household members. Nutrition security differs from
food security in that it also considers the aspects of adequate caring
practices, health and hygiene in addition to dietary adequacy.
Nutrition-sensitive intervention. Interventions designed to address the underlying
determinants of nutrition (which include household food security, care for
mothers and children and primary health care services and sanitation) but
not necessarily having nutrition as the predominant goal.
Nutritional status. The physiological state of an individual that results from
the relationship between nutrient intake and requirements and from
the body’s ability to digest, absorb and use these nutrients.
Overnourishment. Food intake that is continuously in excess of dietary energy
requirements.
Overnutrition. A result of excessive food intake relative to dietary nutrient
requirements.
Overweight and obesity. Body weight that is above normal for height as a
result of an excessive accumulation of fat. It is usually a manifestation
of overnourishment. Overweight is defined as a BMI of more than 25
but less than 30 and obesity as a BMI of 30 or more.
Stunting. Low height for age, reflecting a sustained past episode or episodes
of undernutrition.
Undernourishment. A state, lasting for at least one year, of inability to acquire
enough food, defined as a level of food intake insufficient to meet
dietary energy requirements. For the purposes of this report, hunger
was defined as being synonymous with chronic undernourishment.
Undernutrition. The outcome of undernourishment, and/or poor absorption
and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed as a result of repeated
infectious disease. It includes being underweight for one’s age, too short
for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height (wasted) and
deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrition).
Underweight. Low weight for age in children, and BMI of less than 18.5 in
adults, reflecting a current condition resulting from inadequate food
intake, past episodes of undernutrition or poor health conditions.
Wasting. Low weight for height, generally the result of weight loss associated
with a recent period of starvation or disease.

53 “Nourishing” here must be taken to
mean “providing with food”, and is not
related to the actual nutrition conditions.
A less appealing alternative to
“undernourishment” could be
“underfeeding”, which might have the
advantage of not creating the false
expectation that the indicator is capturing
the state of malnutrition resulting from
inadequate absorption of nutrients. In
languages other than English, such as
French, the difference is clearer, as there
are distinct terms to refer to “feeding”
(“alimentation”) as opposed to
“nourishing” (“nutrition”). The correct
term for the FAO indicator in French is, in
fact, “prevalence de la sous-alimentation”
rather than “prevalence de la sousnutrition”.

Key messages

NOTES for Annex 1
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for the past as well as the latest
reported period. The same holds for population data of the United Nations.
Whenever this happens, FAO revises its estimates of undernourishment
accordingly. Users are advised to refer to changes in estimates over time only
within the same edition of The State of Food Insecurity in the World and
refrain from comparing data published in editions for different years.
1.

A total of 842 million people in 2011–13, or more than
one in eight people in the world, were estimated to be
suffering from chronic hunger, regularly not getting
enough food to conduct an active life. This figure is
lower than the 868 million reported with reference to
2010–12. The total number of undernourished has
fallen by 17 percent since 1990–92.
Developing regions as a whole have registered
significant progress towards the MDG 1 hunger target.
If the average annual decline of the past 21 years
continues to 2015, the prevalence of
undernourishment will reach a level close to the target.
Meeting it would require considerable and immediate
additional efforts.
Growth can raise incomes and reduce hunger, but
higher economic growth may not reach everyone. It
may not lead to more and better jobs for all, unless
policies specifically target the poor, especially those in
rural areas. In poor countries, hunger and poverty
reduction will only be achieved with growth that is not
only sustained, but also broadly shared.
Despite overall progress, marked differences across
regions persist. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region
with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, with
modest progress in recent years. Western Asia shows no
progress, while Southern Asia and Northern Africa show
slow progress. Significant reductions in both the
estimated number and prevalence of undernourishment
have occurred in most countries of Eastern and South
Eastern Asia, as well as in Latin America.
Food security is a complex condition. Its dimensions –
availability, access, utilization and stability – are better
understood when presented through a suite of
indicators.
Undernourishment and undernutrition can coexist.
However, in some countries, undernutrition rates, as
indicated by the proportion of stunted children, are
considerably higher than the prevalence of
undernourishment, as indicated by inadequacy of
dietary energy supply. In these countries,
nutrition-enhancing interventions are crucial to
improve the nutritional aspects of food security.
Improvements require a range of food security and
nutrition-enhancing interventions in agriculture,
health, hygiene, water supply and education,
particularly targeting women.

Policies aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity
and increasing food availability, especially when
smallholders are targeted, can achieve hunger
reduction even where poverty is widespread. When
they are combined with social protection and other
measures that increase the incomes of poor families to
buy food, they can have an even more positive
effective and spur rural development, by creating
vibrant markets and employment opportunities,
making possible equitable economic growth.

Remittances, which have globally become three times
larger than official development assistance, have had
significant impacts on poverty and food security. This
report suggests that remittances can help to reduce
poverty, leading to reduced hunger, better diets and,
given appropriate policies, increased on-farm
investment.
Long-term commitment to mainstreaming food
security and nutrition in public policies and
programmes is key to hunger reduction. Keeping food
security and agriculture high on the development
agenda, through comprehensive reforms,
improvements in the investment climate, supported by
sustained social protection, is crucial for achieving
major reductions in poverty and undernourishment.

World Food Summit goal: halve, between 1990–92 and 2015, the
number of undernourished people.
Millennium Development Goal 1, target 1C: halve, between 1990 and
2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Indicator 1.9
Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy
consumption (undernourishment). The results are obtained following a
harmonized methodology described in Annex 2 and are based on the
latest globally available data averaged over three years. Some countries
may have more recent data, which, if used, could lead to different
estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment and consequently of
the progress achieved.
Projections.
Change from 1990–92 baseline. For countries that did not exist in the
baseline period, the 1990–92 proportion of undernourished is based on
1993–95 and the number of undernourished is based on this proportion
applied to their 1990–92 population.

The State of

Food Insecurity in the World
The multiple dimensions of food security
The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013 presents updated estimates of
undernourishment and progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
and World Food Summit (WFS) hunger targets. The latest assessment shows that
further progress has been made towards the 2015 MDG target, which remains
within reach for the developing regions as a whole, although marked differences
across regions persist and considerable and immediate additional efforts will
be needed.
The 2013 report goes beyond measuring food deprivation. It presents a broader
suite of indicators that aim to capture the multidimensional nature of food
insecurity, its determinants and outcomes. This suite, compiled for every country,
allows a more nuanced picture of their food security status, guiding policy-makers
in the design and implementation of targeted and effective policy measures that
can contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.

Drawing on the suite of indicators, the report also examines the diverse
experiences of six countries in more detail, finding a mixed picture of progress and
setbacks. Together, these country experiences show the importance of social
protection and nutrition-enhancing interventions, policies to increase agricultural
productivity and rural development, diverse sources of income and long-term
commitment to mainstreaming food security and nutrition in public policies and
programmes.
