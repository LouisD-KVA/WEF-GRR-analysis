Foreword
Through its predecessor, the International
Meteorological Organization (IMO), and
since 1950 on its own account, the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) has
been very active in the field of climate ever
since the First International Meteorological
Congress was convened in Vienna in 1873.
The IMO Commission for Climatology was
established in 1929 and fifty years later,
in 1979, WMO organized the First World
Climate Conference, in collaboration with
such partners as the International Council for
Science, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations. This historic conference would
soon lead to the establishment of WMO’s own
World Climate Programme and, in 1980, that
of the World Climate Research Programme
with the International Council for Science and
later the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission. Furthermore, the conference
would also pave the way for the establishment,
in 1988, of the WMO/UNEP co-sponsored
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), which recently received the 2007 Nobel
Peace Prize for its efforts “to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made
climate change, and to lay the foundations for
the measures that are needed to counteract
such change”.
The Second World Climate Conference,
organized by WMO and its partners in 1990,
provided decisive momentum to the international efforts that resulted in the development
of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in 1992 and the Global
Climate Observing System. In the midst of
these significant contributions, in 1993 WMO
began to issue an annual statement on the
status of the global climate, which has by
now become an established source of information eagerly sought after, each year, by
the scientific community and the media. The
WMO Statement on the Status of the Global
Climate in 2007 is the latest in this successful
series.

It is relevant to recall that 2007 was a special
year in many respects, for it was during 2007
that the IPCC issued the different components of its Fourth Assessment Report, which
then served as a fundamental contribution
to the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to
the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (COP-13), held in Bali,
Indonesia, from 3 to 14 December 2007. In Bali,
WMO actively contributed to the session and
organized a successful side event, Improved
decision-making for climate adaptation:
providing a science basis. Furthermore, the
International Polar Year 2007–2008, launched
in 2007 as a WMO co-sponsored scientific
venture, is also making a key contribution to
our increasing understanding of the global
climate system. In following suite, in May 2007
the Fifteenth World Meteorological Congress
decided that in 2009 WMO would organize
with partners a World Climate Conference-3,
under the overall theme of climate prediction
for decision-making.
I would like to stress, once more, the importance of receiving feedback from Members on
the relevance and content of these statements.
A questionnaire circulated by WMO among
recipients of the 2006 Statement revealed
important messages that were used proactively in preparing the present issue. WMO
therefore looks forward to your comments
on the WMO Statement on the Status of the
Global Climate in 2007, or to your suggestions
for further improvement.

Global temperatures during 2007

years on record. The Met Office Hadley Centre
analyses showed that the global mean surface
temperature in 2007 was 0.40°C (0.72°F) above
the 1961–1990 annual average (14°C/57.2°F)
and hence marks the seventh warmest year
on record. According to the National Climatic
Data Center of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the global mean
surface temperature anomaly was 0.55°C
(0.99°F) above the twentieth century average
(1901–2000) of 13.9°C (56.9°F), which ranks
2007 the fifth warmest year in its record.

All temperature values have uncertainties, which
arise mainly from gaps in data coverage. The
size of the uncertainties is such that the global
average temperature for 2007 is statistically
indistinguishable from each of the nine warmest years on record.
Since the beginning of the twentieth century,
the global average surface temperature has
risen by 0.74°C, but this increase has not been
continuous. The linear warming trend over
the past 50 years (0.13°C per decade) is nearly
twice that for the past 100 years.
Note: Following established practice, WMO global temperature analyses are based on two different data sets. One is
the combined data set maintained by the Met Office Hadley
Centre, UK, and the Climatic Research Unit, University of
East Anglia, UK. The other is maintained by the United
States Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. Both centres use improved
temperature analyses, but different methodologies. These
differing methodologies result in small differences in
global rankings.

Regional temperature anomalies
Warmer-than-average annual temperatures
affected most land areas of the world, with the
exception of cooler-than-average anomalies

in the southern parts of South America. The
largest warmer-than-average annual anomalies
affected high latitude regions of the northern
hemisphere including much of North America,
Europe and Asia. Annual temperature anomalies in these regions reached 2–4°C (3.6–7.2°F)
above the 1961–1990 average. In the Russian
Federation, 2007 was the warmest in 150 years
of hydrometeorological measurements.
Much of the North Atlantic was significantly
warm, a pattern that reflects the continuing
warm phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal
oscillation, which began in the mid-1990s.
Sea surface temperatures in large areas of the
Southern Ocean were below average.
The year 2007 started with record-breaking temperature anomalies throughout the
world. In parts of Europe, winter and spring
ranked among the warmest ever recorded,
with anomalies of more than 4°C (7°F) above
the long-term monthly averages for January
and April.
Extreme high temperatures occurred in much
of Western Australia from early January to
early March, with February temperatures
more than 5°C above average.

the southern United States of America during much of August with numerous new alltime high temperature records established
and more than 50 deaths attributed to the

Droughts
Across North America, severe to extreme
drought was present across large parts of
the western United States and the Upper
Midwest, as well as southern Ontario, Canada,
for much of 2007. More than three quarters of
the South-east United States was in drought
from mid-summer into December, but heavy
rainfall led to an end of drought in the southern Plains. Ongoing drought and strong Santa

Ana winds brought devastating fires to parts
of Southern California in October, destroying more than 1 500 homes and affecting
hundreds of thousands of people. Based on
preliminary estimates, over 85 000 wildfires
and more than 37 000 square kilometres had
burned across the United States, ranking 2007
the second worst fire season on record.

In Australia, while conditions were not as
severely dry as in 2006, water resources
remained extremely low in many areas owing
to long-term drought. Below-average rainfall
—especially from July to October—over the
densely populated and agricultural regions
resulted in significant crop and stock losses
and a continuing need for water restrictions in

Flooding and intense storms
Global precipitation over land in 2007 was
above the 1961–1990 average. However,
regionally drier-than-average conditions were
recorded across the south-eastern and western contiguous United States, northern India,
the eastern coast of Brazil, the southern and
eastern parts of Australia, and parts of eastern
Asia. Meanwhile, the central United States
and parts of Europe and Asia experienced
wetter-than-average conditions.
Flooding affected many African countries in
2007. In February, Mozambique experienced
its worst flooding in six years, killing dozens
of people, destroying thousands of homes
and flooding 800 square kilometres of crops
in the Zambezi valley. In Sudan, torrential
rains caused flash floods in many areas in
June/July, affecting over 410 000 people, of
which 200 000 were left homeless. The strong
south-westerly monsoon resulted in one of the
heaviest July–September rainfall periods, triggering widespread flash floods that affected
several countries in West Africa, Central Africa
and parts of the Greater Horn of Africa. Some
1.5 million people were affected and hundreds
of thousands of homes were destroyed.
In Bolivia, flooding in January/February affected
nearly 200 000 people and 700 square kilometres of cropland. Strong storms brought
heavy rain that caused extreme flooding in
the littoral region of Argentina in late March/
early April. In early May, Uruguay was hit by
its worst flooding since 1959, with heavy rain
producing floods that affected more than

110 000 people and severely damaged crops
and buildings. Triggered by storms, massive
flooding in Mexico in early November destroyed
the homes of half a million people and seriously
affected the country’s oil industry.
In Indonesia, massive flooding on Java in early
February killed dozens of people and covered
half of the city of Jakarta by up to 3.7 metres
of water. Persistent heavy rains in China ravaged the Huai He river valley in late June and
July, affecting more than 29 million people.
This flood is believed to be the worst in the
region since 1954. Monsoon-related extreme
rainfall events caused the worst flooding in
years in parts of South Asia. About 25 million
people were affected in the region, especially
in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, and
thousands lost their lives. However, in India,
rainfall during the summer monsoon season
(June–September) was, generally, near normal
(105 per cent of the long-term average), but
with marked differences in the distribution of
rainfall in space and time.
Heavy rains in the second half of December
resulted in massive flooding in Sri Lanka and
Indonesia. In Sri Lanka, more than one quarter
of a million people were affected, whilst widespread floods triggering devastating landslides

on the island of Java in Indonesia affected tens
of thousands with more than 100 casualties.
A powerful storm system, Kyrill, affected much
of northern Europe on 17 and 18 January
with torrential rains and winds gusting up to
170 km/h. There were at least 47 deaths across
the region, and disruptions in electric supply
that affected tens of thousands of people
during the storm.
England and Wales recorded the wettest
May–July period since records began in
1766, receiving 415 mm of rain compared
with the previous record of 349 mm in 1789.
Extensive flooding in the region killed nine
people and caused more than US$ 6 billion
in damages.

Tropical cyclones
In the North-West Pacific, 24 named tropical
storms developed during 2007, below the longterm annual average of 27. Of those, 14 storms
were classified as typhoons, equalling the
long-term annual average. Tropical cyclones
affected millions in South-East Asia, with
typhoons Pabuk, Krosa, Lekima and tropical
storms such as Peipah among the severest.

During the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season,
15 named storms occurred, compared with the
1981–2000 annual average of 12, with 6 being
classified as hurricanes, equalling the average.
For the first time since records began in 1886,
two Atlantic category 5 hurricanes, Dean and
Felix, made landfall in the same season.
In February, due to tropical cyclone Gamède,
a new worldwide rainfall record was set in
La Réunion with 3 929 mm measured within

The brief El Niño event of late 2006 quickly
dissipated in January 2007, and La Niña conditions became well established across the
central and eastern Equatorial Pacific in the
latter half of 2007.

In the course of the year, with La Niña established, conditions in the western Equatorial
Pacific were initially not typical of a La Niña.
Unusual sea surface temperature patterns, with
cooler-than-normal values across the north of
Australia to the Indian Ocean, and warmer-thannormal values in the Western Indian Ocean,
were recorded. The sea surface temperature
patterns in the Indian Ocean were similar to
those associated with a positive phase of the
Indian Ocean Dipole, a recently documented
mode of the climate system (see box).

The Indian Ocean Dipole
A positive phase of the Indian Ocean
Dipole is characterized by the presence
of cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Indian
Ocean near Indonesia and Australia
and warmer-than-normal sea surface
temperatures in the western equatorial
Indian Ocean, near Madagascar. A negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole
has the opposite features.

Over the last three months of the year, however, sea surface temperature patterns became
generally consistent with a La Niña event.
The evolution of La Niña has influenced climate patterns across many parts of the globe,
including in the direct vicinity of the Equatorial
Pacific, and more widely, across the Indian
Ocean, Africa, Asia and the Americas.

Ozone in the Antarctic
The 2007 Antarctic ozone hole was relatively
small owing to mild stratosphere winter temperatures. Since 1998, only the 2002 and 2004
ozone holes were smaller. In 2007, the ozone
hole reached a maximum of 25 million square
kilometres in mid-September, compared with
more than 29 million square kilometres in the
record years of 2000 and 2006. The ozone mass
deficit reached 28 megatons on 23 September,
compared with more than 40 megatons in the
record year of 2006.

Arctic sea ice extent
The average sea ice extent for the month of
September was 4.28 million square kilometres,

The September rate of sea ice decline since
1979 is now approximately 10 per cent per

Sea-level rise and global climate change
by John Church,1 Chair WCRP JSC 2

Global averaged sea level continued to rise
through 2006 and 2007. Modern satellite measurements reveal that since 1993, sea level has
been rising at an average rate of about 3 mm
per year, substantially faster than the average
for the twentieth century of about 1.7 mm
per year, estimated from coastal sea-level
measurements. These coastal measurements
indicate that the 2006/2007 global averaged
sea level is about 200 mm higher than in 1870
and since then there has been a significant
increase in the rate of the sea-level rise. Both
data sets show interannual variability in the
rate of rise. The increase in the rate of rise
during the latter half of the nineteenth century
and the early twentieth century is confirmed
by the few multi-century direct coastal sealevel measurements as well as by sea-level
estimates from sediment cores in various parts
of the world. This is consistent with estimates
made from sea-level benchmarks carved in
rock in Tasmania in 1840 and other data such
as the height of ancient Roman fish tanks.
Together these results imply that there had
been little net change in the sea level from the
first century AD to the nineteenth century AD

and that the twentieth century rate of rise is
anomalous relative to the recent Holocene.
The main contributions to sea-level change in
the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are
the following:
ß Thermal expansion of the oceans (water
expands as it warms);
ß The addition of mass to the oceans from
the melting of glaciers and ice caps in
areas such as the Himalayas, Alaska
and Patagonia;
ß The exchange of mass with the ice
sheets of Antarctica and Greenland;
ß The exchange of mass with terrestrial
water storages (groundwater, aquifers,
dams, lakes).
Since 1960, the thermal expansion of the oceans
and the melting of glaciers and ice caps are the
largest contributions to sea-level rise. There
has also been an increasing contribution from

surface melt from the Greenland ice sheet over
this period. These contributions are directly
related to recent climate change.
Over the last decade, however, there are
indications of a larger contribution from
the movement of outlet glaciers of both the
Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. If
this were a sign of an acceleration in response
to global warming, it would be a major concern as the ice sheets contain enough water
to raise sea level by 7 and 6 m, respectively,
and any such dynamic response could raise
sea level significantly faster than surface
melting alone.
The impacts of sea level rise will be felt through
an increase in both mean sea level and the
frequency of extreme sea level events, for
example storm surges, of a given level. Impacts
include increased flooding, both severity

14

and frequency, of low-lying areas, erosion of
beaches, and damage to infrastructure and
the environment, including wetlands, intertidal zones and mangroves, with significant
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Millions of people in low-lying nations
such as Bangladesh, the Mekong and other
deltas, and Pacific islands such as Tuvalu, will
have to respond to rising sea levels during the
twenty-first century and beyond.
Improved sea-level rise projections will contribute to more effective coastal planning and
management. Adaptation measures include, for
example, enhanced building codes, restrictions
on where to build and developing infrastructure
better able to cope with flooding.
