Cooperation is critical to achieving all water-related
goals and targets
At current rates, progress towards SDG 6 is off-track. The 2023 edition of the United Nations World Water
Development Report (WWDR) describes how building partnerships and enhancing cooperation across all
dimensions of sustainable development are essential to accelerating progress towards all the targets of
SDG 6 and realizing the human rights to water and sanitation.
Partnerships and cooperation take place in almost
any water-related endeavour and water resources management
has a long history of experience with partnerships, both good
and bad. This report reviews this experience, highlighting how
enhancing positive and meaningful cooperation amongst the
water, sanitation and broader ‘development’ communities is
required to accelerate progress.
This report also addresses how the water and sanitation
community can internally collaborate more effectively by
maximizing complementarity, as well as reach out to other
sectors and realms of decision-making where water plays a
critical (but often times misunderstood or ignored) role in
meeting their own objectives and amplifying co-benefits.

Nearly every
water-related
intervention involves
some kind of
cooperation

Safeguarding water, food and energy security through sustainable water management, providing water
supply and sanitation services to all, supporting human health and livelihoods, mitigating the impacts of
climate change and extreme events, and sustaining and restoring ecosystems and the valuable services
they provide, are all pieces of a great and complex puzzle.
Only through partnerships and cooperation can the pieces come together.
And everyone has a role to play.

“Since wars begin in the minds of men and
women it is in the minds of men and women
that the defences of peace must be constructed”

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Foreword
by António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations

Water is the lifeblood of humanity. It is vital for survival itself and supports the health, resilience, development and
prosperity of people and planet alike.
But humanity is blindly travelling a dangerous path. Vampiric overconsumption and overdevelopment, unsustainable
water use, pollution and unchecked global warming are draining humanity’s lifeblood, drop by drop.
The effects are all around us – from climate change-driven heatwaves, droughts, floods and violent storms, to the
world’s supply of fresh water being contaminated by pollutants, chemicals and torrents of salt water from rising seas.
As this year’s report reminds us, protecting and preserving this precious resource for future generations depends
on partnerships. The smart management and conservation of the world’s water resources means bringing together
governments, businesses, scientists, civil society and communities – including indigenous communities – to design
and deliver concrete solutions.
In particular, the 2023 United Nations Water Conference is a critical moment for collective progress – the first major
United Nations meeting on water in nearly half a century, and a significant step towards Sustainable Development
Goal 6: clean water and sanitation for all.
The Conference also reminds us that humanity’s hopes captured by all of the Sustainable Development Goals – from
education and health, to human rights, economic progress and climate action – depend on safeguarding our water
resources for the future.
Now is the moment to stand together and invest in the management and governance of the world’s water resources
and freshwater ecosystems. We must strengthen accountability and equitable water access for all people, and place
conservation of this precious resource first across national and global plans and priorities.
The United Nations is proud to stand with you, and to ensure that water continues to sustain our ecosystems, our
economies, and the lives, health and future of every person on earth.

Water is in constant motion. It is part of a cycle – one that ignores all borders created by humans. As such, it is a common
good, which requires common management, if this management is to be both effective and relevant. For what happens
upstream always has an impact downstream: extracting water from rivers or aquifers directly concerns all the populations
that depend on them.
For this reason, water is an essential component of international cooperation. But how can we ensure the success of the
partnerships and cooperative arrangements on which its sustainable management depends? That is the question asked
by this United Nations World Water Development Report, coordinated by UNESCO on behalf of the UN-Water family.
Successful initiatives often apply a number of principles, which are presented in this report – whether this means the
inclusion of all communities, like indigenous peoples and women, or the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach.
Pooling expertise and perspectives leads to more relevant and efficient management – as seen in the impressive Climate
Risk Informed Decision Analysis tool, which helps identify climate adaptation actions, or in the mapping of the Stampriet
Aquifer, shared by Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.
UNESCO seeks to implement these principles on a daily basis, for water is an important area of action for our Organization.
Over the past 50 years, we have developed two major programmes: our Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme, with
its 169 national committees and 18 flagship initiatives, and our World Water Assessment Programme, both of which have
allowed us to develop an impressive network of partners. Not to mention the 29 independent centres operating under the
auspices of UNESCO, and the 70 UNESCO chairs working on these topics at universities and research institutions.
This report is a particularly timely way of building on these efforts. I would like to thank all its contributors, as well as
the Government of Italy and the Regione Umbria for their ongoing support to UNESCO’s World Water Assessment
Programme. Indeed, this year, a major event on water is taking place, the United Nations conference on water, which will
be an opportunity for the international community to develop a programme of action to ensure water and sanitation for all.
This is an essential objective, for both collective security and human dignity. May this report, the result of the collective
intelligence of the entire UN-Water family, contribute to this goal by paving the way for new partnerships and cooperative
agreements on this issue.

Director-General of the International Labour Organization

Water flows throughout the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It underpins most of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) that are intended to create a more sustainable future for us all, leaving no one behind.
The essential role of the water cycle in all human activity and in our ecosystems means that if we fail to achieve SDG 6
– to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030 – we risk the success
of almost all of the other 16 Goals, including those related to food and nutrition, poverty reduction, human health,
gender equality, energy, economic growth, sustainable cities, climate change and the environment.
As things stand today we are seriously off-track. The latest data show that if we continue on our current course we will
not achieve any of the SDG 6 targets by the 2030 deadline.
But this is not inevitable. We can still achieve SDG 6, and all the related benefits it will bring to other parts of the
2030 Agenda, if we come together and form effective and dynamic partnerships.
This year’s edition of the UN World Water Development Report shows what is possible. It presents best-practice
examples of water-related partnerships and cooperation. It shows us the potential for expanding and strengthening
partnerships and cooperation as a key way to accelerate progress.
It is a landmark publication. I would like to offer sincere thanks to the different UN bodies and partner organizations
that make up the UN-Water family, without whose contributions the report would not have been possible. I would also
like to recognize the valuable coordination work of UNESCO and its World Water Assessment Programme, as well as
the inputs of the many other colleagues who contributed to the diversity and scope of this important study.
The Report is launched as we convene for the UN 2023 Water Conference - the first United Nations Conference on
water in almost half a century.
The primary purpose of this Conference is to generate voluntary commitments that will rapidly shift our current
course. These will form the Water Action Agenda – a shared endeavour on a critical issue that could make or break
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
There is much to do and time is not on our side. But this report shows what is possible. We must now come together
and accelerate action.

Preface
by Michela Miletto, UNESCO WWAP Coordinator
and Richard Connor, Editor-in-Chief

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the United Nations World Water Development Report (UNWWDR), as well as the 10th
anniversary of its annual, thematic version. It also coincides with the first UN conference dedicated to water since 1977,
with UNWWDR occupying a critical role as the UN system’s principal authoritative report on water.
These milestones provide us the opportunity to both reflect on the successes of the past and, more importantly, take stock
and learn from our mistakes as we move forward into the coming decades. The good news is that the resonance of the
UNWWDR has been steadily increasing over the years, as evidenced by various indicators ranging from online downloads
to media coverage. This in turn has also sparked interest and motivation in contributing to the report.
The concept of this year’s edition, partnerships and cooperation, underpins the entire archetype of the United Nations.
This very report, like all its predecessors, is the result of a tremendous level of cooperation between several UN agencies,
partners and experts from around the globe. Indeed, the UNWWDR has often been cited as a shining example of the ‘UN
delivering as one’.1 The report is all the more relevant in the context of ‘accelerating change’ – the theme of the 2023 World
Water Day – as nearly every water-related intervention that is required to accelerate progress towards SDG 6, the overall
objective of the UN 2023 Water Conference, involves some kind of meaningful cooperation.
As messages from this year’s report began to emerge, we also came to realize that many of the lessons we’ve learned
developing this report can also apply to this unique collaboration among UN Water members and partners. The first and
foremost pertains to the inestimable value of partner dedication and the quality of their contributions. Indeed, the majority
of our partners, with several of whom we have been collaborating for several years, continued to be committed and focused
on delivering the relevant and insightful content that is the foundation of the report’s success.
Another important lesson concerns the importance of data and information, specifically its availability and the best ways
to share them among partners. While the theme partnerships and cooperation provided opportunities to highlight a vast
number of cases and examples, the circumstantial nature of such content does not easily lend itself to detailed empirical
analysis. However, covering a broad range of topics and experiences, the data and information provided by various
contributors proved to be much more complementary than contradictory, and led to conclusions and response options
that can serve the interest of all parties. In other words, the challenges of data limitations can be overcome, at least in part,
by working in partnership across different perspectives.
Again this year, we have endeavoured to produce a balanced, fact-based and neutral account of the current state of knowledge,
covering the most recent developments. This year’s report highlights how enhancing cooperation and partnerships is not
only essential to the integrated management of water resources in order to accelerate progress towards every water-related
goal, but also critical in addressing the social, environmental and economic challenges that interconnect through water.

‘Delivering as One’ refers to a concept at the core of the UN reform process: coordinating different agencies to exploit the benefit of their competitive
advantages.

Although primarily targeted at policy- and decision-makers, water resources managers, academics and the broader
development community, we hope this report will also be well received by non-water specialists, including those who
are engaged in the alleviation of poverty and humanitarian crises, in the pursuit of the human rights to water supply and
sanitation, and the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
This latest edition of the UNWWDR is the result of a concerted effort among the Chapter Lead Agencies listed in the
acknowledgements. The Report also benefited to a great extent from the inputs and contributions of several other
UN-Water members and partners, as well as from numerous universities, research institutions, scientific associations and

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

The year 2023 marks the first major conference of the United Nations (UN) dedicated to water
since 1977. The UN 2023 Water Conference focuses on progress towards water- and sanitationrelated goals, coinciding with the mid-term comprehensive review of the International Decade for
Action, ‘Water for Sustainable Development 2018–2028’.

Executive summary

As the UN system’s principal authoritative report on water, the United Nations World Water
Development Report 2023 directly informs the UN conference discussions, describing how
building partnerships and enhancing cooperation across all dimensions of sustainable
development are essential to accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal
for water and sanitation (SDG 6) and realizing the human rights to water and sanitation.

The world’s water: demand, availability and quality
Water use has been increasing globally by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years and is
expected to grow at a similar rate through to 2050, driven by a combination of population growth,
socio-economic development and changing consumption patterns. The bulk of this increase is
concentrated in middle- and lower-income countries, particularly in emerging economies.
Water scarcity is becoming endemic as a result of the local impact of physical water stress,
coupled with the acceleration and spreading of freshwater pollution. As a result of climate
change, seasonal water scarcity will increase in regions where it is currently abundant – such
as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of South America – and worsen in regions where water is
already in short supply – such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa. On average, 10% of the
global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress.
Low-, middle- and high-income countries all show signs of risks related to water quality. Poor
ambient water quality in low-income countries is often related to low levels of wastewater
treatment, whereas in higher-income countries runoff from agriculture is a more serious problem.
However, water quality data remain sparse, due in large part to weak monitoring and reporting
capacity. This is especially true in many of the least developed countries in Asia and Africa.

Progress towards SDG 6 Targets
Half-way through the 2030 Agenda timeline, progress towards SDG 6 targets is only
significantly reported for drinking water and sanitation, with some preliminary and rough
indications of progress for water stress, water use efficiency, transboundary cooperation and
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), leaving 5 of the 11 target indicators without
quantified information on progress.
At current rates, progress towards all the targets of SDG 6 is off-track and in some areas the rate
of implementation needs to quadruple, or more.
According to the latest figures from 2020, 26% of the world’s population (2 billion people) did
not have access to safely managed drinking water services (Target 6.1), and an estimated 46%
(3.6 billion) lacked access to safely managed sanitation (Target 6.2).
Approximately 60% of the world’s reported water bodies were categorized as having ‘good’
ambient water quality (Target 6.3). However, the poorest 20 countries are grossly underrepresented in this global estimate.
Globally, water use efficiency (Target 6.4) rose by 9% from 2015 to 2018 (from 17.3 to
18.9 US$/m³). Progress has been greatest in the industrial sector (15% increase), followed by
the water supply and sanitation services and agricultural sectors (8% increase).

Executive summary

1

While most countries have reported some progress, the global rate of progress on IWRM
implementation (Target 6.5) needs to double to approach the target.
The data required to track changes in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time
(Target 6.6) are not yet refined enough to reveal discrete trends in recent years. However,
available data show an 80% loss in the extent of natural wetland area since the pre-industrial
era (1700).
Official development assistance (ODA) committed and disbursed to ‘water’ in 2020 was
estimated at US$8.7 billion globally, up from US$2.7 billion in 2002. However, international
cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitationrelated activities and programmes (Target 6.a) had not yet been specifically reported at the
time of this report’s production.
The number of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or policy for participation by
users/communities (Target 6.b) has increased between 2014 and 2019, but still remains low
overall. Levels for both laws/procedures and participation are very low for drinking water in
both urban and rural settings compared to the other subsectors.

Diversity of partnerships and collaboration
Cooperation
improves water
governance and
decision-making,
stimulates
innovative
solutions,
and leverages
efficiencies

The currently inadequate rate of progress towards the SDG 6 targets highlights the need to
explore opportunities through partnerships and cooperation. Cooperation improves water
governance and decision-making, stimulates innovative solutions, and leverages efficiencies.
By promoting inclusive engagement, participation and dialogue, and giving voices to those
that are otherwise not heard, partnerships can help ensure that no one is left behind and that
the human rights to water and sanitation are realized.
Each party invariably comes with its own knowledge, perceptions, interests, positions and
objectives, such that disagreements on priorities and strategies are commonplace. While
partnerships and cooperation, at all levels, overwhelmingly deliver positive outcomes, in rare
occasions, they can institutionalize exclusion, distort resource allocations and encourage
fragmentation.
The categorization adopted for the purposes of this report is based on the water-related
outcomes that partnerships seek to achieve. The first category involves partners with a
common objective, such as supplying water and sanitation to local communities or managing
shared irrigation systems. The second involves actors with different (potentially competing)
water-related objectives, including cooperation between municipalities and farmers over
the allocation of water supplies, or payment for environmental services schemes. The third
involves actors from ‘outside the water domain’, where objectives of some partners are
not primarily water-related, but where water plays a determining role. These partnerships
support water-related interventions that in turn serve objectives related to human health or
climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Thematic perspectives
Agriculture
Water user associations (WUAs) are formal organizations through which farmers manage a
common irrigation system. Smaller-sized WUAs, in which farmers share similar norms, and
have social capital from other local institutions (e.g. village councils or religious groups),
long-term involvement of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and democratic
internal processes (e.g. elected chairpersons and board members) have been most

successful. Others have underperformed due to poor implementation, unclear roles and
responsibilities, lack of women participation, and lack in administrative authority, among
other factors. The imposition of central and national directives by governments (e.g. irrigation
departments and water ministries), often through mandated scheme by-laws or rules, may
limit the effectiveness of WUAs.
While urban water demand is projected to increase by 80% by 2050, water allocation from
agriculture to urban centres has become a common strategy to meet freshwater needs in
growing cities. The reallocation of water from agriculture has been generally successful
in terms of meeting the demands of growing cities. From an agricultural/rural perspective,
negative consequences have been observed as less water is available for irrigation, leading
to reduced food security and lower farmer livelihood incomes. Compensation, including
financial payments or new infrastructure, and benefit-sharing arrangements can help offset
these negative impacts.
The water–energy–food–ecosystem (WEFE) nexus provides a systematic approach to
understanding WEFE interconnectedness and trade-offs. The WEFE approach integrates
across all sectors and provides a holistic vision of sustainability that seeks to balance the
different goals, interests and needs of people and the environment.

Watershed protection or rehabilitation measures are among the oldest of water-related
partnerships. Many watershed services schemes address climate change adaptation by
building resilience, and their role in mitigation is increasingly recognized.
Co-benefits generated through ecosystem-based approaches provide a strong justification for
nature-based solutions. Water utilities are mainly interested in reducing infrastructure risks,
ensuring compliance and reducing costs. Climate adaptation benefits, such as flood mitigation,
are particularly attractive to rural communities. Additional benefits include biodiversity
conservation, and jobs and training opportunities. This diversity and scale of benefits forge
strong interests among a broader scope of stakeholders and potential partners.
Water funds, as a means of financing these schemes, support partnerships that bring
together downstream users, like cities, businesses and utilities, to collectively invest in
upstream habitat protection and land management to improve water quality and/or quantity
and generate long-term benefits.
Partnerships involving local communities are increasingly used to improve monitoring of the
environment. These are particularly important in order to address the huge gaps in water
quality data.

Human settlements
A diversity of actors, including the private sector, NGOs and communities, along with
government ministries and departments responsible for water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH), health, housing, agriculture, education, planning and infrastructure, handle various
aspects of WASH. Cooperation also opens up space for an even broader range of partners.
WASH initiatives are more likely to meet their objectives if the intended beneficiaries
participate in a meaningful way, especially in rural areas and secondary towns. Effective
stakeholder involvement in planning and implementation leads to services that are more
appropriate to the needs and resources of poor communities, and increases public
acceptance and ownership of systems. Stakeholder engagement from the onset also fosters
accountability and transparency.

Executive summary

Water operators’ partnerships (WOPs) connect established, well-functioning utilities with
others that need assistance or guidance. The resulting improvements in capacity and
performance can facilitate utilities’ access to financing for infrastructural investments,
supporting further extensions or improvements in services. WOPs can be a valuable
instrument to reach underserved populations in both rural and urban contexts.
Forced migration puts an increased strain on local entities (utilities, communities)
responsible for providing water supply and services. While states are the primary dutybearers for fulfilling these human rights, multi-stakeholder partnerships between United
Nations agencies, international organizations, NGOs and civil society are needed to respond
to the complex dynamics that impact both displaced populations and host communities.
Within displacement settings, water user committees can facilitate collaboration with local
water authorities as well as promote women’s participation.

Industry

recognized

Industry turns to collective action when desired outcomes cannot be obtained through
internal or unilateral action alone. Industry has the capacity to advance responsible practices
and devise market-based solutions to accelerate the SDGs at scale, but this ability can be
undermined by governance gaps, market failures, cultural barriers and trust deficits. Collective
action, in the form of partnerships and coalitions, is vital to overcoming these impediments.
For collective action to be effective, companies typically have to establish unconventional
relationships with non-traditional partners. There must be a commitment to shared goals and
a recognition of the potential for trade-offs between company interests and broader public
benefits. Collective action requires companies to develop new skills and knowledge, such
as greater understanding of community needs and values, and to enhance their ability to
connect with government actors and NGOs.
In recent years the increased value of adding environmental, social and governance (ESG)
and water stewardship scopes to such arrangements has become very evident – not only
in the commercial sense but also in the broader context of overall water sustainability to
provide beneficial results for all parties.

Health
Despite interdependences between the WASH and health sectors, gaps in coordination and
governance occur because they are led by different ministries, local authorities, international
organizations, NGOs and private sector actors. Partnerships aligned at the scientific,
strategic and operational levels are therefore necessary to optimize and accelerate positive
health outcomes through WASH.
Fully functioning WASH services in health care facilities are essential to the delivery of safe
quality care. While the provision of WASH in hospitals, in- and out-patient health centres
and clinics is a health sector responsibility, it has until recently been neglected due to
health actors either not accepting the role, not knowing how to develop and maintain WASH
services, or being overwhelmed with curative tasks. COVID-19 efforts have been increasingly
leveraged to strengthen policies, regulations and investments in WASH.
New health risks are emerging from exposure to ‘contaminants of emerging concern’ in
water, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial and household chemicals, personal care products,
pesticides, and manufactured nanomaterials. WASH plays an essential role in preventing
neglected tropical diseases that are close to elimination from bouncing back. Safe WASH
limits the avoidable use of antimicrobials for WASH-preventable infections, thus contributing

to address the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis. Progress requires cooperation across
a wide range of stakeholders, such as policy-makers, engineers and scientists, health care
professionals, veterinarians, farmers, donors, NGOs, and private citizens and corporations.
Wastewater disease surveillance can complement diagnostic testing. The global polio
eradication programme is a well-established example of a health partnership (with wastewater
laboratories) using wastewater as part of a wider surveillance and control approach.

Climate change

Within

authorities

The coordination of climate and water agendas is bidirectional. On the one hand, climate
policy-makers need to better understand the needs of the water community to adapt to
climate change, as well as the role that water resources management and supply and
sanitation can play in mitigation. On the other hand, water policy-makers need to proactively
reach out to climate stakeholders to better understand how climate-led processes work,
and to integrate water-related climate risks into national water policies, strategies and
implementation plans.
Accelerating action through partnerships and cooperation between water and climate
stakeholders can create additional benefits to freshwater ecosystems and to the most
exposed and vulnerable people, reducing disaster risks, delivering cost savings, fostering
job creation and generating economic opportunities. The cross-sectoral nature and
interdependence of water and climate change with other vital natural resources, such as land
or energy, create further opportunities for partnership and cooperation.
In commitments made by Parties to the Paris Agreement, more than 80% of countries
have reported freshwater resources as an adaptation priority area. However, mitigation
opportunities through water management – ranging from biogas recovery from wastewater
treatment systems to geothermal power generation – deserve greater attention from climate
planners and should open the door to further collaboration with water stakeholders.

Regional perspectives
Sub-Saharan Africa
Developing water infrastructure, harnessing groundwater resources, addressing climate
change effects and investing in science and technology are all needed to drive sustainable
water security in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the coordination, communication
and exchange of the generally limited data and information available to African water
stakeholders have been very weak due to the lack of appropriate strategies and platforms
to enhance dialogue between researchers, decision-makers and community members.
Cooperation is particularly critical for ensuring water security in the region’s many
transboundary basins and aquifers.
Community–public partnerships (CPPs), usually established between a water utility and an
elected group within a community, offer win–win arrangements that enable private operators,
public utilities and communities to derive benefits through mutual understanding, shared
responsibilities, and exchange of knowledge and experiences.
There are currently numerous activities at all levels that require coordination to optimize
efforts and resources. Several subregional, regional and continental partnerships could be
strengthened. Member states, development partners and other stakeholders should consider
reinforcing existing structures, rather than developing new ones.

Executive summary

Europe and North America
Water-related partnerships and cooperation initiatives are frequent in Europe and North
America. The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making
and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and the Convention on the Protection and Use
of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes stress the need for cooperation and
involvement of stakeholders, as do several relevant Directives of the European Union. These
instruments have facilitated the development of various types of partnerships in the region
and are also contributing to stakeholder participation outside the region.
Stakeholder involvement is an objective that has been proactively pursued and, to a large
degree, it remains a common challenge in water management, governance and cooperation
across the region.
The International Joint Commission (IJC) between Canada and the United States of America
has a long history of successful water cooperation, not only across borders but also within
countries and between sectors, administrative levels and other stakeholders.

Latin America and the Caribbean

Cooperation
is particularly
critical for
ensuring water
security in many
transboundary
basins and
aquifers

The different types of partnerships and forms of cooperation in the region are mainly waterfocused or closely connected to water-dependent sectors, such as agriculture. Evidence
points to limited engagement outside the water-based domain, such as water initiatives
linked to social justice, gender, education or job creation, or even other environment-related
aspects, such as biodiversity.
The most common water-related partnerships at the local level have been established
for overseeing drinking water supply and sanitation services, particularly in rural areas.
Agricultural producer groups, such as WUAs, are also widespread. One common trait of these
associations is that they usually operate independently of urban area regulators, with varying
levels of involvement from national-level authorities.
There is a long history of basin management organizations in the region, which mostly focus
on data monitoring, research, coordination of actions, regulation, planning, financing, and
development and administration, among other aspects. They often face similar challenges
related to technical capacity, governance structures and, particularly, funding.
There are additional instances of inter-institutional coordination where public, private and
community actors work together with the aim of improving water management. These
involve public- and private-sector entities, academia, community and national networks, and
national as well as international NGOs.

Asia and the Pacific
Water resources management contributed to the economic and social welfare of the
region over the last decade through the provision of basic WASH services, improved food
production, industrial development and ecosystem-based services. However, Asia and the
Pacific remains far from being on track to meet the targets of SDG 6.
Inequity in terms of water access remains an issue. Women, who are primarily responsible for
water collection in local communities, often have limited participation in water management
due to traditional norms and practices, such as power imbalances and sociocultural factors.
Other critical regional challenges include inadequate sanitation services and pollution, as
well as shortcomings in transboundary cooperation.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

There is a need to strengthen existing partnerships and networks, to enhance existing
platforms for better stakeholder engagement at all levels, and to ensure that all relevant
stakeholders are included in water governance. Participative governance approaches at
subnational and national levels, across multiple government agencies, would support the
mainstreaming and financing of water management and expedite progress across other
water-dependent sectors.

The Arab region
The region’s surface water scarcity, along with other rising challenges such as climate
change, high dependency on transboundary water resources and high usage of water
resources by the agricultural sector, requires successful cooperation and partnership
initiatives in order to progress towards water security.

In many parts of
the world, water
management is
shaped by local
knowledge and
practices

Several such arrangements have already been initiated in the Arab region despite the
financial and political barriers that might hinder collaboration. These have demonstrated the
importance of collaborative efforts, trust-building processes and data exchange for better
water management. However, given the immense challenges, increased collaboration is
needed, especially to secure additional financing, advance innovation and share information.
Most Arab states largely rely on rivers and/or aquifers shared with neighbouring countries
for their water supply. Despite certain inter-state tensions between some neighbouring
countries, several examples of cooperation modalities do exist in the region, including
transboundary aquifers. These transboundary cooperation arrangements have led to
improved water management through iterative trust-building processes that started with
targeted data-sharing, information-gathering and scientific research, which then developed
into more robust cooperation modalities.

Accelerating change
The following sections align with each of the five ‘accelerators’ of the SDG 6 Global
Acceleration Framework (GAF), in which partnerships and cooperation play a central role.
Such partnerships and cooperation transcend boundaries and sectors, making SDG 6
everyone’s business.

Education and capacity development
Education and capacity development are crucial to accelerate the development, adoption and
institutionalization of more sustainable and equitable water management practices. They
involve the sharing of knowledge and skills between teachers, students, institutions, and
other providers and recipients of information.
Technological progress is a major driver of such collaborative opportunities. The recent
COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has given a major boost to the development of digital
content and the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) for teaching
and training worldwide.
In many parts of the world, water management is shaped by local knowledge and practices.
Often based on natural processes that provide multiple ecosystem services, they can add
flexibility and adaptive capacity. Integrating this knowledge requires multidirectional forms of
knowledge exchange, such as occurs in communities of practice and professional networks.

Executive summary

7

Maximizing these opportunities poses several challenges. Some of them are
technical in nature, such as creating inclusive online platforms and systems that
maximize access to disadvantaged groups and communities. But partnerships for
more efficient, sustainable and equitable education and capacity development on
water can also benefit from a stronger adoption of approaches such as communities
of practice, citizen science, open innovation and life-long learning.
Many citizen science projects are cross-disciplinary partnerships that bring together
scientists, water professionals and the broader public. These projects often have a
strong educational dimension, and are increasingly used to build awareness on local
issues, such as water pollution and equitable resource allocation, and to increase
transparency and inclusivity.

Data and information
Data and information are essential to water-related decision-making. While the
potential breadth and scope of water-relevant data is vast, so too are the data gaps
from the local through to the international levels. Additional challenges include
insufficient levels of disaggregation and difficulties (or reluctance) in sharing data.

Government
agencies tasked
with resource
monitoring and
management
often lack the
capacity to
generate all the
data needed to
address waterrelated economic
and social issues

Water-related data are often generated by different users (or ‘sectors’) and therefore
not interoperable for multiple users due to differences in terminology and other
factors. While data may be considered to be neutral, the information generated
after data analysis may not be. Partnerships can help ensure that relevant data are
effectively generated and processed into objective information.
A broader engagement process, involving partners in priority-setting, planning,
data collection and joint development of data governance mechanisms, fosters
collective ownership. Successful partnerships also require time, transparency and
mutual respect. At initial stages, areas of common interest need to be explored,
expectations discussed and trust built in order to reach a common understanding
of the objectives. Consultation, communication and consensus-building are critical
throughout the process.
Open-access global data repositories can be used at national and regional scales,
but such data tend to lack the spatial resolution or level of disaggregation required
for more targeted interventions. Government agencies tasked with resource
monitoring and management, such as agricultural or environmental industries, often
lack the capacity to generate all the data needed to address water-related economic
and social issues. The problem is compounded further when these agencies fail (or
refuse) to share what data they do have between them.
Joint monitoring of transboundary water resources promotes a shared
understanding of the system and provides a platform where data can be shared and
applied in a timely manner. Transboundary actors such as river basin organizations,
national government entities, academic institutions, as well as development
organizations, are repositories of data that can be streamlined and shared through
these platforms. Harmonizing various databases, within and across borders, requires
partnerships between government institutions and private sector actors such as
companies and landowners.

Innovation
Partnerships can accelerate the development and uptake of innovative technologies
through knowledge transfer, entrepreneurship and applied research.
Strengthening and extending South–North and South–South partnerships between
universities encourage the transfer of new technologies and innovative skills. Business
incubators and accelerators can facilitate partnerships between universities, budding
entrepreneurs and venture capital providers. Such incubators should be strengthened
and expanded in middle- and low-income countries. Communities of practice for
knowledge co-creation and innovation with partners from the North and South could
go a long way towards developing technically feasible, economically viable, socially
acceptable and locally adaptable solutions.
Novel partnerships across the wider water and sanitation industry are also needed
to accelerate the uptake of new technologies for water processing, distribution
and treatment. This can be achieved through partnerships between industry and
technology providers, such as universities and entrepreneurs.
The introduction of new technologies and innovations, such as ICT, does not favour the
participation of those without proper access to internet or mobile phones connections,
not to mention electricity. Care should therefore be taken that the introduction of
new technologies does not lead to unintended side effects, such as a widening the
knowledge and socio-economic divides.

Financing
Achieving equitable access to safe drinking water for all by 2030 could require tripling
current investment levels. Evidence suggests that some WASH-related funding may
be poorly targeted and even counterproductive in addressing the needs of the poorest
people and communities.

Better coordination
across stakeholders
can generate
additional
funding streams
for water-related
investments

Better coordination across stakeholders can generate additional funding streams for
water-related investments from various sources. Cooperation mechanisms are key
for bringing these beneficiaries together and can facilitate joint financing of relevant
projects. Water funds are examples of multi-stakeholder platforms that pool funding
from various actors.
Cooperation among the different sources of finance can support and leverage cofinancing arrangements. By spreading investment risks among multiple financiers
(with differing risk appetites and requirements), public or development finance can
be used strategically to improve the risk–return profile of a project and to mobilize
additional investment – so-called ‘blended finance’ arrangements.
Better cooperation between the demand and supply sides of finance encompasses
improved understanding of (i) the supply and demand side’s respective perceptions,
characteristics and requirements; (ii) intermediary institutions and their diverse
functions; and (iii) the translation of water-related risks and benefits into expressions
relevant and understandable to the financial sector.
Investments for water supply and sanitation facilities at the household level require
specific financial products, such as micro-credits for low-income consumers and
households, and could attract finance from impact investors.

Executive summary

Governance
A whole-of-society approach embraces both formal and informal institutions in seeking a
generalized agreement across society about policy goals and the means to achieve them.
Trust and hope are fundamental building blocks for social cohesion and security. Trust is the
‘lubricant’ needed to ‘grease the wheels’ of the economy, and hope can be the mortar that
holds societies together. Addressing corruption has been shown to yield substantial cost
savings across the water sector, and also reduce the incidence of cancellations and delays.
Meaningful participation and inclusive stakeholder engagement take time but stand to
generate trust and hope. Policy and project processes need to adapt to the concerns
and potential contribution of different groups. Strategic integration of cross-sectoral and
stakeholder concerns involves developing norms, standards and allocation methods that
affect water use efficiency and the protection of resources across sectors.
Public authorities, acting on behalf of the state, in principle determine whether and how to
bring private operators in to deliver water and sanitation services. The authorities retain
their sovereign duties for ensuring the progressive fulfilment of the human rights to safe
drinking water and sanitation. To be successful, public–private partnerships (PPPs) need to
build upon cooperation that is beneficial to all stakeholders – they need to serve the public
interest while providing a decent return to the service provider. Both private sector and public
sector operations are more effective in countries with clear, predictable and stable legislative
frameworks, as these allow long-term investment to be supported with confidence and
receive a reasonable return.

Coda
Safeguarding water, food and energy security through sustainable water management,
providing water supply and sanitation services to all, supporting human health and
livelihoods, mitigating the impacts of climate change and extreme events, and sustaining and
restoring ecosystems and the valuable services they provide, are all pieces of a great and
complex puzzle.
Only through partnerships and cooperation can the pieces come together.
And everyone has a role to play.

Water demand

Globally, water use has been increasing by roughly 1% per year over the last 40 years
(AQUASTAT, n.d.). The bulk of this increase is concentrated in middle- and lower-income
countries, particularly in emerging economies (Ritchie and Roser, 2017). This trend has been
driven by a combination of population growth, socio-economic development and changing
consumption patterns (Figure P.1). Regions with the largest water withdrawals per capita have
been Northern America and Central Asia (FAO, 2022). Between 2010 and 2018, municipal
withdrawals increased by 3%, whereas agricultural withdrawals increased by 5%, and now
represent 72% of total withdrawals. Meanwhile, industrial withdrawals decreased by 12%,
mainly due to reductions in withdrawals for thermal power production, as cooling processing
has become more water-efficient (FAO, 2022).

Groundwater provides half of the volume of water withdrawn for domestic uses globally and
around 25% of all water withdrawn for irrigation (United Nations, 2022).

not) measures to

12

Total water withdrawals per capita remained flat or declined from 2000 to 2018, except in
Central America and the Caribbean, South America and Southeast Asia. In general, these
trends are expected to persist as populations grow, partly due to overall increases in water
productivity, including in agriculture, and partly due to the prevalence of water scarcity
induced by extended periods of aridity in areas of high population density (FAO, 2022).
Future trends in demand are difficult to predict accurately. Burek et al. (2016) estimated
that overall global demand for water will continue to increase at an annual rate of about
1%, resulting in an increase of between 20 to 30% by 2050, with a margin of error of more
than 50%. The evolution of water demand is highly location-specific, reflecting shifting use
patterns across the three major water use sectors – municipalities, industries and agriculture.
Growth in the municipal sector is mainly driven by the expansion of water supply (and to
a lesser extent sanitation) services, and is therefore faster in regions where efforts are
being made to address lower levels of existing provision. Industrial water demand is led by
water-intensive processes, including various types of manufacturing and energy production.

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Therefore, increases tend to be associated with escalating industrialization (as is currently
the case in many middle-income and emerging economies), but demand can subsequently
decrease as industries and (especially) energy production become more water-efficient.
Water demand for agriculture is essentially driven by irrigation, where demand will vary as a
function of several determining factors, ranging from soil to climatic factors and from crop
type to field applications. Agricultural water use is also increasingly determined by competing
uses and limits to availability, while food consumption patterns and trade are also important
factors (FAO, 2022).
These global figures mask important local and regional differences; for example, in Europe,
agriculture withdraws only 30%, municipalities 26% and industry 45%, whereas in South Asia,
the respective figures are 91%, 7 % and 2% (FAO, 2022). Real growth in water demand will
be highly dependent upon whether (or not) measures to improve water use efficiency are
implemented across these different sectors.

Water availability
and stress

The global volume of renewable freshwater was estimated at around 37,000 km³/year in 2015
(Ritchie and Roser, 2017). Availability varies considerably locally and regionally according to
geological and climatic factors. Seasonal variation in water availability (Figure P.2) is also a
main driver of water storage needs. It can be as important a factor as total annual availability,
or even more important.

Figure P.2 Seasonal variability in water availability

Higher values indicate wider variations of available supply within a year.

Availability per capita is another critical consideration. It varies significantly by region, but has
been decreasing in all worldwide as a function of population growth rates (Figure P.3). The
decline in global per capita internal renewable water resources (IRWRs) was about 20% between
2000 and 2018; with a greater change in countries with the lowest per capita IRWRs, which are
often located in Sub-Saharan Africa (41%), Central Asia (30%), Western Asia (29%) and Northern
Africa (26%). Europe was the region showing the smallest decline, with 3% (FAO, 2022).

Water scarcity
is becoming
endemic as a
result of the local
impact of physical
water stress,
coupled with
the acceleration
and spreading
of freshwater
pollution

Global freshwater withdrawal was about 3,800 km³/year in 2017 (United Nations, 2021;
AQUASTAT n.d.), roughly 10% of renewable water resources availability. But this global statistic
is particularly misleading as it hides real problems related to local or regional physical water
stress (Figure P.4), a term used to describe water use as a proportion of water availability.
Physical water stress is determined by a combination of factors, including surface and/or
groundwater availability (which can be greatly influenced by varying climatic conditions),
ecological requirements, and human abstractions.
Water scarcity is becoming endemic as a result of the local impact of physical water stress,
coupled with the acceleration and spreading of freshwater pollution (FAO, 2022).
The first consequence of scarcity is increasing use and depletion of groundwater. The rate of
groundwater storage depletion is estimated to be between 100 and 200 km³/year, accounting
for 15 to 25% of all groundwater withdrawals (United Nations, 2022). Hotspots of groundwater
depletion are found around the world, most often in areas with intensive groundwater
withdrawals for irrigation or to supply large cities (Figure P.5).
While some places experience physical water stress throughout the entire year, others
experience water stress during one or more months per year, as a result of seasonal variability
in water availability (Figure P.2). Between 2.2 and 3.2 billion people lived under water stress
for at least 1 month per year in 2010, corresponding to 32% and 46% of the world’s population

irrigation and livestock consumptive and non-consumptive uses. Available renewable water supplies include surface and groundwater supplies and considers
the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. Higher values indicate more competition among users.

at the time. Around 80% of people living under water stress lived in Asia; in particular,
northeast China, as well as India and Pakistan (Vanham et al., 2021). The global urban
population facing water scarcity is projected to increase from 933 million (one third
of global urban population) in 2016 to 1.7–2.4 billion people (one third to nearly half of
global urban population) in 2050, with India projected to be the most severely affected
(He et al., 2021).
Physical scarcity does not adequately account for economic water scarcity, which
describes a situation in which there is sufficient water to meet human and environmental
needs, but access is limited due to a lack of water infrastructure or poor water resources
management. Twenty years ago, an estimated 1.6 billion people lived under conditions
of economic water scarcity (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in
Agriculture, 2007), and it remains unclear whether this number has gone up or down.
Currently, about 25% of the global croplands are under agricultural economic water
scarcity, where the lack of irrigation is due to limited institutional and economic
capacity instead of hydrologic constraints. These lands are mainly located across
Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Europe (Rosa et al., 2020). However, such
calculations rarely consider economic outputs from alternative uses of the same water.
Also, dependent on scenario assumptions, major hydrologic basins can experience
strongly positive or strongly negative economic impacts due to global trade dynamics and
market adaptations to regional water scarcity (Dolan et al., 2021). These observations,
among others, highlight the need for a much more systematic approach to assessing
both physical and economic water scarcity that will require enhanced partnerships and
cooperation between different disciplines and stakeholders.

Climate change is likely to increase seasonal variability in, and uncertainty about,
water availability, quality and quantity in most regions (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020).
According to World Bank (2016), water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change,
could cost some regions up to 6% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2050
due to water-related impacts on agriculture, health and incomes, potentially spurring
migration and even conflict. The combined effects of growing populations, rising
incomes and expanding cities will see an exponential rise in water demand, while
supply becomes more erratic and uncertain. Water will become increasingly scarce in
regions where it is currently abundant – such as Central Africa, East Asia and parts of
South America – and scarcity will greatly worsen in regions where water is already in
short supply – such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa.

Water quality

Water quality data remain sparse, especially at the global level, due in large part to weak
monitoring and reporting capacity. This is especially true in many of the least developed
countries in Asia and Africa (United Nations, 2021). Poor water quality remains an
impediment to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including
regarding public health, productivity, economic prosperity and the environment
(Alcamo, 2019).
Low-, middle- and high-income countries all show signs of risks related to water quality
(Figure P.6). Poor ambient water quality in low-income countries is often related to low
levels of wastewater treatment (WWAP, 2017), whereas in higher-income countries
runoff from agriculture is a relatively more serious problem (UNEP, 2021). The release
of hazardous chemicals from industry still occurs across all continents, and emerging
pollutants, including microplastics and pharmaceuticals, remain a growing concern
(WWAP, 2017; United Nations, 2021).

Water itself is an ecosystem service and underpins all other ecosystem services. There are
specific water-related ecosystem services that have to do with regulating water quality and
availability (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). Terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems
of all types play a role in the global water cycle.
Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened in the world (Vári et al., 2022). The
most significant pressures on river basin water balances are from freshwater withdrawals
and drainage from agricultural land (FAO/IWMI, 2018), which can compromise the hydraulic
continuity of downstream wetlands and associated ecosystem services. Impacts are not
limited to those from surface water use. Declines of groundwater of less than 1.0 m have been
shown to potentially remove high levels of ecological protection (Gleeson and Richter, 2018).
A great majority of indicators of ecosystems and biodiversity have been experiencing rapid
deterioration across the globe as a result of multiple human drivers. For example, 75% of the
land surface has been significantly altered, with over 85% of natural wetlands area lost. Since
1970, land use change has had the largest relative negative impact on both terrestrial and
freshwater ecosystems (IPBES, 2019). “Areas of the world projected to experience significant
negative effects from global changes in climate, biodiversity, ecosystem functions and nature’s
contributions to people are also home to large concentrations of indigenous peoples and many
of the world’s poorest communities” (IPBES, 2019, p.15).
Impacts of land use change can also include significant associated greenhouse gas emissions,
for example when peatlands are drained and converted to cropland (Crump, 2017).

The state of the world’s freshwater resources

The loss of environmental services and biodiversity is expected to continue as natural
landscapes are lost to cultivated land (UNEP, 2019). How to maintain sustainable levels
of production while avoiding further damage to the natural resources and the provision of
ecosystem services will remain a central question in global debates on the future of food,
water and agriculture (FAO, 2022).

Extreme events

Floods and droughts are among the most devastating disasters due to natural hazards
known to humankind. Over the period 2000–2019, floods alone are reported to have
caused US$650 billion in economic losses, affecting 1.65 billion people and resulting
in over 100,000 deaths. Over the same period, droughts affected another 1.43 billion
people, with recorded estimated losses of nearly US$130 billion. Combined, floods and
droughts accounted for over 75% of all disasters due to natural hazards affecting people
(CRED/UNDRR, 2020).
Over the period 1985–2015, flood frequency has increased at both global and latitudinal
scales, with floods in the tropics quadrupling since 2000, compared to a 2.5-fold
increase in the north mid-latitudes (Najibi and Devineni, 2018). Trends regarding droughts
are more difficult to establish, although an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts
and ‘heat extremes’ can be expected in most regions as a direct result of climate change
(Clarke et al., 2022). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), increases in drought frequency and magnitude are
projected to pose substantially larger risks with a temperature rise of 2°C than at 1.5°C,
particularly in the Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and
the Near East) and southern Africa (medium confidence).

Prologue
Part 2

Progress
towards SDG 6
WWAP
Richard Connor and David Coates

The sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6) seeks to ensure the availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, focusing on drinking water and
sanitation, the sustainable management of water resources, water quality, integrated water
resources management (IWRM), water-related ecosystems, and the enabling environment.
In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, countries have committed to engage in
systematic follow-up and review of progress towards the SDGs and their targets, using a
set of global indicators. The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative (IMI-SDG6) supports
countries’ monitoring of, and reporting on, SDGs. A summary of the targets, indicators and
custodial agencies are shown in Figure P.7.
Half-way through the 2030 Agenda timeline, progress towards SDG 6 targets is only
significantly reported for drinking water and sanitation, with some preliminary and rough
indications of progress for water stress, water use efficiency, transboundary cooperation
and IWRM, leaving 5 of the 11 target indicators without reported quantified information
on progress (United Nations, 2022a). These gaps in monitoring and reporting are largely
due to data deficiencies. Without historical data, progress cannot be measured and
without multiple waypoints the acceleration required cannot be assessed. The most
recent results of the IMI-SDG6 are presented below for each target.

SDG Targets
6.1 and 6.2
Drinking water and
sanitation services

“Five years into the SDGs, the world is not on track to achieve SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2.
Achieving universal coverage by 2030 will require a quadrupling of current rates of progress
in safely managed drinking water services, safely managed sanitation services, and basic
hygiene services. Least developed countries (LDCs) have the furthest to go and it will be
especially challenging to accelerate progress in fragile contexts. Many more countries
are facing challenges in extending services to rural areas and to poor and vulnerable
populations who are most at risk of being left behind” (WHO/UNICEF, 2021, p. 7).
According to the latest figures from 2020 (Figure P.8), 26% of the world’s population
(2 billion people) did not have access to safely managed drinking water services,
including 1.2 billion people with basic services, 282 million with limited services,
367 million using unimproved sources, and 122 million drinking surface water. An
estimated 46% (3.6 billion) lacked access to safely managed sanitation, including
1.9 billion people with basic services, 580 million with limited services, 616 million
using unimproved facilities, and 494 million practising open defecation. Furthermore,
29% (2.3 billion) lacked basic hygiene services, including 670 million people with no
handwashing facilities at all. Over half of these people (374 million) lived in fragile
contexts (WHO/UNICEF, 2021).

SDG Target 6.3
Water quality
and wastewater

SDG Indicator 6.3.1 tracks the proportion of total, industrial and domestic wastewater
flows that are safely treated in compliance with national or local standards, and its
status is reported by UN-Habitat/WHO (2021). Globally, an estimated 44% of all domestic
wastewater worldwide was not safely treated prior to its release into the environment
in 2020. This number was extrapolated from data from 128 countries representing
80% of the global population. Data and reporting coverage are even lower for ‘total’ and
‘industrial’ wastewater flows, where figures are available only up to 2015 and remain too
sparse to develop global values: only 42 countries (representative of 18% of the global
population) reported both generation and treatment of total wastewater flows, with
32% receiving at least some treatment; only 14 countries (representing 4% of the global
population) reported the percentage of the industrial wastewater flow that was treated,
which averaged only 30%.

SDG Indicator 6.3.2 monitors the proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality,
as per national and/or subnational water quality standards and based on measurements of
five water quality parameters that inform on the most common pressures on water quality at
the global level (oxygen, salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus and acidity). The latest status report
is provided by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2021a). About 60% of
the world’s reported water bodies were categorized as having ‘good’ ambient water quality.
However, over three-quarters of the over 75,000 water bodies that were reported on in 2020
were in 24 high-GDP countries. The poorest 20 countries reported on just over 1,000 water
bodies and are therefore grossly under-represented in this global estimate. Only 59% of the
89 countries reporting included data on groundwater. Some positive trends were reported, with
19 of the 49 countries reporting in both 2017 and 2020 being on track to improve water quality;
all were countries with a robust monitoring system in place.

SDG Target 6.4
Water use
efficiency and
water scarcity

SDG Indicator 6.4.1 monitors the change in water use efficiency over time, measured as
the ratio of monetary value added to the volume of water used. The latest status report is
available from FAO/UN-Water (2021a). Water use efficiency rose by 9% from 2015 to 2018
(from 17.3 to 18.9 US$/m³). All economic sectors have seen an increase in their water use
efficiency between 2015 and 2018: the industrial sector by 15% (with a water use efficiency
equivalent to 32.2 US$/m³ in 2018), and by 8% in the services sector (112.2 US$/m³ in 2018)
and the agriculture sector (0.60 US$/m³). Data are available for 86 countries from 2006. The

industrial sector has experienced the largest net efficiency gains from 2006 to 2018, likely
due to the transformation of thermal cooling for energy production, industrial processes and
heating systems. Emerging data on total withdrawals and gross value added (GVA) over the
years reveal a potential decoupling of economic growth from water use since 2016. These
results are preliminary and remain inconclusive until more data points are forthcoming.
Water use efficiency is closely linked to water scarcity. SDG Indicator 6.4.2 tracks water stress
(Figure P.4) as a proxy measure of scarcity, and the most recent status report is provided by
FAO/UN-Water (2021b). In 2018, 18.4% of the total global renewable freshwater resources
available was being withdrawn.1 Although this figure may seem safe, there are important large
regional, national and subnational variations (Figure P.4). Three out of seven SDG regions had
water stress values above 25% in 2018, including Central and Southern Asia with high water
stress and Northern Africa with critical water stress. Western Asia and Eastern Asia had
medium and low water stress, respectively. The remaining regions and subregions,
representing approximately 31% of the global population, were at the ‘no stress’ level, but
important differences in water stress levels were evident at country and major basin level. On
average, 10% of the global population lives in countries with high or critical water stress, which
significant impacts water access and availability for personal needs.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Previous published reports indicate a much lower level of water stress. These differences
are attributed largely to improved assessment methodologies. FAO/UN-Water (2021b)
recomputed data prior to 2015. This shows that the water stress value has evolved from
2008 to 2018 at the regional and subregional levels (Figure P.9). Note that in order to reach
Target 6.4, water stress should not increase at a slower rate, but decrease. Slower growth is
evident in Eastern, Western and Central Asia but a moderate to large increase between 2008
and 2018 is evident in South-Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan
Africa, Oceania, and Northern Africa. Southern Asia, Europe and Northern America reduced
their water stress level between 2008 and 2018.

SDG Target 6.5
Water management
and transboundary
cooperation

SDG Indicator 6.5.1 monitors the degree of IWRM2 implementation, by assessing the four
key dimensions of IWRM: enabling environment, institutions and participation, management
instruments, and financing. According to the latest indicator status report (UNEP, 2021b),
while most countries have made some progress, the global rate of progress on IWRM
implementation needs to double to approach the target. None of the four IWRM dimensions
is expected to be fully implemented by all countries by 2030. Management arrangements at
the basin level are generally lagging behind at the subnational and national level, and aquifer
management is lagging further still. Acceleration is most urgently needed in South and
Central America, the Caribbean, Oceania, South Asia, Central Asia, Central Africa, and West
Africa, but further effort is still needed in all regions. A total of 107 countries are not on track
to achieve SDG Target 6.5. There are signs of progress: between 2017 and 2020, 55 countries
made limited or no progress, but 52 countries made moderate progress, 22 countries made
substantial progress, and 44 countries are close to the target. Despite this progress, the
degree of IWRM implementation remains low, with 87 countries (47%) still reporting ‘low’ or
‘medium–low’ levels.
SDG Indicator 6.5.2 monitors the area of a country within transboundary basins
and assesses the extent to which that area is covered by operational3 cooperation
arrangements. In total, 153 countries share 286 transboundary river and lake basins
and 592 transboundary aquifer systems. As of 2022, an estimated 58% of the world’s
transboundary basin areas had an operational arrangement for water cooperation. The
global average of the aquifer component is 42% (UNECE/UNESCO, 2021). In most cases,
transboundary aquifers are part of broader water cooperation arrangements, rather than
covered by stand-alone agreements (United Nations, 2022b).

SDG Target 6.6
Water-related
ecosystems

SDG Indicator 6.6.1 tracks changes in extent of water-related ecosystems over time. The
latest update of the indicator is reported in UNEP (2021c). A primary indicator, the wetlands
extent index, tracks natural wetland area since 1700, showing an 80% loss since the preindustrial era. The data are not yet refined enough to track discrete trends in recent years.
The monitoring effort is also compiling data on areas of lakes, rivers, wetlands, mangroves,
groundwater and reservoirs. Combined data on these indicators need to be interpreted
carefully, but they do confirm, for example, the rapid changes occurring in the global surface
water area. An estimated 21% of the world’s water basins are experiencing rapid changes,
both increases and decreases, in the area covered by surface waters. The disaggregated
datasets confirm the continuing shift in surface area from natural wetlands, such as river

IWRM is “a process which promotes the co-ordinated development and management of water, land and related
resources, in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without
compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems” (GWP, 2000, p. 22).

Arrangements are ‘operational’ when there is a joint body, meetings between countries take place and information is
exchanged at least once per year, and joint or coordinated management plans or objectives for the basin(s) have been set.

floodplains, to artificial water bodies such as reservoirs. An experimental data platform
(the ‘Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer’ – see Section 3.4) is being developed to provide
an improved and simplified but accessible overall picture of a complex monitoring area.
Datasets also include those for water quality, river flow, IWRM and other management
trends. Potential for a ‘scorecard’ to quantify river basin health, using multiple datasets, to
assist in providing a more systematic overview of trends, is being explored. The monitoring
for Indicator(s) 6.6.1 does not currently measure mountains or forests or the extent of
ecosystem restoration dimensions of Target 6.6.

SDG Target 6.a
International
cooperation and
capacity-building

SDG Indicator 6.a.1 tracks the amount of water- and sanitation-related official development
assistance (ODA) that is included in a government-coordinated spending plan. According
to estimates by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
ODA disbursed and committed to ‘water’ in 2020 was estimated at US$8.7 billion globally, up
from US$2.7 billion in 2002 (OECD.stat, n.d.). Investment categories include water supply and
sanitation, agricultural water resources, and hydro-electric power plants. The OECD Creditor
Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA data on water and sanitation among
several categories (including sector policy and administration, water resources protection,
large and basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management,
agricultural water resources, and education and training). The UN-Water IMI-SDG6 had not
yet reported comprehensively and separately on this indicator at the time of this report’s
publication, although real-time data are available on the data portal.4

SDG Target 6.b
Community
participation

SDG Indicator 6.b.1 measures the proportion of local administrative units with established
and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and
sanitation management. Participation of users and communities helps ensure sustainable
solutions for all aspects of SDG 6 and contributes to equality within and among countries,
including with regard to gender. The metric in use records the existence, at country level, of
procedures in law or policy for participation, as well as the actual level of participation, in the
subsectors of urban drinking water, rural drinking water, urban sanitation, rural sanitation,
hygiene promotion, and water resources planning and management. Data availability has
improved from 2014. The number of countries with clearly defined procedures in law or
policy for participation by users/communities has increased between 2014 and 2019. Over
the same period, the number of countries reporting high levels of participation has increased
more rapidly, but still remains low overall (Figure P.10). Levels for both laws/procedures and
participation are very low for drinking water in both urban and rural settings compared to the
other subsectors.

1.1
Purpose and
scope of this
report

The year 2023 marks the first major United Nations (UN) conference dedicated to water5
since 1977. The UN 2023 Water Conference focuses on progress towards water- and
sanitation-related goals, coinciding with the mid-term comprehensive review of the
International Decade for Action, ‘Water for Sustainable Development 2018–2028’. At current
rates, progress towards all the targets of the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6)
is off-track and in some areas the rate of implementation needs to quadruple, or more (see
Prologue Part 2). The SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework (GAF) was designed to accelerate
this progress, and partnerships and cooperation are central to it (Box 1.1). Such partnerships
and cooperation transcend boundaries and sectors, making SDG 6 everyone’s business.
As the UN system’s principal authoritative report on water, the United Nations World Water
Development Report 2023 directly informs the UN conference discussions, describing how
building partnerships and enhancing cooperation across all dimensions of sustainable
development are essential to accelerating progress towards SDG 6 and realizing the human
rights to water and sanitation.

Partnerships
and cooperation,
at all levels,
overwhelmingly
deliver positive
outcomes

The Prologue to this report briefly describes the status and trends concerning global
freshwater resources (availability, demand, quality, etc.) and summarizes the current
level of progress on each of the SDG 6 targets. Chapters 2–7 showcase experiences and
perspectives on partnerships and cooperation from different water-dependent sectors:
Agriculture, Environment, Human Settlements, Industry and Energy, Human Health, and
Climate Change. Regional knowledge and practices are highlighted in Chapter 8. Chapters
9–13 review partnerships and cooperation with regards to each of the five ‘accelerators’
under the SDG 6 GAF: Education and Capacity Development, Data and Information, Innovation,
Funding, and Governance. Guiding principles for successful partnerships and cooperation,
along with a review of the roles, responsibilities and contributions of partners at various
levels, are presented in Chapter 14.
Partnerships and cooperation, at all levels, overwhelmingly deliver positive outcomes.
Cooperation improves water governance and decision-making, stimulates innovative
solutions, and leverages efficiencies. By promoting inclusive engagement, participation
and dialogue, and giving voices to those that are otherwise not heard (e.g. marginalized
communities), partnerships can help ensure that no one is left behind and that the human
rights to water and sanitation are realized.
However, in rare cases, partnerships and cooperation can institutionalize exclusion, distort
resource allocations and encourage fragmentation. Corruption is widespread in the water
sector (WIN, 2016; Vos, 2011) and can be based on or influenced by partnerships and
cooperation. These negative aspects, even where unintentional, highlight the need to be
vigilant that partnerships and cooperation are aligned with societal benefits.
Water resources management has a long history of experience with partnerships, both good
and bad. Partnerships and cooperation take place in almost any water-related endeavour.
The currently inadequate rate of progress towards the SDG 6 targets (see Prologue Part 2)
highlights the need to explore opportunities for new models of partnerships and cooperation,
especially because of the intersectoral nature of water, crossing all the social, economic
and environmental pillars of sustainable development. This report reviews this experience,
highlighting how enhancing positive and meaningful cooperation amongst the water,
sanitation and broader ‘development’ communities is required to accelerate progress.

1.2
Basic concepts

1.2.1 What is a partnership or cooperation?
There is a multitude of definitions and understanding of what constitutes a partnership or
cooperation. For the purpose of this report, partnerships are considered to be “voluntary and
collaborative relationships between various parties, both public and non-public, in which all
participants agree to work together to achieve a common purpose or undertake a specific task
and, as mutually agreed, to share risks and responsibilities, resources and benefits” (UNGA,
2015). Partnerships between different stakeholders at all levels (international, national and
local) are emphasized in most contemporary water-related policy approaches, recognizing
that solutions to water problems cannot be achieved by one organization or even one
segment of society (WWAP, 2003).
Partnerships are often based on some type of formal or informal agreement. Cooperation
is generally understood to be a less formal practice of “working together to the same end”
(Dictionary, 2021). ‘Water cooperation’ entails various players and sectors working together
towards a common goal to peacefully manage and use freshwater resources at the local,
national, regional and international levels (UN Water for Life Decade, 2013). Each of these
cooperative arrangements may include more formal partnerships, and each partnership
involves cooperation. Consequently, many sections of this report use the two terms flexibly
and often interchangeably.

Box 1.1 The SDG 6 Global Acceleration
Framework
The SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework
(GAF) is a new, unifying initiative that aims
to deliver ‘fast results at an increased
scale’. It is part of the UN SecretaryGeneral’s Decade of Action to deliver the
SDGs by 2030.
One of the main strategies focuses on
partnerships, noting the need to establish
or scale up powerful partnerships at the
global, regional, community, and river, lake
and aquifer basin levels. The objectives of
such partnerships include: to generate and
sustain political will, to mobilize public and
private entities across different sectors
for cooperation, to foster innovation and
reform, to prevent conflicts, and to promote
effective, sustainable and peaceful
management of water resources.
Designed to enable entities within the UN
system and multi-stakeholder partners
to act together to support country
progress, the SDG 6 GAF is guided by five
accelerators: Capacity, Funding, Innovation,
Data and Information, and Governance.
Source: UN-Water (2020).

To distinguish them from a loose association among
players (e.g. meetings), genuinely successful examples
of partnerships and cooperation are those that result in a
demonstrable mutual benefit for the parties involved and/or
result in a tangible change in their behaviour.

1.2.2 Types of partnerships and cooperation
Partnerships exist at all geographic scales: global,
international, basin, regional, national and local. Some are
more wide-ranging in terms of the aspects of water that they
cover, some are more specific; some focus solely on water,
and others link to other subject matters. Examples include
multi-stakeholder partnerships, corporate partnerships,
academic/research partnerships, public–private partnerships
(PPPs), basin organizations that involve multiple countries
as partners, water user associations (WUAs), and water
operator partnerships, among many others. Examples of
cooperation include networks, platforms, transboundary
water cooperation, and multi-/cross-/inter-sectoral and
interdisciplinary cooperation, technical cooperation,
South–South/North–South/triangular cooperation, and
development cooperation, among several others. Integrated
water resources management (IWRM) can involve both
partnerships and cooperation, but not always depending on
its level of participation.
Partnerships and cooperation can develop naturally among
parties, or need enabling and promoting, but few are without
difficulties. Each party comes with its own knowledge,
perceptions, interests, positions and objectives, such that
disagreements on priorities and strategies are commonplace.

Introduction

1.2.3 Categorizing partnerships
Spatial scales are a precarious way of categorizing partnership and cooperation over
water, as these can occur at different geographic scales and most usually operate across
multiple scales. Similarly, categorization by discipline or subsector is problematic because
stakeholders themselves often operate across different scales and, most importantly, may or
may not necessarily share the same primary water-related objectives.
The novel approach to categorization adopted for the purposes of this report focuses directly
on the overall objectives of the partners in relation to the type of water-related outcomes that
they are meant to collectively achieve. These are divided into three categories:
a) Intra-sectoral partnerships and cooperation between or among stakeholders with a
common and specific type of water-related use or objective. The partners may include
different types of stakeholders (e.g. governments, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), private sector, financiers, academia, local communities, etc.), but all would share
the same general water management objective. Examples include organizations managing
a common irrigation system, or coalitions that supply drinking water and sanitation
infrastructure to a certain area.
b) Cross-sectoral (or inter-sectoral) partnerships and cooperation, involving actors with
different water-related foci and multiple (different or even competing) water-related
objectives. While these can potentially involve several of the actors mentioned above, the
difference is that these actors would have different perspectives and, therefore, often
different perceptions, intentions and goals requiring conciliation and/or benefit-sharing.
Examples include cooperation between municipalities and farmers over the allocation of
water supplies, or payment for environmental services schemes.
c) Extra-sectoral partnerships and cooperation, involving actors from ‘outside the water
domain’, where the primary foci and objectives of some partners are not primarily
water-related, but where water plays a determining role. Such non-water objectives may
involve land use, gender equity, urban/rural planning, education, job creation, art and
culture, trade, and economic development (among others). Partnerships and cooperation
addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation through water-related interventions
is one specific example.

Introduction

This chapter examines three management responses to explore cooperation and partnership
for food and agriculture. Water user associations (WUAs) are chosen as an example of
intra-sectoral water partnerships and cooperation; water allocation for agriculture and urban
centres to illustrate cross-sectoral interactions; and the water–energy–food–environment
(WEFE) nexus as an extra-sectoral case study.
Data and information concerning water use for all sectors is required in order to determine
their impacts on water and other water-related systems (e.g. energy). By increasing the
availability of high-quality data for evidence-based policy-making, regulations, planning and
investments at all levels, the FAO AQUASTAT Database, as well as the UN-Water collaboration
and partnerships through the Integrated Monitoring Initiative for the Sustainable Development
Goal 6 (IMI-SDG6), are key examples in accelerating the achievement of SDG 6.
The chapter illustrates how the levels of cooperation and performance of a management
response is determined by a multitude of hydro-physical, socio-economic, political, institutional
and governance parameters. Partnerships and cooperation between actors operate at varying
and interdependent sectoral scales, depending on the objectives and scope.
Additional highlights include how the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework6 accelerators are
of critical importance to the performance of management responses, and how partnerships
and cooperation can help strengthen them in order to improve water and food security.

The characteristics of partnerships and cooperation involving WUAs are an important
factor when considering their performance. The actors involved in WUAs often include
farmers, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, bilateral
development institutions, development banks, and in some cases the private sector. Capacity,
funding and governance issues are also highlighted in relation to WUA performance, linking
to the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework accelerators. WUAs warrant attention because
of their focus on improving the performance of irrigation schemes and smallholder farm
systems, enhancing irrigated agricultural productivity and food security for marginalized
farmers whose livelihoods are often highly dependent on irrigated agriculture.
WUAs are formal organizations that bring together farmers for the purpose of managing a
common irrigation system. The historical development of WUAs at a larger scale originates
from the late 1970s. They sought to improve coverage and efficiency in low-performing
state-managed irrigation systems (Mollinga et al., 2007; Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007;
Turral, 1995), and to improve small-scale community-based and farmer-led irrigation systems.
Decentralization entails transferring management responsibility for all or part of an irrigation
scheme from the state to farmers (Aarnoudse et al., 2018; Turral, 1995). Principal tasks of
WUAs include the allocation of water within an irrigation system, operation and maintenance
(O&M), and the cost recovery of O&M through the collection of irrigation fees. WUAs are
generally small-scale with a limited number of members (usually not exceeding several
hundred, dependent on the size of the irrigation system), so that self-management by users is
possible (Aarnoudse et al., 2018).
The characterization and development of WUAs differ globally. In South and South-East Asia,
as well as North Africa, WUAs are primarily established for the management of large- and
medium-scale irrigation systems, rehabilitated or constructed by governments. They are
generally managed by state irrigation departments. WUAs in North Africa and Sub-Saharan
Africa are also established in small-scale irrigated systems and managed by farmers. In the
case of Sub-Saharan Africa, WUAs are often heterogeneous (serving multiple uses and users,

through development projects addressing smallholder farmers (Aarnoudse et al., 2018).

2.2.1 Factors affecting performance
At the global level, the results of the performance of WUAs are mixed. Some have less-thansatisfactory results, performing below the expectations of governments and donor agencies.
Recent reviews of WUA performance based on the analysis of a large number of case studies
in Africa and Asia found that, overall, they underperformed due to poor implementation,
unclear roles and responsibilities, lack of women participation, and lack in administrative
authority, among other factors (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007; Ghazouani et al., 2012; Mukherji
et al., 2009; Senanayake et al., 2011, 2015). This confirms earlier research on implementation
challenges of decentralization through Participatory Irrigation Management (Meinzen-Dick
et al., 1995; Turral, 1995; Vermillion, 1997; Groenfeldt and Svendsen, 2000; Meinzen-Dick
et al., 2002; Uphoff and Wijayaratna, 2000). Factors of WUA underperformance are related
to unrealistic cost recovery expectations and lack of inclusive stakeholder participation in
irrigation projects (Aarnoudse et al., 2018), characterized by unclear formulation of roles and
responsibilities of WUAs (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, there are also many cases of successful WUA performance and
implementation, depending on the local socio-political, economic and hydro-physical
context. Generally speaking, context-specific factors positively correlated with effectiveness.
Successful experiences have been documented with active farmers’ participation in
Japan; with small-size systems and rich social capital in Nepal; long-term engagement
and involvement of NGOs in Sri Lanka and India; and the provision of correct incentives to
irrigation officials and farmers in China (Mukherji et al., 2009).
The multitude of factors influencing WUA performance and levels of cooperation between
actors can be categorized into four themes: socio-economic and political settings; water
resource systems; governance; and users (Table 2.1) (Meinzen-Dick, 2007). It is beyond the
scope of this section to discuss all of these factors. However, a number of partnerships
between actors (e.g. farmer user groups, national irrigation agencies) are highlighted
as important to the performance and implementation of WUAs, as well as SGD 6 Global
Acceleration Framework accelerators, especially in terms of water resources systems (data
and information) and finance.

The characteristics and internal dynamics of WUA farmer user groups are found to be an
important factor in determining the level of participation and cooperation within WUAs.
Smaller-sized WUAs are generally more successful, with evidence from Asia indicating that
less than 1,000 farmers is optimal (Mukherji et al., 2009). Farmer groups that share similar
norms and have social capital from other local institutions, such as village councils or religious
groups, are also found to be more successful, as exemplified by the Panchakanya Irrigation
System in Nepal (Mukherji et al., 2009). Another influential factor is the presence and long-term
involvement of local NGOs within farmer user groups (Meinzen-Dick, 2007). Evidence from
Africa also highlights strong and charismatic leadership as an important factor in successive
collective action of farmer groups (Meinzen-Dick, 2007; Ghazouani et al., 2012).
Democratic processes within WUAs, such as the election of chairpersons and other board
members, are found to enhance farmer participation and cooperation, such as in the
Toyogawa Irrigation Project in Japan (Mukherji et al., 2009).
An insightful critique on social dynamics is that WUAs are not necessarily homogeneous
groups of water users with predictable relations of trust and a common purpose that
would enhance collective action and cooperation (Aarnoudse et al., 2018). It is argued that
collective action around irrigation is often embedded in wider systems of patronage and
social hierarchies in villages (Mosse, 2006). Government and donor-supported agencies
have imposed central and national directives, often through mandated scheme by-laws or
rules, which may not reflect local WUA leadership to provide equitable, inclusive member
participation in decision-making (Mukherji et al., 2009).

State irrigation authorities
Decentralization of management responsibility from state irrigation departments is a central
tenant of WUAs, as pursued through Participatory Irrigation Management from the 1970s
onwards. However, irrigation departments and water ministries that do not take farmer-led
initiatives into consideration may limit effective farmer participation and cooperation through
WUAs. In many countries, such as in India (Nikku, 2006; Mollinga and Bolding, 2004), Indonesia
(Suhardiman, 2008), Mexico (Rap et al., 2004; Wester, 2009) and Thailand (Molle and Floch,
2008), state irrigation agencies have gone through decentralization reforms, guiding WUA
board member elections, establishing the legal status of WUAs, directing revenue flows, and
setting rights and responsibilities through legal documents (Mukherji et al., 2009).
Powerful state irrigation agencies are sometimes inclined to pursue national and regional
hydraulic missions, centered upon irrigation control and expansion of large-scale water
infrastructure (Molle et al., 2009; Wester, 2009).

Water resource systems
Important water resource system data requirements for WUA management include
hydrological data on flows in and out of irrigation systems, water storage requirements,
and irrigation infrastructure (Table 2.1). However, particularly in the case of Sub-Saharan
Africa, there is little hydrological data collection or monitoring within small-scale irrigation
schemes. Government irrigation departments in Sub-Saharan Africa often lack human
resource capacity and funds to establish data monitoring, which severely limits benchmark
assessment and performance evaluation (Aarnoudse et al., 2018). Greater levels of
hydrological data monitoring and evaluation within large and medium-scale irrigation
schemes exist in North America, South and South-East Asia, as well as North Africa.
Effective hydrological monitoring and evaluation could potentially provide data to identify
constraints and opportunities for enhancing WUA performance (Aarnoudse et al., 2018).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Even less is known about groundwater. Groundwater monitoring is practically non-existent
in both Africa and Asia, where diffuse groundwater withdrawals are common. Groundwater
plays a critical role in conjunctive use with surface water to serve irrigation needs during
times of limited surface water availability, such as in times of drought (United Nations, 2022).

Finance
Financial shortfalls to pay for O&M by means of user fees is a commonly cited challenge
facing WUA performance and cooperation in Africa and Asia (Aarnoudse et al., 2018;
Mukherji et al., 2009). Heterogeneous WUAs are likely to contribute to farmers’ disincentives
to pay fees, and possibly to the inappropriate use of funds by WUA leadership (Mosse, 2006).
The lack of systematic documentation of WUA financial management makes it difficult to
estimate the level of fee payment. According to the Independent Evaluation Group (2006),
few project evaluation reports provide a clear indication of performance on O&M cost
recovery through user fees. Furthermore, donors and public agencies often expect fees to
be collected to cover O&M costs and ensure WUA financial independence, but they rarely
provide guidance for fee collection. Governments and donor agencies typically expect WUAs
to strengthen both user participation and cost recovery aspects of irrigation management.
In practice, user participation and cooperation are often equated with assigning O&M tasks
to WUAs, while cost recovery concentrates on the collection of water user fees by WUAs
(Aarnoudse et al., 2018).

2.2.2 Improving performance
In the past, some WUAs have been challenged in terms of cost recovery for O&M, user
participation and cooperation, and hence overall irrigation performance.7 The review of case
studies and past experiences have shown that socio-economic, political and agricultural
conditions are important to shape the ability of WUAs to achieve the expected results
and levels of cooperation that would improve irrigation performance. And such enabling
conditions cannot be easily created by external institutions and actors.
The actors and partnerships highlighted in this chapter – farmer user groups and government
irrigation agencies – illustrate the complex site-specific nature of partnerships for WUA
performance. Alignment of the many policies, legislation and fiscal measures that influence
water management, service delivery and level of demand, calls for institutional and legal
frameworks that can underpin well-defined water rights, provide appropriate incentives
for water use, and increase coherence in measures for supply enhancement and demand
management (FAO, 2017). The dynamics of these partnerships are influenced by a range of
socio-economic, political and agrarian factors as listed in Table 2.1.
A number of alternative management options exists to improve partnerships and
cooperation, and hence performance. These include public–private partnerships (PPPs),
participatory design, water user platforms, multi-stakeholder and innovation platforms,
joint management, multifunctional WUAs, and combined surface water–groundwater
WUAs (Aarnoudse et al., 2018; Ghazouani et al., 2012; Mukherji et al., 2009). The
appropriate management modality to site-specific WUAs should aim to improve capacity of
governments and user groups, increase funding through appropriate user fee collection, and
fundamentally, establish hydrological data monitoring and evaluation upon which benchmark
assessments can be conducted (Garces-Restrepo et al., 2007).

7

Some commentators consider the conceptual weakness of WUAs to be at the root of the problem, with invalid
assumptions underpinning the expected functions of WUAs (Mukherji et al., 2009), whereas others consider poor
implementation or lack of enabling conditions to be the main challenge (Hodgson, 2007; Vermillion, 1997; MeinzenDick, 1997). Meinzen-Dick (2007) proposes to define the most appropriate mix of state control, user management
and market mechanisms for irrigation systems based on context-specific conditions.

Water allocation
for agriculture and
urban centres

Competition for freshwater between cities and agriculture is projected to grow due to rapid
urbanization, for which urban water demand is projected to increase by 80% by 2050 (Flörke
et al., 2018). Water allocation8 from agriculture to urban centres has become a common
strategy to meet freshwater needs in growing cities (Garrick et al., 2019; Marston and Cai,
2016; Meinzen-Dick and Ringer, 2008; Molle and Berkoff, 2006). Roughly one-third of the
world’s cities that are dependent on surface water are facing competition with agriculture,
which uses approximately 72% of the global freshwater withdrawals (Garrick et al., 2019).
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has studied the
economics of water transfers from urban reclaimed water to agriculture. The FAO State
of Land and Water Resources for Food and Agriculture (SOLAW) 2021 indicates that rapid
growth in urban areas has displaced all types of agricultural land use, while other land use
increased by 220 million ha since 2000 (King et al., 2022).

Water allocation is documented at a number of spatial scales and forms. These include
schemes related to land use changes or inter-basin transfers, as well as those within river
basins or sub-basins, where agriculture is located either upstream or downstream of urban
centres (Figure 2.1).
The use of reclaimed water in agriculture is an increasingly viable option in regions
experiencing water scarcity, growing urban populations and growing demand for irrigation
water. FAO has developed an economic framework for the assessment of the use of
reclaimed water from urban to irrigated agriculture as part of a comprehensive planning
process in water resource allocation strategies, presenting a more economically efficient and
sustainable water utilization (FAO, 2010; Heinz et al., 2011).

2.3.1 Experiences
Different ways of water allocation have produced a range of outcomes for agriculture
and urban centres, including win–win, win–lose and lose–lose outcomes.9 Results and
implications of reallocation evolve over the course of time, with negative impacts on
agriculture and urban centres occurring particularly early in the transition process of
reallocation (Garrick et al., 2019). Yet comprehensive data on the impacts of reallocation,
both positive and negative, are sparse, and evidence about the performance of water
reallocation is relatively limited10 (Garrick et al., 2019; Marston and Cai, 2016; Hooper, 2015;
Molle and Berkoff, 2006).
However, based on the case studies that have been conducted, it is possible to draw a few
general conclusions. From an urban perspective, the reallocation of water from agriculture
has been largely/relatively successful in terms of meeting demands of growing cities as well
as improving irrigation efficiency (Molle and Berkoff, 2006).

8

Water allocation is the decision-making process to determine the volume or proportion of water available for sectors
or individuals. These decisions are based on principles for allocation (Dinar et al., 1997). Water reallocation refers to a
change in historical patterns of water use when “the existing allocation is physically impossible, economically inefficient
or socially unacceptable” (Marston and Cai, 2016, p. 658). “It is distinct from ‘allocation’ in the sense that reallocation
applies to contexts where water is fully committed. Reallocation is a politically more difficult proposition than initial
allocation. Nevertheless, the terms reallocation and allocation are often used interchangeably” (Hooper, 2015, p. 23).

9

“Reallocation of water out of agriculture follows several modes (gradual or outright, minor or major, surreptitious or
open, short-term or permanent, with or without compensation) depending on the hydrological characteristics of the
source, the definition of rights/allocation, and the power of the cities/state to reorder this allocation. These different
modes shape the impact and the response of society to these reallocations” (Molle and Berkoff, 2006, p. 34).

10

A recently published review of 97 studies (academic and policy-based) found that owing to data limitations, explicit
information on the impacts is available for a third of rural–urban reallocation cases, which constraints efforts to
assess the performance. None of the case studies include detailed longitudinal data regarding changing water
availability and associated changes in the magnitude and distribution (Garrick et al., 2019).

From an agricultural/rural perspective, numerous negative consequences have been observed
as less water is available for irrigation, leading to reduced food security and lower farmer
livelihood incomes (Meinzen-Dick and Ringer, 2008). However, ancillary benefits to rural areas
and irrigated agriculture have been documented in the form of flood control and improved
irrigation efficiency. Furthermore, compensation and benefit-sharing arrangements attempt
(with varying success) to offset the negative impacts of water reallocation on the agricultural
sector. Compensation can take many forms including financial payments, new infrastructure
and, in cases, alternative water supplies (Garrick et al., 2019; Marston and Cai, 2016).
Agricultural water users and irrigators have been seen to adapt to reduced water availability
by developing a number of strategies, including demand management. These include farmers
and managers increasing irrigation efficiency and productivity at the farm and/or scheme
level, or by changing crop patterns. An increased reliance on groundwater as an alternative
water source is apparent and widespread, which in cases has led to overwithdrawal, with
farmers being driven out of business when groundwater levels sharply declined. Another
strategy employed has been the diversion of more water from the same or alternative

surface sources, often with negative implications on the environment. The use of reclaimed
wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban areas is also a common response in areas facing water
scarcity. For this reason, FAO, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) have developed guidelines on the safe use of wastewater
and greywater for agriculture (WHO, 2006; WWAP, 2017).

2.3.2 Mechanisms of allocation
Mechanisms of water allocation for agriculture and urban settlements are detailed in Table 2.2.
These mechanisms shape the nature of interaction and cooperation between agricultural water
users and urban centres. Three types are identified: administrative allocation, market
allocation, and collective negotiations (Meinzen-Dick and Ringer, 2008; Dinar et al., 1997).

Administrative allocation involves the transferring of water by the national, state, or basin
entity from one user to another, in this case agriculture to urban, usually under the premise
that it is for the benefit of society/water users as a whole (Marston and Cai, 2016). Access
to safe water and sanitation for all are fundamental human rights. In 2010, the General
Assembly of the United Nations adopted the landmark resolution 64/292, which explicitly
recognized these rights (UNGA, 2010). Since then, a number of subsequent resolutions
adopted by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly gave further affirmation and
clarified the human rights to water and sanitation.
Collective action and negotiations through multi-stakeholder participation can lead to
innovative solutions for water reallocation to agriculture, fisheries and urban water users,
which can in cases provide mutually agreeable arrangements and benefits (Box 2.1). Reduced
water availability owing to the transfer of water to cities has resulted in agricultural demand
management practices, including increased irrigation efficiency and productivity. Negative
environmental and water use consequences can also occur, as agricultural water users turn
to alternative water supplies, including groundwater (Molle and Berkoff, 2006). Informal
collective negotiations are witnessed widely around the world, most prevalent in Asian
countries, and particularly in South-East Asian countries, where water scarcity exists but no
formal water markets are in place (Marston and Cai, 2016).
Drawing on insights from case studies, it has been found that collective consultation and
administrative decisions (when reasonably effective institutional arrangements exist) are the
most prevalent form of interaction and cooperation between agriculture and urban centres
(Garrick et al., 2019).

Box 2.1 Water reclamation and inter-sectoral water transfer between agriculture and cities: A FAO
economic wastewater study
“By means of an illustrative example at Lobregat River basin in Spain, it could be proved that reclaimed
water reuse and inter-sectoral water transfer can result in economic and environmental benefits at the
watershed level. The agricultural community faces cost savings in water pumping and fertilizing, increases
in yields and incomes; the municipality benefits from additional water resources released by farmers.
Farmers should be encouraged to participate by implementing adequate economic incentives” (Heinz
et al., 2011, p. 1067).
Agriculture benefits from cooperation with the urban sector include:
• Water all year round;
• Nutrients and organic matter;
• Higher yields;
• Location closer to cities;
• More crops/year; and
• Higher incomes.
Cities’ benefits from cooperation with the agricultural sector include:
• Increased food security;
• Additional wastewater treatment; and
• Water exchange with agriculture.
The environmental benefits from urban–agriculture cooperation include:
• Lower pollution; and
• Freshwater conservation.

2.3.3 Methods to improve agriculture–urban water allocation
A number of approaches are highlighted to improve the effectiveness of agriculture–urban
water allocation and enhance the level of cooperation and partnerships between the
two sectors. These are classified by the ‘accelerators’ of the SDG 6 Global Acceleration
Framework: governance, data and information, capacity-building, innovation and finance
(Table 2.3).
Accelerating action in addressing water scarcity for agriculture, FAO has fostered the
sharing of knowledge and experiences from the private sector, research/academia, water
associations, governments, and development banks on the fit-for-purpose use of reclaimed
wastewater, desalinated water and rainwater, as well as technologies such as fog and
cloud harvesting to augment water for agriculture. Discussions on new mechanisms of
collaboration between the public–private sectors and innovative blended financing presented
opportunities in scaling up non-conventional water use (FAO, n.d.a).
Water and resource recovery from urban centres represent the greatest opportunity for positive
change, but it requires changes in the areas of urban water management and peri-urban
irrigated agriculture production. Transitions are needed in implementing the circular economy,
enhancing public engagement, integrating utilities, broadening practitioners’ skill sets and
creating new jobs. To accelerate the needed transitions in the water and agri-food sector, both
public and multi-sectoral stakeholders are needed to be actively engaged.

2.4
Water–energy–
food–ecosystem
nexus

Over the past decade, the WEFE nexus has risen to prominence as a systematic
approach to understanding WEFE interconnectedness and trade-offs. Effective
cross-sectoral consultation mechanisms, such as the WEFE framework, are needed
at local, national, and global scales to ensure the development of concerted efforts.
Understanding and harnessing the potential of the WEFE nexus is key to reconciling
often-competing sectoral objectives and attaining sustainable development. WEFE
has indeed emerged as a powerful concept to describe and address the complex and
interrelated nature of global resource systems needed for humankind to achieve social,
economic and environmental goals (Koo-Oshima and Gillet, 2022). The WEFE approach
integrates across all sectors and its holistic vision of sustainability aims to attain a
balance between the different goals, interests and needs of people and the environment.
Successful partnerships can be built on existing institutions (e.g. river basin
organizations, WEFE resource user associations) and their knowledge, capacity,
competencies and social capital. It can be challenging to further develop existing
structures to fully cover the necessary breadth of the WEFE nexus. Therefore,
partnership development must recognize and address thematic and institutional
gaps, barriers for change, the wider political economy, social and political contexts,
ownership, power relations between actors, and funding, among others. Facilitating an
engaging partnership platform for constructive dialogue and participatory design and
decision-making can help overcome obstacles to successful partnerships.
As a transformative approach, the WEFE nexus is about restructuring the network of
decision-making and partnerships to focus on inclusion and equity among partners.
A lack of inclusivity and equity in partnerships can hinder the approach’s viability, as
the WEFE nexus approach would lack new insights for innovation.
FAO has developed its own conceptual approach to the water–energy–food nexus
(Figure 2.2; FAO, 2014). The approach distinguishes between the resource base and the
different goals and interests that are to be achieved with the same limited resources. It
is about understanding and managing these different resource user goals and interests,
while maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. Effective partnerships is key in nexusbased decision-making, with structured stakeholder dialogues in managing the nexus
through evidence, scenario development and response options (see Box 2.2).

2.5
Collection and
dissemination of
water data and
information

Around the world, countries are grappling to adapt their agriculture and food systems to
conditions of water scarcity, climate change and increased competition between users.
Better water data and information are indispensable for sustainable and equitable water
management. Through close collaboration and engagement with different partners in
water quantity and quality data and related information, with additional variables on
biomass, crop evapotranspiration, weather and socio-economic data, countries and
subnational organizations and stakeholders would be better facilitated in making more
effective water management decisions at various levels. It is important to provide tools
that improve the coordination, accessibility and usability of water data, particularly
made accessible to smallholders as they are the most vulnerable to changes in water
access and availability. A strengthened focus on water governance and the related
data and supporting informatics for agriculture and food security is therefore crucial to
address water management challenges in a changing climate.
AQUASTAT is the FAO’s global information system on water resources and agricultural
water management. AQUASTAT monitors and reports SDG Indicators 6.4.1 (change
in water efficiency over time) and 6.4.2 (water stress level), for which FAO is the

responsible UN-Water agency. Country ownership of data is one of the core principles of
AQUASTAT, in line with the 2030 Agenda. This requires strong partnerships and continuous
dialogue with countries during data collection, analysis and dissemination. To pursue
this goal, FAO has established a network of national correspondents at country level
responsible for coordinating the collection of water data within their country. In addition
to AQUASTAT, FAO has developed a publicly accessible near-real-time WaPOR data portal
using satellite data, which allows for the monitoring of agricultural water productivity
at different scales. This data portal works with over ten partner countries to build their
capacity in the use of WaPOR data for its different applications, and to generate solutions
to local challenges linked to water and land productivity as well as water management
(FAO, n.d.b).
Whether a farmer or water manager is evaluating the biophysical or societal side of water
resource management or water services delivery, water accounting, governance, tenure
and the management processes require accurate information and data. Strengthening
the capacities of national institutions, water experts and farmers will require additional
support for the generation and dissemination of data and information (Box 2.3).
In short, understanding and monitoring the hydrological cycle at the appropriate scale
of analysis is necessary to improve water-related decision-making at local, regional
and national levels. A better understanding of the hydrological cycle can be obtained

Box 2.2 WEFE nexus in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon
A FAO-American University in Beirut study implemented scenario development tools in highlighting the trade-offs associated
with different decisions for different food, water, energy and health alternatives and recommended a number of areas to be
explored in alternative water resources, land reclamation options and ways to improve higher-yielding nutritious crops. Most
importantly, it recommended multi-sectoral stakeholder engagement and cross-government collaborations as requirements in
finding optimal solutions to achieve multiple goals (FAO, 2021).
The study concluded that:
• Increasing food security with local production comes at additional requirements in terms of water, energy and land;
• Alternative water resources should be investigated. For example, desalination is expensive whereas wastewater reuse is
cheaper and has the additional benefit of solving the problem of wastewater disposal in water bodies;
• Land reclamation, utilization of marginal land, and agroforestry options should be explored;
• Crop yield potential improvements and breeding technologies are needed; and
• Most importantly, stakeholder engagement is key, especially regarding government policy-makers across sectors.

through water accounting. However, such an understanding will not automatically lead
to improvements in water governance. Water auditing, which can be defined as “placing
trends in water supply, demand, accessibility and use in the broader context of governance,
institutions, public and private expenditure, legislation and the wider political economy of water
of [sic] specified domains” (Batchelor et al., 2016, p. 9), can help to support improved water
policy development. Water accounting and auditing are recommended by FAO and others as
being fundamental to initiatives that aim to cope with water scarcity.

Box 2.3 Cooperation through water tenure in achieving inclusive water policy and development objectives
FAO has produced a seminal report on water tenure* and has held water tenure consultations with water experts
and country representatives that included the conceptualization of tenure (FAO, 2020). The latter refers to the
relationship of customary and statutory water rights and the role of hybrid legal systems for more inclusive
water tenure regimes in improving water governance at the national level. This diverse work and the various
conceptualizations of water tenure form an important basis for developing international consensus on the
core elements, definition and added value of water tenure in order to achieve a diverse array of policy and
development goals. The FAO Knowing Water Better project** piloted water resources assessment and different
aspects of water tenure in three countries. In Rwanda, several scenarios of water allocation explored the context
of increasing competition among water users, using the water tenure approach. In Sri Lanka, the assessment
dug into issues such as environmental protection and economic growth and analysed the different strategies
to manage water in a more sustainable manner. In Senegal, the project sought to better understand the
interlinkages between water and land. All of these projects successfully implemented water tenure consultations
and multi-stakeholder engagement across sectors and government line agencies supported by water accounting
principles (Batchelor et al., 2016) and water tenure approaches.
Example of participatory approach in water tenure:
• Coordination with village and municipal authorities;
• Establishment of pilot committees on water tenure;
• Community meetings and focus group discussion to define rules and regulations;
• Continuous focus on awareness-raising;
• Capacities of local authorities and members of pilot committees;
• Accompany the follow-up to established conventions; and
• Establishment of water resource user groups/associations.

Water tenure is the “relationship, whether legally or customarily defined, between people, as individuals or groups, with respect to water
resources.” (FAO, 2020, p. 3).

Introduction

Ecosystems play a central role in regulating water availability and its quality. Hence, Target 6.6
(“By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands,
rivers, aquifers and lakes”) was included under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, as both
a descriptor of sustainability and enabler of all the other SDG 6 targets. Different sectors of
human activity can change the environment, positively or negatively, through water and land
use. Partnerships, therefore, have always been at the heart of meeting environment-related
challenges for water. In this regard, inter-sectoral and extra-sectoral partnerships for water and
the environment (see Chapter 1) tend to be the norm, with intra-sectoral partnerships being
relatively less common.
The three planetary crises of climate change, nature (or biodiversity) loss and pollution are
at the centre of the United Nations (UN) systems strategy on the environment (e.g. UNEA,
2021) and articulate the main environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. Water is a key dimension of each of the three crises and forges the strongest
interdependencies among them.

The continuing
rate of loss and
degradation
of freshwater
ecosystems
and the loss
of freshwater
biodiversity
remain the
highest among all
ecosystem types

Water was included in 75% of countries’ climate change National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)
(Walton, 2015). Recognition of the role of ecosystems in climate change mitigation and
adaptation in the Paris Agreement (United Nations, 2015) allows countries to focus on
ecosystem-based mitigation and adaptation strategies in their NAPs and in the intended
nationally determined contributions (INDCs) that will determine investment priorities as far as
50 years in the future. The ‘Paris Pact on Water and Climate Change Adaptation’ (UNFCCC, 2015)
is clear recognition of the importance of water and ecosystems in the climate change agenda.
The continuing rate of loss and degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the loss of
freshwater biodiversity remain the highest among all ecosystem types (Prologue Part 1;
UNEP, 2021a). Key drivers include land and water use, and climate change (IPBES, 2019).
The proactive use of the nature–water relationship to meet water resources management
challenges is the realm of nature-based solutions (NBS), covered in detail in WWAP/UN-Water
(2018). The fact that NBS concepts are making their way into high-level policy and decisionmaking (Bennet and Ruef, 2016) and the rapidly increasing deployment of NBS and attention
in the literature (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018) are among the few positive developments in an
otherwise usually gloomy outlook for water. Although some commentators remark that the
‘fourth industrial revolution’ is driven by information technology, UNIDO (2019) argues that it is
being driven by nature-like and convergent technologies in which partnerships based on NBS
play a central role.
Water pollution is a large part of the third crisis (in addition to air and land pollution).
Climate change exacerbates water pollution (Seneviratne et al., 2012), as does the loss of
nature. The restoration of nature is therefore a leading approach to reducing water pollution
(WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). These interdependencies result in water and environment
interventions delivering co-benefits across multiple development goals. The water–
environment relationship includes a potentially far greater diversity of stakeholders and
potential partners than any other water domain.
Partnerships on environment and water, as other areas and interests, operate at multiple levels.
These include at the level of policy, between institutions and sectors, and at both national and
international levels. The most important are partnerships among or with those stakeholders
on the ground, as they can directly implement land and water resources interventions that
lead to tangible progress. These are usually individuals and communities that are owners,
leaseholders or stewards of land or water or whose activities directly impact these, including their
representative bodies. Many are outside the ‘water sector’, according to its narrow definition.
Because of the cross-cutting nature of the three planetary crises, and the ubiquitous
nature of partnerships, a comprehensive assessment of these partnerships’ contribution to
accelerating change is a complex and challenging task. This chapter focuses on only three
areas, among potentially many more: partnerships for watershed services as one of the

most widespread applications of NBS, where partners can be clearly visible on the ground;
institutional partnerships for policy change, consensus-building and awareness-raising that
may often seem remote but can play an important role in enabling action on the ground;
and partnerships on data and knowledge on water and the environment that attempt to
rectify gaps in information that hinder the adaptive management essential to achieving
transformational change to accelerate progress.
Finally, the chapter attempts to draw some lessons learned from these experiences that can
help identify the way forward on accelerating change through partnerships and cooperation,
covered in further detail in Chapter 14.

3.2
Watershed
services schemes

Watershed services schemes are designed to optimize ecosystem services delivery, often
through payments for ecosystem services to incentivize upstream land or water users
to maintain or improve the flow of ecosystem services to downstream beneficiaries.
Watershed protection or rehabilitation measures are among the oldest of water-related
partnerships, with a history that may span millennia. Case studies have been included
in previous World Water Development Reports, across multiple themes, and in detail in
WWAP/UN-Water (2018). These measures are mostly founded on voluntary partnerships,
usually with incentives, and with or without associated supporting regulations.
Green infrastructure payments have protected, rehabilitated, or created new habitats on
more than 486 million hectares of land around the world, an area nearly 1.5 times the size of
India, with a total investment of US$25 billion in 2015, mostly going to landowners and local
communities and mostly driven by water resources-related objectives (Bennett and Ruef,
2016). However, this is still a meagre 0.37 to 1.1% of the estimated amount of investment
required in water infrastructure in the same year (WWC/OECD, 2015). A common means of
financing these schemes is through water funds (Box 3.1; see also Box 8.2 and Chapter 12).
Many watershed services schemes address climate change adaptation by building resilience.
In recent decades, there has been increasing attention to climate change mitigation
measures in watershed services schemes (Box 3.2).

Different partners are likely to have different motivations (Table 3.1). Interestingly, for public
sector/government partners, environmental co-benefits rank highest, with mitigating risks
ranked second, and meeting compliance/regulations and improving local governance ranked
lower. Brand value, maintaining business models and supply chain resilience feature high in
private sector partner motives. Both public and private water utility partners are interested
mainly in reducing infrastructure risks, ensuring compliance and reducing costs. For nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and donor partners, risks reduction and environmental
co-benefits were ranked highest (Bennett and Ruef, 2016). Public subsidy programmes
also frequently sought to deliver climate adaptation benefits in rural communities, with
high numbers of programmes harnessing watershed protection subsidies to help address
challenges amplified by a changing climate, such as increased flooding, forest fires and
food insecurity. Many programmes reported monitoring and/or evaluating ‘beyond water’
benefits, with biodiversity conservation, community benefits, and jobs and training at the
top of programme administrators’ lists (Bennett and Ruef, 2016). These co-benefits on offer
through ecosystem-based approaches should not be underestimated and can provide the
strongest justification for NBS interventions (WWAP/UN-Water, 2018). Davidson et al. (2019)
estimated the annual value of natural wetlands to be US$47.4 trillion per year at 2011 values,
43.5% of the global total value of the ecosystem services of all natural biomes, despite
wetlands covering less than 3% of land area. Between 32% and 53% of the monetary value
of inland wetlands comes from co-benefits such as food, erosion regulation, tourism, and
recreation. This diversity and scale of the benefits forge strong interests among stakeholders
and potential partners beyond the water sector.

Box 3.1 Water funds mobilize multiple partnerships to address water security needs
Water funds support partnerships that bring together downstream users, like cities, businesses and
utilities, to collectively invest in upstream habitat protection and land management to improve water
quality and/or quantity and generate long-term benefits for people by addressing climate, nature and
pollution. They help to make sense of and manage the complexities associated with water risk and
nature-based source water protection (Calvache et al., 2012).

As an example, The Monterrey Water Fund could be cited: an extra-sectoral partnership to protect source
water (Abell et al., 2017). The City of Monterrey, Mexico, with a population of 4 million, derives more than
60% of its drinking water from upstream surface water sources, but these are degraded due to a loss of
vegetation cover, erosion, forest fires, invasive species and land use change. The region is also prone to
intense weather events producing flooding and droughts. Climate change increases the very real risk of
future floods exceeding the capacity of the dam built to protect the city. The Fondo de Agua Metropolitano
de Monterrey (FAMM) was launched in 2013 and became Mexico’s first legally established water fund
driven by the key objectives to maintain water quality, reduce flooding, improve infiltration, rehabilitate
nature, raise awareness and increase resources to support a sustainable watershed. FAMM had over
US$9 million in total investments by 2018. The fund’s work is having a significant positive impact on
runoff from flooding in the areas of highest sensitivity. Over 40 partners are involved in the FAMM,
ranging from federal and local government administrators, scientists, businesses, non-governmental
organizations and civil society, through to the farmers, pastoralists and foresters who actually implement
the rehabilitation measures (Latin America Water Funds Partnership, n.d.).

Box 3.2 Partnerships for conserving and restoring peatlands for carbon storage, hydrological flows and livelihoods
Peatlands are wetlands that depend on and regulate hydrology. Globally, peatlands store twice as much carbon as all
forests, yet they account for less than 3% of the land area. About 5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions come
from degraded peatlands (Crump, 2017). Draining for conversion to agriculture or forestry and livestock grazing are the
main drivers of degradation. Attention to peatlands has increased in the last decade due to the recognition of their role
in climate change mitigation in the Paris Agreement. Peatlands are able to deliver co-benefits by regulating droughts and
floods, preserving biodiversity, supplying food and water, maintaining ecological systems, and improving human livelihoods
(UNEA, 2019; Arias et al., 2021). Peatlands contribute to the implementation of multilateral environmental agreements,
such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the Convention on Wetlands and the United Nations Convention to
Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
A case study is the restoration of the Ruoergai peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau (Wetlands International, n.d.). These are the
largest high-altitude peatlands in the world (490,000 ha), storing 1.9 billion tonnes of carbon. In the past, these percolation
peatlands have been drained for crops and fuel and severely damaged by overgrazing. This resulted in land degradation
and the encroachment of desert-like conditions due to soil loss. Apart from the significant carbon emissions, it affected the
water flows and sediment loads that entered the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, China’s two longest rivers. An initial partnership
between Wetlands International and the national and local governments and scientific institutions helped to understand
the extent and state of the huge peatlands and restoration needs. A critical goal at the implementation stage was to build a
good partnership with the nomadic herders who depended on the land for their livelihoods. The trials resulted in sustainable
management plans focused on restoration of hydrology and improved grazing management. From 2010 onwards, the
government provided financial assistance to sustainably manage and protect the peatlands, largely through direct funding
to the herders and local communities to maintain the ecosystem. This led to a rise in eco-tourism and the Ruoergai became
a National Nature Reserve and Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention, boosting the local
economy (Wetlands International, n.d.). The restoration approach used in Ruoergai resulted in increased water levels in
the canals, up to 26 cm higher than recorded before. Levels in shallow water canals also increased up to 50 cm, which led
to an overflow of water and rewetting of the adjacent peatlands, improved water flows and water quality downstream, and
restoration of carbon sinks (Zhang et al., 2012).

3.3
Institutional
partnerships for
policy change and
consensus-building

A plethora of partnerships operate at the institutional level to support better environmental
outcomes or improved proactive use of ecosystem services with regards to water. Many focus
specifically on water while others integrate environment, ecosystems and water into broader
agendas. Only a few can be highlighted here.
Over the last few years, ecosystem services have received increasing attention across many
forums. This is illustrated by the emergence of the Ecosystem Services Partnership (ESP)
in 2008 (Box 3.3). In the ESP, several networks and initiatives work together, including the
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the
International Association for Landscape Ecology (IALE), the Natural Capital Coalition and the
Society for Ecological Restoration (SER). Each of these is also an important partnership relevant to
this chapter.
The Global Peatlands Initiative (GPI) is an example of a partnership focused on a priority
ecosystem type with regards to the three planetary crises, primarily climate change, but also with
an important role in addressing the loss of biodiversity and improving water quality (Box 3.4).
Wastewater, including agricultural runoff, is the leading cause of water pollution. It is intricately
linked to human and ecosystem health, with over 80% of global wastewater estimated to enter
water bodies untreated (WWAP, 2017). Hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP), the Global Wastewater Initiative (GW²I) is a multi-stakeholder partnership-based response
to improve wastewater management established under the framework of the Global Programme
of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities (GPA). It partners

closely with the Global Partnership on Marine Litter and the Global Partnership on Nutrient
Management, also under the GPA. The initiative supports countries through informationsharing, development and adoption of sound policies and guidelines, technical support, and
demonstration projects. As such, it acts as a bridge between stakeholders, including the private
sector, to leverage additional resources, provide solutions and opportunities for wastewater
recovery and reuse, and to help raise awareness and build the necessary capacities. Over
time, the initiative has been instrumental in implementing numerous successful projects and
activities on wastewater management and sanitation provision. The initiative contributes to
SDG 6, implementation of numerous resolutions of the United Nations Environment Assembly,
and to UNEP’s Implementation Plan: Towards a Pollution-Free Planet.

Box 3.3 The Ecosystem Services
Partnership
The Ecosystem Services Partnership
(ESP) connects over 3,000 ecosystem
services scientists, policy-makers
and practitioners who work together
in more than 40 Working Groups
and a growing number of National
Networks on all continents. The
ESP regularly organizes world
and regional conferences and
provides many services to further
enhance the flow of ecosystem
services stemming from nature
conservation, ecosystem restoration
and sustainable management. The
partnership is organized around
20 thematic working groups,
10 biome working groups, and
10 sectoral working groups. It
covers all ecosystem services but
water-related services (e.g. regulation
of water availability and quality,
water-related disaster regulation,
etc.) are the most prominent. This
enables the partnership to operate
across sectors (e.g. agriculture,
forestry, business and the circular
economy) and across biomes (e.g.
freshwater systems, forest and
woodlands, urban systems, drylands
and deserts, etc.). The ESP currently
has about 50 sponsors, and this
number continues to grow. Sponsors
include national governments, aid
agencies, intergovernmental and
non-governmental organizations and
initiatives, and the private sector.

Environment-related data form one of the most significant gaps in
water-related knowledge. Partnerships have always been central to
improving this knowledge and many ongoing and recent initiatives are
playing a role. The following are only a few illustrations.
The connection between the environment, the three planetary crises (climate
change, nature loss, pollution), water, policy and sustainable development is
through ecosystem services, or nature’s contributions to people.11 Despite
this, generating, assessing and monitoring water-related ecosystem services
data remain among the weakest areas, particularly for cultural, regulating and
supporting services (that is, most services excepting goods). Consequently,
there has been a rapid increase in attention to the topic (Aznar-Sánchez et al.,
2019). A promising recent development to fill these gaps is the Ecosystem
Service Value Database (Box 3.6).
The World Water Quality Alliance (UNEP, n.d.) is a multi-disciplinary
partnership, established in 2019, among dozens of contributing organizations
worldwide providing a participatory platform for water quality monitoring
and assessments and co-design of tailored and demand-driven services
and solutions through a multitier, multidisciplinary and networking approach
(Figure 3.1). Examples of progress areas include: a baseline water quality
assessment (in progress); Africa case studies (Volta Basin, Lake Victoria
and Cape Town aquifer system) providing information on achievements
and challenges to inform upscaling of approaches; guidelines for the
harmonization of methodologies for monitoring plastics in rivers and lakes;
capacity-building activities; improvements in spatially explicit data availability
and access on nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and toxic stress; and
efforts towards a pan-African water quality programme. A snapshot of some
of the data provided or made available under the partnership is included in
UNEP (2021b). However, the scale of the challenge is illustrated in the latest
national SDG 6 indicator data on water quality (UNEP, 2021b), which shows
the absence of reported data for the whole of South Asia (including India),
China, South-East Asia and large parts of Africa and the Middle East, among
other areas, possibly representing the bulk of the world population.
Truly integrated water resources management (IWRM) involves all the sectors
and dimensions of water resources management. While the environment
has been a driver of its development and application, it has also been one
of the main casualties of its absence. The SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme
is an example of a multi-level partnership under the guidance of UNEP
and coordinated by the Global Water Partnership (GWP) in collaboration
with UNEP-DHI and the International Capacity Development Network for
Sustainable Water Management (UNDP Cap-Net). The goal is to support
country and regional responses to SDG Target 6.5 (on IWRM) as an entry
point to accelerate implementation of SDG 6 and other water-related goals.
While the Support Programme is, in itself, a partnership, it in turn fosters
other partnerships across SDG targets at the global and regional levels,
and with regional commissions, banks and support agencies, through the
production of regional analyses based on the SDG Indicator 6.5.1 reporting
exercise, including the identification of actions required. Although still in its
infancy, the partnership has already delivered results from the first round of
monitoring (UNEP, 2021c).

Box 3.4 The Global Peatlands Initiative
The Global Peatlands Initiative (GPI) was launched at the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Marrakech, Morocco in 2016. The partnership’s goal is to protect and conserve
peatlands as the world’s largest terrestrial organic carbon stock, and to prevent the carbon stocked in them from being
emitted into the atmosphere. The initiative has now 49 partners committed to working together to improve the conservation,
restoration and sustainable management of peatlands. By bringing together the best available science, the GPI informs
policies, decisions and actions to protect peatlands all around the world, with four peat-rich tropical countries (the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Peru and the Republic of the Congo) serving as pilots.
South–South and triangular cooperation are the primary delivery mechanisms of the GPI. This approach has facilitated
the identification, collection and sharing of good practices, enabled exchanges, improved methodologies, and promoted
more sustainable approaches to peatland management. The GPI has communicated and disseminated results widely to
upscale peatlands transformation and inspire evidence-based action based on their contribution to climate, people and
the planet, in line with global climate and biodiversity targets. It has been instrumental in raising awareness of peatlands
and mobilizing funding in the context of climate change, biodiversity and water resources management at national and
international national levels.

SDG Indicator 6.6.1 uses changes in water-related ecosystem extent (area) as a proxy
for ecosystem service delivery (see Section ‘SDG Target 6.6: Water-related ecosystems’
in the Prologue Part 2). UNEP and the Ramsar Convention secretariat are custodians of
the indicator. The Ramsar Convention secretariat, with its extensive list of international
and national partners, lead on providing data on wetlands, including mangroves, in
partnership with the Global Mangrove Watch, itself a consortium of partners. The scope
of the indicator effort has now expanded to include monitoring water quality and IWRM

and the United Nations Statistics Division, together
with partners that convey results and messages to
Member States collectively, including the High-Level
Political Forum on Sustainable Development and
the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable
Development (Figure 3.2).
The Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer (UNEP,
2021d) is an open-access data platform developed
by UNEP in partnership with the European
Commission’s Joint Research Centre, Google, the
UNEP-DHI Centre on Water and Environment, Global
Mangrove Watch and the EU Copernicus Earth
Observation Programme. The data portal aims
to provide accurate, up-to-date, high-resolution
geospatial data depicting the extent of freshwater
ecosystems change over time in order to support
decision-making and track progress towards the
achievement of SDG Target 6.6. Again, although
still in their infancy, these partnerships have already
made progress in data and information availability,
which is summarized in UNEP (2021d).

Partnerships involving local communities (‘citizen science’; see Section 11.3) are increasingly
used to improve monitoring of the environment. This is particularly so for water quality
monitoring, in order to address the huge gaps in data availability. Concentrations of
nitrate and phosphate and total suspended solids measured by citizen scientists at Lake
Tanganyika matched those established by professional scientists, showing considerable
potential to upscale to other African Great Lakes (Moshi et al., 2022). Engaging youth and
women in data-scarce least developed countries is gaining attention, engendering personal
empowerment and ownership, particularly for hydrological data (Rigler et al., 2022). At least
19 water-related citizen science projects emerged in China since 2005, most of which
are dedicated to improving water quality, with a few focusing on biodiversity monitoring
(Wu et al., 2022). Multiple stakeholders, including NGOs,academic institutions, governments
and companies participate in these activities.
‘Debris Tracker’12 is an example of open-access citizen science that operates globally to track
the status of plastic debris from upstream catchments down through to oceans.

3.5
Lessons learned

Better and impartial critical assessments of project and partnership performance are
required. Although there is a plethora of case studies on partnerships on water and
environment, far too few include critical assessments of quantified costs, outcomes and
challenges. In particular, a reliance on discretional donor financing leads many institutions
to showcase the positive and avoid any negative messaging of their projects. Improved and
more systematic attention to impartial evaluations of performance, and open access to them,
would improve our ability to tease out ways and means by which partnerships for water and
the environment can be scaled up to accelerate progress towards SDG 6.

Barriers to further uptake of partnerships need to be better understood. A useful example
of improved approaches is the assessment of barriers to further uptake of partnerships
through watershed services schemes by Bennett and Ruef (2016). This study ranked ongoing
challenges with relationships with stakeholders or local partners second-highest after
future regulatory uncertainty (Figure 3.3), confirming that partnerships are not a panacea.
Unfortunately, inadequate information was provided on the nature of the challenges and
means to overcome them. Interestingly, scientific and technical challenges were not ranked
high, and conflicts with basin planning and securing demand (buyers of the watershed
services) were ranked unexpectedly low. Surprisingly, lack of support from policy/decisionmakers was ranked as the least serious challenge, signalling a positive trend in recognition
of the potential of such partnerships. Further lessons here include: (1) policy support tends
to be enabling, but governments could likely accelerate uptake by addressing regulatory
constraints, (2) more attention is required to understand relationships between stakeholders
and ways to manage them better to accelerate progress, (3) social sciences are likely to
identify means to accelerate progress towards SDG 6 rather than natural sciences and
technology, and (4) at least with regards to the environment and water, it is not necessary
for partners to have the same motivations (Figure 3.3), as long as they reach agreement
regarding what needs to be done.

Box 3.6 The Ecosystem Service Value
Database
The Ecosystem Service Value Database
(ESVD) was developed under a voluntary
partnership based on open access with
the mission to gather and standardize
information on monetary values of
ecosystem services to reflect their ‘true’
value. It covers all ecosystem services,
but since all depend on water and the
water-related services are among the
most highly valued, the database is
broadly relevant to water. The ultimate
purpose is for these values to be
internalized in everyday economic
decision-making. The ESVD organizes
its value estimates and corresponding
data in 106 columns with information
on among others: bibliographic details,
study site, biome, ecosystem service,
valuation method, valuation result
in original units, standardized value
and review status. It also promotes
standardized classifications of
ecosystem services, biomes and
ecosystems. The initiative involves
partnerships with several international
governmental and non-government
organizations, research and academia,
governments, financial institutions
including private banks, business and
consultancy, and other partners in
the Ecosystem Services Partnership
(Box 3.3). The involvement of partners
from outside ‘the water (or ecosystems)
box’ is particularly pertinent to enable
uptake of the results into economic
decision-making. Although still in its
infancy, the partnership has already
created the largest publicly available
database and tool with standardized
monetary values for all ecosystem
services and all biomes on all
continents. All the information in the
ESVD comes from over 30 years of
peer-reviewed academic research and
official reports on monetary valuation of
ecosystem services.
Source: ESVD (n.d.).

Better cost–benefit analyses are required. For example, many
ecosystem restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost
analyses (Puspitaloka et al., 2021). From a partnership perspective,
the indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses
to engage local communities, were often left out of assessments and
these can add up to half of the total cost of restoration projects.
Better understanding of challenges and drawbacks of citizen science
is needed. For example, the factors that drive the success of citizen
science activities around water and environment remain unclear
(San Llorente Capdevila et al., 2020). Despite the obvious potential
of partnerships with women to accelerate progress, there can be
significant exclusion of women in citizen science on the topic of water
and environment, which can also curtail their role in governance and
leadership (Nigussie et al., 2018).
The World Water Quality Alliance (UNEP, n.d.) notes several lessons
learned, including:
• There can be issues with data/information-sharing due to
institutional or government sensitivities;
• Fragmented institutional landscapes across neighbouring countries
constrain partnerships for transboundary water bodies; and
• Stakeholder networks should be expanded to include a broader range
of sectors and include more local contacts of alliance partners.
Experiences from payments for watershed services schemes also
reveal a number of important lessons, including:
Watershed services schemes can also lead to new problems that
need to be understood. Chan et al. (2017) note that payments for
ecosystem services schemes have revealed concerns including:
(1) the creation of new externalities; (2) misplacement of rights
and responsibilities; (3) crowding out of existing motivations;
(4) efficiency–equity trade-offs; (5) monitoring costs; (6) limited
applicability; and (7) top–down prescription/alienating agencies.
To overcome such problems, the authors suggest supplementing
monetary value-based decisions with approaches that recognize rights
and responsibilities conducive to sustainability and build sustainable
relationships with nature.
Governance approaches can have a major bearing on outcomes.
For example, Lin (2014) compared the New York watershed partnership
(the Catskills programme) with a partnership that was set up in Beijing.
The former was regarded as comparatively more successful, mainly
due to its bottom–up, as opposed to top–down, evolution that creates
stronger and more effective partnerships as well as more realistic
financial incentives that better reflect true values. Importantly though,
both case studies show that positive incentives prove more pragmatic
and effective than negative ones, suggesting that voluntary incentivebased partnerships have the potential to accelerate progress more than
regulatory approaches (although the two are not mutually exclusive).

Conclusions

There would be few, if any, initiatives operating in the environment–water arena that do not
involve partnerships. This brief introduction confirms their predominantly inter-sectoral
nature. A conspicuous feature of environment–water partnerships is engagement with
partners outside the water ‘box’, or beyond the water and sanitation sector. This is illustrated,
for example, by partnerships on data where initiatives include attempts to integrate the
information into broader planning tools and forums, or involve investors from beyond the
water sector. This is an essential ingredient of progress since many of those that influence
the environment are beyond the water domain and many that benefit most from it are unable
to manage it alone.
But this report is tasked with exploring the potential to scale up partnerships to accelerate
progress towards SDG 6. The chasm between the current state of the environment regarding
water and the progress required (see Prologue Part 2) and the ubiquitous nature of
partnerships for water and the environment suggest they will continue to play a significant
role in future progress. The evident increasing attention paid to the environment–water
relationship, through, for example, NBS, gives some reason for optimism that more progress
will be made, and faster. Environment–water stakeholders must collectively be more critical
of their partnerships and generate pragmatic information on what works, what doesn’t,
and why, and how to overcome constraints, if the presumed substantial opportunities for
partnerships to accelerate progress are to be realized.

Introduction

The need for partnerships and cooperation on water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
in human settlements, regardless whether they are formal or informal, is driven by three
main factors.
First, the cross-sectoral nature of WASH creates the need for partnerships. Various actors,
including the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and communities,
along with government ministries and departments responsible for WASH, health, housing,
agriculture, education, planning and infrastructure, among others, are all handling various
aspects of the water supply and sanitation sector. Partnerships and cooperation open up space
for additional actors relevant to – but not always considered to be part of – the WASH sector.

The magnitude
of the WASH
challenges in
formal and
informal human
settlements is
such that no
one country or
institution alone
can overcome the
growing demand
for these services

4.2
Water operators’
partnerships

Second, the magnitude of the WASH challenges in formal and informal human settlements
is such that no one country or institution alone can overcome the growing demand for
these services (WHO/UNICEF, 2021). Pollution, climate change impacts and environmental
degradation of freshwater resources, combined with the huge infrastructure gap in a world
of scarce financial resources, explains the multitude of state and non-state actors involved in
water supply and sanitation service provision.
Third, there is consensus that WASH initiatives are much more likely to meet their objectives
if the intended beneficiaries participate in a meaningful way in multistakeholder partnerships
and cooperation, especially in rural areas and secondary towns (UN-Habitat, 2008). Evidence
suggests that effective stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process and in
planning and implementation leads to services that are more appropriate to the needs and
resources of poor communities, and increases public acceptance and ownership of systems
(Jones, 2003). Stakeholder engagement also ensures from the onset that accountability and
transparency are built into the programme (Evans et al., 2005).
This chapter presents an analysis of a number of examples of WASH-related partnerships
and cooperation in formal and informal settlements that address specific objectives,
including: those aimed at strengthening the capacity of operators through peer-to-peer
support; those aimed at addressing wastewater management; those aimed at ensuring that
interventions are informed by and respond to the needs of local stakeholders; those aimed
at building resilience to climate change; and those aimed at improving access to services in
refugee and migrant settlements.

Water supply and sanitation service provision in human settlements is affected by a plethora of
governance and operational challenges. In the last decades, service providers across the globe
have been turning to peer-to-peer partnerships to enhance their capacity and performance
while striving to provide affordable quality services for all. These not-for-profit partnerships
are referred to as water operators’ partnerships (WOPs). They work by connecting established,
well-functioning utilities with other utilities that need assistance or guidance. Building on
peers’ shared understanding of professional demands and challenges, partners conduct joint
diagnoses to assess challenges and design solutions. WOPs are non-commercial partnerships
that rely on trust and open exchange of information and expertise.
The United Nations Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation first
called on development actors to support these partnerships in 2006 and requested the
United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) to host the Global Water
Operators’ Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA)13 to support water operators through WOPs.
WOPs are implemented in a variety of settings that include cities and small towns in low- and
middle-income countries and fragile states. In the global WOPs database maintained by

Box 4.1 The experience of
Ghana Water Company Ltd.
in pro-poor services: From
mentee to mentor
About half of the 17 million
urban residents in Ghana live
in low-income urban
communities (LIUCs).
While Ghana Water
Company Limited (GWCL)
is responsible for potable
water supply to all urban
communities in Ghana,
only a fraction of the LIUC’s
residents have direct access
to GWCL’s piped network.
Over the last 15 years, GWCL
has been the beneficiary
of a series of WOPs,
first supported by Dutch
and South African public
companies, to improve
operational performance
and attract additional
investments. GWCL then
received mentorship and
funding from the Dutch
WaterWorX Programme and
the Dutch Water for Life
Foundation to extend service
delivery to LIUCs by providing
direct access to water
services to over 750,000
people. This process led to
the creation of a specialized
Low-Income Customer
Support Unit, making service
delivery to the underserved
poor a viable market.
The impact associated to this
success story grew further in
2021 when GWCL embarked
on a new WOP, this time as
a mentor, together with VEI
Dutch water operators, to
support the development
of pro-poor activities at the
Guma Valley Water Company
in Sierra Leone.

GWOPA, out of the 425 WOPs documented, the majority (50%) involves two utilities
from the Global South; and 38% are partnerships between a northern and a southern
utility. The remaining are triangular partnerships14 (10%) and partnerships among
utilities from the Global North (2%).
WOPs can vary in terms of duration, objectives, and the number and nature of
partners involved. Some WOPs focus on a single technical issue and last less
than a year; others cover several aspects of service delivery and organizational
functioning, and last for some years. In general, WOPs make their impact by helping
utilities acquire and apply knowledge, establish new practices and implement
improved approaches. The areas tackled through mentorship encompass the
management, financial and technical levels. Utilities may want to increase
efficiency, take up new mandates, such as providing services in low-income areas,
expanding sanitation service coverage, enhancing environmental performance,
facilitating access to finance, and/or rebuilding human resource capacity following
a restructuring. The resulting capacity and performance improvements can
facilitate utilities’ access to financing for infrastructural investments, supporting
further extensions or improvements in services. WOPs have been gaining
importance on the global development agenda, as demonstrated by the EU-WOP
programme launched by GWOPA in 2021. The EU-WOP programme is a €9 million
initiative funded by the European Commission; it involves 22 WOPs created among
utilities from African, Arab, Asian, European and Latin American countries.15
WOPs can be a valuable instrument to reach underserved populations in urban
contexts, and implementing WOPs can have a ripple effect because the beneficiary
or mentee utility, after having enhanced its capacities and acquired new
competences, can go on and use this expertise to help other utilities (Box 4.1).
Moreover, many countries are still facing challenges in extending services to rural
areas, where coverage of safely managed drinking water services (60%) is lower than
in urban areas (86%) (WHO/UNICEF, 2021). However, the WOP model has proven
effective in rural areas of Latin America. For example, the National Federation for
Sanitation Services Cooperatives (FESAN) in Chile supported the Rural Community
Development Association (ADECOR) in Guatemala to provide water services to
indigenous communities (Box 4.2). A long-lasting impact on rural water providers can
be achieved by partnerships that tap into local knowledge in a participatory manner.
The positive outcomes generated by WOPs include organizational changes
related to improvements in staff knowledge, skills, awareness and attitude, in
addition to a deeper understanding of the organization’s needs and strategies on
how to address them (Pascual-Sanz et al., 2018). This translated in an estimated
number of 63.7 million indirect beneficiaries (UN-Habitat, n.d.). However, from a
practical standpoint, some challenges still persist. For example, the performance
indicators normally used to monitor how capacity development takes place in WOPs
provide little insight into the intangible elements of capacity development and the
effectiveness of the partnership (Pascual-Sanz et al., 2013). Other aspects to be
carefully considered while implementing a WOP are the context in which it takes
place, including language, cultural norms and governance structures (Tutusaus
and Schwartz, 2016). Lastly, questions of power dynamics should be more openly
discussed within the WOP community, as operators and donors have various
interests at stake (Beck, 2021).

Triangular cooperation normally involves a traditional donor from the ranks of the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
an emerging donor in the South, and a beneficiary country in the South (Ashoff, 2010).

4.3
Wastewater
management

Increases in rural and urban populations, rapid economic development and expanding
agricultural production have increased the volume of water consumed and discharged
as wastewater. Lack of adequate infrastructure and resources to treat wastewater
in cities and towns in a number of developing countries results in a large proportion
of wastewater being discharged directly into drainage channels, rivers, lakes and
oceans. It is estimated that well over 80% of the world’s wastewater flows back into the
environment without being treated or reused (WWAP, 2017). As a result, at least 2 billion
people (globally) use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces, putting them at
risk of contracting cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio (WHO/UNICEF, 2021).
Over the years, a number of partnerships have been created at global, regional and
country levels to address wastewater management in an efficient and sustainable way.
At the global level, the Global Wastewater Initiative (GW²I), a global multiple stakeholder
platform, was launched in 2013. It brings together United Nations agencies, NGOs,
academia, the private sector, development banks and others, to step up efforts against
wastewater pollution worldwide, and to change the paradigm of how wastewater is
commonly seen, from simple waste to a valuable and rich resource.

4.4
Multistakeholder
partnerships
in rural and
secondary towns

At the regional level, findings from two regional case studies in Israel, the ‘Karmiel
Region Union of Towns for Sewage Treatment’ and the ‘Treatment and Reuse of
Wastewater in the area of the Hadera Stream, Ltd.’, suggest that “regional cooperation
can be an efficient tool in promoting advanced wastewater treatment, and has several
advantages: an efficient use of limited resources (financial and land); balancing
disparities between municipalities (size, socio-economic features, consciousness and
ability of local leaders); and reducing spillover effects” (Hophmayer-Tokich and Kliot,
2008, p. 554).
At the national level, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)
and 20 partner organizations involved in managing decentralized wastewater
systems entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to work collaboratively to
encourage proper management of decentralized wastewater systems and increase
collaboration among US EPA, state and local governments, and decentralized system
practitioners and providers. It aims to encourage proper decentralized wastewater
system management and protect the nation’s public health and water resources with
an emphasis on small, rural and suburban communities. The partnership was initiated
in 2005 with eight public and private sector organizations, and had expanded to
20 partners in 2020 (US EPA, n.d.).

In the Lake Victoria region in East Africa, multistakeholder forums were created by
UN-Habitat in 2005 to enhance local ownership of WASH interventions in secondary
towns around the lake. It is generally acknowledged that giving stakeholders a voice and
choice in the basic service delivery process, and building their capacity to manage and
maintain them, leads to services that are more appropriate to the needs and resources
of poor communities, and increases public acceptance and ownership of systems
(WWAP/UN-Water, 2019). Stakeholder engagement also ensures that accountability and
transparency are built in to programmes from the onset.
The Lake Victoria Water and Sanitation Initiative (LVWATSAN), initially supported
by the Government of the Netherlands in 2005 and later by the African Development
Bank (AfDB) in 2011, involved a group of diverse stakeholders representing a range of
knowledge and expertise and attributed with specific responsibilities:

Box 4.2 Providing water services to
indigenous communities in Guatemala
through the FESAN–ADECOR water
operators’ partnership
In 2017–2018, the National Federation
for Sanitary Services Cooperatives
(FESAN) from Chile supported the Rural
Community Development Association
(ADECOR) to expand inclusive and
sustainable access to safe drinking
water for people living in rural areas
of Guatemala, to support women in
conditions of extreme poverty, and to
increase women’s participation in the
sphere of water.
This water operators’ partnership
(WOP), financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank, was characterized
by the participation of water
professionals and local leaders. A
needs assessment was conducted that
highlighted issues with water access,
systems functionality and environmental
hazards. Then, FESAN went on to share
their rich experience about technical
and administrative capacity-building. As
a result, the Municipality of San Martín
Jilotepeque in Guatemala decided to
establish an independent drinking water
service unit, aligned with the culture and
identity of the Kaqchikel ethnic group.
The final phase of the WOP focused on
training women and men from Maya
indigenous communities on sustainable
management models for rural drinking
water supply, which allowed them to
expand career opportunities.
As a result of this WOP, local
communities and rural water operators
of the district of San Martín Jilotepeque
were able to supply drinking water to
indigenous populations. Considering the
local culture in a participatory manner
is fundamental to make a long-lasting
impact in rural water suppliers, impact
workers and help them take ownerships
of the solutions.

schemes. NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) were
also responsible for community awareness-raising, training and
education activities. Partnership building with local authorities created
opportunities for contracting NGOs and CBOs for service provision.

iv.

Regional water service boards – key organization in the sector
reforms and are looking at LVWATSAN as a way to operationalize
water sector reforms at the local level. They were also responsible
for setting pro-poor policies, such as adjusting tariff structures.
The Initiative assisted in building the capacity of the Boards in the
areas of regulation and management of local service providers.

v.

Local water and sanitation service providers – large utilities and
small-scale providers are managers of assets and any assistance
in infrastructure or capacity-building has a direct impact on the
management of their operations. The Initiative improved on their
assets and management capacity, for sustainability of the project.
It also assisted in building the capacity of local service providers
in the areas of business plan development, financial management
(including tariff-setting), technical management (including
operations and maintenance), and demand management.

vi. Local private sector – town-wide improvements in water supply,
sanitation, drainage and solid waste management attract further
investments and increase local economic activities in the
participating towns. The local private sector was, therefore, a direct
beneficiary of the programme.
vii. Local water vendor associations – responsible for most of the
service provision to the poor communities in the participating towns.
The Initiative supported them in establishing and supporting the
formation of associations of small-scale service providers; providing
access to finance and supporting development of entrepreneurship
skills; regulating prices and monitoring quality of water supplied
to consumers; and establishing linkages with utilities (through
franchising etc.) to ensure vertical integration and synergy.
viii. Local media – responsible for raising levels of awareness about
water, sanitation, waste management and drainage issues in the
Lake Victoria region in general, and in the participating towns, in
particular, among political leaders, policy-makers, development
partners and beneficiary communities.

Box 4.3 Smart rainwater management and drought resilience in rural semi-arid communities:
A case study of Northeast Brazil
The smart rainwater management in Northeast Brazil was triggered by a drought between 1979 and
1983, which killed nearly one million people. Since the late 1970s, the Governmental Agricultural
Research Center for the Semi-arid Region (EMBRAPA Semi-Arid) conducts research on rainwater
harvesting systems. In 1990, the Regional Institute of Small Appropriate Agriculture and Animal
Husbandry (IRPAA) and other non-governmental organizations started undertaking research and
dissemination of rainwater harvesting technologies, as part of the model ‘Living in Harmony with
the Semi-Arid Climate’. Over the course of the 1990s, it became necessary to create the institutional
basis to implement larger programmes, so the government funded the Brazilian Rainwater
Catchment and Management Association in July 1999, bringing together researchers and users of
rainwater technologies.
In the same year, non-governmental organizations founded the Semi-Arid Network (ASA),
which brought together more than 2000 grassroots organizations, including non-governmental
organizations, farmers’ unions, cooperatives, associations and church communities. The ASA
launched the campaign under the slogan ‘No family without safe drinking water’ and proposed
the One Million Cisterns Programme (P1MC), to be implemented by civil society in a decentralized
way (at the community, municipal, micro-regional, state and semi-arid regional levels). The P1MC
was complemented by the Programme One Piece of Land and Two Types of Waters (P1+2), calling
for every rural family to have: (1) a piece of land large enough to produce food, raise livestock,
and ensure a sustainable life; and (2) two types of water storage, one for drinking and another for
agricultural production.
The rainwater management programmes, executed principally by ASA with governmental financing,
are a success story. The community went from 1 million dead people to 1 million cisterns. In the
drought of 1979 to 1983, about 1 million people in the Northeast died of starvation, that is, hunger or
thirst. In the drought that lasted from 2012 to 2017, there were no records of deaths by starvation,
no large migrations, no emergencies and much less looting in the cities of the hinterland.
The One Million Cisterns Programme received the Future Policy Award 2017 during the 13th
Conference of the Parties of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Ordos, China, because
it “is a participative, bottom-up way to provide water for consumption, for producing food and raising
livestock in Brazil’s drought-prone semi-arid region using simple rainwater collection technology. It
empowers millions of the region’s poorest people to be in control of their own needs, to generate
income and enhance their food security”.

stakeholder interests and the need for a balanced geographical and gender
distribution. Identifying credible individuals who can represent the issues and
concerns of a particular stakeholder group is an efficient way to obtain active
engagement.
To document this engagement experience in the Lake Victoria region, the
multistakeholder engagement guide How to Set Up and Manage a Town-Level
Multistakeholder Forum: A Step-by-Step Guide (UN-Habitat, 2008) has been used to
set up a number of town-level multistakeholder platforms for citizen feedback and
oversight in the provision of urban water and sanitation services in Burundi, Kenya,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The multistakeholder platforms have
also been used in these countries to involve residents in city-wide issues, including

Box 4.4 Uptime Consortium and Catalyst Facility: A new partnership approach to scaling up sustainable
rural water services
Rural water supply in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, is typified by a
mix of community-based management and self-supply (Carter, 2021). While decentralizing to the community
and household level has advantages, there are also marked disadvantages when it comes to uneven and
unreliable sustainability and equity (Whaley et al., 2020; Sutton and Butterworth, 2021). Thorough analysis and
action research by the University of Oxford and partners in Kenya revealed that, if repair times for waterpoints
are brought down from weeks to 1–3 days, willingness to pay goes up and cost recovery improves (Foster
et al., 2022). Professionalized operators can maximize ‘uptime’ of rural water services if incentivized to do
so through performance-based contracts and blended finance (McNicholl et al., 2019). With this insight, the
Uptime Catalyst Facility was created in 2020, initially comprising five non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and private sector operators in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Kenya and Uganda, serving over
a million people. This has now expanded to seven countries and 1.6 million people served (uptimewater.org,
n.d.), but the goal is to scale up to 100 million people by 2030. For this, partnerships are essential, and a first
step was collaboration with the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN) to find operators and governments that
could adopt this approach.

the improvement of municipal governance. Institutionalized citizen engagement within
the local governments in turn enhanced public accountability, performance and customer
responsiveness in water and sanitation service provision.
A similar multistakeholder engagement initiative in Northern Brazil is summarized in Box 4.3.
In remote rural areas, where water supply is often provided through a combination of
community engagement and household self-supply, participatory approaches through
partnerships can lead to improvements in maintenance and cost recovery (Box 4.4).

Water resilience
in cities

Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MCR2030)16 is a multi-stakeholder initiative for improving
local resilience, including reducing disaster and climate risks, through advocacy, sharing
knowledge and experiences, establishing mutually reinforcing city-to-city learning
networks, injecting technical expertise, connecting multiple layers of government, and
building partnerships. Through delivering a clear roadmap to urban resilience, providing
tools, access to knowledge and monitoring and reporting tools, MCR2030 is supporting
cities on their journey to reduce risk and build resilience. The founding partners are the
World Council for City Data, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), UN-Habitat, the World Bank, United
Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI),
R-Cities, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), C40 Cities, the
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). In addition, there are over 280 other partners that
provide services to cities.
MCR2030 strives to ensure cities become inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030,
contributing directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 and
other global frameworks (Sendai Framework, Paris Agreement, New Urban Agenda).

Water supply and sanitation for human settlements

MCR2030 tools promote a better understanding of the role of water in the development
of an urban settlement. The tools promote diagnostics of risks to human settlements,
including from excess or scarcity of water, an analytical approach to address the
challenges posed by this situation, and an action plan to handle risks, including
water-related risks. For example, the tools emphasize that deforestation may increase
the potential for flash flooding, and green areas may help in flood and stormwater
management. As such, the Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Cities encourages cities
to examine the “‘Water/sanitation loss factor’. If: a = estimated # of days to restore
regular service area-wide and b = % of user accounts affected… then water/sanitation
loss factor = a x b” (UNDRR, 2017, p. 66). This kind of calculations helps to understand
the customer service days at risk, so that city planners are better equipped to analyse
vulnerabilities in the WASH sector.

4.6
Migrants and
refugees

Over the years,
a number of
partnerships have
been created at
global, regional
and country
levels to address
wastewater
management in
an efficient and
sustainable way

At the end of 2020, the number of forcibly displaced people was estimated to be
82.4 million, with 48 million of these internally displaced (UNHCR, 2022). International
human rights law requires that states guarantee everyone the right to an adequate
supply of safe water for personal and domestic use. However, forced migration puts an
increased strain on water resources and more importantly, on the local entities (utilities,
communities) responsible for providing water supply and sanitation services. While
states are the primary duty-bearers for these rights, multi-stakeholder partnerships
between United Nations agencies, international organizations, NGOs and civil society
are required to respond to the complexity of contemporary displacement dynamics,
impacts and drivers, which affect both displaced populations and host communities.
The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM)17 commits states
to provide evidence- and human rights-based policy-making and public discourse on
migration. Water governance and effective policy responses are required to consider the
full spectrum of human mobility under a human rights framework, with consideration
for the relationship between migration and water – that is, how water insecurity drives
migration, and how pressure on water resources is also an impact of migration (Global
High-Level Panel of Water and Peace, 2017).
In addition to high-level water governance, intra-sectoral partnerships for crisis
management are formulated through the Global WASH Cluster to ensure coordination
and response quality and capacity for WASH assistance to people affected by
emergencies (e.g. operational support to national WASH coordination boards,
enhancing emergency preparedness of WASH participants; liability and learning to
enable WASH actions and promotion for WASH as an essential part of the humanitarian
response in both emergency and development settings). This is specific to emergencies
when for example a human settlement displacement camp is being set up. WASH actors
need to collaborate under the National WASH Cluster, which is the main coordination
mechanism for partnerships and cooperation in emergencies.18
Within displacement settings, water user committees can facilitate collaboration with
local water authorities as well as promote women’s participation (Box 4.5).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Box 4.5 Supporting community-based WASH collaboration in displacement settings
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has worked to improve access to safe drinking water
and sanitation in the Gedo Region of Somalia. A crucial element for ensuring water sustainability has been
the establishment of several water user committees, which own and manage the water infrastructure and
services. Their members are elected by the community and entrusted with responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of the waterpoints on the site, in order to ensure their long-term sustainability. Water committees
can also take on other roles, such as promoting positive hygiene behaviour change such as safe storage and
collection of water, and safe food and hand hygiene.
It is key for women to be active participants of the committees, given that they are primarily responsible for
domestic water collection, and are the main water decision-makers at the household level. Water committees
can also work to mitigate disputes over water, promoting cooperation and conflict resolution.
Women’s participation and inclusion in labour (work) activities form also a challenge in northeast Nigeria,
where the role of women is largely limited to domestic chores, with little or no opportunity to participate
in activities that bring them out into the public domain. The IOM encourages women to be fully involved at
every stage of programme development, for example selecting where to drill boreholes and place sanitation
infrastructure. Further, the IOM has engaged Hygiene Promotion and Community Engagement Volunteers, 80%
of whom are women, who are actively involved in mass campaigns and risk communication and community
engagement, leading a large transformation in attitude towards, and access to, these types of roles.

Conclusions

Experiences on WASH-related partnerships and cooperation in human settlements
highlighted in this chapter are driven by the need to accelerate change, create greater
impact and achieve sustainable results by sharing knowledge, resources and technical
expertise. WOPs, for example, are a valuable tool to enhance the performance of water
and sanitation service providers by connecting a strong utility with another utility that
needs assistance or guidance.
At the project management level, multistakeholder partnerships involving local
community groups and local governments illustrate the value of partnerships in
ensuring community ownership and engagement in the management of water and
sanitation facilities.
Partnerships and cooperation at global, regional and national levels are equally
instrumental in advocating for better performance in wastewater management in
diverse human settlements. Strengthening city-to-city learning networks is an equally
unique partnership opportunity for improving local resilience. Partnerships on water and
sanitation in migrant and refugee contexts also demonstrate the impact of cooperation
to ensure supply of these essential services to displaced populations.

5.1
Context

Industry has the capacity to advance responsible practices and devise market-based
solutions to accelerate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at scale, but this ability
can be undermined by governance gaps, market failures, cultural barriers and trust deficits.
Collective action, in the form of partnerships and coalitions, is vital to overcoming these
impediments (Nelson, 2017). The phrase “collective action”, which is gaining prominence
in the business community, refers to “coordinated engagement among interested parties
within an agreed-upon process in support of common objectives” (CEO Water Mandate, 2013,
p. 3). Industry turns to collective action when desired outcomes cannot be obtained through
internal or unilateral action alone.
Industry is in a unique position to lead on the collective action front, being very familiar with
strategic partnerships and cooperation and their ability to produce win–win outcomes in
core business areas. In recent years the increased value of adding environmental, social and
governance (ESG) and water stewardship scopes to such arrangements has become very
evident – not only in the commercial sense but also in the broader context of overall water
sustainability to provide beneficial results for all parties.
Although industry is no stranger to collective action, there is a need to increase the scale
and also the “effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy” of such efforts (Nelson, 2017). To that
end, this chapter looks at industry motivations to enter into collective action, canvasses key
elements of collective action involving industry, and explores some examples of practical
collective action and trends where industry is taking the lead, and where it can therefore
engage in partnerships and cooperation to accelerate SDG 6.

5.2
Industrial
water use

A frequently cited statistic is that industry and energy together use approximately 19% of the
world’s freshwater withdrawals (Ritchie and Roser, 2017).19 Energy uses approximately 10%
of the world’s withdrawals (IEA, 2016a). While this is much less than the 70% attributed to
agricultural use (Ritchie and Roser, 2017), it is nonetheless a considerable amount of water
that requires careful stewardship in the watersheds that industry and energy share with so
many other users. On the other hand, these data do not provide a complete picture, as it
has been estimated that two-thirds of all water consumption is involved in corporate supply
chains (TNC, n.d.). Supporting this estimate, companies in seven major sectors – food,
textile, energy, manufacturing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and mining – are affecting more
than 70% of the world’s freshwater use and pollution (CDP, 2018).
A regional distribution shows that industrial water withdrawal averages 17% of total water use
in high-income countries but only 2% in low-income countries. The average for industrial use
hides a huge range, from 49–96% in the European Union (with the highest level in Estonia)
to 0–5% in many countries of various income levels in other regions. Such percentages
correspond in reverse to the use of water for agriculture, particularly in poorer economies.
However, areas in the Middle East and North Africa with high levels of water stress are only
using about 4% of their water for industry, while South Asia is experiencing high industrial use
(47%) and high water stress simultaneously (Ritchie and Roser, 2017).
The perspective changes when the quantity of industrial water use is taken into account. The
two largest users, Asia and North America, are very similar at 229 km³/year and 249 km³/year
respectively, yet Asia is by far the world’s largest user for all sectors at 2505 km³/year, which
is considerably more than runner-up North America at 602 km³/year (United Nations, 2022,
Figure 3, p. 15). By contrast, the total use (agriculture, domestic and industry) for each of the

19

The backstop for industrial water use statistics is the AQUASTAT database by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO), which provides the amount of self-supplied water used, including thermoelectric and
nuclear cooling water, but excluding hydropower. Publicly supplied water to industry is usually included in municipal
water withdrawal, so the total amount of industrial water use is unknown but will be more than the AQUASTAT data.

other continents – Africa, Europe and South America – is close to the industrial use of Asia
and North America (United Nations, 2022. Figure 3, p. 15). Globally, energy uses a relatively
small total of 338 km³/year (IEA, n.d.).

Industry turns to
collective action
when desired
outcomes cannot
be obtained
through internal
or unilateral
action alone

Estimates for future water demand in industry and energy are not widely available. In
2012, globally, a 400% increase for manufacturing and a 140% increase for thermal
power generation between 2000 and 2050 was projected (OECD, 2012). A report in 2009
had forecast that by 2030 industrial water withdrawals globally would increase to 22%
(2030 Water Resources Group, 2009). A later study suggests a 24% increase in industry and
energy’s water demand by 2050 in a ‘middle of the road’ scenario (Burek et al., 2016). More
recently, the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) reported that about two-thirds of
the companies that responded to its survey are reducing or maintaining their withdrawals
(CDP, 2021). Water withdrawal for energy by 2030 is expected to remain much the same for
the scenarios considered by the International Energy Agency (IEA), except for the Sustainable
Development Scenario, 20 which forecasts an increase in consumption of about 75 km³/year
(from 50 km³/year) in 2016, but a reduction in overall use of about 275 km³/year. (IEA, 2018).
According to the CDP, issues of water quality have largely been overlooked, with only 59% of
the responding companies monitoring their wastewater quality, only 12% setting pollution
targets and only 4.4% making progress against them (CDP, 2021).
Progress can be made in reducing water stress by decoupling water use from industrial and
energy growth, controlling supply chains, and maintaining the quality and accessibility to
water for those in need – which are all best achieved by collective action.

5.3
Collective action
and industry
motivations

Companies within industries that rely heavily on water for their core business – such
as manufacturing of goods or production of inputs and raw materials – have become
increasingly attuned to water stress and the risks21 it poses to business interests. As a result,
many companies are exploring and testing ways to reduce or mitigate water risks across their
business and supply chains (CEO Water Mandate, 2013).
The UN Global Compact’s SDG Ambition (Box 5.1), launched at Davos in 2020, “aims to enable
the world’s leading companies to set ambitious goals and targets in the areas that will have the
greatest business impact on the SDGs, and integrate sustainable development into enterprise
management processes and systems” (UN Global Compact, 2020, p. 2).
Companies that make the strategic decision to manage water-related risks or seek water
stewardship initiatives (WSIs)22 often do so to ensure business viability, retain their legal or
social license to operate, assure investors, and uphold corporate values and commitments.
“Collective action is desirable (and likely necessary) when the ability to produce these outcomes
is not possible through internal or unilateral action” (CEO Water Mandate, 2013, p. 5).

20

The Sustainable Development Scenario uses the objectives from the SDGs 7, 3 and 13 and “assesses what
combination of actions would deliver them.” The SDG Targets 6.1–6.3 are not embedded in this Scenario, however the
analysis “provides a what if case to assess what the additional energy needs of achieving these targets might be under
the framework of the Sustainable Development Scenario.” (IEA, 2018).

21

The CEO Water Mandate defines water risk as “the possibility of an entity experiencing a water-related challenge (e.g.,
water scarcity, water stress, flooding, infrastructure decay, drought). The extent of risk is a function of the likelihood of
a specific challenge occurring and the severity of the challenge’s impact. The severity of impact itself depends on the
intensity of the challenge, as well as the vulnerability of the actor” (CEO Water Mandate, 2014, p. 4).

22

“Water stewardship initiatives typically involve structured collective action and joint decision making and
implementation to ensure use of water that is socially equitable, environmentally sustainable, and economically
beneficial” (CEO Water Mandate/WIN, 2015, p. 11).

The SDG 6 Benchmark is Net-Positive Water Impact in Water-Stressed Basins, which helps businesses assess their water use
and deliver net-positive water impacts,* especially in highly water-stressed areas (defined by the World Resources Institute
as an area where 40% or more of the available supply of water is withdrawn each year (Hofste et al., 2019)). This benchmark
enables businesses to assess their impact across freshwater’s availability, quality and accessibility, and advocates moving
beyond operational to measurable improvements of watersheds in proportion to their local water use and economic impact.
Companies must set targets for direct operations’ water use in the short term, supporting a pathway to 50% fulfillment by
2030 and 100% fulfillment of net-positive water by 2050 (CEO Water Mandate, n.d.b).
There are eight strategic steps to operationalize the SDG Ambition benchmarks (Figure).

A net-positive water impact “contributes toward reducing water stress in its three dimensions: availability (quantity), quality, and access[ibility]. It ensures the

company’s contributions [continually] exceed impacts on water stress in the same region” (CEO Water Mandate, n.d.a).

76

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Nestlé, the world’s largest food and beverage company, explains that industrial trends are
“shifting from an isolationist mindset to a more collective approach. … This change reflects
a growing realization taking place globally that water is not a confined commodity, rather a
shared resource, and unless collective action is taken, the positive impact on water resources
will remain minimal. For business water users this means looking at your water risks not just
within your fence line, but at a catchment level” (AWS, 2020, p. 5).
In practice, the motivating factors behind any company’s participation in collective action
vary (Enright et al., 2018). According to the CEO Water Mandate’s analysis (2013) and
research by Nelson (2017), industry will typically embrace collective action with interested
parties for:
• Coherent articulation of the problem, shared ownership of solutions, and clarity of joint
purpose;

interests

• Better-informed decision-making by all parties to the effort;
• A larger pool of expertise and increased capacity to focus on fostering change;
• Access to partner assets (new networks, technical support and complementary skills; new
technologies; data and information);
• Lasting outcomes, due to support from the engaged parties;
• Credibility, legitimacy and visibility among key interested parties, bolstering its legal and
social license to operate;
• Stronger, more sustainable governance as a result of the engagement of multiple
stakeholders;
• Involvement in larger and more significant projects;
• The ability to leverage financial resources, including access to donor funding and pooling
of resources that can be mobilized and optimized toward a common purpose;
• Opportunities to shape industry standards, influence and garner political support, and
encourage behavioural change; and
• Fresh ideas and perspectives for solving a problem.

5.4
Elements of
collective action

Collective action for industry can take many forms, ranging from a relatively informal
exchange of perspectives to highly structured processes of joint decision-making,
implementation and accountability (CEO Water Mandate, 2013). Box 5.2 shows some of the
contributions industry can bring to a collective action for sustainable development. Given the
long-term nature of partnership building and system change, most collective actions remain
at an early stage. Rigorous analysis of their impacts, and of what works or not, is therefore
not readily available (Nelson, 2017).
Typically, interested parties must have a shared sense of risk, responsibility and benefit for
collective action to be successful. The potential advantages of acting with others to manage
water-related risks or capture opportunities for WSIs must be weighed against the potential
challenges and complexities of consulting other parties, sharing information, making joint
decisions or commitments, and sharing responsibility for implementation. According to the
CEO Water Mandate, “Companies engaging in collective action can face a host of vulnerabilities,
including additional public scrutiny, unrealistic expectations and skepticism about motives.
Done poorly, collective action can undermine a company’s reputation, tarnish product brands
and exacerbate existing problems” (CEO Water Mandate, 2013, p. 2). For collective action to

be effective, companies typically have to establish unconventional
relationships with non-traditional partners. There must be a commitment
to shared goals and a recognition of the potential for trade-offs between
company interests and broader public benefits. Collective action (Box
5.3) requires companies to develop new skills and knowledge, such as
greater understanding of community needs and values, and enhance
their ability to connect with government actors and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) (CEO Water Mandate, 2013).

• Brand power

The CEO Water Mandate (2013) proposes the following collective action
engagement levels:

• Access to markets and value
chains/distribution networks
to take a solution to scale

• Informative: coordinating the sharing of information for expanded
knowledge and increased transparency, familiarity and trust;

• Leveraging of scarce public
funding and mobilization of
private capital

• Consultative: convening specific interested parties to exchange
ideas and expertise, and to create a shared understanding of needs,
interests and challenges to enable informed, independent decisions;

• Infrastructure and logistics

• Collaborative: bringing interested parties closer together to find
common ground and objectives, and increasing individual and
collective effectiveness by sharing implementation responsibilities;
and

• Managerial and operational
experience
• Policy influence

• Integrative: a formal joint structure when an alignment of interests,
resources, decision-making and coordinated actions to meet waterrelated challenges or opportunities is needed.

• Risk management and
appetite for risk
• Intervention sustainability
(extended investment horizons
beyond short-term project
cycles)
• Solutions mindset and focus
on results
• Access to customers,
employees, suppliers, peer
companies, investors and
training providers

With a long history of working with industry, the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has developed a
classification (Figure 5.1) of three collective action scenarios (upon
which this chapter builds further, using a framework presented by the
UN Global Compact for collaboration between the United Nations and
the private sector) that can be considered from the perspective of
SDG 6, as follows:

(1) Core business and value chain partnerships
These partnerships harness the core strengths of industry
and/or change the way industry operates to be more in line with
development goals (UNIDO, 2013). The aim is to “[create] positive
shared value for host countries and communities by mobilizing the
innovative technologies, processes, products and skills of industry
to help achieve international goals [such as SDG 6] through what are
increasingly called ‘inclusive business models,’ ‘base of the pyramid
models,’ or ‘creative capitalism’” (UN Global Compact, 2008).
These alliances “can be commercially viable from the outset, or they
may require various forms of seed or venture financing, or hybrid
approaches that include ongoing public, donor or philanthropic
support” (UN Global Compact, 2008). Key development multipliers
from core business operations can include producing safe
and affordable products and services; generating income and
investment; creating jobs; developing human resources; fostering
entrepreneurship (including women empowerment) and building
local businesses and business linkages; spreading responsible

business standards and practices; supporting technology development and
transfer; establishing physical and institutional infrastructure; and participating
in collective platforms (UN Global Compact, 2008). For large companies with
operations and subsidiaries in numerous countries, or a sizable market share
and influence in their industries, cooperating more systematically with business
partners along their value chains can have a substantial scaling impact (Nelson,
2017).
(2) Social investment and philanthropy partnerships
These partnerships provide different types of non-commercial financial support,
including traditional philanthropy, social venture funds, hybrid or blended-value
financing mechanisms, or employee volunteers. They can also contribute core
industry expertise, products or services to the public cause (UNIDO, 2013).
Activities can include: building the capacity of community leaders and social
entrepreneurs; training local technical specialists; enhancing the governance
capacity and voice of local civil society groups and media organizations;
supporting multicultural education and awareness programmes; establishing and
supporting micro-credit programmes and small business initiatives (UN Global
Compact, 2008); and promoting gender equality and providing opportunities for
marginalized groups.

Box 5.3 The CEO Water Mandate’s Guide to Water-Related Collective Action
The CEO Water Mandate, an initiative of the UN Global Compact in partnership with the Pacific Institute, is an umbrella
programme that encourages individual corporations to join its network, use its resources to address water issues,
and advance corporate water stewardship. It provides opportunities for collective action at many levels and its Guide
to Water-Related Collective Action introduces the idea that success in responsible engagement is critically tied to
effective collective action among all parties with a stake in sustainable water management at the relevant scale –
local, regional, national or international. The Guide provides a five-element process to approaching collective action:
1. Scoping the water challenges and action areas;
2. Identifying and characterizing the interested parties;
3. Engaging all interested parties in the challenges and action areas at a level of involvement to deliver the results
and benefits;
4. Designing the collective action engagement; and
5. Structuring and managing the collective action.
The CEO Water Mandate also provides an online platform, the Water Action Hub, which has a mapping function
and assists organizations in identifying potential collaborators, such as businesses, relevant governments,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local communities, to improve water management in watersheds of
critical strategic interest.
Source: CEO Water Mandate (2013).

(3) Multi-stakeholder and transformational partnerships
These partnerships enable dynamic processes for issue-focused consultation and
scalable operations among numerous private and public parties, and help to include
industry representatives in governance structures (UNIDO, 2013). Such partnerships
allow “individual companies or business associations engaging in advocacy, public
policy dialogue, joint regulation, and efforts to build or strengthen public institutions
and administrative capacity in order to bridge governance gaps, improve the enabling
environment, and support more systemic change at the local, national or global level”
(UN Global Compact, 2008, p. 4). Activities can include supporting local and national
governments to protect human rights, making public administration and service delivery
more efficient, and improving the fairness and transparency of regulation; engaging in
global dialogue on water issues; and advocating for increased quantity and quality of
donor aid to developing countries (UN Global Compact, 2008).
Because businesses generally do not publish their unsuccessful attempts or failures at
collective action, explicit lessons from collective actions are not easily drawn. Collective
actions for WSIs involving industry are also still relatively new. “As such the evidence
regarding their efficacy is still limited and much work has been through a process of trial and
error. And many still question whether corporate engagement is anathema to sustainable and
equitable water management arguing, for instance, that it can lead to policy and resource
capture [undue influence on decision-making, skewing of public policy priorities, or privileged
access to water resources] or provide companies with increased access to decision-makers
and information” (CEO Water Mandate/WIN, 2015, p. 5).
The CEO Water Mandate and Water Integrity Network (WIN) recognized that WSIs, which require
a lot of collective action, would be subject to many pitfalls and so produced a document titled
Guide for Managing Water Integrity in Water Stewardship Initiatives: A Framework for Improving
Effectiveness and Transparency to support existing and future WSIs in creating tangible benefits
for society by ensuring high levels of integrity and transparency. The document notes that

80

“WSIs with integrity ideally have: (1) Clear objectives and demonstrable outcomes that advance
sustainable water management; (2) Trustworthy, credible and accountable participants; [and]
(3) Inclusive, transparent and responsive processes and governance that lead to informed and
balanced decision making” (CEO Water Mandate/WIN, 2015, p. 13). WSIs that fail often do not
have one or more of these dimensions.

Examples of industry
collaboration

The format of collective actions in industry is demonstrated in three major ways: intra-, multiand extra-sectoral partnerships and cooperation, as defined previously in the report (Chapter 1).
These are illustrated by examples in the four boxes (5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7) that follow.

The Alliance for Water Stewardship
(AWS) Standard is a framework for
major water users in a catchment area
to understand their own water use and
impacts, and to work collaboratively
and transparently with others towards
sustainable water management – driving
social, environmental and economic
benefits. Implementing the AWS
Standard can help industry understand
water dependencies and impacts;
mitigate operational and supply chain
water risks; ensure that responsible
water procedures are in place; build
relationships with local water-related
stakeholders; and address challenges
shared with others in a catchment.

drawn up through dialogues between various actors, such as banana producers, local communities, parish governments and
producers from other agricultural sectors in the area. It has helped the banana producers understand their water risks; identify
and implement clear activities toward collective action to minimize them – thereby improving their operational, regulatory and
reputational performance and minimizing unaccounted expenses; and become a driver of positive change that delivers longlasting benefits beyond the farm level.

Box 5.5 Igniting a CEO-driven initiative: The
Water Resilience Coalition

Box 5.6 Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement (PACE)
programme for women

The CEO Water Mandate has partnered
with a number of leading global companies
from the beverage, technology and garment
manufacturing sectors, among others, that
use water in their own operations or in their
value chains (including AB InBev, Diageo, Dow
Chemical Co., Ecolab, Gap Inc., Microsoft
and PVH Corp.) to launch an industry-driven,
CEO-led initiative: the Water Resilience
Coalition. Founded in 2020, the Coalition,
through collective action, will ground its work
in building the resilience of water-stressed
basins around the world – prioritizing
those that pose the greatest risk to local
communities and economies, industry, and
long-term economic prosperity.

According to UN-Water “Effective planning, implementation and
monitoring of water and sanitation depends on engaging with the whole
of society, especially the involvement of women and young people
and the integration of gender equality considerations. [Therefore, to
accelerate SDG 6] Opportunities, such as engaging women to build skills
for maintenance of water provision systems with water operators, must
be expanded.” (UN-Water, 2020, p. 7). Industry is uniquely positioned to
accelerate gender equality in the water domain, may it be individually or
in partnership with other entities.

Companies that join the Water Resilience
Coalition sign a pledge to make the needed
investments in their own operations, and work
together through collective action, to meet
three overarching commitments by 2050:
• Net-positive water impact: Deliver
measurable net positive impact in waterstressed basins, defined as contributing
more to the availability, quality and
accessibility of a basin’s freshwater
resources than what is taken from it;
• Water-resilient value chain: Develop,
implement and enable strategies to
support leading impact-based water
resilience practices across the global
value chain; and
• Global leadership: Raise the ambition
of water resilience through public and
corporate outreach, and inspire other
industry leaders to join the Coalition.
Coalition members are expected to work
together, share their knowledge and participate
in collective action projects in water-stressed
basins to achieve their pledge commitments.
By 2030, the expectation is that members will
enable water resilience actions and outcomes
in the parts of their value chain with the largest
water dependencies and impacts. By 2050,
coalition members will be working with all
value chain partners with significant water
use/impacts to encourage net-positive water
impact. More than 25 companies have joined
the Coalition as of July 2022.

Worldwide, women comprise approximately 80% of garment workers
in the apparel industry, which is “also responsible for roughly one-fifth
of [global] freshwater pollution. For example, manufacturing processes
such as dyeing and finishing garments are sometimes poorly regulated
and can result in impacts to surrounding community water resources.
Many of the countries where apparel production is based also face
underlying challenges in meeting the health, economic, and natural
resource management needs of their populations. A significant factor that
contributes to women’s disadvantages in many of these countries is the
disproportionate burden that women bear for household responsibilities,
particularly related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Women
and girls collectively spend more than 150 million hours collecting water
and face serious health risks due to inadequate access to safe drinking
water and sanitation facilities, and poor understanding of healthy hygiene
practices. Addressing these issues provides an opportunity to strengthen
women’s lives” (USAID, n.d.).
Gap Inc. launched its Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement
(PACE) programme for women in vendor facilities in 2007, to support
their professional and personal growth through education and skills
training. A WASH curriculum was added in 2014 (Nanda et al., 2014).
In 2017, Gap Inc. in partnership with the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) expanded its efforts to the
watershed level with the Women + Water (W+W) Alliance, a five-year
programme aimed at improving the health and well-being of women
and communities touched by the apparel industry through improved
WASH services. To help build community water resilience, W+W Alliance
partners the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE),
water.org, WaterAid and the Institute for Sustainable Communities
work to help build women’s self-efficacy with trainings and resources
to advocate for their water needs, to improve awareness and access to
water and sanitation, and to train cotton farmers to incorporate water
stewardship into their farming practices (Gap Inc., 2021).
For the 2017 through January 2022 period, the Alliance empowered
more than 1.5 million people to improve their access to clean water and
sanitation. The initiative has also led to the following impacts: 162,174
women enrolled in PACE self-efficacy training; 2,198 Village Action Plans
developed for local water access; 10,244 women and youths trained on
water quality testing; 66,100 affordable loans made; US$12.8 million
in financing catalysed for water and sanitation; 4,140 farmers trained
on good operating practices for sustainable cotton cultivation; and
260 women entrepreneurs supported to sell farmers bio-based fertilizer
and pesticides (USAID, n.d.).

Box 5.7 Google’s flood forecasting initiative
As part of a crisis response programme that aims to provide trusted information and resources in critical
moments, Google began a flood forecasting initiative in 2018, with the goal of preventing catastrophic damage
by equipping those in harm’s way with accurate and detailed alerts. Working in partnership with the Indian
Central Water Commission and the Bangladesh Water Development Board, it initially covered areas of India and
Bangladesh with a population of 220 million, to send out 40 million potentially life-saving alerts. Previous global
flood alerts provided only information on how much rivers would rise, which was not always meaningful to the
people who were at risk. Google’s flood alerts visualize this critical information by overlaying the extent and depth
of potential flooding right on Google Maps.
In 2021, the initiative expanded to cover an area with over 360 million people and send more than 115 million
alerts, using more advanced flood prediction technology. The company has also partnered with local aid
organizations such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Indian Red
Cross Society, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, and Yuganter to help reach people without smartphones
or internet access. Google worked closely with these organizations to provide training in local villages on how
to read the alerts and flood maps, as well as how to act and notify others once an alert is issued. The flood
forecasting system is now live throughout India and Bangladesh, and Google is working to expand to other
countries in South Asia and South America.

5.6
Energy sector

The energy sector, particularly power generation, conventionally uses much water and
its efforts to decarbonize have an impact on water in countries of all income levels. The
effects of drought and water scarcity have large repercussions on cooling water for thermal
generation and on reservoirs for hydropower (see UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020, Table 7.2).
Decarbonization, particularly through renewables, is reflected through the SDG 6 targets
concerning water quality, water use efficiency, integrated water resources management and
water-related ecosystems. However, in low-income countries and water-stressed areas, there
is an added dimension of safe drinking water and sanitation, where poor water availability or
poor access can be mitigated by providing increased access to electricity. This means water
can be pumped and moved more efficiently, thus improving the lives of people – particularly
benefiting women who would otherwise spend much time and effort obtaining water. This
shows that the energy sector does not work in a vacuum, as collective action in water basins
can be beneficial to all (Box 5.8).

5.7
Small and
medium
enterprises

There are approximately 400 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs)23 globally,
representing about 95% of companies and providing 60% to 70% of employment (National
Action Plans on Business and Human Rights, n.d.). The International Finance Corporation (IFC)
estimates that there are 9.34 million registered women-owned SMEs in over 140 assessed
countries in the non-agricultural sector (IFC, 2014).
SME Connect, a network of SMEs in the European Union, has an SDG 6 working group, which
aims, among other things, to “build networks of knowledge and support better water policy/
regulations in Europe and worldwide” (SME Connect, n.d.). This includes finding solutions for
challenges related to industrial wastewater.

Box 5.8 Cooperation between a public utility (Hydro-Québec) and the Cree First Nation of Québec, Canada:
A sustainable path for the community and the environment
Hydro-Québec launched the Eastmain-1-A/Sarcelle/Rupert project to partially divert the Rupert River’s flow
northward. The goal was to increase generating capacity and build two new powerhouses while preserving
the surrounding environment and respecting the host communities. From the design stage, Eastmain-1-A/
Sarcelle/Rupert incorporated many environmental protection measures, reflecting the traditional knowledge of
the Cree community members consulted. The Cree Nation of Québec were involved in all stages of the project,
ensuring they had a voice in how their land would be impacted. A combination of dykes and canals was
necessary to improve the water flow, which ensured that the project, which diverts 71% of the river, flooded
the smallest possible land area. Hydro-Québec also incorporated a substantial ecological in-stream flow and
a series of weirs in the river to protect biological diversity, preserve the landscape, and maintain navigation
and other activities in the area. Hydro-Québec also signed an unprecedented water management agreement
with the Cree to ensure that the modulation of the ecological in-stream flow was managed in a cooperative
manner. Throughout construction, which began in 2007, more than US$700 million in contracts were awarded
to Cree companies. In 2002, the Boumhounan Agreement put in place an extensive participation programme
built around information and consultation with Cree stakeholders. In 2014, after project completion, the
Reappropriation Agreement was signed, giving Cree land users the necessary support to maintain their
tradional activities as long as the Rupert River diversion continues in operation.

The World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) is involved in collective action with SMEs
to implement water stewardship in China, India and Pakistan, as well as several
lower-income countries. In China, the textile and dyeing industry was prioritized,
particularly in industrial parks (a form of collaboration in themselves). With the help
of an international clothing company, a pilot project was established in one industrial
park. One objective was to “improve the water stewardship performance of SMEs
individually and collectively”. A local dyeing association of 23 companies has been
engaging with local government. The Industrial Park Water Stewardship Guidance has
been developed and, by the end of 2016, a total of 346 SMEs had been engaged. WWF
also convened a multi-stakeholder water stewardship platform of various levels of
government, international companies, SMEs, NGOs and academia (WWF, 2017).

5.8
The way forward

84

Achieving SDG 6 is an ambitious vision. As more and more businesses choose
that vision as their roadmap to growth, general confidence in reaching the
SDGs will grow, creating powerful incentives for companies, governments and
other stakeholders to plan and invest accordingly (Business and Sustainable
Development Commission, 2017). But while leadership by individual companies is
necessary to accelerate action toward SDG 6, it is not sufficient to drive requisite
transformational and systemic change to achieve this goal. Collective action,
while not a panacea, is “needed among companies themselves, working together
along global supply chains and on a precompetitive basis in specific industry
sectors, issues and locations. It will also be needed on a cross-sector basis among
companies, governments and civil society organizations” (Nelson, 2017, p. 5).
Businesses anticipating that future in the strategic choices they make today are
more likely to thrive and unlock the opportunities that a more environmentally
stable and socially inclusive planet can bring.

6.1
WASH and
health linkages

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is crucial for human health and well-being. Global
data show that on average, progress needs to be four times faster to meet the promise on
safely managed WASH for all by 2030 (WHO/UNICEF, 2020a; 2021a; WHO/UNICEF/World
Bank, 2022). WASH and health partnerships are needed to accelerate progress on WASH, and
in turn accelerate progress on WASH-related health goals. While there is interdependence
between the WASH and health sectors, there are also gaps in coordination and governance
stemming from the fact that these sectors are led by different ministries, local authorities,
international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector
actors at all levels. Both areas comprise different disciplines, practitioners, funding
streams and institutional arrangements. Therefore, partnerships between WASH and health
stakeholders, particularly those that work at the key intersection points as elaborated below,
are necessary to optimize and accelerate positive health outcomes, especially among the
most vulnerable. As shown in Table 6.1, in 2019, 1.4 million deaths and 74 million disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to inadequate WASH globally.
Historically, many health programmes have focused on curative strategies for disease control,
such as medication and surgery. However, sustained and cost-effective disease control has
proved difficult or impossible without addressing the root causes of disease transmission by
preventing, rather that treating, diseases though better WASH services. Partnerships among
WASH actors for health outcomes, and between WASH and health programmes, have proven to
be an important tool to drive and hold WASH-related diseases down.

For WASH–health partnerships to be successful, they need alignment at the scientific and
strategic level, and efficiencies at the operational level to allow for focus and meaningful
collaboration. Figure 6.1 outlines core functions of the health section in WASH.
Similarly, health sector stakeholders concerned with issues in Figure 6.2 have reasons to
engage and partner with WASH.
The definition of health extends beyond the absence of disease to also encompass human
well-being, which WASH impacts as well. As shown in Figure 6.3, WASH affects antimicrobial
resistance (AMR), safety and mental health, food safety and decent work. Working with the
health sector is key for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 on health. New
health risks are emerging from exposure to contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in
water, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial and household chemicals, personal care products,
pesticides and manufactured nanomaterials.

6.2
Priority WASH
and health
partnerships

Partnerships addressing WASH and health can be found among actors within the WASH
sector, as well as among actors working in other sectors. This section highlights some
priority WASH partnerships with health actors, focusing on the nature of the partnership and
some of the main guiding strategies and tools, complemented with examples of challenges
and successes of the partnerships in accelerating change and driving down diseases. All
examples given cover major partnerships with collaboration at global, regional and local
scales among international organizations, governments, NGOs, private sector actors and
citizens, all with strong local leadership.

6.2.1 WASH in health care facilities

For WASH–health
partnerships to be
successful, they
need alignment at
the scientific and
strategic level, and
efficiencies at the
operational level
to allow for focus
and meaningful
collaboration

Fully functioning WASH services in health care facilities (encompassing facilities of all sizes,
such as hospitals, in- and out-patient health centres, and clinics) are critical to delivery of
safe quality care and for effectively responding to outbreaks and pandemics, including
COVID-19. Such services are also essential for creating an environment that supports dignity,
equity and human rights, especially for mothers, newborns, children and care providers.
Shockingly, major gaps in basic WASH still exist, with 1.8 billion people using health care
facilities that lack basic water services and 780 million using facilities with no toilets globally
in 2021 (WHO/UNICEF, 2022). The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed gaps in these basic
services but also drew attention to the need for greater support for WASH in all settings.
A recent price-tag analysis led by the World Health Organization (WHO) also found that costs
required to ensure universal access to WASH in health care facilities in least developed
countries is modest (US$6.5–9.6 billion over 10 years) compared to existing government
health and WASH spending (Chaitkin et al., 2022).
The provision of WASH in health care facilities is a health sector responsibility. However,
until recently it was neglected due to health actors either not accepting the role, not knowing
how to develop and maintain WASH services, or being overwhelmed with curative tasks.
Partnership with WASH was needed to accelerate and guide progress.
WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) lead global efforts with global national
and local health and WASH partners on WASH and health care facilities, and are working
to improve the situation through three main pillars of work: (i) Global leadership, advocacy
and knowledge exchange;24 (ii) Technical support, tools25 and country capacity-building; and
(iii) Monitoring and accountability of country actions26 in line with commitments made in the
2019 World Health Assembly Resolution on WASH in health care facilities. In addition, the
WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) provides robust data on WASH services in
health care facilities27 through their data portal and regular reports.
In 2022, a particular focus was given to supporting national WASH and health system actors
to unlock key bottlenecks particularly relating to budgets and financing. Focus was also given
to further integrate WASH into health systems and quality of care efforts through the Global
WASH in Health Care Facility Taskforce and an updated Water and Sanitation for Health
Facility Improvement Tool (WASH FIT) package.28 Over 40 countries are already using WASH
FIT and the new, state-of-the-art package will support existing and new facility improvement
efforts to address climate resilience, environmental sustainability, gender and equity as part
of incremental, risk-based WASH and waste improvements.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

While there has been success in conducting situational analyses, updating standards and
setting baselines, with more than 60% of countries reporting progress on these actions,
development and implementation of costed country roadmaps and integration of WASH into
health systems monitoring and budgeting is still far from optimal (less than 30% of countries)
(WHO/UNICEF, 2020b; 2022). Countries like Ghana, Indonesia and the Philippines provide
important examples of how developing and implementing national roadmaps, rolling out
WASH FIT nationally, and integrating and regularly monitoring WASH in health care facilities
as part of wider universal health coverage efforts can be done (WHO/UNICEF, 2020b). Further
examples and continued advocacy and leadership at every level are needed to support more
widespread and sustainable uptake of this work by the health sector.

6.2.2 Neglected tropical diseases
WASH is critical in the prevention and management of many neglected tropical diseases
(NTDs) scheduled for intensified control, elimination or eradication by 2030 under the
global NTD roadmap. Sanitation in particular plays a key role in preventing diseases such
as soil-transmitted helminth infections, schistosomiasis or trachoma, while safe water and
hygienic conditions in health facilities and in homes are essential for the management and
care of many NTDs (WHO, 2020). Partnerships on WASH are essential to prevent NTDs that
are close to elimination from bouncing back when treatment interventions, such as mass
drug administration, are eventually scaled back.
The WASH and NTDs partnership includes WHO and its Member States, academia,
donors, NGOs (spearheaded by the NGO Network on NTDs (NNN)29 ) and pharmaceutical
companies donating medications for treatment of some NTDs. In 2015, the partnership
was strengthened with the WASH and NTD Strategy 2015–2020 to guide cross-sectoral
collaboration, and for the first time the new 2021–2030 NTD roadmap included specific
WASH-related targets to incentivize collaborative action along with an updated WASH
and NTD strategy (WHO, 2021a; Boisson et al., 2021). Translating a will to collaborate into
concrete action requires tools and sustained effort. The WASH and Health Working Together
toolkit developed by the NNN with WHO provides tools and a forum to support sustained
collaboration (NNN/WHO, 2019).
Phenomenal global progress has been made on the elimination of Guinea worm (or
dracunculiasis). Dracunculiasis decreased from an estimated 3.5 million cases in
20 countries in the mid-1980s to just 15 human cases in 2021, driven largely by WASH
interventions (WHO, 2022a). Sustained partnerships over this period with health surveillance
authorities and clinics enabled targeted support for safe drinking water, using filters to
remove worm larvae. Follow-up and care were provided to infected people to ensure wounds
would not recontaminate water bodies.
Similarly, the number of people living in districts in which trachoma is a public health
problem dropped from 1,517 million in 2002 to 125 million in June 2022 (WHO, 2021b) under
the SAFE strategy 30 in which the ‘F’ and ‘E’ components cover facial cleanliness and an
excreta-free environment (specifically improved access to water and sanitation).

6.2.3 Cholera
In 2015, it was estimated that annually there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cholera cases, affecting
69 countries across the globe (Ali et al., 2015). Cholera continues to disproportionately
affect the world’s poorest and most vulnerable communities, often occurring in ‘hotspots’
where access to safely managed water and sanitation is limited. The Global Taskforce
on Cholera Control31 is a collaboration of over 30 WASH and health organizations that
seeks to end cholera through a multisectoral approach that includes vaccination, WASH
and cholera treatment delivered via coordinated leadership and community engagement.
There are a number of tools that guide this work, including frameworks for developing
national cholera prevention and control plans, WASH and infection and prevention control
standards for cholera in health care facilities, and outbreak response manuals. A number
of working groups are developing technical products to support the vaccination, WASH and
treatment elements of the partnership, and documenting their implementation.

WASH is critical
in the prevention
and management
of many neglected
tropical diseases
(NTDs)

While cholera deaths have reduced from a peak of almost 1 in 20 cases in the mid-1990s
to less than 1 in 500 in 2020, global case numbers have risen dramatically in the past
5–10 years, indicating that global treatment responses are improving while preventive
measures are not (WHO, 2021c). This trend indicates that the goals of the global cholera
roadmap32 to eliminate cholera by 2030 in up to 20 countries will be difficult to reach without
substantial improvements in WASH services. Vaccination has been used effectively in
hotspot locations, but without sustained WASH improvements the disease can easily return
as immunity wanes over time. Success in eliminating cholera will require sustained and
concerted national efforts to extend and prioritize WASH services to those most in need, in
order to address the root causes of outbreaks – and in doing so, such efforts also address
key issues around equity, human rights and prevention of other waterborne diseases.

6.2.4 Antimicrobial resistance
The world is facing a crisis of AMR, meaning that infections that have been easily treatable
since the scientific discovery of antibiotics less than 100 years ago could once again kill.
The pipeline of new antimicrobials has all but dried up, and urgent solutions to tackle
AMR are needed from a wide range of stakeholders such as policy-makers, engineers and
scientists, health care professionals, veterinarians, farmers, donors, NGOs, and private
citizens and corporations. Everyone has a role to play (FAO/OIE/WHO, 2020).
Wastewater effluent from all sources including communities, health facilities, plant
and animal production, and antimicrobial manufacturing are increasingly recognized
as critical components in the fight against AMR. Safe WASH limits the avoidable use of
antimicrobials for WASH-preventable infections. Treatment of wastewater from all sectors
limits the emergence and spread of AMR in water and soil that has been polluted with
untreated wastewater and sludge (FAO/OIE/WHO, 2020; UNEP, 2022).
The response to the AMR crisis has been spearheaded through the One-Health global
action plan on antimicrobial resistance (WHO, 2015), developed by WHO in a close
tripartite collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). This global action plan was
formally endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2016 and the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) joined in 2022 to more fully embrace the
One-Health approach encompassing human, animal and ecological health. A central task
of the quadripartite is to support the development and implementation of national policies
and actions plans (NAPs) that mobilize national and local-level governments, industry and
private sector partners around investments to combat AMR in all sectors.

awareness weeks, they have succeeded in raising the profile of environmental dimensions
of AMR and the role of the water and waste management across sectors. However, a
key challenge remains that the role of WASH and wastewater management are not well
understood or well represented in NAPs – the important roles of WASH and wastewater
management are often not addressed, or the proposed actions do not align with the major
AMR risks within national contexts.

6.2.5 Nutrition
The three principal underlying causes of undernutrition are unsuitable or insufficient
food intake, poor care practices and disease. These are directly or indirectly related
to inadequate access to WASH. Partnerships between WASH and nutrition actors can
deliver significant synergies. For example, WASH programmes, often implemented at
scale, can enhance the coverage and effectiveness of nutrition interventions to reduce the
malnutrition and stunting that affect 22% or 149 million children under the age of five years
globally according to estimates for 2020 (WHO, 2021d).
One important global partnership between WASH and nutrition is that between the Scale
Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement33 and Sanitation and Water for All (SWA).34 This partnership
was created in response to recommendations for cross-sectoral collaboration on new
analyses, tools, evidence, funding and commitments from the landmark 2015 international
Bonn WASH Nutrition Forum.35 SUN and SWA collaboration focuses on three thematic
areas, namely joint advocacy, good practices and research, encapsulated in the joint
WASH–nutrition narrative (SWA/SUN, n.d.).
While there is no question about the critical role played by environmental health in shaping
children’s nutritional outcomes, difficulties in quantifying the impact of WASH on nutrition
have sometimes challenged cross-sectoral programmatic collaboration. Most significantly,
a series of studies published in 2018–2019 investigating this relationship showed
little or no impact of selected WASH interventions on reducing childhood diarrhoea or
stunting (Null et al., 2018; Luby et al., 2018; Humphrey et al., 2019; Cumming et al., 2019).
The implications of these studies were not always clearly articulated, prompting doubt
among some practitioners, researchers and funders on the value of WASH investment for
improved nutrition. Strong partnerships and constructive interaction across sectors play
a vital role in ensuring the evidence base and its limitations are well understood, creating
dialogue on the myriad benefits of co-programming beyond health impacts, and ensuring
that co-programming becomes more effective (WHO/UNICEF, 2019).

6.2.6 Food safety
Safe water for irrigation, food processing and food hygiene in homes and restaurants is
an essential part of protecting human health in food systems, along with risk reduction
measures at the farm (e.g. selection of high-growing crops36 or crops eaten cooked).

Safe WASH limits
the avoidable use
of antimicrobials
for WASHpreventable
infections

The FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarium38 is the primary international partnership on food
safety. Codex fosters consumer trust in the safety and quality of food products by
developing international food standards, guidelines and codes of practice for the safety,
quality and fairness of food trade. Common risk assessments underpinning global
guideline values for chemicals in food and drinking water, including bottled water, form
an important aspect of the partnership between the drinking water quality guideline
developers, the WASH sector and Codex (WHO, 2022b). Codex and wider partnerships
with the agricultural sector also exist for irrigation and food processing water quality.
However, developing partnerships to ensure the safe use of wastewater (both formal and
informal use) in agriculture and aquaculture continues to be a significant challenge, due
to the highly multisectoral nature of the topic and the gaps in institutional responsibilities,
particularly for informal reuse (WHO, 2006; 2016). Stronger collaboration is needed
between the water, agricultural and health sectors to develop coherent policy, standards
and implementation approaches as demand for wastewater use grows with demands
for fresh produce near expanding urban centres, while water scarcity increases due to
climate change.

6.2.7 Pandemics and public health emergencies
Experiences with recent and ongoing public health emergencies, including COVID-19,
Ebola, Zika and cholera outbreaks, highlight the centrality of WASH in preparedness,
readiness, response and recovery efforts. WASH services are needed to help prevent
infections of health care workers and patients within health care settings, to allow
schools and workplaces to operate more safely, and to help protect communities and
families from infections.
While the role of WASH in preventing COVID-19 (including hand hygiene, water supply to
enable hand hygiene, and essential water and sanitation services to enable stay-at-home
and distancing measures) is indisputable, WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response
Plans did not comprehensively address or monitor WASH, and initial investments went
disproportionally to other pillars of the response.
Increasingly, though, COVID-19 efforts are being leveraged to strengthen policies,
regulations and investments in WASH. The recently established WASH in Public Health
Emergency Working Group, co-led by WHO and UNICEF, working with a wide range of
WASH and health emergency partners, seeks to consolidate guidance, to strategically
address gaps and to engage with health actors. Furthermore, guidance on key WASH
interventions for COVID-19 (WHO/UNICEF, 2020c) and more recently on environmental
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (WHO, 2022c) provide evidence-based
frameworks from which to take action. COVID-19 exposed the particular lack of
investment and services around safe health care waste management (WHO, 2022d).
This work can no longer just focus on segregation and safe treatment, but must address
the entire waste management chain, including reducing procurement of non-essential
personal protective equipment (PPE), seeking products with less and biobased packaging
and components, and supporting safe reusable PPE as well as recycling and reverse
logistics. Such efforts also align with the new framework that is being put in place to

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

support countries in implementing the commitments on low-carbon and sustainable health
systems that were established at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Many countries leveraged COVID-19 financing and attention to improve WASH. For example,
in Lao PDR, since 2020, the Ministry of Health has mobilized over US$2 million nationally
to implement national green and climate-resilient WASH and energy standards in 62 health
care facilities (WASH in Health Care Facilities, n.d.). Funds supported procuring autoclaves,
water tanks, hand hygiene stations and other infrastructure as well as to run WASH FIT
trainings and deliver ongoing supportive supervision. During a 2021 cholera outbreak in
Niger, where increasing terrorist threats and growing food insecurity threatened many
households, the work on emergency WASH focused on health care facilities. In response,
a national taskforce was established led by the Ministry of Health and involving key WASH
and health partners. The WASH FIT roll-out began nationally and efforts focused on cholera
hotspots and engaged local community leadership and women’s groups to support best
hygiene practices and to sustain WASH improvements in health care facilities.
The number of individuals affected by emergencies, encompassing both disasters caused
by natural hazards and conflict, is unlikely to decrease in the foreseeable future. Thus,
there will be a continued need to implement WASH interventions that are sustainable, that
result in health and well-being benefits, and for which there is strong local engagement,
understanding and leadership.

6.2.8 Hygiene for disease prevention

Safe water for
irrigation, food
processing and
food hygiene
in homes and
restaurants is an
essential part of
protecting human
health in food
systems

Hand hygiene is critical to preventing the transmission of infectious diseases. The
COVID-19 pandemic highlighted insufficient global coverage of hand hygiene in lowand middle-income countries, persistent lack of political prioritization and chronic
underinvestment. Against this backdrop, and given the cross-sectoral nature of the
challenge, new collaborative initiatives emerged, including the Hand Hygiene for All global
initiative (HH4A) (WHO/UNICEF, 2020d). Launched in June 2020, HH4A aims to work
with diverse actors to embed and elevate hand hygiene within existing policies, plans
and budgets across relevant sectors, and to support their implementation. It is jointly led
by UNICEF and WHO in partnership with international partners, national governments,
public and private sectors, and civil society. Core partners include the World Bank, SWA,
the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),
the International Labour Organization (ILO), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine/Hygiene Hub, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), the Global Handwashing Partnership and WaterAid.
Other important partnerships include:
• The Hand Hygiene Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC), 39
• The Hand Hygiene Market Accelerator (HHMA), 40 and
• The longstanding Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP).41
Successes of these partnerships can be seen from the country to the global level. Over
60 national governments have been supported by HH4A partners to develop fully costed
roadmaps for universal hygiene coverage. Notable regional efforts include a hygiene

strategy for Southern Africa (SADC, 2021) led by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), and the ‘Hand Hygiene for South Asia’ 42 partnership (KlaesenerMetzner and Cavill, 2022). At the global level, partnerships facilitate co-developed tools to
support country action, such as for example a country costing tool (WHO/UNICEF, 2021b),
as well as advocacy efforts of unprecedented scale. A successful example of this is Global
Handwashing Day,43 coordinated each year by GHP. In 2020, the HH4A partnership brought
together the individual efforts of veteran hand hygiene champions to equal more than the
sum of their parts, securing high-level political commitment44 and more than doubling the
social media reach of 2019.

6.2.9 Wastewater monitoring for disease surveillance
Wastewater surveillance can play an important complementary role to diagnostic testing by
providing additional evidence to inform disease surveillance and management. An important
benefit is that samples from wastewater generate population level data on disease trends
that are not susceptible to biases inherent in diagnostic testing. These data can provide
valuable insights to public health decision-makers, such as: early warning of increasing cases
(including asymptomatic cases); hotspots where testing services and behaviour change
interventions should be targeted; vulnerable or isolated communities and events; and known
and novel disease variants, among others.
The global polio eradication programme is a well-established form of a health partnership
(with wastewater laboratories) using wastewater surveillance as part of a wider surveillance
and control approach. Wastewater is monitored for early detection of an outbreak and
confirmation of the absence of circulation of wild-type and vaccine-derived poliovirus in a
population (WHO, 2003). It is also used in typhoid surveillance (WHO, 2018), at pilot scale for
monitoring antimicrobial resistance (WHO, 2021e) and for monitoring illicit drug use, and has
also been rapidly scaled up in many settings for COVID-19 (WHO, 2022c).

6.3
Emerging areas
for partnerships
for WASH and
health

In addition to the partnerships for WASH and health previously described, working together is
also crucial for the following areas.

6.3.1 Climate Change
Climate change is leading to shifting WASH-related health risks – particularly for
mosquito-borne diseases where larvae breed in water containers and uncontained
wastewater. Collaboration between and within institutions needs to be strengthened to
integrate disaster and climate risk management into national policies and practices. This
would include the clear identification of climate-related risks, the design of specific risk
reduction measures and an improved and routine use of climate risk information by planners,
engineers and other decision-makers. Protection of human health often depends on efforts
by other sectors, such as food and agriculture, energy and urban planning. The active
involvement of these sectors in National Adaptation Plans would make them more effective.
Another reason for stronger inter-sector collaboration concerns the implementation of
climate-resilient water and sanitation safety plans, as many teams from the health sector
lack the necessary climate and hydrological experience to access climate data and expertise.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Climate change has already started influencing the transmission and spread of vector-borne
diseases, and its impacts are likely to worsen (Rocklöv and Dubrow, 2020). In response to
mosquito/vector-borne disease, new partnerships with climate specialists are needed to
better understand how the spatial distribution of vectors (e.g. warmer climates, which are
wetter further north and south of the equator) is evolving, and to update WASH strategies for
vector control amid this new reality.

6.3.2 Contaminants of emerging concern

Wastewater
surveillance can
play an important
complementary
role to diagnostic
testing by
providing
additional
evidence to
inform disease
surveillance and
management

Chemical pollution in freshwater and drinking water is a threat to human health across
the globe (Fuller et al., 2022). CECs are drivers of AMR and several diseases induced by
endocrine disruption (Kahn et al., 2020). Partnerships across policy domains that address the
life cycle of harmful products and substances are essential to reduce water pollution in order
to safeguard human health and aquatic ecosystems. This includes promoting policies on
chemical safety, public health, agriculture and food, environment, industry, trade, and waste
management (including pharmaceutical disposal) (OECD, 2019; forthcoming). The scientific
community has an important role to play in partnerships by developing and promoting
state-of-the-art knowledge on the complexities of chemical pollution impacts and potential
responses (Brack et al., 2022). Partnerships and coordination between pharmaceutical
companies, consumers (patients and agriculture), health care actors (doctors, hospitals,
pharmacies) and governments across the life cycle of pharmaceuticals are the most effective
approach (OECD, 2019).
Partnerships between the public sector and industry are increasingly established to minimize
pollution at source or to finance mitigation measures (OECD, 2022). For example, Extended
Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes transfer the responsibility of environmental impacts
of harmful products to the manufacturer. The manufacturer can respond by switching to
a less harmful product design, or by financially contributing to, for example, wastewater
treatment infrastructure that is needed to break down harmful substances.

6.3.3 Mental health and well-being
While the connections between WASH and physical health are well established, the
relationship between water and mental health is considerably less well known, and causal
relationships between water and mental ill health are difficult to empirically confirm (Wutich
et al., 2020). This knowledge gap could be addressed though productive collaboration
between the WASH sector and the mental health care community. One option would be to
build upon the research and experiences concerning ‘ecological grief’ and ‘climate anxiety’
(Nagabhatla et al., 2021; Okamoto and Nagabhatla, 2022).

6.3.4 Labour
Workers in the water sector around the world provide an essential public service. Yet,
these services all too often come at the cost of the health, safety and dignity of workers,
particularly in sanitation – as workers doing toilet cleaning (predominantly women),
faecal sludge management and sewer cleaning (predominantly men) are among the most
vulnerable workers (World Bank/ILO/WaterAid/WHO, 2019). Their jobs often exist in an
informal economy without basic labour protection or rights, and many are consigned to this
work though religion or class and face stigma. Many more workers are needed to achieve
SDG 6. Partnerships with labour movements are needed to ensure that workers’ rights are
recognized, and that their working conditions are improved and progressively formalized to
safeguard health and decent working conditions, as called for by SDG 8.

6.4
Lessons learned
and ways forward

Partnerships for WASH and health are diverse and address a wide range of topics. While
there have been some successes, collaboration also comes with challenges. It is known that
safe WASH is a prerequisite to health, but the health sector often neglects prevention and
instead focuses on clinical diagnosis and care, vaccines and medicines. On the other hand,
the WASH sector faces pressures and timescales of achieving and sustaining safe water and
sanitation services for all, which will ultimately deliver health benefits, but it may not prioritize
health objectives directly in planning and delivery of services.
NTD efforts failed to sustainably eliminate disease in unsanitary environments, despite
cheap and effective mass drug administration. Cholera, rotavirus, polio and typhoid all have
vaccines, but are often lacking the WASH component to effectively sustain disease control
and prevent reemergence of outbreaks. Attempts at partnership have clearly been made,
but often actors have struggled to organize themselves to optimum effect, in part due to
entrenched structures of funding, competing incentives, as well as varied implementation
structures and institutional arrangements.
The world is facing serious, emerging challenges such as AMR, increases in zoonotic
diseases, pollution by CECs and magnified climate risks. To address these challenges,
continued and new partnership among the WASH and health sector will be critical to
accelerate progress in existing areas of collaboration and to effectively face new challenges.
Moreover, emerging challenges are in need of bold partnerships extending to other sectors,
including environment, chemical safety, agriculture, industry, food safety and trade.

7.1
Introduction

To advance on sustainable development and climate action, a number of global frameworks
have been adopted. These include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and
its specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 and 13, to ensure availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and to take urgent action to
combat climate change and its impacts, respectively. The Paris Agreement on climate
change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 have also set
ambitious climate-related goals and targets. These agreements can, in many ways, be
considered as a ‘partnership’ among countries.
While those distinct frameworks exist, recent analysis shows how governments increasingly
recognize that action to address climate change is inseparable from delivering the SDGs
to eradicate poverty and hunger and reduce inequality (UNDP/UNFCCC, 2019). The
same analysis concludes also that through those frameworks the private sector, cities,
regions, investors, civil society and other stakeholders have all become more involved in
cross-sectoral solutions to climate change.

Mitigation derived

radar of countries
when they make
commitments
to reduce the
emissions of
greenhouse gases

Water has been recognized as the ‘climate connector’ that allows for greater collaboration
and coordination across the majority of targets of the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement
and the Sendai Framework (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020). Recently, the first global stocktake
of commitments made by Parties to the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2022) indicates that
more than 80% of countries are reporting freshwater resources as an adaptation priority
area. In relation to mitigation, the stocktake reveals that opportunities derived from
water and sanitation management are not comprehensively on the radar of countries
when they make commitments to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, signaling
an area where stronger cooperation and partnerships between the climate and water
communities is needed.
However, in order to begin to strengthen such cooperation, it is essential to develop a
clear understanding of who makes up these ‘communities’ and how they differ from one
another. For example, water is a manageable, ecosystem-based resource that ultimately
provides services to humankind. Its stakeholders are largely comprised of users and
practitioners, working under various water-related institutions and governance structures,
whose objective is to maximize these services whilst protecting the resource for future
generations. Climate change, on the other hand, is a process or a phenomenon (many might
say, a ‘crisis’). Its stakeholders are heavily science-oriented, primarily concerned with either
addressing the causes of climate change (mitigation) or dealing with its impacts (adaption).
Despite such broad distinctions, the two domains also share several commonalities.
For example, water and climate change both directly impact upon, and are impacted by,
agricultural practices and food security, energy production, ecosystems, industry, and a
plethora of other ‘sectors’, such that both are implicitly ‘cross-sectoral’ in nature. Furthermore,
given the all-too-often different political frameworks through which they are managed and/or
addressed (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020), it can become quite difficult, if not impossible, to
clearly define exactly which stakeholders belong to which discrete community.
While cross-sectoral climate change policies and plans, led by climate stakeholders such as
ministries of environment, and centred on national priorities, have the potential to unleash
investment into low-carbon and climate-resilient development, the institutional, political and
economic environment for implementing these policies and plans is complex (Cooke et al.,
2018). Key identified bottlenecks for implementation of agreed climate priorities include lack
of: integration with existing national development policy and planning (sector-driven); access
to reliable information and data; clear financing plans; and political will (UNDP/UNFCCC, 2019).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Water governance adds a complexity layer to the effective implementation of climate-related
water priorities, as it is characterized by a wide diversity of policy areas and stakeholders,
decentralized water policy-making, a sectoral fragmentation of water-related tasks across
ministries and public agencies, a diversity of actors involved in water policy-making, and
policy-makers facing conflicting objectives (OECD, 2011). Addressing those bottlenecks
through effective climate and water partnership and collaboration represents an opportunity
to safeguard sustainable and climate-resilient development. While good examples start to
emerge, surely there is need and scope for stronger partnerships and cooperation between
the climate and water stakeholders.

7.2
Water and
climate
stakeholders

Everyone is a climate change stakeholder. Climate change touches upon all aspects
of society. Yet, distinct frameworks exist for climate and sustainable development
planning, and distinct stakeholders manage climate and water-driven policy and
strategy. For example, at the country level, ministries of environment and climate change
departments are responsible for climate planning and for reporting commitments made
as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), while
departments of water resources services, oftentimes part of different ministries, look after
water development policies and strategies.
Accelerating action through partnerships and cooperation between water and climate
stakeholders can create additional benefits to freshwater ecosystems and to the most
exposed and vulnerable people, reducing disaster risks, delivering cost savings, job creation
and economic opportunities.
This requires improving existing partnerships and in some cases forging new ones at all
levels, from local, national, basin to global, and is usually best accomplished through multistakeholder processes (OECD, 2015). Research and learning institutions, the private sector,
and civil society, including youth, women and marginalized groups, play a key role and
support efforts to underpin effective government leadership and action. Working together
on water resource management, water and sanitation service delivery, as well as health,
inclusion, food and energy, can broaden benefits from climate mitigation and adaptation
efforts. Such an approach also presents opportunities to further engage and align
commitments, with a view to strengthening mutual accountability. The five ‘accelerators’ of
capacity, financing, innovation, data/information, and governance under the SDG6 Global
Acceleration Framework (UN-Water, 2020) each have a critical role to play in water–climate
partnerships and cooperation, and have the potential to contribute to progress across
the 2030 Agenda and towards the climate resilience of communities, ecosystems and
production systems.
While climate change and water partnerships are de facto ‘extra-sectorial’, the following
three subsections highlight examples of water and climate partnerships and collaboration
at different working levels, engaging different stakeholders, and progressing through
different ‘accelerators’.
The sections on the ‘intra-sectoral’ and ‘cross-sectoral’ dimensions of partnerships and
collaboration focus on how climate action is a trigger to foster and strengthen collaboration,
first within the water community, and then within water and other natural resources
management areas. After that, the section on ‘extra-sectoral’ collaboration highlights instead
the opportunities that water brings to climate-led processes and therefore to partnerships
and collaborations from this other angle.

7.3
Intra-sectoral
approaches

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) most updated reports released
in 2021 and 2022 (IPCC, 2021; 2022) confirm that climate change has already altered
freshwater ecosystems, leading to diverse adverse impacts on human systems. This
highlights, from a water intra-sectoral perspective and a climate angle, the connection and
interdependence between water resources management (WRM) and the provision of basic
services such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
While such interconnection is clear, “enabling effective and adaptive collaboration between
water resources and WASH actors is challenged by conflicting mandates, differences in
management scales, financial constraints, and the lack of engagement platforms” (Mahayni
et. al., 2021, p. 2).

The opportunities
that the water
(and sanitation)
sector represent
for emission
reductions deserve
greater attention
from climate
planners and
should open the
door to further
collaboration with
water stakeholders

Climate planning processes and disaster management can facilitate such engagement
and collaboration. Indeed, ensuring continuity of WASH services during climate-related
shocks requires the assessment, design, construction and operation of drinking water and
sanitation services that have factored in potential changes in water resources quantity and
quality caused by climate hazards and stresses, such as drought or flooding. This includes
considering the direct impacts they may have on service disruption through infrastructural
damage (e.g. caused by flooding) and also the impact that climate hazards (e.g. drought)
may have in terms of rendering the service temporarily or permanently non-functional. In
fact, ensuring continuity of WASH services to withstand climate stresses goes beyond just
structural measures and involves joint WRM–WASH cooperation (UNDP/SIWI/UNICEF,
forthcoming).45 The following three approaches can create opportunities where climate
action can strengthen collaborations and partnerships between water resource managers
and water/sanitation service providers:
1. Bottom-up water resilience approaches
The Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis (CRIDA) uses stakeholder engagements
at each step of the process to identify multidisciplinary challenges in a target area,
and to identify those adaptation actions that provide co-benefits for other sectors
simultaneously. This allows, for example, prioritizing nature-based solutions (NBS) when
addressing challenges to water security, by focusing not only on the direct impact of water
resources, but also on the environmental secondary impacts of proposed solutions. The
active engagement of stakeholders and partnerships throughout the process steers the
multidisciplinary decision-making and ensures that positive impacts are achieved across
sectors and interest groups (UNESCO/ICIWaRM, 2018).
2. Water safety planning for climate resilience
As availability of freshwater is under increasing threat from climate change, water safety
planning is one risk management-based approach for managing both water availability
and water quality risks to safe drinking water services. Integration of climate risks
and water resources in a water safety plan (WSP) starts with ensuring that the team
established to lead the development and ongoing implementation of the plan has sought
additional expertise from water resources and climate experts, in addition to WASH
experts. Subsequently, some of the key steps where WRM–WASH cooperation should
occur in the development and implementation of the WSP include: (1) adding water
resources characteristics (past, present, future) when describing the water supply system
and factoring in competing demands of other water resources user groups; (2) considering
the strategic risks posed by source water scarcity and quality as part of the climate
hazard and risk assessment; and (3) identify and jointly implement WRM-related control
measures to mitigate climate risks (WHO, 2017).

3. City Water Resilience Approach
“Urban water issues are complex, involving overlapping and interconnected systems and
diverse sets of actors. Water services are shaped by financial and political considerations,
affected by urban growth, land use planning and environmental management. Given the nature
of these relationships, planning for water resilience is neither simple nor straightforward.
The City Water Resilience Approach helps cities build the capacity of urban water systems to
endure, adapt and transform in the face of new challenges for the benefit of all city residents.
It has been developed to [bring together and] guide decisions by a range of stakeholders
including government, private sector, academic and civil society actors. Ultimately, the
approach will inform how water programmes and projects are planned, designed, delivered
and operated to improve outcomes” (ARUP, 2019, p. 8).
The Boxes 7.1 and 7.2 provide examples of climate adaptation triggering WRM–WASH Cooperation.

7.4
Cross-sectoral
approaches

The cross-sectoral nature and interdependence of water and climate change with other vital
natural resources, such as land or energy, creates further opportunities for partnership and
cooperation. For example, food security is affected by the impacts of climate change on water,
including food production, transportation, processing, access, use and price stability (Porter
et.al., 2014). Furthermore, water management is critical for the necessary transformation of
food systems (Uhlenbrook et al., 2022). Water is also required for nearly all production and
conversion processes in the energy sector, including fuel extraction and processing (fossil and
nuclear fuels as well as biofuels) and electricity generation (thermoelectric, hydropower and
renewable technologies) (WWAP, 2014).

Box 7.1 Applying water safety planning for climate resilience in Nepal
Climate change-related hazardous events in Nepal include increased
precipitation intensity and variability and decreased water flows, both
of which have an impact on the availability and quality of water supply.
Over the last few years, climate-resilient water safety plans (WSPs)
have been piloted in five water supply systems. Some modification
to the WSP process has been introduced, whereby a climate change
expert (or person with knowledge of climate change) is included in
WSP teams. The hazard identification and risk assessment now include
consideration of climatic hazards and control measures that are
sensitive to climate change and extreme weather events at the basin
level. WSP teams are encouraged to tap into the opportunities available
in their local areas for engagement with other stakeholders, including
health officers and local experts. For example, the climate-resilient WSP
in Barchour Ranipani (Tanahun) initially had the usual control measure
of a diversion channel above the intake to protect against contamination
of the source water through the upstream irrigation channel during the
rainy season. However, considering climate risks such as landslides
and floods related to extreme weather conditions, and strengthening
collaboration with water resource managers at basin level, major control
measures now include catchment protection to control soil erosion and
divert floodwater during rainfall events; improved wellhead protection;
installation of deep-set tube wells; and water conservation and protection
of local or alternative sources, including awareness campaigns to
conserve, reuse and recycle water.

These dependencies result in
increasing competition of resources
and challenge their management.
Transformative action is thus required
to accelerate progress towards
achieving SDG 6 in connection with
all other SDGs, including on climate
action. This cannot happen without
urgently strengthening broader
cooperation between water, land, food
and energy actors.
Several approaches have been
proposed, including integrated water
resources management (IWRM), and
more recently, the water–energy–
food (WEF) security nexus (Liu et al.,
2017; Heal et al., 2021). While these
approaches should be drivers for
cross-sectoral partnerships, there
are challenges related to putting
into place the necessary governance
structures needed for an integrated
management of resources. There are
also operational problems in enacting
the various management instruments
required, leading to investments in
water, energy and food infrastructure
being made separately, sacrificing

Box 7.2 Drought-induced collaboration of water
managers and service providers in Cape Town
Cape Town’s dominant water crisis over the
last years has caused the extreme multi-year
drought that confronted the city and its people.
It is a remarkable achievement that a city of over
four million was able to reduce its collective
consumption by approximately 50% in a short
period of time, in order to avoid ‘Day Zero’.
The City Water Resilience Approach (CWRA)
responds to a demand for innovative processes
and tools as a response to climate change.
Through its application in Cape Town in 2019,
two assessment workshops engaged experts
from government, academia, civil society and
the private sector in round-table discussions
focusing on the city’s resilience to various water
challenges. Key recommendations were made
to ensure sustainable management of water
resources and water and sanitation services.
It was highlighted that improved collaboration
between the municipal, regional and national
spheres of government will be critical in
overcoming ongoing water shortages and
preventing future crises. While relationships
between government, the private sector and
civil society have improved since the height
of the drought crisis at the beginning of 2018,
efforts to sustain and improve coordination
must be maintained post-crisis. A key first
step agreed through the CWRA application
is to improve coordination around collecting,
managing and sharing data, including between
government agencies, and between the scientific
community and government. More needs to be
done as well to improve engagement with local
communities, to identify local partners and to
ensure that opportunities exist for residents to
provide meaningful input into decision-making
around water issues. It was highlighted that
initiatives that improve community engagement
can help inform decisions that account for the
holistic social, environmental and economic
costs and benefits of water programmes and
projects. Moving forward, the city will need to
extend its focus beyond water supply and extend
collaboration with stakeholders managing
wastewater, drainage and sanitation.

efficiencies and risking counterproductivity (McDonnell, 2008).
In relation to this, the UN-Water Policy Brief on Climate Change
and Water recommended that, when targeting multilateral,
bilateral and other sources of climate financing, stakeholders
should ensure that proposals bring together multiple water
considerations, including sanitation (and wastewater) and
hygiene, health, agriculture, energy and industry, and ecosystems
(UN-Water, 2019). Engaging climate stakeholders in the process
of managing natural resources creates opportunities for
synergistic partnerships and collaboration aimed at financing
resilient water, food and energy security interventions.
As both water and climate change know no borders, joint
adaptation to climate change and cooperation across
administrative boundaries (in domestic or transboundary)
river basins and aquifers represent two great opportunities for
cross-sector and cross-country collaboration in order to enable
the sharing of the costs and benefits of adaptation measures,
to ensure their optimal location in a river basin, and to avoid the
possible negative effects of unilateral adaptation or management
measures. Transboundary cooperation on adaptation and
mitigation of climate change can also bring additional benefits
in terms of conflict prevention, socio-economic development
and human well-being, and can even motivate transboundary
cooperation in other domains (UNECE/INBO, 2015).
A focus on climate adaptation can make transboundary
cooperation more effective and efficient, through increased
data-sharing, joint planning and the locating of measures where
they have the optimum effect (UNECE/INBO, 2015). Examples
include the International Commission for the Danube River
Basin that developed and later updated a basin-wide adaptation
strategy that has supported basin countries in their own
adaptation planning (UNECE, 2022). The Niger Basin authority
has secured the first transboundary adaptation programme from
the Green Climate Fund, which includes also implementation of
national and local adaptation measures (Green Climate Fund,
n.d.). There is now a rich and specialized literature providing
other examples of best practices, tools and methodologies
for cooperation between water and climate stakeholders at
basin scale (Rieu-Clarke et al., 2015; UNECE/INBO, 2015; World
Bank, 2019). The Task Force on Water and Climate under
the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary
Rivers and International Lakes and the global network of
basins managed jointly with the International Network of Basin
Organizations (INBO) enable sharing of experiences and lessons
learned between transboundary basins.
The following case studies described in Boxes 7.3 and 7.4 focus
on strengthening collaborations and partnerships between water
resource and service managers on the one, and land, food and
energy actors on the other hand.

Box 7.3 Developing a climate financing
proposal for water and food security in
Zimbabwe
In Zimbabwe, climate change has
over the last decades contributed to a
decline in crop diversity, production and
productivity across the country. This
has caused decreasing food availability
to households, leading to malnutrition.
However, malnutrition is not only related
to decreased food availability; as it has
been estimated that roughly 50% of all
malnutrition is associated with inadequate
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
services (Prüss-Üstün et al., 2008).
While numerous actions have been taken
by the government and other entities
to address these challenges, many of
these have been implemented using
isolated and centralized approaches.
To address this, the Government of
Zimbabwe, with support of development
partners, is drafting a climate financing
proposal, using a consultative approach
with multiple national and subnational
stakeholders, in close collaboration
between the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture,
Fisheries, Water and Rural Development
and the climate financing-designated
authorities to the Green Climate Fund.
The overall objective of the proposal
is to strengthen the food and water
security of vulnerable communities under
changing climate conditions through an
integrated water resources management
(IWRM) approach. This will be achieved
by simultaneously enhancing agricultural
production through climate-smart
agriculture, and maximizing the impacts
of healthier food and improved health
practices and behaviours through resilient
WASH services.

This section highlights the opportunities that water brings
to climate-led processes in terms of partnerships and
collaborations. An important point of departure is that water
is not explicitly mentioned in the Paris Agreement on climate
change. However, closer analysis reveals to what extent the
achievement of the Paris Agreement goals is dependent on
water. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
2015–2030 includes a call to strengthen and implement global
mechanisms on hydrometeorological issues, and to raise
awareness and improve understanding of water-related disaster
risks and their impact on society (UN-Water, 2019).
Given water’s inherent centrality to achieve both climate and
sustainable development goals, stronger partnerships and
collaboration between the climate and water communities can
help to reinforce and strengthen state commitments to climate
change adaptation, mitigation, disaster risks reduction, as well
as strategies to address poverty and inequality.
In relation to mitigation, countries are expected to periodically
revisit and strengthen their nationally determined contributions
(NDCs) to align them with global temperature goals. The
opportunities that the water (and sanitation) sector represent
for emission reductions – ranging from biogas recovery from
wastewater treatment systems to geothermal power generation
(UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020) – deserve greater attention
from climate planners and should open the door to further
collaboration with water stakeholders. For example, wastewater
treatment and discharge directly account for 11.8% and 4.2%
of global CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively (Crippa et al.,
2019). In addition, drinking water and wastewater management
are responsible for approximately 4% of global electricity
consumption in 2014, often associated with indirect carbon
emissions (IEA, 2017).
Parties to the Paris Agreement are also expected to assess
progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and
enable its implementation. To advance on those fronts,
countries have been urged to complete their National
Adaptation Plans (NAPs).
Only through greater cooperation between climate and water
stakeholders can it be ensured that the untapped water- and
sanitation-related opportunities for mitigation are prioritized
in NDCs, that the adaptation needs of the water and sanitation
sector are included in NAPs, and that climate financing is
directed to support the implementation of these priorities.
Examples of existing platforms to foster such collaboration
include the Water and Climate Coalition, the Adaptation Action
Coalition, the Marrakesh Partnership, the COP Water Pavilion,
as well as the COP27 Flagship initiative Action for Water
Adaptation and Resilience (AWARE).
Boxes 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 describe specific cases where water
and climate actors work together towards stronger climate
planning processes.

Box 7.4 Lessons learned on transboundary basin cooperation regarding climate change and energy
in the Mekong River
The regional aspects of water resource management and energy production, particularly hydropower
development – a renewable source of electricity – lends itself very favourably to partnerships and
cooperation on water and climate change. This is highlighted in the Siem Reap Declaration adopted
by Prime Ministers of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) Member Countries on 5 April 2018: “[…]
The increasing development in the mainstream and tributaries highlight the need for the sustainable
and coordinated operational management of tributary and mainstream water resources development
projects.” Due to the intensity of hydropower development in the Mekong Basin mainstream and
tributaries, enhanced information-sharing and coordination of operations across cascades of
projects (with potentially different owners) is critical, and led to the development of a Mekong climate
change adaptation strategy and action plan later in 2018. This was important to optimize power
production, but also essential for the coordination of flood and drought mitigation and management,
sediment transmission during flushing operations, navigation, and riparian community safety.
National priorities for cascade operation may be linked to electricity market requirements. However,
the consequences of this form of operation may have commercial as well as environmental and
community safety implications, therefore extending the need for collaboration with environmental and
civil protection stakeholders. This is of particular concern in the transboundary context, where crossborder collaboration in the form of early warning systems and operational events (e.g. spillway gate
operations) are needed. These are issues that are already familiar to MRC Member Countries based
on past experience. Flood warning protocols are already well established but need to be strengthened
to include dam operations and related emergency response planning. Cooperation mechanisms
for information-sharing and a clear attribution of roles and responsibilities among the participating
projects and Member Countries are required. Proposals for a coordination and monitoring centre have
already been studied in Lao PDR. These concepts will need to be further expanded to ensure basinscale management and transboundary communication.

Conclusions

Climate and water are intrinsically linked and so are the climate change and
sustainable water development agendas. For these agendas to materialize, the
water and climate communities need to collaborate and strengthen partnerships.
Furthermore, it would be necessary to facilitate, demonstrate and scale up sciencebased joint solutions and innovation, including open science, citizen science, women
and youth-led initiatives, as well as traditional and indigenous knowledge to achieve
more effective and climate-resilient water and sanitation management. This has to
be in line with national priorities and circumstances.
This chapter has argued how the coordination of climate and water agendas is
bidirectional. On the one hand, climate policy-makers need to better understand the
role that water and sanitation can play in mitigation, and importantly, also the needs
of the water community to adapt to climate change. It is through strong partnerships
and collaboration between climate and water stakeholders that water and sanitation
can feature more prominently in nationally determined contributions (NDC) and
National Adaptation Plans, contributing to national commitments made to the Paris
Climate Agreement.

the ministerial level

Box 7.6 Water and climate change cooperation
through the ‘Water Tracker’

The triple climate, health and economic crisis has
highlighted the crucial role of water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) in building resilient communities and
achieving sustainable development, including meeting
environmental goals.

Understanding the explicit and implicit water
requirements of climate-sensitive development
plans is critical for ensuring that countries are not
only able to meet Paris Agreement targets, but
are also able to design, finance and implement
effective projects that contribute to social,
economic and ecological resilience through the
careful consideration of water.

For the first time since its inception, the Sanitation
and Water for All (SWA) Partnership convened in May
2022 a High-Level Sector Ministers’ Meeting on WASH
with ministers of environment, climate, health and
economy* to discuss joint solutions for climate change
resiliency, pandemic prevention and increased economic
development. The overall theme for discussion was
Building Forward Better for Recovery and Resilience.
During the event, ministers of environment and climate
had the opportunity to collaborate with WASH ministers
so that agreements could be forged to make sure
that water adaptation needs, as well as mitigation
opportunities, are introduced in national climate plans.
The meeting also served to discuss how to ensure that
climate priorities are integrated into national COVID-19
recovery plans.
The 2022 Sector Ministers’ Meeting was preceded by
a six-month-long preparatory process, composed of
multi-stakeholder discussions at national and regional
levels. During those discussions, water and climate
stakeholders jointly analysed national progress on
identified bottlenecks and successes regarding water and
sanitation, and agreed on joint action.
As a result of this WASH and climate collaboration, a
set of 25 commitments by country governments and
other constituencies were formulated. An example is the
commitment made by the Ministry of Water and Sanitation
of Malawi to increase alignment to sector strategies, such
as the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and
the National Water Policy, by closely working with climate
stakeholders. The outcomes of the meeting were followed
up through national-level processes, contributing to the
preparatory process of the 27th Conference of the Parties
(COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 2023 UN Water
Conference, and the Sanitation and Water for All 2023
Finance Ministers’ Meeting.

*

The Water Tracker for National Climate Planning*
is a tool and diagnostic guide to help countries
self-assess and enhance water resilience in their
national climate plans. Working in collaboration,
climate and water actors use the Water Tracker
to guide water resilience thinking within national
climate plans so that they can be monitored,
enhanced, implemented and refined over time.
The Water Tracker acknowledges that national
climate plans, including nationally determined
contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation
Plans (NAPs), need to be progressive over
time, demonstrating increases in ambition and
commitment. It facilitates the achievement
of reporting requirements for countries by
establishing a baseline to grow from, revealing
existing gaps in national climate plans and
providing concrete tools and frameworks for
addressing those gaps, and enhancing national
climate plans.
In 2021, Costa Rica was the first country to
implement the Water Tracker, triggering and
fostering engagement between different
governmental institutions with an aim to improve
water resilience and its reflection in climate
planning. Online workshops were held with
representatives from across various ministries
and levels of government, as well as academia,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
international organizations. Existing synergies
and gaps in climate planning were identified. The
Water Tracker analysis is helping to improve and
align the different climate plans in Costa Rica,
develop bankable climate-resilient water projects,
and provide overall support to the country’s Paris
Agreement commitments (AGWA, 2022).

Box 7.7 Water and Climate Coalition
The Water and Climate Coalition was founded by ten United Nations entities and the Global Water Partnership (GWP)
as a response to the call by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a Decade of Action to accelerate the
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an initiative in support of the SDG 6 Global Acceleration
Framework, the main objectives of the Coalition are to provide:
• Guidance for high-level policy development through its group of water and climate leaders.
• A platform for its Members to partner in the implementation of solutions that address the gaps of operational water and
climate challenges. The Coalition’s aims will focus on catalysing tangible action and activities for water and climate.
The Water and Climate Leaders provide guidance for high-level policy development. They include current and former
heads of state, prime ministers and ministers, as well as representatives of intergovernmental organizations, the private
sector, research institutions and youth organizations. The Leaders have formulated an action plan that defines their
activities over the next years. It spells out the impact they would like to make, such as being a catalyst for a step change
in the ways in which water and climate are reflected in national and regional planning and in the implementation of
adaptation and mitigation strategies.
Coalition Members have joined forces and resources to design and implement activities that show that current
shortcomings (silos, short span of commitment, regional scope not being considered, etc.) can be overcome, and
that co-benefits can be leveraged if we adhere to an integrated water and climate approach in project and systems
planning and implementation. The Water and Climate Coalition is open for a wide range of stakeholders from scientific
organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), UN organizations, member states and civil
society. Being a member of the coalition is on a voluntary basis, it is a non-bureaucratic community of like-minded
individuals and organizations, and aims to create a movement rather than to function as a structure or an organization.
The coalition is set to create action through positive motivation. The objective is to engage and align different players to
generate trust and momentum through implementing activities on a national, regional and global scale.
For more information, please see: www.water-climate-coalition.org/.

On the other hand, water and sanitation policy-makers also need to proactively reach out to
climate stakeholders and seek partnerships to better understand how climate-led processes
work, and to integrate water-related climate risks into national water policies, strategies
and implementation plans. Indeed, partnering with climate stakeholders and working on
climate action is a great opportunity for the water community to help bridge water resource
management and water and sanitation service priorities and objectives. Working together,
the climate and water stakeholders can ensure the implementation of agreed climate and
water–energy–food priorities in countries.
To do that, climate and water stakeholders need to collaborate at the most adequate
level – from local, national, basin, to global – and this is best accomplished through multistakeholder processes.
The five ‘accelerators’ of financing, data and information, capacity development, innovation
and governance under the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework can serve as an umbrella for
water and climate partnerships and cooperation, and contribute to progress across the 2030
Agenda and to the climate resilience of communities, ecosystems and production systems.

112

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

These accelerators are the following:
·

Climate and water stakeholders must join efforts to secure the adequate financial
resources to overcome barriers to the implementation of national and subnational
climate–water established commitments.

·

Climate (risk) data and water management information, such as data on water
use and discharge, and on impacts on the environment, people and businesses,
need to be transparently shared within national jurisdictions and across borders
to effectively inform decision-making processes by supra-national/national/
subnational governments, environmental agencies and the private sector (among
other stakeholders). Further joint efforts are needed to generate data and evidence
on savings in terms of avoided greenhouse gases emissions as a result of improved
water resources management, and supply and sanitation operations.

·

Joint operational technical teams, forums and platforms, representing both the
climate and the water community, represent an opportunity for bi-directional
capacity development, with climate stakeholders understanding better how the
water community operates and vice versa.

·

Collaboration between water and climate stakeholders is needed to further develop
and test innovative tools and approaches that bridge climate planning and early
warning with regard to water policy making.

·

Further collaboration among water and climate stakeholders is needed to streamline
and clarify respective responsibilities and to take ownership of their specific
roles, recognizing climate–water interlinkages, building on complementarities,
and ensuring that institutions, policy frameworks and enabling environments are
effective.

Finally, given the fact that climate change essentially exacerbates water-related challenges,
making them both more challenging and urgent, climate change should in and of itself be an
accelerator for action on water.

Sub-Saharan
Africa

Of the 771 million people still lacking even a basic drinking water service in 2020, half
lived in Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO/UNICEF, 2021). There is a widening gap in water supply
between urban and rural dwellers (Adams et al., 2019; Grasham et al., 2019; Niva et al.,
2019) where governments have not been able to expand the necessary infrastructure to
meet growing demand.
Developing water infrastructure, harnessing ground water resources, addressing climate
change effects and investing in science and technology under an enabling political and
institutional environment are key areas needed to drive sustainable water security. Given
the multifaceted nature and the magnitude of water challenges in the region, strategic
collaboration among stakeholder groups is deemed crucial and a necessity for reaching
solutions. However, even though some efforts have been made recently to mitigate this
problem, the coordination, communication and exchange of the generally limited data and
information available to African water stakeholders has been very weak due to the lack of
appropriate strategies and platforms to establish a fruitful dialogue between researchers,
decision-makers and community members (see Chapter 10).

This chapter presents a few cases of strategic partnerships on water development in
Sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from community-based to regional and international levels.

8.1.1 Community–public partnerships
Community–public partnerships (CPPs) offer win–win arrangements that enable private
operators, utilities and communities to derive benefits through mutual understanding,
shared responsibilities, and exchange of knowledge and experiences (Adams et al.,
2019). CPPs are usually established between a water utility and an elected group within
a community. Adams et al. (2019) examined the role of CPPs for water supply in Ghana,
Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. In Malawi, a CPP between water boards and communityelected water user associations (WUAs) in informal settlements, facilitated by local
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community leaders and city councils, led to
significant improvements in water supply (Adams and Zulu, 2015; Adams et al., 2019). In
Tanzania, the CPP between community-based organizations (CBO) and public utilities
in Dar es Salaam enabled the construction and maintenance of secondary pipes which
permitted water connections to households (Adams et al., 2019; Dill, 2010).
CPPs have also been linked to the resolution of water-related conflicts. In Ghana, a
partnership between the Ghana Water Company, private operators and community water
boards enabled a successful mediation of water tariff conflicts by showcasing broader
communal benefits (Galaa and Bukari, 2014). In Zambia, the CPP in the city of Ndola
showed how a partnership between informal water supply systems and the formal sector
was critical in ensuring safe water quality (Liddle et al., 2016).

8.1.2 Regional and international water development partnerships
Alliance for Water Stewardship Africa
The need to hold businesses and water users accountable and ensure adoption of
sustainability practices for the management of water resources has inspired water
stewardship worldwide. In 2011, the International Water Stewardship Programme (IWaSP)
was initiated to foster collaboration among different water actors. Inspired by IWaSP, the
Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) was born as a global collaboration membership
comprising businesses, NGOs and the public sector. AWS members contribute to the
sustainability of local water resources through their adoption and promotion of the
AWS Standard, a universal framework that recognizes and rewards good water stewards
through third-party certification. AWS Africa is the regional partner of AWS, driving and

116

guiding implementation of the AWS Standard across the continent. In 2018, 26 regional
stakeholders from eight countries joined to agree on a strategy to guide and champion the
AWS Standard in Africa (AWS Africa, n.d.).
In Kenya, AWS Standards were tested at flower and vegetable farms and a coffee processing
enterprise to examine their suitability in delivering better water management in the
challenging context of an African river basin (Hepworth et al., 2011). The study, carried out
in the Lake Naivasha basin, showed that application of AWS Standards improved water use
efficiency and quality, and resulted in long-term investments and management commitments
to improving basin governance by WUAs through research and partnership projects
(Hepworth et al., 2011; Isundwa and Mourad, 2019).
As Isundwa and Mourad (2019) have noted, there are several other African examples of
successful water partnerships under the AWS. A stewardship partnership resulted in secured
groundwater supply for residents and businesses in Lusaka (IWaSP, n.d.a). In Uganda, more
than 500 hectares of wetland areas were reportedly restored through a partnership between
companies and local industries operating in the Ruwizi River catchment area (IWaSP,
n.d.b). In Tanzania, a stewardship partnership comprising development partners resulted in
successful restoration of the Mlalakua River and safeguarded it from pollution (IWaSP, n.d.c).
Transboundary water partnerships
Cooperation is crucial for ensuring water security in the region’s many transboundary basins
and aquifers.
In the Stampriet Transboundary Aquifer shared by Botswana, Namibia and South Africa,
a joint assessment of the water system required the harmonization of data across the
countries. In partnership with UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (IHP)
and the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC), the project has
generated more than 40 thematic maps, which have been uploaded to the project’s Information
Management System.46 The coordination mechanism supports science-based decisionmaking on water allocation and sound management at the basin level.
Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA), managed by the World Bank, invests
in water infrastructure development and offers technical support and analyses to foster a
better understanding of transboundary water issues. It provides governments, river basin
organizations (RBOs) and other stakeholders with the sound evidence required to make
informed decisions. Since 2011, the CIWA partnership has supported riparian governments in
Sub-Saharan Africa by addressing constraints to cooperative management and development of
transboundary waters in order to advance sustainable, inclusive and climate-resilient growth.
CIWA’s activities are cross-sectoral, involving climate resilience, biodiversity conservation, data
initiatives, energy, agriculture, social issues, the environment, as well as Gender and Social
Inclusion (GESI), and Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV). The partnership works to protect
people and property from water-related shocks and use the valuable resource sustainably.
CIWA has strengthened cooperative and sustainable management and development in the
Niger River basin and is seeking to unlock growth opportunities through transboundary
cooperation in the Zambezi River basin (World Bank, 2022).
W12+ Programs
W12+ Programs is a partnership-based initiative jointly run by the Institute for Ecological
Civilization (EcoCiv) and a a registered charity based in South Africa (SOS NPO47), born out
of the crisis experienced by Cape Town as it approached Day Zero (See Box 7.2). W12+’s
mandate is to connect, catalyse and incubate water solutions, particularly in urban contexts

facing the dual crisis of climate change and rapid urbanization. W12+ Programs addresses
the obstacles to water security through a two-pronged approach: supporting local leaders
who are working to solve their own communities’ water security challenges via hubs; and
connecting these leaders or decision-makers to global resources and knowledge via the
Blueprint’s network and other W12+ events such as the ‘W12+ Drive-In’.
W12+ has three African ʽhub ̕ locations: in Wau (South Sudan) with Water for South Sudan
(WfSS); in Minya (Egypt) with Life from Water; and in Johannesburg (South Africa) with the
National Business Initiative. Via a participatory process, these hubs each identified key priority
interventions to transition towards a water-secure future. W12+ then provided a supportive,
capacity development partnership to design, implement and evaluate these interventions,
ultimately sharing them widely with the W12+ network broadly to prompt global adaptation
and uptake, scaling the impact of each W12+ Hub. The W12+ Blueprint currently houses over
35 case studies representing adaptable and replicable water solutions from over 30 countries
globally. W12+ also organizes informational and networking events for local leaders, activists,
policy-makers and government leaders, including W12+ Drive Ins and W12+ Congresses.

Continental Africa Water Investment Programme
The Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP), part of the second phase of the
Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa – Priority Action Plan (PIDA – PAP 2)
of the African Union Development Agency’s New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(AUDA-NEPAD), is an emerging partnership between regional and global agencies such
as AUDA-NEPAD, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA). AIP supports a collective ‘call for action’ for meeting the
2025 Africa Water Vision of Water Security by addressing investment gaps and supporting
water infrastructure projects. The new agenda targets five pilot countries (Benin, Cameroon,
Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia) and five transboundary basins: the North-West Sahara aquifer
system, the Volta River basin, the Lake Chad basin, the Kagera/Lake Victoria basin and
the Zambezi River basin. In August 2018, AUDA-NEPAD, the AfDB, the African Ministers’
Council on Water (AMCOW), the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, and the Global Water
Partnership (GWP) signed a joint communiqué to make investment in water security and
sustainable sanitation a key goal for AIP (AUDA-NEPAD/AfDB/AMCOW/ICA/GWP, n.d.). The
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a political and economic union of
15 countries in West Africa adopted AIP to accelerate regional cooperation on transboundary
water investments. While the partnership aligns with the targets of the 17th Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG 17 – in particular 17.17) and encourages and promotes public,
public–private and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing
strategies of partnerships data, monitoring and accountability, success depends on how
participatory these partnerships emerge (Nagabhatla et al., 2021).

8.1.3 Conclusions
Figure 8.1, below, provides a schematic representation of the complex landscape of water
partnerships in Africa.
There are currently numerous activities at all levels that require coordination to optimize
efforts and resources. The value of CPPs is worth examining further, and CPPs should
potentially be scaled up. Several subregional, regional and continental partnerships could be
strengthened. A knowledge management tool and a campaign to avoid duplication and ensure
complementarity are required. At the continental level, the role of such coordination is being
taken up by AMCOW (Box 8.1). Development partners and other stakeholders should consider
reinforcing existing structures, rather than developing new ones. It is only then that the growing
complexity of partnerships involved in Africa’s water governance can be fully addressed.

8.2
Europe and
North America

The case studies below illustrate partnerships and cooperation initiatives that are frequent
in the Europe and North American region. The Convention on Access to Information, Public
Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus
Convention – UNECE, 1998) and the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary
Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention – UNECE, 1992) stress the need for
cooperation and involvement of stakeholders, as do several relevant Directives of the European
Union (EU). These instruments have facilitated the development of various types of partnerships
in the region and are also contributing to stakeholder participation outside the region.
While stakeholder involvement is an objective that has been proactively pursued and, to
a large degree, successfully achieved in the outlined case studies, it remains a common
challenge in water management, governance and cooperation across the region.

8.2.1 Cooperation in the Drin basin
The transboundary Drin River basin includes two rivers (Drin and Buna/Bojana) and three lakes
(Prespa, Ohrid and Skadar/Shkoder). Four State Parties to the Water Convention - Albania,
Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia - and Kosovo (within the framework of the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, dated 1999), share the basin. It provides water
resources for drinking, energy, fishing, agriculture, biodiversity, tourism and industry.

The African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) identified groundwater as a priority intervention area in its Strategic Plan
2018–2030, launching the Pan-African Groundwater Program (APAGroP) in Kampala in February 2020. Through APAGroP,
AMCOW has engaged groundwater networks and institutions such as the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and
Natural Resources (BGR), the British Geological Survey (BGS), the International Water Management institute (IWMI) and
UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (IHP), working across three main thematic pillars (see Table).

Arising from this collaboration, several joint activities were accomplished, including the development of a groundwater
country support tool (the Namibia case study), a groundwater financing framework (the Uganda pilot study) and the
development of the Pan-Africa Water Quality Programme in collaboration with the IWMI.

With the support of GWP Mediterranean (GWP-Med) and the Water Convention Secretariat
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), multi-stakeholder
consultations at the national and basin level led to the signing by riparians of a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) for the Management of the Extended Transboundary Drin Basin48 in 2011.
The MoU established an institutional framework for cooperation: the Meeting of the Parties,
a Drin Core Group and three Expert Working Groups. Objectives of the MoU include increased
accessibility to comprehensive data and adequate information, minimization of flooding,
pollution control, and reduction of damage from hydro-morphological changes (UNECE, 2022).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

With the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and GWP-Med, joint activities under the MoU included a transboundary
diagnostic analysis that provides the basis for collaborative work. Outcomes included:
• Consensus among riparians on key transboundary concerns and drivers of change,
including climate change and variability, reached through joint fact-finding;
• Commitment of riparians and donors to sustain joint cooperation mechanisms and to
undertake priority reforms and investments; and
• Benefits demonstrated in the field by environmentally sound approaches and technologies
new to the region (such as River Basin Management Plans, wastewater treatment
technologies, approaches to decrease nutrient loads, and establishment and testing of
transboundary monitoring).

Partnerships
and cooperation
initiatives are
frequent in the
Europe and North
American region

The process has included a high level of stakeholder involvement, including regular
stakeholder meetings at the national and basin levels. Implementation of a joint Strategic
Action Plan, approved by the riparians in 2020, has been supported by the GEF and the
Adaptation Fund and through national investments. A nexus assessment focusing on
hydropower and floods, and on sustainable biomass and forest management contributes
to the involvement of important sectors in the management of the basin (UNECE, 2022).
The learning workshop Gender equality for sustainable development in the Drin basin (2020),
held in the framework of the project ‘Promoting the Sustainable Management of Natural
Resources in Southeastern Europe, through the use of the nexus approach’ by the Austrian
Development Agency (ADA), GWP and UNECE, discussed gender-related challenges and
opportunities relevant to the water–food–energy–ecosystem approach in the Drin basin,
enhancing the understanding of the basic concepts of gender equality among stakeholders.

8.2.2 National Policy Dialogues of the EU Water Initiative
Since 2006, UNECE and its Water Convention Secretariat, jointly with the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in close cooperation with national
authorities, has been implementing National Policy Dialogues (NPDs) in countries of Eastern
Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia under the EU Water Initiative (EUWI), funded mainly
by the European Union. The International Office for Water (IOW) and the Environment
Agency Austria have also been involved in this work since 2016. NPDs have strengthened
water governance and integrated water resources management (IWRM) in line with the
provisions of the Water Convention, its Protocol on Water and Health, and EU Directives.
It is a specific feature of the NPDs that they are involving a broader base of stakeholders,
such as representatives of civil society, academia and the private sector, than is usually the
case in national water policy discussions. Capacity-building on modern water management
principles has been an important aspect of the NPDs (UNECE, 2022).
Outcomes of such support in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in
2016–2021 (European Union, 2021; UNECE, 2022) included:
• Five transboundary basins (of the Dniester, Kura, Khrami-Debeda, Neman and
Western Dvina Rivers) progressed with development of joint legal frameworks;
• Hundreds of knowledge products such as technical reports, databases, maps and
web services were delivered and nine water laboratories modernized, including
with the delivery of 400 units of state-of-the-art equipment items for water
monitoring and analysis;
• Forty-four surveys were carried out in rivers, ground- and coastal waters, covering
over 1,000 sites;

Regional perspectives

121

• Water information systems in the six countries were modernized to provide transparent
data on the status and use of water resources; and
• Around 30 million people are benefiting from 11 new or revised River Basin Management
Plans and water monitoring practices that are closer to EU standards.
Outcomes of support in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan included:
• A multi-stakeholder water–food–energy–ecosystems nexus dialogue in the Syr Darya
basin in 2013–2015;
• Progress with strategic planning, such as a water sector reform strategy in Tajikistan for
2016–2025 involving the uptake of the basin management principle, and water safety
indicators in Kyrgyzstan;
• Modernized legislation in Turkmenistan, such as a new water code, adopted in 2016 with
IWRM elements, and accession by that country to the Water Convention; and
• Capacity-building and research on the state of the Kigach, Ural/Zhayik, Bolshoy and
Malyi Rivers shared by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, and development of an
action plan in 2015–2018.

8.2.3 Water-oriented living labs for a water-smart society
Water Europe has been established to promote water-related innovation, research and
development in the region. It is a multi-stakeholder association with over 250 members,
representing the whole diversity of water-related innovation. All Water Europe activities and
positions are guided by its Water Vision (2017) and the ambition to achieve a water-smart
society (Water Europe, n.d.).

A water-smart
society leads to
a more resilient
water sector, with
water security
and safety as
essential goals

A water-smart society leads to a more resilient water sector, with water security and safety
as essential goals. It responds to the need for major societal changes in response to
climate change and demographic trends.
Water Europe has developed the model of Water-Oriented Living Labs (WOLLs) to promote
the co-creation, validation and deployment of innovations to achieve a water-smart society.
Experts among Water Europe’s members form Vision Leadership Teams – Water Smart
Industry, Water Smart City and Water Smart Rural – providing guidance.
WOLLs work on the integration of technologies with new business and governance models,
and on innovative policies to address the pressing water and water-related challenges in full
compliance with SDGs 6 and 17 (Water Europe, n.d.).
Water Europe selected 105 WOLLs in its 2019 Atlas of Water-Oriented Living Labs
(Water Europe, 2019), expanding the networks of existing WOLLs, supporting the creation
of new WOLLs, and exploring funding opportunities by leading the WOLLs pillar of the
EU co-funded partnership Water4All. An annual action plan for the Network of WOLLs
establishes priorities for the urban, rural and industrial water-related environments.

8.2.4 The International Joint Commission
The International Joint Commission (IJC) between Canada and the United States of
America (USA) has a long history and demonstrates good practices for successful water
cooperation and for the establishment of partnerships not only across borders but also
within countries and between sectors, administrative levels and other stakeholders.

122

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

The IJC was created by the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 for the purpose of settling and
preventing transboundary water disputes between Canada and the USA. The IJC’s activities
commence when governments issue a Directive. The IJC works independently to study
issues and makes recommendations back to governments. Once recommendations are
accepted, the IJC assumes a monitoring and reporting function.
The IJC’s rich history of resolving water apportionment and flood management issues
is linked to a strong engagement with involved communities. Public outreach and
engagement are foundational components of the IJC’s activities. Article XII of the 1909
Boundary Waters Treaty states that “… in any proceeding, or inquiry, or matter within
its jurisdiction under this treaty, all parties interested therein shall be given convenient
opportunity to be heard…” (The Boundary Waters Treaty, 1909).
Providing all interested parties with convenient opportunities to be heard is prominently
included in all IJC activities and is the core principle for its communications programme.
As detailed in its Rules of Procedure (IJC, n.d.), the IJC fulfils this obligation by holding
public hearings before issuing an Order or submitting final reports to the governments.
For hearings to be meaningful, the IJC must also inform the public about the matters it is
considering.
For the past 40 years, the IJC has also taken a proactive approach by involving stakeholders
as members of its boards and advisory groups. More recently, the IJC has endeavoured to
involve members of indigenous communities in its work.
One of the recent experiences is the concept of ‘adaptive management’ used by the
watershed (basin) boards to monitor and review international water regulation plans across
the transboundary waters. Adaptive management enables the IJC’s boards to respond
quickly to changing conditions. This is particularly important in view of the changing
climate. In the watershed boards, a broad range of stakeholders are represented.
In 2022, the IJC has undertaken the 50 th anniversary review of the 1972 Great Lakes Water
Quality Agreement. The Great Lakes Horizon project identifies factors that could impact
the Great Lakes (which hold 20% of the world´s freshwater resources – US EPA, n.d.)
ecologically, economically, socially and culturally over the next 30+ years, and provides
suggestions regarding potential improvements of the Agreement.
Another key initiative implemented in support of SDG 6 is the Great Lakes Manure
Management Framework. The 2019 Great Lakes Water Quality Board’s report on
manure management included research from a very diverse group of stakeholders from
agriculture, nutrient research and water treatment organizations (IJC, 2019). Partnerships,
including with regional governmental agencies and institutions, are key to establishing an
implementation plan.

8.2.5 Equitable access to water and sanitation in Armenia
In its efforts to improve access to water and sanitation, in 2015–2016, Armenia undertook
a self-assessment of equitable access to water and sanitation, using the Equitable Access
Score-Card (UNECE/WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2019). This innovative analytical tool,
based on the Protocol on Water and Health (UNECE/WHO Regional Office for Europe, 1999),
helps governments and other stakeholders to establish a baseline measure of equity in
access to water and sanitation, identify policy gaps and priority areas for actions, agree on
further actions, and evaluate progress through a process of self-assessment (UNECE/WHO
Regional Office for Europe, 2013).

Regional perspectives

123

The self-assessment exercise was carried out by the NGO Armenian Women for Health and
Healthy Environment under the coordination of the State Committee of Water Economy under
the Ministry of Agriculture.49 The exercise brought together the Ministry of Health, the Ministry
of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure, the Public Services Regulatory Commission, the
Ministry of Nature Protection, the Ministry of Education and Science, and the Ministry of Labour
and Social Affairs of Armenia. The Office of the Human Rights Defender of Armenia was a
partner in the exercise. Stakeholders from the private sector, universities and civil society also
participated, providing inputs.
The exercise identified the challenge of guaranteeing water supply for almost 579 rural
communities that were neither connected to the centralized water supply system nor serviced
by water companies. Obtaining water supply was found to be particularly problematic for
schools. Information on access to water and sanitation by vulnerable and marginalized groups
was scarcely available or lacking from official sources. It became evident that the existing legal
framework lacked definition of the term ‘vulnerable and marginalized groups’, and there were
no public policies to sufficiently help improve access for these various groups (UNECE/WHO
Regional Office for Europe, 2019).
The self-assessment process led to strong interministerial collaboration in addressing these
issues. An Action Plan on Equitable Access to Water and Sanitation for the period 2018–2020
identified priority measures to reduce geographical disparities and provide access to water
and sanitation for vulnerable and marginalized groups. The self-assessment also triggered a
legislative reform to include a definition of vulnerable and marginalized groups in the Water Code.
The self-assessment exercise strengthened the governance framework for guaranteeing
human rights to water and sanitation in Armenia by capitalizing on new data and information
gathered through the use of the Equitable Access Score-Card (UNECE/WHO Regional Office
for Europe, 2013). Through 2012–2020, the Equitable Access Score-Card has been applied at
the national, subnational or municipal level in 12 countries of the UNECE region, enhancing
knowledge of the situation of equitable access to water and sanitation through selfassessments and awareness-raising and fostering the adoption of measures to further ensure
equitable access.

8.3
Latin America
and the
Caribbean

This section describes several different types of partnerships and forms of cooperation
related to water management in Latin America and the Caribbean. It covers examples found at
different scales (i.e. local, national, and transboundary basins) as well as other cross-sectoral
productive experiences. These partnerships are mainly water-based or closely connected to
water-dependent sectors, such as agriculture. The evidence points to limited engagement
outside the water-based domain, such as water initiatives linked to social justice, gender,
education or job creation, or even other environment-related aspects, such as biodiversity.

8.3.1 Water-related partnerships and other coordination efforts
Local level
The most common water-related partnerships at the local level in Latin America and the
Caribbean are established for overseeing drinking water supply and sanitation services,
particularly in rural areas. Agricultural producer groups (such as WUAs; see Section 2.2) for the
management of irrigation water are also widespread, given the relevance of this activity in the
region. One common trait of these associations is that they usually operate independently of
urban area regulators with varying levels of involvement from national-level authorities.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Rural drinking water and sanitation
In Latin America and the Caribbean, rural drinking water and sanitation services are
generally led by community organizations, such as administrative boards or water vigilance
committees. An estimated 80,000 of these associations were active in the region’s rural and
peri-urban areas in 2011 (AVINA, 2011). Most of these organizations are responsible for the
operation and maintenance of services, which depend on the collection of fees. However,
these associations tend to have weak management capacities, mainly due to the lack of
funding, insufficiently trained technicians, poor or insufficient infrastructure, and/or the
difficulty of agreeing on rates or fees with the local population. Faced with these issues, the
promotion of new management models based on efficiency, enhanced technical assistance
and appropriate subsidies are generally required to improve and expand overall service for
rural and peri-urban populations (Mejía Betancourt et al., 2016).

There are several
different types
of partnerships
and forms of
cooperation
related to water
management
in Latin
America and the
Caribbean

Another challenge is related to the regulation of said partnerships, which varies significantly
across countries in the region. For example, the drinking water and sanitation management
boards in Ecuador need to have a legal status and must affiliate their staff to social security.
These demands induce community organizations to avoid legalization and therefore tend to
remain informal (Foro de los Recursos Hídricos, 2013). Similar situations are found in rural
areas of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru. In Chile, the Rural Water Systems are
managed, maintained and operated by local committees or cooperatives, which benefit from
infrastructure, advice and assistance provided by the state. For the operation of the service,
a license must be issued, while tariffs should guarantee the sustainability of the system
(Gobierno de Chile, 2015).
Agricultural associations – Irrigation boards
Irrigation boards or committees are found all across the region. Frequently, they operate
independently and are privately funded. However, there are some interesting examples of
coordination and state involvement. In Jamaica, the WUA organizes private farmers into a
cohesive self-governing unit, which manages an irrigation system. Farmers are members
and shareholders and are responsible for governing the organizations through democratic
processes (Government of Jamaica, 2015). In Peru, legal support from the state for the
collective management of irrigation water has played a fundamental role in strengthening
collective action for water management across different basins (MINAGRI, 2015; Muñoz
Portugal, 2020).
Regionally, the participation of women in local irrigation boards has been low. This is partly
explained by the low ratio of women’s land ownership, while land ownership is in many cases
a precondition for legally participating in irrigation boards, although there are other prevailing
sociocultural constrictions as well (Saravia Matus et al., 2022).

National and transboundary basin levels
National level
Basin management organizations have a long history in the region. Organizations and
systems vary in structure, continuity, stakeholders or functions, even within the same
country. However, most of these associations focus on data-monitoring, research,
coordination of actions, regulation, planning, financing, and development and administration,
among other aspects, and often face similar challenges related to technical capacity,
governance structures and, particularly, funding (GWP/INBO, 2009).
The launch of the National Basin Plan of the Plurinational State of Bolivia led to the creation
of basin management organizations. These organizations serve as interlocutors with
the executing entities of investment projects, and as the intercommunal entities for the
management of the natural resources of the micro-basins. They are established based
on existing social organization structures (unions, brands, irrigation organizations, etc.).

Regional perspectives

125

The sustained operation of these organizations requires the support of the Municipal
Autonomous Government and other local authorities, in addition to the legitimacy granted
by the recognition of the social or indigenous organizations that are water users.
In Brazil, there are River Basin Committees whose primary functions are to approve
water resources management plans, to set the price and charge for use, and to serve as
intermediaries in the event of conflicts between users. These committees are comprised
of representatives of the federal, state and municipal governments, water users and
civil society. In this case, having associated support organizations or funds to carry out
their activities is key to the committees’ effectiveness. Thus, efforts to create effective
coordination between committees is crucial as many are still unable to fulfil their mission
(Formiga, 2014). Likewise, in Mexico, the decentralization of water resources management
from the national to the basin level includes the participation of federal, state and
municipal government, together with representative water users and sectoral organizations
(CONAGUA, 2014).
In Panama, the River Basin Committees are organized by the Ministry of the Environment.
These committees promote coordination and cooperation between the public sector,
private organizations and civil society on water issues, and coordinate the preparation and
implementation of the Environmental Territorial Planning Plan for the hydrographic basin
and the Management, Development, Protection and Watershed Conservation Plan. Basin
Committees were established for 84.6% of the national territory during the 2015–2019
period, thus highlighting the political support given to this type of partnership (Gobierno de
Panamá, 2020).
As in the local-level analysis, gender disparities can be identified among the decisionmakers at the national level. In the case of Peru, one 2020 study identified 20 key roles
in water management, of which 19 were for less than 35% performed by women. At the
national management level (National Water and Sanitation Superintendency), only 29%
of managers were women. At the regional and basin level, only 17% of basin presidencies
were held by women, while in the case of Irrigation Water Users Board presidencies only
6% were women (Carrillo Montenegro and Remy Simatovic, 2020).
However, the current gender gap in governance and decision-making in the water sector
has been recognized by policy-makers across Latin America and the Caribbean, and in
fact, of all gender-related water policies established over the past 20 years, 58% address
gender equality in governance and participation in the sector (Saravia Matus et al., 2022).
Water funds can be defined as multi-stakeholder partnerships that design financial and
governance mechanisms to address water insecurity and act collectively through naturebased solutions (NBS) in support of sustainable river basin management (see Box 3.1 and
Chapter 12). In Latin America and the Caribbean, there are 26 water funds in 9 countries50
and 14 more are being created (Box 8.2) (Alianza Latinoamericana de Fondos de Agua, n.d.).
Transboundary level
In Latin America, only 4 of the 22 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Paraguay) have
arrangements for at least 90% of the surface of their transboundary basins. Furthermore,
in ten countries, the area of the transboundary river and lake basins covered by operational
arrangements does not reach 10%. There are however, several encouraging examples
(UNECE/UNESCO, 2021).

Box 8.2 Santiago Maipo
Water Fund
To address water security
challenges in the Maipo River
basin, particularly the growing
water deficit (mega-drought),
the Santiago Maipo Water
Fund brings together multiple
water users to find collective
solutions. The objective
of this partnership is to
implement projects aligned
with six strategic lines of
action: (i) source water
protection, (ii) water use
efficiency, (iii) information
management, (iv) risk
management, (v) awareness
and communication, and
(vi) territorial planning. For
instance, the water fund has
launched a demonstration
project based on restoration
and reforestation for the
protection of natural habitats,
such as high Andean
wetlands and key riparian
areas in the Maipo River
basin. A pioneering initiative
for environmental monitoring
of wetlands has also been
launched. The fund has the
support of the Metropolitan
Regional Government and
forms part of the Resilience
Strategy of the city of
Santiago.
Source: Fondo de Agua SantiagoMaipo (n.d.).

One particular case is the Binational Commission for the Integrated Management
of Water Resources of Transboundary Hydrographic Basins between Peru and
Ecuador, created in 2017 as an intergovernmental organization to promote
exchange and cooperation between representatives of the two countries. Its
objective is to consolidate bilateral coordination, cooperation and participation,
with an ecosystemic and sustainable vision, for the most appropriate use and
management of water resources in the nine basins shared between both nations.
It has a Binational Technical Secretariat that technically and politically oversees
the Commission and the Committees of the nine transboundary basins. For their
part, the Committees are responsible for executing the development plans for
each basin. Some of the functions of the Binational Commission are to agree on
the framework of policies and strategies to promote IWRM, establish mechanisms
for the implementation of national IWRM strategies, approve basin plans,
analyse the technical-economic proposals of the committees, propose dialogue
mechanisms, propose climate change adaptation and mitigation measures as well
as early warning systems for extreme events, and establish financing mechanisms
(Ecuador and Peru, 2017).
Despite delays in the implementation of the Commission due to political
instability in both countries’ governments and the health emergency related
to the COVID-19 pandemic, Presidential meetings have been arranged to
agree and implement IWRM plans for all transboundary basins (starting with
Zarumilla, Catamayo – Chira and Puyango – Tumbes), as well as other technical
studies (GWP, 2021). However, according to GWP (2021), the Regulation for the
Binational Commission may face some key challenges in the near future, such
as the need to improve information exchange, adopt water quality protocols,
mobilize additional resources and implement conflict resolution mechanisms.
Other coordination efforts
There are additional instances of inter-institutional coordination where public,
private and community actors work together with the aim of improving water
management. At the national level, one example is the Inter-Institutional
and Sectoral Commission for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (COMISASH)
of Nicaragua. This involves public- and private-sector entities, academia,
community and national networks, and national as well as international NGOs.
One of the most relevant examples in the region is the case of the Water Cabinet in
the Dominican Republic. Created as an advisory council to increase efficiency and
agility in decision-making, it coordinates state water policy, previously dispersed
in institutions such as the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources, the National
Institute of Potable Waters and Sewers, the Ministry of Environment and Natural
Resources, the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company, and the Santo
Domingo Water and Sewerage Corporation, with their local versions in each region
(Gobierno de la República Dominicana, 2021a; 2021b). One of the main advantages
of this Cabinet is that it is held within the Ministry of Economy, Planning and
Development, and holds regular meetings with the president of the country, thus
providing key evidence for decisions on water management that directly affect
economic output, public health and the quality of the environment in the country.
The Water Cabinet recognizes the triple dimension of water as a human right,
an economic resource and a natural resource, and outlined the need of a public
investment programme of more than US$8.5 billion through 2030 (equivalent to
7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022) (UNECLAC, 2022). Moreover, it
also intends to achieve a National Water Pact that will allow for the preservation
and availability of water in the future (World Bank, 2021). In other words, the
high-level political endorsement is recognized here as an essential element to
foster a water management transition involving different stakeholders.

Regional perspectives

127

At the transnational level, different intergovernmental initiatives pursue the implementation
of good practices and cooperation. One example is the Caribbean Water & Sewerage
Association Inc. (CAWASA), an organization of public and private water services
providers. In Latin American countries, the Association of Water and Sanitation Regulators
(ADERASA) aims to draw common lessons and formulate best practices, particularly
to address efficiency and regulatory challenges. The Caribbean WaterNet focuses on
improving the development of functional capacities for IWRM and resilience to disaster
risks. Similarly, the Central American Integration System (SICA) is established as a space
for cooperation around the consensual use of water resources. They have proposed the
Regional Strategy for the Integrated Management of Water Resources and its respective
Plan for the Integrated Management of Water Resources as regional instruments for
harmonization in water management.51 Likewise, the Andean Community (consisting of the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) has also adopted a strategy for
comprehensive management of water resources, seeking synergies with governmental and
non-governmental actors such as academia, indigenous peoples, local communities and
organized civil society, among others (Comunidad Andina, 2020). Despite these efforts, it is
necessary to highlight that Latin America and the Caribbean has the lowest regional score
in adopting integrated water management (37%), ultimately indicating that efforts in this
respect still need to increase (UNEP, 2021).

8.3.2 Conclusions
Although there are valuable examples of water-based partnerships in Latin America and the
Caribbean, their performance remains challenged by limited technical capacity and funding.
Based on the examination of these, it is possible to conclude that basin-level management is
of central importance to both public and private stakeholders. However, the level of adoption
of IWRM remains rather low in the region. In this respect, high-level political support for
water-related partnership initiatives is identified as a key enabler.
At the local level, most water-related organizations remain sectorial in their focus, either
aimed at rural drinking water and sanitation supply, or at agricultural irrigation purposes,
which is also a reflection of low levels of IWRM. Both types of organizations still need to be
framed within basin-level management, and there is often no evidence of this connection.
Although basin organizations have been evolving over time to empower social participation
and communal agreements, the available examples of partnerships and other forms of
cooperation indicate that there is still a void regarding those that connect water to other
closely linked issues, such as education.

8.4
Asia and the
Pacific

Water resources management has significantly contributed to the increasing economic and
social welfare of the region over the last decade, through the provision of basic water and
sanitation hygiene (WASH) services, and improved food production, industrial development,
and ecosystem-based services. However, Asia and the Pacific remains far from being on
track to meet the targets of SDG 6.
Several of the region’s major river basins are experiencing high to critical levels of water
stress, including the Krishna and Ziya River basins (Figure 8.2). Compounded by the effects
of climate change, these stress levels are reported to be increasing (UN-Water/UNESCAP,
2022). Competition among the agriculture, industry, energy, and drinking water sectors will
intensify as demands rise due to rapid urbanization and population growth (among others),
exercising even greater pressure on water resources (FAO, 2021).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Inequity in terms of water access remains an issue. Households with low education that
also belong to the bottom 40% in wealth distribution face higher restrictions in access to
basic sanitation (UNESCAP, 2018). Women and vulnerable groups suffer more from limited
access to water and sanitation (Brighton, n.d.; UNESCAP, 2018). Furthermore, women,
who are primarily responsible for water collection in local communities, often have limited
participation in water management due to traditional norms and practices, such as power
imbalances and sociocultural factors (Thai and Guevara, 2019).
Other critical regional challenges include inadequate sanitation services, pollution – both
very closely related (WWAP, 2017) – as well as shortcomings in transboundary cooperation.

Enhancing governance and policy coherence, including through cooperation, partnerships
and multi-stakeholder engagement at all levels, has been identified as a key priority
for achieving progress on sustainable water management across Asia and the Pacific
(UN-Water/UNESCAP, 2022).

8.4.1 Partnerships in Asia and the Pacific
In Asia and the Pacific, multi-stakeholder partnerships and cooperation at all scales are
critical for supporting a more sustainable approach to water management, including through
greater policy coherence – spanning across the climate, disaster risk reduction, agriculture,
energy, urban and rural development, environment, health and finance sectors – and
enhanced water governance at local, national and regional (especially transboundary) levels.
Intra-sectoral partnerships
At the local level, WUAs can support effective water management strategies (see Section 2.2).
In Cambodia, Nepal and the Philippines, WUAs have helped mobilize investments from
development agencies such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
specifically receiving technical and financial support on projects involving irrigation canals,
drainage structures and water conservation systems (IWMI, 2011).
Multi-stakeholder partnerships sharing a common objective in the water sector also exist,
involving local communities, national ministries and NGOs. Community participation was the
important factor to ensure sustainability of water projects in the Solomon Islands (Alexander
et al., 2012), on Apo Island in the Philippines (Hind et al., 2010) and in the Songkhram River
basin in Thailand (Piman and Ghimire, 2022).
Public–private partnerships (PPPs) have been set up for infrastructure projects supporting
water distribution, treatment and transmission (ADB, 2022), benefiting 67.5 million people in
Asia and the Pacific in 2013 (Jensen, 2017). There has been an increase in PPPs for water
services in China, Singapore and South Korea since 2000, but some have experienced a lack
of sustainability when financial viability is not ensured (see Section 13.4). This happens when
there is limited fiscal commitment from both private and government sectors and tariff risks
are high. Sustainability is also jeopardized when projects have not been incorporated in a
national water plan (ADB, 2022).
Evidence suggest that women’s participation in the assessment and implementation of PPPs
is increasing (Almeida et al., 2020), and that women’s involvement in decision-making leads
to their economic empowerment (Indarti et al., 2019).
Cooperation and partnerships between countries sharing transboundary water resources
are also critical for Asia and the Pacific. For example, the Mekong River Commission
(MRC) was established in 1995 as a result of the Agreement on the Cooperation for the
Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin. The MRC collects water-related data and

information, increases stakeholder awareness, and supports cooperation among
its Member States through consultations and the adoption of water management
strategies, including on flood management and mitigation, as well as water use
monitoring (MRC, n.d.).

Cross-sectoral partnerships
Asia and the Pacific records generally high levels of IWRM implementation
(GWP/UNEP-DHI, 2021), which attest to a focus on both water and land management
for social and economic development.
The Network of Asian River Basin Organizations (NARBO) serves as a platform
for fostering regional cooperation in water governance, using IWRM. Since 2004,
NARBO has contributed significantly through advocacy, awareness-raising,
information exchange, capacity development and active participation in water-related
conferences (ADB/ADBI/CRBOM/Japan Water Agency, 2015).
Cross-sectoral cooperation can also be effective in watershed governance. In China,
the River Chief System (RCS) is a horizontal cooperation mechanism between
different ministries from the municipal offices, the Environment Protection Agency,
the Finance Bureau and the Water Conservancy Bureau, among others. The RCS
has been implemented in 31 provinces since 2018, where visible improvements in
surface water quality and the overall ecological condition of watersheds have been
reported (Wang, et al., 2021).

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Extra-sectoral partnerships
As water is a cross-cutting issue, partnerships and cooperation are key to integrated
approaches to water management spanning across key sectors.
Integrated solutions, such as water–energy–food nexus approach, can help identify
interlinkages and orient priorities in managing and allocating water for its multiple uses
(Mitra et al., 2020), assessing co-benefits, neutrality and trade-offs (Rasul and Neupane,
2021). The GWP supports countries and regional organizations in developing and
implementing nexus-integrated plans on cross-sectoral projects (GWP, 2020).
The water–energy–food nexus is also critical in a transboundary context. One partnership
addressing this issue is the transboundary water cooperation arrangement established by
the Mahakali Treaty (Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project) between India and Nepal, which
aims to achieve water and energy security for both parties (Shrestha and Ghale, 2016; MoJS,
n.d.). Although the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project is long delayed, several beneficial
impacts have been highlighted in terms of irrigation and flood control, and lessening energy
shortages (Kunwar, 2014).
In Tuvalu, where water resources are affected by recurring storms and droughts related to
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles, the government formulated the Sustainable and
Integrated Water and Sanitation Policy (2012–2021),52 addressing the sustainable management
of water resources as well as integrated policies on climate change and disaster risks. This
resulted in a more comprehensive approach addressing the gaps between the policy outcome
individually achieved by different government agencies (Gheuens et al., 2019).
The Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modality of Action (SAMOA Pathway)
Pathway focuses on interlinkages among sustainable energy, natural resource management
and green economy commitments to provide holistic adaptation measures, which includes
water and ocean-based approaches (Commonwealth Foundation, 2015).

8.4.2 Conclusions
In Asia and the Pacific, multi-stakeholder partnerships and cooperation at all scales are
critical for supporting sustainable water management and integrated approaches related to
water, including at the transboundary level.
It is critical to strengthen existing partnerships and networks, to enhance existing platforms
for better stakeholder engagement at all levels, and to ensure that all relevant stakeholders
are included in water governance. Further developing governance approaches at subnational
and national levels, engaging all parts of government, would support the mainstreaming and
financing of water management required to achieve SDG 6, and lead to progress across other
water-dependent sectors.

8.5
The Arab region

Characterized by its arid to semi-arid climate, the Arab region suffers from surface water
scarcity. Over 392 million people in the region live with less than 1,000 m3 of renewable
freshwater per capita per year (AQUASTAT, n.d.b; UNDESA, 2019). This and other rising
challenges, such as climate change, high dependency on transboundary water resources and
high usage of water resources by the agricultural sector, require successful cooperation and
partnership initiatives, in order to collectively progress towards the sustainable management

of water resources and an improved water security in the region. This section explores some
of the partnerships and cooperation modalities in the region, from regional to transboundary
to cross-sectoral.

8.5.1 Ministerial-level cooperation

Most Arab states
largely rely on
rivers and/or
aquifers that
are shared with
neighbouring
countries (within
and outside the
region) for their
water supply

In June 2008, the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States approved the proposal
to establish the Arab Ministerial Water Council (AMWC). This institution aims to develop
cooperation and coordinate efforts among Arab states (League of Arab States, n.d.). In
2011, the AMWC adopted the Arab Strategy for Water Security in the Arab Region to Meet the
Challenges and Future Needs for Sustainable Development 2010–2030 (AMWC, 2012). This
document is a framework for programmes and activities in all areas of water resources,
especially the following: IWRM, development and preservation of water resources in quantity
and quality, water demand management, support to coordination and cooperation in shared
basins, and protecting Arab rights to water in transboundary water resources and in occupied
territories. The strategy has been updated in 2022 to reflect current progress and emerging
issues relevant to water security in the region.
In addition to consolidating regional efforts and collaboration on water security, the strategy
action plan has helped to advance:
• Inclusion of water security in national development strategies and in policies related to
economy and climate change;
• Setting of priorities for supporting water security on the national level through
collaboratively working with regional organizations and neighbouring countries;
• Regional cooperation in research and data-sharing; and
• Investments under regional cooperation for advancing water security through
technological innovations.
The AMWC further coordinates efforts on other regional water priorities, such as
transboundary water cooperation. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Western Asia (UNESCWA), as mandated by the AMWC, drafted the guidance principles
for Arab cooperation in the management of transboundary water resources and presented
them at an intergovernmental meeting organized by UNESCWA and the League of Arab
States in 2017. The guidelines have been under discussion since then, but their adoption
has yet to be formally approved. Several challenges have hindered the process, including
the difficulty of holding physical meetings due to COVID-19 and, most importantly, the
political sensitivity tied to current developments on major transboundary surface water
basins in the region. However, these guidelines constitute an institutional mechanism
for dialogue and agreements on transboundary water issues as well as an opportunity to
develop capacities of many state actors.

8.5.2 Transboundary water cooperation in the Arab region
Most Arab states largely rely on rivers and/or aquifers that are shared with neighbouring
countries (within and outside the region) for their water supply. In fact, 15 out of the
22 Arab states are riparian to a shared surface water basin, and all Arab states, except the
Comoros, are riparian to a shared aquifer. This makes cooperation on transboundary water
resources essential for the region’s water security. Despite certain inter-state tensions
between some neighbouring countries, several examples of cooperation modalities do exist
in the region, including transboundary aquifers. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System
(NSAS), the Northwestern Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS) and the Orontes River basin are
among those where such cooperation arrangements are in place.

132

The United Nations World Water Development Repor t 2023

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

For the NSAS, a Joint Authority formed by Egypt and Libya was launched in 1991 and
was later joined by Sudan and Chad. This Joint Authority aims at serving the social and
economic development of NSAS countries by studying, protecting and planning the uses
of NSAS water resources (NSAS-JA, n.d.). The gathering and sharing of data often form a
critical challenge in transboundary settings (see Section 10.3). To overcome this challenge,
the four riparian countries of the NSAS have signed two agreements that have advanced
data-sharing, monitoring and modelling. Cooperation in the NWSAS is fostered through a
consultation mechanism facilitated by the Sahara and Sahel Observatory in the form of a
steering committee constituted of representatives from water authorities of each riparian
country. This consultation mechanism offers cooperation on data exchanges, research, and
management and monitoring of water resources. However, it does not legally restrict any of
the riparian countries from abstracting groundwater. The NWSAS cooperation mechanism
was initiated with the support and funding of the international community, resulting in a
mechanism prototype for other aquifers in the Arab region.
Formal cooperation on the Orontes River basin between Lebanon and the Syrian Arab
Republic started in 1972 when the two riparian States signed a bilateral agreement
concerning water use. It was further developed in 1991 through the Fraternity, Cooperation
and Coordination Treaty (Syrian Lebanese Higher Council, 1991), establishing the formal
basis for cooperation between the two countries in the domain of water and other
sectors. The treaty led to the establishment of a Lebanese–Syrian Joint Committee
for Shared Water in addition to several agreements that were signed thereafter to
enhance cooperation between the riparian countries. This cooperation has improved
the management of the transboundary water resources through river infrastructure
development and shared allocation between countries (UNESCWA/BGR, 2013).
These transboundary cooperation arrangements have led to improved water management
through iterative trust-building processes among riparian countries that started with
targeted data-sharing, information-gathering and scientific research and then developed
into more robust cooperation modalities.

8.5.3 Cross-sectoral cooperation
The High-Level Joint Committee for Water and Agriculture
After several years of working towards coordination between the water and agricultural
sectors, the First Joint Meeting of Arab Ministers of Agriculture and Water was convened
under the auspices of the League of Arab States with the support of UNESCWA and the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2019 (UNESCWA, 2019).
The meeting resulted in the adoption of the terms of reference for the Joint Ministerial
Committee and its Joint Secretariat, comprised of the Arab Organization for Agricultural
Development (AOAD) and AMWC. This ministerial meeting was concluded with a call for
the effective integration of water and food security issues into the national sustainable
development strategies and the adoption of the Cairo Declaration urging governments and
partners to reinforce regional coordination and to harmonize policies across both sectors
to face the impacts of climate change and water scarcity.
The High-Level Joint Committee for Water and Agriculture strives to achieve greater
institutional coordination between the agriculture and water sectors, particularly to
improve intergovernmental coordination to support policy coordination and coherence for
optimizing water use in the agriculture sector and for food production, both at the national
and regional levels. So far, the High-Level Joint Committee for Water and Agriculture has
set five priority areas of work (Figure 8.3).

The achievements of this cross-sectoral cooperation include drafting an action plan
for the implementation of the Cairo Declaration, adopting a regional guideline for water
allocation in the agriculture sector and issuing a scoping paper on the use of nonconventional water resources. Work is in progress to pilot the water use allocation
guidelines in several Arab states.

8.5.4 Regional networks and initiatives
Several regional partnerships and cooperation initiatives have been initiated in the region
in response to water priorities such as implementing IWRM and finding solutions to
deal with the consequences of water scarcity or climate change. These initiatives have
succeeded in bringing together partners and building synergies to address regional
challenges and priorities of the water sector.

RICCAR
The Regional Initiative for the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources
and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region (RICCAR) is the outcome of the first
Arab Ministerial Declaration on Climate Change (2007), which recognized the potential
impacts that climate change may have on development in the Arab region (UNESCWA,
n.d.a). RICCAR is implemented through an inter-agency collaborative partnership involving
11 partner organizations,53 including UNESCWA. Commitment and support for the initiative
have been further articulated by Arab states through follow-up resolutions adopted by
AMWC, the Arab Permanent Committee for Meteorology (APCM) and the Council of Arab
Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE). The regional initiative aims to assess
the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources in the Arab region and to examine

RICCAR is implemented through an inter-agency collaborative partnership involving 11 partner organizations,
namely UNESCWA, the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands (ACSAD), FAO, the Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the League of Arab States Secretariat, the Swedish
Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) Cairo Office, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations
Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and
Health (UNU-INWEH), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). In addition to the resources provided by
the partner agencies, funding is provided by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)
and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which financially support
RICCAR through the Adaptation to Climate Change in the Water Sector in the Middle East and North Africa Region
(ACCWaM) project (UNESCWA et al., 2017).

their implications for socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities, based on regional
specificities (UNESCWA et al., 2017). In 2017, it has launched the first Arab domain climate
modelling ensembles, which in turn are used to assess the impact of climate change on
subdomains and transboundary resources in the Arab region.
Specific outcomes of RICCAR in relation to regional cooperation include (RICCAR, n.d.):
• Establishing an Arab knowledge hub on climate and water;
• Creating a common platform for assessing, addressing and identifying regional climate
change challenges;
• Providing a common and comparable scientific understanding of climate change
impacts and associated vulnerabilities across the Arab region;
• Increasing the capacity of Arab water ministries and meteorological institutions to
engage in climate prediction and climate change projection; and
• Informing policy dialogue, negotiations and exchange among Arab decision-makers.

WSI
The FAO Water Scarcity Regional Initiative (WSI) was established in 2013 as a ‘partnership
platform’ for strengthening coordination and collaboration among institutional partners
(FAO, 2013). Partners54 signed a ‘Partnership Pledge’ expressing their strong interest
and willingness to work together to support the implementation of relevant collaborative
strategies, in the context of the Arab Water Security Strategy and the Arab Strategy
for Sustainable Agricultural Development (2005–2025). The primary focus areas of
the initiative include: (i) adopting global standards for water accounting systems;
(ii) expanding the knowledge base for irrigation efficiency and water productivity;
(iii) improving groundwater governance; (iv) using non-conventional water resources;
(v) adapting to climate change; (vi) managing drought; and (vii) implementing scenario
analysis, including the water–energy–food nexus approach, to identify safe operational
boundaries for water.
Specific outputs of WSI collaborative initiative include:
• Coordinated planning and implementation of joint activities between regional partners;
• Better understanding of, and responding to, countries’ priority areas/needs;
• Contribution to updating and enhancing the scope of ongoing and future regional
strategies in water, food and climate change; and
• Supporting member countries in issuing policies and identifying sustainable practices
in agriculture to boost productivity, improve food security and better manage water
resources.

AWARENET
The Arab Integrated Water Resources Management Network (AWARENET) is an
independent regional network of training and research institutes, NGOs, government
institutions, civil society and experts in the field of water, engaged in the elaboration and
delivery of capacity development programmes and resource materials on IWRM policies
and practices for the Arab region. Part of the International Capacity Development
Network for Sustainable Water Management’s (Cap-Net UNDP) global network of
networks, AWARENET was established in March 2002 with support from UNESCWA
and a number of regional and international organizations, and is currently hosted by
UNESCWA. It aims to spread knowledge through sharing experiences and information
during workshops and trainings. AWARENET currently includes more than 680 members
from the Arab region – of which at least 30% are women – and has worked on capacity
development through structured training on several topics, including IWRM, innovative
technologies and climate change assessments (AWARENET, n.d.).
Outcomes of AWARENET (UNESCWA, n.d.b) include:
• Raising regional understanding and awareness about water-related challenges in
the Arab region;
• Offering capacity-building activities;
• Initiating regional forums and discussion groups; and
• Creating professional opportunities.

8.5.5 Conclusions
The Arab region is a water-scarce region facing many challenges exacerbated
by climate change impacts, high dependency on transboundary water resources,
low irrigation efficiency in the agricultural sector, and conflict, among others. This
more than ever necessitates national and regional cooperation and partnerships to
collectively meet the region’s growing water needs.
Several cooperation and partnership arrangements have already been initiated in the
Arab region despite the financial and political barriers that might hinder collaboration.
These arrangements have demonstrated the importance of collaborative efforts,
trust-building processes and data exchange for better water management. Such
cooperation arrangements and partnerships are a starting point and a prototype
for replication across Arab countries. However, given the immense challenges,
more partnerships and increased collaboration are needed to accelerate the level
of achievement of the water-related goals, especially to secure additional financing,
advance innovation and share information.

Introduction

Optimal access to a relevant knowledge base is essential to make informed decisions on water
resources and water-related risk management, to empower local communities to take action to
achieve water security, and to minimize negative impacts on people’s access and safety.
Education and capacity development are crucial to establish this knowledge base, and
to accelerate the development, adoption and institutionalization of more sustainable and
equitable water management practices. Education and capacity development are activities
that involve the sharing of knowledge and skills, both of which are impossible without
partnerships between teachers, (experienced and novice) students, institutions, and other
providers and recipients of information.
The type and modality of these partnerships is changing rapidly, both because of a change
in the requirements and needs of decision-makers, but also because of new opportunities
and approaches to implement and enhance education and capacity-building for sustainable
development (Alaerts and Zeverbergen, 2022).
Technological progress is a major driver of such new opportunities. The recent COVID-19
pandemic, in particular, has given a major boost to the development of digital content and
the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) for teaching and training
worldwide. For example, the International Capacity Development Network for Sustainable
Water Management (Cap-Net UNDP) experienced a 200% increase in demand for online
courses during the pandemic (Cap-Net, 2019; 2021).
Awareness that scientific knowledge needs to be better integrated with other knowledge
bases, such as local and indigenous knowledge, is also increasing. This is particularly
relevant for managing water resources and risks. In many parts of the world, water
management is shaped by local knowledge and practices, such as the qanat systems of
northern Africa and the Middle East (ICQHS, n.d.), or water sowing and harvesting in the
Andes (Ochoa-Tocachi et al., 2019).
Integrating these diverse knowledge bases requires strengthening, and furthering the
adoption of multidirectional forms of knowledge exchange, such as occurs in communities
of practice and professional networks. As women often play a major role in traditional water
management, this also provides opportunities for women’s empowerment and gender
mainstreaming (Feijoo and Fürst, 2021).
Maximizing these opportunities poses several challenges. Some of them are technical in
nature, such as creating inclusive online platforms and systems that maximize access to
disadvantaged groups and communities. But partnerships for more efficient, sustainable
and equitable education and capacity development on water can also benefit from a stronger
adoption of approaches such as communities of practice, citizen science, open innovation
and life-long learning.

9.2
Education
and training

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on most aspects of human society,
including on scientific and educational practices. In some cases, this has hindered the
generation of knowledge and capacity, including the delivery of training needed to achieve
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
However, the pandemic has also accelerated the development and uptake of novel
approaches to education, training and capacity development, making use of the latest ICT
technologies. An unprecedented body of online learning material has come online, from
recorded lectures to immersive 3-dimensional virtual field trips and so-called massive open
online courses (MOOCs).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

This provides a unique opportunity to support education and capacity development
worldwide, particularly for the Global South. Although a substantial share of this material
has been made available for free online, active partnerships are needed to make the most
of this evolution in the context of water management. The application of e-learning in poor
regions remains a challenge, in part because of a lack of basic facilities such as reliable
internet connections and ICT equipment. E-learning materials should also be adapted to
the local geographical, cultural and socio-economic context, translated to local languages,
and disseminated to relevant interest groups. This is particularly relevant for water. Many
textbooks and e-learning materials mostly use data and examples from temperate regions
such as Europe and North America. Hydrometeorological and climate conditions, as well
as infrastructure availability, are very different in the tropics, where water security is most
severely threatened and capacity is most limited.

In many parts of
the world, water
management is
shaped by local
knowledge and
practices

North–South and South–South inter-institutional educational collaboration can make
e-learning materials locally relevant, improve their quality, and train local teachers and
academics to make best use of those materials in local curricula. The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Water Family, which includes
approximately 30 water-related category 2 centres as well as 70 water-related UNESCO
Chairs and the University Twinning and Networking Programme (UNITWIN),55 is a prime
example of a partnership that aims to enhance institutional and human capacities through
knowledge-sharing and collaboration. The category 2 centres also function as regional and
global hubs to foster collaborative action and capacity development on strategic priorities
including water.
The increased flexibility and accessibility of e-learning also presents a unique opportunity
to widen participation, and to stimulate the rights and access to education for women.
Partnerships between e-learning content providers and representatives of underrepresented
groups can reinforce the development of material that promotes inclusion, widening
participation and gender equality. Concerning the latter, the Global Multi-stakeholder
Coalition that supports the ‘Call for Action to accelerate gender equality in the water domain’
initiative,56 coordinated by UNESCO’s World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP), is a
recent example of an active partnership that spurs the development and implementation of
gender-inclusive strategies and transformative actions. The Global Coalition is composed
of Member States’ institutions, UN agencies, international and regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), official development assistance (ODA) agencies, and
representatives of the private sector and civil society.
Despite these and other opportunities, vocational and practical education remains a
challenge for e-learning. Many practical skills in water management require a combination
of theoretical understanding and tactile experience that can only be acquired by doing, with
proper on-site coaching and mentoring. Online demonstrations, tutorials and videos, for
example on laboratory procedures or hydrometric measurements, can support in-person
learning. But this will require building partnerships between e-learning providers, on-site
teachers and mentors, and professionals like water resources technicians. Ensuring the local
relevance and applicability of the taught skills, tools and instruments in local hydrological
settings is key in such partnerships (Box 9.1).
Greater uptake and development of open science, as advocated by the UNESCO
Recommendation on Open Science, can also support local relevance of, access to, and
dissemination of training materials (UNESCO, 2021). Open Science promotes not only the
co-development and sharing of knowledge (e.g. through open courseware), but also tools
and techniques to create locally relevant knowledge, for example through open software,

open laboratories and open innovation. An example of successful collaborative Open
Science is open-source hardware, which applies the open-source philosophy to the design
of technology such as computing devices, sensors and networking devices, among others
(see Section 11.2). This has yielded popular products such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino
microcomputers57 and fostered global collaborative development efforts among volunteers
and enthusiasts – often referred to as the maker community (Tauro et al., 2019).
These efforts have produced a wealth of online information and documentation that support
new partnerships between technology providers and end users, including in areas such
as hydrological and meteorological observations. For example, the Trans-African HydroMeteorological Observatory (TAHMO)58 leverages open-source hardware technology to
develop and install a network of weather stations across Africa. TAHMO partners with local
universities and companies to develop new agricultural and hydro-meteorological farming
services, as well as teaching and training.
Open-source technologies are also instrumental in supporting citizen science. Many citizen
science projects are cross-disciplinary partnerships that bring together scientists, water
professionals and the broader public. These projects often have a strong educational
dimension, and are increasingly used to build awareness on local issues, such as water
pollution and equitable resource allocation, and to increase transparency and inclusivity
(Fraisl et al., 2020). Because of their practical approach, citizen science projects can also
be instrumental in involving youth and young professionals. Citizen science projects using
low-cost weather stations have been used worldwide to teach schoolchildren about local
meteorological and hydrological processes (e.g. Paul et al., 2020; see Section 11.3).

Partnerships that focus on knowledge co-creation instead of knowledge transfer aim to
embrace the diversity of expertise and experience within a knowledge system. This is
particularly relevant in the context of water. In many parts of the world, water resources
management practices incorporate traditional elements, ranging from local expert
knowledge on spring water availability and flood frequency, to highly sophisticated systems
such as ancient water sowing and harvesting (e.g. paar systems in western Rajasthan, India,
and amunas in Peru). This can (and should) also include the knowledge and experience
of women (Feijoo and Fürst, 2021), who often play an integral role in water management,
especially in rural settings.
Over the last decades, engineering-based water management approaches have often
disfavoured traditional practices, which risk being phased out or forgotten (Kreamer, 2021).
However, the limitations of engineering solutions based on large-scale infrastructure
are becoming increasingly clear. Their high capital costs and limited flexibility hinder the
development of adaptive water resources management in the face of the uncertain effects
of climate change. Local practices, which are often based on natural processes that provide
multiple ecosystem services, have the potential to add such flexibility and adaptive capacity
(Vörösmarty et al., 2021).
Integrating local solutions in river basin and aquifer management require partnerships
between governments, water supply companies and local communities. In 2014, the
Peruvian government passed a law on the implementation of benefit-sharing mechanisms
for ecosystem services (Box 9.2). This law requires water supply companies to invest in
watershed interventions that benefit downstream water users and upstream communities

Box 9.1 H2O Maghreb: A training partnership responding to Morocco’s water challenges
The lack of a skilled workforce in a water-scarce country like Morocco prevents industry and agriculture from exploiting the full
potential of growth (through improved water use efficiency and water quality/pollution control, among others). Responding to
Morocco’s water challenges, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) launched the project H2O Maghreb
in 2017, as a public–private development partnership between the Moroccan government, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), the Moroccan National Institute for Water and Electricity (ONEE), and the private sector
partners Festo Didactic SE and EON Reality (UNIDO, 2019). Festo Didactic and EON Reality have created a Virtual Reality
Aquatronics training simulator that features several water and wastewater scenarios in which users interact with a virtual water
treatment plant, operate machinery and perform emergency procedures. Virtual reality applications introduce professionals to
new disciplines and technologies, as well as to situations that are dangerous and difficult to reproduce.
H2O Maghreb introduces cutting-edge solutions to urgent water needs in Morocco and the region, while improving the skills
and employability of young Moroccans by providing them with a market-driven training programme in a newly established
water training hub (USAID, 2022). By developing a new water management curriculum, the project brought together the public
and private sector to provide innovative training and equipment. The H2O Maghreb training programme combines elements
from different professions (e.g. mechanics, electronics, hydraulics, chemistry, biology) to address the challenges of improving
water management, access to water and water quality in a systematic manner (UNIDO, 2019).
Additional information about the H2O Maghreb training programme can be found at https://lkdfacility.org/h2o-maghreb/.

that live in water supply areas. This has incentivized partnerships between government
agencies, such as the Peruvian water industry regulator SUNASS, water supply companies
and representatives of local civil society (Dextre et al., 2022).
Such partnerships for knowledge co-production prompt scientists to engage in a dialogue
with other knowledge bases and develop ways to integrate these in novel solutions for
water security. This requires transdisciplinary approaches, bringing together experts in
technical water management with disciplines such as public policy, human geography,
gender and anthropology.
One way to foster such partnerships is by establishing communities of practice around
specific challenges, such as developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies
(Chapter 7). These challenges can bring together theorists, practitioners and beneficiaries,
and achieve the diversity that is needed to develop robust, innovative and inclusive
approaches that respect the rights of all stakeholders (UN-Water, n.d.).

9.4
Life-long
learning

Life-long learning (i.e. continuous development) is becoming an increasingly recognized
driver of the creation and application of innovative solutions in many sectors, including water
(RWSN, 2022). However, life-long learning can only be successful if it starts from a solid base
of essential skills and understanding of water processes and technologies. This requires
more and stronger global partnerships to provide high-quality and locally relevant vocational
and high-education training programmes.
Stronger partnerships between educators and water professionals can help training
programmes adapt to changing needs, for example by creating specialized training courses
that fill specific gaps or meet specific demands. This is especially relevant for women and
professionals from rural regions in the Global South (RWSN, 2022), and can be supported
by networks such as learned societies and communities of practice. Life-long learning also
broadens career development pathways and can promote workforce retention.

Box 9.2 Partnering for sustainable water management: The Andean monitoring network iMHEA
The Initiative for the Hydrological Monitoring of Andean Ecosystems (iMHEA) was founded in 2009
by the NGO CONDESAN (Consortium for the Sustainable Development of the Andean Eco-Region)
as a small grassroots network of professionals from academia and civil society, with a common
interest in understanding the impact of land use on Andean water resources. It has since then grown
into a network of 22 partners, monitoring 51 catchment areas at 24 sites along the Andes. iMHEA
started as a technical network sharing expertise on data collection, analysis and experimental design,
evolving into a broader knowledge co-creation partnership with a stronger focus on community
involvement, knowledge exchange and support for local decision-making.
In Peru, the network has played an instrumental role in the operationalization of a new law on hydroecosystem benefit-sharing mechanisms (MERESE). Several water companies responsible for the
implementation of MERESE projects have become a member of iMHEA, receiving access to expertise
on hydrological sensor technologies, monitoring protocols and data analysis.
iMHEA operates largely as a virtual network with online documentation, seminars and meetings,
but it organizes a yearly in-person assembly for training, discussion and interaction. It does not
receive central funding but relies on contributions from its members and joint fund raising. Two
remarkable characteristics of this network are its grassroots origins and open nature, and its focus
on knowledge-sharing between academia, government, industry and civil society.
Source: iMHEA (n.d.).

Partnerships between scientists, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists
can support the integration of new technologies and innovation in
capacity development, through the incubation of start-up companies, the
creation of innovation hubs, and the local commercialization of new ideas
and solutions (see Chapter 11). This has the potential to create new jobs
and commercial activity, but also to actively stimulate the participation of
women and minorities in the workforce.
In each of these efforts, rigorous and transparent monitoring and
evaluation of the impact of education and training is essential to track
progress, and to ensure accountability.

Introduction

Transparency in
data generation
and informationsharing
strengthens
trust among the
various and often
competing users of
water resources

Data and information provide evidence as to where, when and how much water resources
there are, how they are used, and how their management can be sustainably improved.
Despite the essential importance of data and information in water-related decision-making,
a range of challenges exists in producing holistic data sets, including a general lack of data
across all use sectors, limited sex-disaggregated data (Miletto et al., 2019), temporal and
spatial variability in local water availability, and difficulties (or reluctance) in sharing data,
especially across international borders (Mukuyu et al., 2020).
To achieve the targets of the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6), developing and
enhancing partnerships and cooperation are required to bring together concerned parties
at global, regional and national scales. Key partners include researchers and data providers,
as well as investors and implementers such as governments, civil society, businesses
and development agencies. A broader engagement process involving partners in prioritysetting, planning, data collection and joint development of data governance mechanisms
fosters collective ownership. Recognition of each partners’ mandate and role, emphasizing
complementarities and synergies, supports the establishment and development of
appropriate partnerships.
Building the trust or realize successful partnerships to support data, information and
monitoring activities will require time, transparency and mutual respect. At initial stages,
areas of common interest need to be explored, expectations discussed, trust built and a
common understanding constructed of what the partnership will ultimately seek to achieve.
Throughout the partnership, consultation, communication and consensus-building are
critical in supporting these processes.
The SDG6 Global Acceleration Framework (UN-Water, 2020) highlights data and information
as one of the five key accelerators needed to meet set targets for attaining sustainable
water and sanitation for all. Transparency in data generation and information-sharing
strengthens trust among the various and often competing users of water resources. This
chapter highlights partnerships and cooperative efforts that show potential for improving the
generation and application of water-related data and information.

10.2
Transforming
data into
information and
action

The breadth and scope of water-relevant data is vast. Partnerships are therefore necessary
to ensure that relevant data are effectively generated and processed into useful information.
As such, partnerships have the potential to ultimately influence policies, investments and
decisions towards meeting the SDG 6 targets.
Information is arguably more important than data, as the practical use of data is limited
unless converted into information. While the conversion process should be unbiased and
transparent, this is not always the case – indeed, the process might be highly political. And
while data may be considered to be neutral (depending on what, where and when data are
collected, and by whom), the information generated after data analysis may not be. This is
why open cooperation and participation, involving both information generators and users,
are paramount.
Some examples of how data are transformed into information for application in decision-making,
and ultimately action, are provided in Table 10.1.
Considering demographic and other socio-economic aspects of water data enhances their
potential for application and use. Gender disaggregation of data, for example concerning
access to water supply services, is critical in pinpointing the actual beneficiaries, leading
to interventions designed to provide more equitable allocations of the often limited water
resources. Data analytics on marginalized groups, such as women and children, help target

developmental assistance, investments and policy reforms where they are most needed
(Miletto et al., 2019). Partnerships bringing together local community organizations,
service providers and regulatory authorities can be key to ensuring that data generated are
representative. In general, the more data are disaggregated, the greater their potential for
practical analysis.

10.3
Data generation
and sharing

The majority of water-related data pertain either to water availability (including quality) or to
water use. Monitoring water resources’ quality and quantity generates data that can foster a
general understanding of water availability and guide its equitable allocation (see Box 9.2).
Open-access global data repositories can be used at national and regional scales, but such
data tend to lack the spatial resolution required for more targeted interventions. The data,
where available, are generally not disaggregated. Government agencies tasked with resource
monitoring and management often lack the capacity to generate all the data needed to
address emerging water-related economic and social issues.
In view of strengthening its national data managements systems, South Africa, for example,
has developed a data management strategy for water and sanitation, proposing three main
interventions for partnerships: (i) form partnerships and intergovernmental cooperation
agreements for data-sharing; (ii) negotiate data-sharing agreements; and (iii) ensure
adherence to data-sharing agreements (DWS, 2020).
Joint monitoring of transboundary water resources promotes a shared understanding of
the system and provides a platform where data can be shared in real time and applied in a
timely manner. As more data are generated, water use planning can thus be supported by
evidence to harness shared benefits across the transboundary landscape and manage water
in transboundary basins or aquifers more sustainably.
The value of collaboration in data collection should not be underestimated, especially in a
transboundary context (Box 10.1). Joint monitoring can defuse potential cross-boundary
tensions before they manifest, and enhance trust across borders (United Nations, 2022).
Data exchange in transboundary basins may sometimes fall short of its objectives in terms
of facilitating data-driven decision-making. A global assessment of shared basins revealed
that a reasonable proportion of river basins exchange some data, but the breadth of such

Box 10.1 Joint monitoring of groundwater levels across borders
In the Tuli Karoo Transboundary aquifer system shared by Botswana, South Africa and
Zimbabwe, efforts to generate data about the system have been improved through
cooperation. Prior to this intervention, monitoring had not been managed in an integrated
manner, resulting in limited spatial and temporal data about the system and how it can
sustainably support the livelihoods of the mainly rural communities through food security and
climate resilience. Joint groundwater-monitoring allows for the assessment of long-term and
annual changes in aquifer storage due to climate change and water withdrawals.
Collaboration among the three country governments, the regional entity (the Southern
African Development Community Groundwater Management Institute) and the basin
organization (the Limpopo Watercourse Commission) led to the co-design of the
groundwater monitoring system.

exchange is often limited and irregular (Mukuyu et al., 2020). The open exchange of data
is often driven by mutual needs, for example to minimize flood impacts or to manage
transboundary infrastructure. As such, data-sharing is much more likely to be considered
successful if it responds to a palpable need and serves practical uses, as opposed to feeding
data ‘graveyards’ where data are collected and not interpreted and applied (IWMI, 2021;
Alferes et al., 2014).
Transboundary actors such as river basin organizations, national government entities,
academic institutions, as well as development organizations, are repositories of data that
can be streamlined and shared through shared platforms. In order to harmonize various
databases, within and across borders, linkages need to be created beyond government
institutions, including with private data partners, such as private companies (Kölbel et al.,
2018) and landowners.
Partnerships also offer the opportunity to validate and verify generated data, thereby
improving data reliability.

Data, information and monitoring

10.4
Data
accessibility and
interoperability

In many countries, obtaining access to data and sharing them transparently remain important
challenges. Water-related data, in particular, are often generated by different users (or
‘sectors’) and therefore not interoperable for multiple users due to differences in terminology
and other factors (Cantor et al., 2018). Transparency supports better management of water
resources and promotes accountability when dealing with challenges such as pollution and
over-abstraction.
In the United States of America (USA), California’s Open and Transparent Water Data
Platform59 brings together various interested parties (e.g. State and federal agencies, data
experts, data providers and data consumers) to build an integrated platform for sharing and
accessing water data (Cantor et al., 2018). These efforts are in line with the ‘FAIR’ principles
for data management – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Wilkinson et al.,
2016). Through interaction with various stakeholders, use cases for data were developed for
the State of California with the aim of addressing different data needs and creating linkages
and partnerships across sectors (Cantor et al., 2018).
Another example is provided by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which
has partnered with various entities to drive the generation and application of water data
through the World Water Data Initiative started by the Government of Australia. This initiative
encourages an ‘open water data policy’, where governments are encouraged to make their
data openly available and shared (Bureau of Meteorology, 2017).

10.5
Trends in
monitoring and
data accessibility

Shortcomings in the development and maintenance of infrastructure for monitoring surface
water – and especially groundwater – has resulted in data gaps in biophysical data. Coupled
with weak political will for supporting monitoring activities, funding for maintaining such
networks has been cited as a challenge for some national governments (UNECE, 2019).
However, with the advent of the digital era and the rollout and uptake of mobile phones,
the potential for data generation is phenomenal. The ability of satellites to produce
remotely sensed data, along with the internet of things and associated sensors, are also
increasingly providing high-frequency data in real time (Chapter 11), in some ways resulting
in a ‘drowning in data’ situation. Nonetheless, there is still a need for on-the-ground
monitoring data, which serve to validate and calibrate remote sensors and enable machine
learning. Such direct observation data, and mechanisms for data-sharing and strengthening
capacities, are still largely lacking, particularly in developing countries where limited
monitoring infrastructure, governance and technical capacity can be constraining.
Data management can be enhanced to improve direct benefit. When the time-lag between
data generation and application in decision-making is too long, the risk of a mismatch
between the two increases. The incompatibility of data with intended applications can
also impede usefulness. The data value chain has to be efficient to ensure that maximum
value is derived from generated data in order to address water scarcity, pollution and
other challenges in a timely manner. The idea of public data brokers in the context of
water resources management may be worth considering in terms of timely response and
the consolidation of data dispersed across numerous repositories. Data brokers typically
harness data from different sources and provide them to users in the form that is most
useful and actionable. One such example is the Water Point Data Exchange platform,60 which
harmonizes data from different sources to improve rural water access.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

According to the International Water Management Institute (IWMI): “Incentives for data
exchange may not be sufficiently evident to those involved in river basin management. One
way to stimulate data sharing is to focus on a common need, e.g., flood or drought mitigation,
or improving water quality to support ecosystem services. Such practical and tangible uses
of data may serve as a catalyst that enables increased data flows. Data-driven decisions
and policies have become more critical, particularly with the increased frequency of extreme
weather events as a result of climate change. Therefore, response times have to be shorter.
An adequate flow of data is needed to enable such responses” (IWMI, 2021, p. 5). The use and
application of data can thus be stimulated through aligning with specific needs.
There are new opportunities from digital innovations, ranging from the development of
novel sensors to emerging remote sensing applications, as well as the quantitative and
qualitative data generated through social media and citizen science (see Section 11.3).

Shortcomings in

and maintenance

and especially

data gaps in
biophysical data

Remote sensing from Earth observation allows platforms to support flood awareness
and preparedness, particularly at the scale of large transnational river basins. The Global
Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)61 provides meteorological situation maps, early flood
detection (up to 30 days in advance) and seasonal river flow outlooks (up to 16 weeks
in advance). NASA’s Near Real Time Global Flood Mapping System also provides near
real-time data for response during flooding disasters. This same information is also
valuable for flood mitigation, preparedness and recovery, including for planning large-scale
infrastructure, settling insurance claims following flood disasters, and planning community
rebuilding.62
Web-based platforms can enable users to: (i) receive and analyse sensed rainfall data;
(ii) convert rainfall data into runoff through calibrated hydrological modelling; (iii) receive
and analyse sensed hydrometric data; (iv) conduct hydrodynamic numerical simulations
forced with hydrometric data or other hydrological data; and (v) translate the results
of a combination of numerical results and sensed data into parameters that may be
communicated to authorities to trigger alert levels or to issue warnings (Sweta, 2014;
Woldegebrael et al., 2022).
At the regional level, the FANFAR63 project (Reinforced cooperation to provide operational
flood forecasting and alerts in West Africa) gathers a cascade of actors from various
disciplines at regional, national and local levels from 17 countries in West and Central
Africa (Figure 10.1) where flooding is a growing concern due to climate change. Flood risk
notifications can be provided through e-mail and SMS to subscribed users.
National and subnational flood monitoring initiatives and early warning systems generally
focus on emergency response (alerts and warnings) or preparedness (risk assessment).
The Iowa Flood Inundation System64 (IFIS) (Demir et al., 2018), for example, is a
comprehensive decision support system that provides real-time information on streams
and weather, forecasts, maps and damage estimates for floods in the State of Iowa in
the USA. As a way to promote inclusive participation, IFIS has augmented reality features
to raise awareness and inform decision-makers, including a holographic visualization of
inundation in some locations.

Next steps

Three key interventions targeted at basin and country levels could accelerate the generation,
application and exchange of water-related data and information to enable effective water
management and speed up achievement of SDG 6 targets:
1. Encourage partnerships between state and non-state actors in generating, harmonizing
and interpreting water-related data, streamlined into established data management and
information systems;
2. Strengthen cooperation around transboundary joint monitoring and data and information
exchange for sustainable basin and aquifer management through targeted actions that
promote application of data and information;
3. Promote more participative data generation, analysis and information-sharing, for example
through the inclusion of women and youth, with increasing focus on disaggregated data
on socio-economic indicators and the use of traditional knowledge.
In support of all of the above, there is a need to build awareness around water resource
monitoring and data and information management as well as to strengthen individual and
institutional capacity across and within societies, organizations and sectors to improve
water management. Ultimately, the aim is to reduce vulnerability, and increase resilience and
sustainability.

Introduction

Managing global water resources and water-related risks relies on a wide range of
technologies, from measuring water fluxes and stores in the natural environment
to drinking water and wastewater treatment, desalination, and grey water recycling.
Partnerships can accelerate the development and uptake of innovative technologies
through knowledge transfer, entrepreneurship and applied research.
Taking account of social innovations, for example regarding working conditions, education,
community development or health, can further enhance these partnerships, making them
more transparent, robust, sustainable, resilient and inclusive.
But the introduction of both technological and social innovations also incurs challenges
and risks. New technologies may be developed or leveraged by specific interest groups
and elites, and reinforce existing inequalities. Social innovation may require large time
investments for dialogue, or create conflicts if the process fails. Adequate safeguards and
policies should be designed to minimize these risks.

11.2
Technological
innovations

Technological innovations are reshaping all facets of water management. As Chapter 10
describes, new information and communication technologies give unprecedented
opportunities to monitor, diagnose and control water resources systems from source to
tap. New technologies are making the exploitation of new and non-conventional water
sources more feasible. For example, solar energy may allow harvesting drinking water
from the air (Lord et al., 2021), simultaneous production of electricity and freshwater
(Wang et al., 2019), or strengthening the water–food–energy system resilience (e.g.,
the Agrophotovoltaics in Africa project implemented by UNU-EHS, (n.d.)). Innovations
in treatment technologies are creating opportunities for the recycling and reuse of
wastewater (WWAP, 2017).
Digitization is increasingly making available practices, tools and other resources that
are in turn ushering in a new era of water management. The increased use of internet of
things (IoT), sensor technologies and modelling applications is creating opportunities to
monitor water management systems more accurately. Analysing these data streams relies
increasingly on technologies such as big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence.
Making best use of new technologies will require the strengthening and extension of
traditional partnerships, but also the development and implementation of novel modes
of collaboration and new business models for innovation and technological acceleration.
Strengthening and extending South–North and South–South partnerships between
universities encourages the transfer of new technologies and innovative skills. Business
incubators and accelerators can facilitate partnerships between universities, budding
entrepreneurs and venture capital providers. Such incubators are becoming increasingly
common in the developed world but should be strengthened and expanded in middle- and
low-income countries. Partnerships through the creation of communities of practice for
knowledge co-creation and innovation with partners from the North and South could go a
long way towards developing technically feasible, economically viable, socially acceptable
and locally adaptable solutions in response to core challenges in the field of water security.
Intellectual property issues, such as restrictive licences and patents, can pose challenges
to the sharing of technologies, even within partnerships. The adoption of the Open Science
principles (see Section 9.2), as advocated by the UNESCO Recommendation on Open
Science, can help avoid intellectual property issues and promote a more sustainable and
equitable approach to technology-sharing (UNESCO, 2021). These principles are well
established in software development, where they have been a major driver of leveraging

information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D). It is increasingly
adapted beyond software, in fields such as computational hardware, data management
systems and environmental systems. The development and dissemination of open
hardware solutions rely strongly on global partnerships of volunteers and enthusiasts,
often referred to as the maker community.
Examples of open hardware-based solutions in the water domain include water
quantity and quality sensing solutions, such as the Mayfly data logger,65 or the water
sensors developed by the University of Minnesota (USA).66 Developing innovation and
commercialization partnerships based on open-science principles may require a different
approach to business model development, relying less on licencing revenue and more on
services. A successful example of such a business is the woman-owned company mWater,
which provides a data platform for the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector, using
an innovative, free and open-access business model.67
Novel partnerships across the wider water and sanitation industry are needed to
accelerate the uptake of new technologies for water processing, distribution and
treatment. These industries tend to be risk-averse, and innovation needs to be fully
integrated in a wider value chain (Leflaive et al., 2020). This can be achieved through
partnerships between industry and technology providers, such as universities and
entrepreneurs. Such initiatives can help create job opportunities, for example for youth
in the Global South who have grown up with digital technologies, and who can apply
the acquired skills to leapfrog the classic development path. This may boost economic
growth and job creation in many key sectors of the economy, while also providing
pathways out of poverty. Maximizing this potential requires well-designed policy
frameworks that stimulate demand for innovation, typically by making visible the costs of
prevailing approaches and signalling the benefits of innovation.

New partnerships can also emerge from social innovations (i.e. new social practices that
address social needs better than existing solutions), of which the rise of citizen science
is a prominent example. Citizen science is essentially a partnership between professional
scientists and citizen volunteers to further scientific knowledge in a specific area or topic.
While citizen science has its roots in the scientific discovery process, it is increasingly
applied to generate evidence for decision-making.
Citizen science can act as an agent of social inclusion and local-level participation and
bring a sense of ownership in shaping evidence-based policies. Its approach often contains
a series of steps that build the capacities of the local representative target groups to better
identify outstanding and common issues. In this regard, citizen science brings leadership
and ownership together, as well as global and local concerns and solutions.
Early citizen science projects in the water sector were mostly related to weather
observations, either manually or through personal automatic weather stations. However,
the increasing availability of technologies has triggered a broader range of citizen science
projects in water, of which water quality is particularly popular (e.g. the Earthwatch
Freshwater Watch project).68

Citizen science projects have predominantly originated in highly developed regions, but the
application of citizen science projects in a development context is increasing (Box 11.1).
This can have a range of benefits beyond the creation of new scientific evidence. It can
increase the transparency, trustworthiness and credibility of water management, and be a
powerful tool to enhance awareness and motivate behavioural change (Nardi et al., 2021;
European Commission, n.d.). Moreover, it enables groups and individuals to participate in
the generating of scientific evidence that may otherwise be left out.

Citizen science is one example of a larger and broader effort to develop new and innovative
partnerships to enhance participation and collaboration within the water sector. In the
United Kingdom (UK), the Catchment Based Approach (CaBA)69 is a recently established
collaborative platform between civil society, the government, local water authorities, water
companies and business to promote an inclusive approach to river basin management.
CaBA partnerships are actively working in more than 100 river catchments with the aim of
protecting the water environment and maximizing the environmental, social and economic
benefits they generate. Forty percent of these partnerships carry out monitoring and citizen
science. The CaBA directly supports many of the targets of the UK Government’s 25 Year
Environment Plan.
Establishing such partnerships is crucial to support the development and implementation
of catchment interventions such as nature-based solutions (NBS) (WWAP/UN-Water,
2018) and climate resilience water management (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020). However,
the multi-benefit and multi-stakeholder nature of interventions such as NBS can entail a
potentially complex design and negotiation process to balance the benefits and potential
disadvantages of different intervention scenarios. It is necessary to include stakeholders
from outside the water sector in these partnerships to develop and implement
arrangements such as benefit-sharing and compensation between upstream and
downstream populations within a river basin.
Water funds (see Boxes 3.1 and 8.2; Chapter 12) are increasingly popular mechanisms to
achieve such benefit-sharing. One of the oldest and most successful initiatives is the Fund
for the Protection of Water of the city of Quito (FONAG, n.d.). FONAG was established in
2000 as a partnership between the water supply company of Quito and the international
environmental non-governmental organization (NGO) The Nature Conservancy, but it
currently includes several other commercial, governmental and civil society actors.
With an allocated yearly budget of US$3.4 million, the fund currently manages around
20,000 hectares of land within the Guayllabamba River basin, for the purpose of improving
the reliability and quality of Quito’s water supply, as well as enhancing biodiversity,
sustainable agriculture and local livelihoods.
Global climate change poses a complex challenge to sustainable catchment management,
imposing multiple stressors and risks, and requiring novel arrangements and partnerships
between affected stakeholders. One of such approaches is the Climate Risk Informed
Decision Analysis (CRIDA) methodology. CRIDA is the result of a multi-partner process
auspicated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO). It presents a methodological framework to implement participatory, bottom-up
approaches to the identification of water security risks related to hydro-climatic events.
This methodology promotes the involvement of local communities and stakeholders in
its design. By combining local insights with scientific evaluation and modelling, it aims
to identify the most useful and locally relevant adaptation strategies, and to design more
robust pathways that are in line with local needs (UNESCO/ICIWaRM, 2018).

11.4
Challenges

Developing and supporting partnerships for technological and social innovation holds
promise to make water management more efficient, robust and inclusive, but also faces
challenges. The inclusion of a wider range of stakeholders in the knowledge generation and
governance process inevitably reveals diverging interests, viewpoints or knowledge gaps,
increasing the potential for friction and conflict. This needs to be carefully managed, using
robust, transparent and fair negotiation processes.
The introduction of novel partnerships may also cause the disruption of established
governance processes. For example, citizen science can have a strong impact on local
environmental management processes. The resulting evidence of citizen science projects
can be used to contest decisions and support specific political agendas. But it can also
change power relations, as it tends to put this knowledge in the hands of actors that
traditionally do not participate actively in the governance process. This incurs a risk of
destabilizing the decision-making processes, a risk that needs to be managed carefully
(Dewulf et al., 2019).
Similarly, the introduction of new technologies and innovations, such as ICT to facilitate new
partnerships, may favour participation of those that are more knowledgeable and able to pick
up those technologies. Access to, and knowledge about, those technologies may be highly
uneven, especially in a development context where the poor may not have proper access
to internet, mobile phones and similar technologies, not to mention electricity. Care should
therefore be taken that the introduction of new technologies does not lead to unintended side
effects, such as a widening of the digital divide (Mirza et al., 2019).

Box 11.1 Citizen science for development
Citizen science is a partnership in which volunteers, scientists and potentially other partners jointly create
new scientific knowledge. While some projects focus only on the intellectual challenge, citizen science is
increasingly explored as a means to support sustainable development. For example, community-based
hydro-meteorological monitoring can help filling gaps in statutory monitoring networks and generate
information that can support local water resources management. Efforts in Ethiopia and Nepal have shown
that community-based monitoring can produce reliable and consistent measurements (Walker et al., 2016;
Davids et al., 2019). In South Africa, the Water Research Commission* is putting major efforts in engaging
citizens in water quality monitoring, while citizen science is also explored as a method to generate evidence
for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Fritz et al., 2019). A major challenge
of applying citizen science in a development context is to create sufficient value for volunteer participants to
ensure long-term sustainability of citizen science activities.

12.1
Introduction

Better cooperation can accelerate tackling the financing challenge for water security. The
overall levels of financing for water, which are projected to increase in the future, are well
below what is currently required. The estimated costs of meeting Sustainable Development
Goal 6 (SDG 6) exceed US$1 trillion per year, which is the equivalent to 1.2% of global gross
product (Strong et al., 2020). In particular, achieving universal and equitable access to safe
drinking water for all by 2030 could require tripling current investment levels (Hutton and
Varughese, 2016). These estimates underscore the urgency to scale up existing financing
flows for water.
Existing funds are best channelled where they deliver the greatest positive outcomes.
Evidence suggests that some water-related funds may be poorly targeted, failing to reach the
projects that maximize benefits (Andres et al., 2019; Leflaive and Hjort, 2020). Mistargeted
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) subsidies, for example, can be counterproductive and
potentially reduce the benefits of water services (United Nations, 2021).
Better cooperation across all stakeholders can both scale up current investments and help
channel existing funds more effectively. This requires strengthening cooperation both on
the demand side of finance, notably within the ‘water community’, such as water service
providers and users, and on the supply side of finance, including development finance
agencies and commercial investors. It also requires better coordination and communication
between the demand and supply side for water finance.

12.2
Cooperation on
the demand side
of finance

The demand side of finance refers to actors seeking funding and financing for water-related
projects. They include national and local governments responsible for water infrastructure
development; project developers (e.g. construction, engineering and maintenance firms);
water service providers (e.g. municipal water utilities); and households investing in domestic
sanitation facilities, among others. These actors might seek financing for the upfront costs of
a project, and funding for the operation and maintenance of existing assets through a recurrent
revenue stream (e.g. tariffs and user fees).
Better cooperation on the demand side of finance helps optimize the use of existing funds
and can generate additional funding streams. Water-related investments deliver benefits
to a variety of actors, sectors and policy domains. Investing in water recharge/retention
measures in a specific area, for example, can improve irrigation possibilities and livelihoods
for farmers, water availability for villages or industry, and maintain ecosystem functioning.
At the same time, some water-related interventions can potentially create negative effects for
other users – for example, a dam for water storage and hydropower production will invariably
affect water availability further downstream. This creates particular issues in transboundary
settings. As water-related interventions can have effects over the entire water system, the
catchment area or a specific landscape, they might positively or negatively affect future
investment opportunities over a longer time horizon (OECD, 2020a; Brown et al., 2022).
In practice, water-related investments often fail to adequately account for synergies and their
implications on other actors, sectors and overall water security. Stakeholders that operate in
single disciplinary silos and planning processes are often unable to support the design and
implementation of cross-cutting interventions (OECD, 2022; Alaerts, 2019; Cardascia, 2019).
In transboundary settings, there is a general lack of cooperation between riparian states
in many of the world’s basins, undermining funding for water resource management and
transboundary basin development (UNECE, 2021).
Improved cooperation can help account for these interdependencies, create synergies and
manage trade-offs more effectively, and thus optimize investment choices. Strong cooperation
across actors and sectors helps design integrated projects that pursue multiple policy goals
and select those that can unlock opportunities for others (OECD, 2022). A reforestation

project, for instance, can improve water quality, and at the same time open opportunities for
eco-tourism. Strong coordination across different policy objectives (e.g. on food security,
gender, and other Sustainable Development Goals) and strategic planning approaches that
account for future developments, such as climate change or demographics, ensure that
financial flows are channelled to projects that strengthen resilience and help avoid costly
retro-fitting, maladaptation and future additional investment needs (OECD, 2022; 2020a; Brown
et al., 2022). Box 12.1 gives an example for such a strategic planning approach in which water
investments are embedded in a larger development strategy. The Niger River basin provides
another example for an integrated planning approach, supported through development finance.
The German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) financed technical assistance to
develop a legal framework for transboundary cooperation and to prepare and implement a
comprehensive planning framework with a particular focus on the water–energy–food security
nexus for the basin (GIZ, n.d.; UNECE, 2021).
Better coordination across stakeholders can also generate additional funding streams for
water-related investments from various sources. Different actors can have an interest in
contributing to water security in their area; for example, both an environment ministry and
a beverage company might see benefits in investing in improved water quality. Cooperation
mechanisms are key for bringing these beneficiaries together and facilitate joint financing
of relevant projects. Water funds (see Boxes 3.1 and 8.2) are examples of multi-stakeholder
platforms that pool funding from various actors within a spatial area for nature-based
solutions (NBS) contributing to water security (Trémolet et al., 2019). One example is the
Monterrey Metropolitan Water Fund in Mexico that has leveraged US$9.1 million, including a
non-refundable contribution from an international brewery, into efforts aimed at maximizing
the environmental services provided by the San Juan River basin, which include increasing
infiltration and reducing runoff, as well as resilience and climate change adaptation (Latin
American Water Funds Partnership, n.d.). Another example of private actors investing in
improved water management practices is Danone and its suppliers in the United States of
America (USA), spending US$16 million to promote soil conservation practices to increase
water retention and protect watersheds and biodiversity (CDP, 2021).

The supply side of finance refers to the actors providing funding and financing for waterrelated investments. They include national and local governments managing public budgets
and procurement; public banks and development finance agencies (e.g. regional development
banks) offering grants and preferential loans; commercial financial institutions, such as private
banks or institutional investors (e.g. pension funds and insurance companies), providing debt
and equity financing; and philanthropy and other donors.
Water-related investments have historically been financed by public budgets, including
international transfers, with contributions from water users (e.g. water tariffs). Official
development assistance (ODA) for water70 increased steadily since the beginning of the
millennium, from US$2.7 billion in 2002 up to US$9.6 billion in 2018, then dropping to
US$8.7 billion in 2020 (Figure 12.1). Compared to other sectors, these funds represent a
minor share of total ODA, with just below 4% allocated to water over the 2016–2020 average
(OECD.stat, n.d.). In most instances, public and development finance are not used as a
catalytic force to crowd in additional capital, and private finance remains limited for waterrelated investments (OECD, 2019; 2022). To give an order of magnitude, the amount of private
finance mobilized through official development finance for water supply and sanitation
totalled US$4.6 billion between 2016 and 2020, compared to over US$48 billion for the energy
sector (Figure 12.2; OECD.stat, n.d.).

Box 12.1 Strategic investment pathways in Zambia
While financiers typically focus on the availability of a pipeline of bankable projects, government authorities and project
developers need to situate these pipelines within broader strategic investment pathways to ensure they are resilient
and contribute to water security and sustainable growth over the long term and broader spatial scale. The Zambian
2017–2021 National Development Plan (NDP) provides an example of how water is established as a contributor to a
range of development objectives and how water-related projects are strategically positioned and funded within a broader
development strategy.
The Zambian NDP consists of five strategic pillars, two of which are directly relevant to water: ‘economic diversification’ and
‘human welfare’. For the former, the NDP focuses on meeting increasing water demand for energy and agricultural production,
as well as domestic water needs, through the construction of small, medium and large dams. Additionally, inter-basin water
transfer schemes are promoted to transfer water resources from water-abundant to water-scarce parts of the country. For
the pillar on enhancing human welfare, expanding access to water and sanitation services (WSS) is a central component.
The NDP prioritizes infrastructure development in both rural and urban areas, efforts to improve resilience of WSS, as well
as education for better health. To cover its costs, the NDP explicitly refers to additional private finance for WSS and water
resources management, such as public–private partnerships (PPPs). In 2018, Zambia’s PPP Act was amended to strengthen
the legislative framework for PPPs and a dedicated PPP Department was established within the Ministry of Finance.
Overall, the plan’s clusters provide a platform for coordination among public and private actors to support project planning,
financing and implementation. Engagement in the NDP clusters also provides a means to contribute to the development of
the next NDP, and thus establishes a consistent long-term development strategy for the country.

Better cooperation among the different sources of finance can support co-financing
arrangements and leverage multiple sources of finance. Co-financing arrangements can
spread the risk of an investment among multiple financiers with differing risk appetites and
requirements. For example, risks and associated expected returns vary over time depending
on the phase of the project cycle: they decrease when a project is maturing, or through
public support financing. Different types of financiers and financial instruments can hence
be added or replaced in later project phases (Gietema, 2022; OECD, 2022; Money, 2017).
Further, ministries of finance play an important role in allocating public budgets and setting
the conditions for effective sector (co-)financing. They hold important coordination functions
both horizontally with other ministries and vertically with local governments and service
providers. In Mozambique, for example, the cooperation between the parliamentary Planning
and Budget Committee and the civil society organization Mozambique Budget Forum
contributed significantly to limiting budget cuts for the WASH sector (SWA, 2020).
Public or development finance can be used strategically to improve the risk–return profile
of a project and to mobilize additional private investment – so-called ‘blended finance’
arrangements. Development finance can reduce investment barriers for commercial actors
and serve as a market-building instrument (OECD, 2019; Goksu et al., 2017). Blended finance
approaches can be applied as a structuring instrument to reduce the perceived risk of a project,
for example through guarantees and other risk reduction mechanisms; or to enhance the
expected returns of a project, relative to its perceived risk, for example by covering up-front
costs and hence lowering the overall repayable costs of a project (OECD, 2022). They can
help transform ‘nearly bankable’ projects into viable projects. An example are public–private
partnerships (PPPs) for water infrastructure projects (Box 12.2). A key variable in such
arrangements is how investment risks are allocated across private and public financiers.
Traditionally, the public sector takes on a considerable share of the risk, while the private
investors’ risk remains relatively low, and thus more attractive. Some innovative co-financing
arrangements exist, which transfer parts of the risks to the private investors, for example in the
form of equity finance or performance-based repayment schemes (OECD, 2021a).

166

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Although essential to bridge the financing gap, high availability of development finance
tends to crowd out private finance, which stresses the need for stronger coordination across
development finance institutions. When development finance is easily accessible, it can
reduce the incentives for project owners to attract additional private finance. For example,
water utilities with easy access to concessional finance have lower incentives to strengthen
their performance and financial position required to access commercial finance. Hence,
this trend can impede greater accountability and financial sustainability of the sector and
create market distortions. In such cases, it is vital that blended finance arrangements have a
transitory and market-building nature with a clear exit strategy. This requires more structured
coordination and cooperation across development finance actors on their blended finance
engagement, beyond the single transaction. An innovative option could be to channel funds to
the users (e.g. households), supporting them with their water bills and thus providing a revenue
stream for the service provider. This could transform poor areas into a market segment and
help extend services to previously unserved areas (Kjellén, 2021). Generally, while there is
agreement about the need for better cooperation between development finance actors, in
practice there seems to be competition for ‘good’ investment opportunities, and actions on the
ground remain fragmented (OECD, 2019).
Further challenges around co-financing arrangements are their complexity and contextspecificity, leading to high transaction costs and rendering them difficult to replicate and
scale up. Strengthening capacity and technical assistance for both water and financial
actors, as well as improving the enabling environment for investment can help address these
challenges. Public funds can be used for project preparation and to lower transaction costs,
for pilot projects to develop and test new financing instruments in specific contexts, and to
support their scaling up (OECD, 2022; 2021b; AIIB, 2019).

12.4
Cooperation
between the
supply and
demand side of
finance

In addition to strong cooperation within the demand and supply sides of finance, improved
coordination and communication between them is vital to overcome existing investment
barriers and channel financing flows effectively. Better cooperation between the two
communities encompasses improved understanding of (i) the supply and demand side’s
respective perceptions, characteristics and requirements; (ii) intermediary institutions
and their diverse functions; and (iii) the translation of water-related risks and benefits into
expressions relevant and understandable to the financial sector.

12.4.1 Strengthening mutual understanding
Both on the supply and demand side of finance, there can be a lack of understanding
of the others’ distinct characteristics and requirements, and a mismatch in knowledge
and capacity between the two communities. On the demand side of finance, project
developers often have limited capacity to prepare bankable project proposals with adequate
documentation of risks and returns, necessary to attract financiers. Water infrastructure
projects often suffer from poor project pre-feasibility preparation and pipeline identification
structuring. Project developers might have limited understanding of the requirements of
lenders, and information on creditworthiness and performance of a potential project or its
borrowers might be lacking. On the supply side, financiers have limited knowledge of the
water sector and the related risks and opportunities. Existing financial mechanisms often do
not match the characteristics of the sector. Notably, financiers might lack data, track records
and adequate analytical tools to assess the risks associated to water-related investment,
which leads to perceived high risks, and lowers the attractiveness for lenders to invest in the
sector (Martini, 2022).
Although there is a variety of financiers with different risk–return appetites and fiduciary
requirements, there is a lack of matching arrangements due to limited coordination and
mutual understanding between the water and finance communities. In fact, different water-

Box 12.2 Blended finance example: The As Samra
wastewater treatment plant expansion in Jordan
The As Samra wastewater treatment plant is the first in
the Middle East to have used a combination of private,
local government and donor financing, which can serve
as inspiration for similar projects in emerging markets.
This blended financial package was put in place with a
viability gap funding mechanism and grant financing.
The 2012-initiated project consists of the expansion of
the As Samra wastewater treatment plant. It aims at
expanding services for initially 2.3 million inhabitants
to around 3.5 million people, thus covering 70–75% of
the population of Amman and Zarqa (two of Jordan’s
most populous cities) by 2025. The total expansion
costs of US$223 million were co-financed by a US$93
million grant from The Millenium Challenge, and a
US$20 million grant from the Government of Jordan.
This combination of donor and public funding, referred
to as ‘viability gap funding’, was critical in leveraging
an additional US$110 million in private financing. The
largest share of US$102 million came from private
debt (banks), and a smaller share of US$8 million was
mobilized in equity by the contracted private operator,
The Samra Plant Company (SPC). The duration of the
Build-Operate-Transfer contract is 25 years, including
3 years for construction and 22 years of operation and
maintenance, running until 2037.
In sum, by bringing down the capital costs, the grant
funding enabled the project to be financially viable,
thus benefiting the government and local rate-payers,
without subsidizing the private sector. This new
mechanism provides significant leverage and is likely
to allow new projects to materialize.

related projects reflect distinct risk–return profiles and
characteristics, depending on the type of investment
(scale, capital intensity, repayment periods, time
horizons), different types of risks (credit and transfer
risks, regulatory and policy risks, performance risks, etc.)
and returns (economic, financial and social). Therefore,
distinct projects might attract different types of investors.
For instance, short-term investments, such as leakage
reduction, could be more attractive for commercial
financiers, while larger, longer-term investments (such as
water network expansion with long payback periods)
might be more appealing to concessional finance and
institutional investors (Goksu et al., 2017). Investments
for water supply and sanitation facilities at the household
level require specific financial products, such as microcredits for low-income consumers and households, and
could attract finance from impact investors (water.org,
2021). NBS are water-related projects that require intense
and lasting cooperation between financiers and project
owners, since their intended benefits often develop with
less predictability and over longer time horizons (OECD,
2020b). Generally, water infrastructure tends to be capitalintensive with long lifespans, which requires financing
arrangements for high initial investments with long
payback periods of about 20–30 years. For these projects,
it is challenging to attract private investors, who tend to
prefer shorter-term arrangements, and long-term finance
on affordable terms is hence often unavailable (OECD,
2018; Cardascia, 2019; Alaerts, 2019).
A better communication and coordination on risks and
returns of water-related projects, as well as on risk
appetites of different investor types can thus help match
suitable investors to different projects with corresponding
characteristics. Strategic use of public funds for capacitybuilding on risk assessment and documentation,
knowledge-sharing on financial arrangements, and
performance-benchmarking can foster this coordination –
all leading to better matching.

12.4.2 Coordinating intermediaries and their diverse functions
Intermediary institutions play a central role in connecting the demand and supply side
of finance and facilitating their cooperation. ‘Intermediaries’ encompass a wide range
of organizations across the water investment value chain that improve the connections
between the interests and capabilities of the water and financing communities. They take on
a variety of roles and functions across various geographies and scales from the international
to the local level. Examples include dedicated financing facilities, preparing investment
opportunities and financing arrangements (e.g. the Dutch seed-funded Water Finance
Facility), government entities working on improving the enabling environment for finance
facilitation in a specific country, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fostering
sectoral knowledge and partnerships (e.g. the World Wildlife Fund for Nature – WWF)
(Lardoux de Pazzis and Muret, 2021; Trémolet et al., 2019). For instance, intermediaries can
support financial institutions in building out their water-related loan portfolios and linking

168

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

them with suitable sources of capital from investors or development finance agencies, as
done by the non-profit organization water.org and the associated asset manager WaterEquity
(WaterEquity, n.d.).
Intermediaries and their different functions emerge in an ad-hoc way, and their activities are
often driven by an opportunistic approach and political agendas, which leads to gaps and
overlaps in responsibilities. For example, an analysis showed that there is an abundance of
organizations focusing on providing financial mechanisms, while there is a lack of bankable
projects in the sector that could benefit from these financial mechanisms. Yet, interventions
focusing on improving operational efficiency – a prerequisite for bankable projects – are
covered to a lesser extent by existing intermediaries, revealing a gap of service needed for
the sector. Similarly, the abundance of intermediaries makes it difficult and costly for the
actors on both sides to identify the adequate intermediaries for their specific needs (Lardoux
de Pazzis and Muret, 2021).

There is hence room to better coordinate the functions of intermediary institutions. While
their spontaneous emergence may have value and reflects the dynamics of the local
environment, some strategic support or guidance can help to better respond to the full range
of service providers’ and financiers’ needs along the investment value chain. National and
local governments have a role to play to ensure that intermediaries build partnerships that
deliver value for money at local, landscape and broader level.

12.4.3 Speaking the language of finance
Current developments on sustainable finance definitions can serve as common language
between the water and finance communities and provide guidance on the documentation of
benefits of water-related investments. Green or sustainable finance taxonomies, for instance,
provide frameworks for how to take into account and document climate or other environmental
benefits. When highlighting compliance with such criteria, water-related investments could
provide transparent and standardized information, which is vital for financiers’ confidence, and
further attract new investor or donor types (OECD, 2020c; 2022). For example, in 2020, 80% of
ODA allocated to water was labelled as contributing to ‘climate change adaptation’.71 For other
policy objectives, such as ‘climate change mitigation’ and ‘biodiversity’, these percentages
are significantly lower (19% and 5% respectively) (OECD.stat, n.d.), suggesting there is room
to coordinate and communicate mutual benefits between water and other objectives more
explicitly to financiers (see Section 7.5). Therefore, taxonomies and similar approaches can
help attract attention towards the water sector, despite possibly increasing complexity and
administrative burdens related to project preparation and reporting.
Better communication and consideration of potential impacts of water risks on the financial
sector can put water on financiers’ agenda and trigger investment in water security. The
risk–return profile of an individual water-related project is not the only issue of relevance
for financial actors. Broader risks to water security can also have significant effects on
the financial sector. For example, global economic losses related to urban property flood
damages have been estimated at US$120 billion per year (Sadoff et al., 2015), which can
affect mortgage risks and markets. If not properly addressed, flooding could cause local
mortgage default crises, which could propagate across international financial markets and
thus undermine global financial stability (Mandel et al., 2021; Tett, 2019). Similarly, water
scarcity can slow water-intensive industrial production (e.g. semi-conductor production in
Taipei, the Taiwan province of China (Agence France Presse, 2021)), and thus affect supply
chains and international commodity markets, and hence the financial markets.

Redirecting financing flows from investments that are vulnerable to water risks towards
those that foster water security and resilience requires action on various fronts. Scientific
data on water resources need to be translated into understandable information for credit
rating agencies and other financial actors, calling for better cooperation between the natural
science and finance communities. Governments and central banks play a role in developing
requirements on water-related risk disclosure for companies and financial actors. Central
banks can help develop tools and methodologies for stress testing and thus help quantify
the importance of water security for financial stability. Partnerships and networks are vital
for these endeavours to ensure knowledge-sharing and harmonization of approaches. The
Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), as well
as the Taskforces on Climate-Related and Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD and
TNFD) are relevant examples (OECD, 2021b; 2021c).

12.5
Conclusions

Strong cooperation both within and between the supply and demand side of finance is
essential to tackle the financing challenge – and can be fostered through dedicated events
and initiatives. At a global scale, the Roundtable on Financing Water72 provides a platform
to convene and substantiate dialogue between the water and finance communities. It has
helped advance several related issues, captured in a flagship report (OECD, 2022). The
SDG6 Global Acceleration Framework is a unifying initiative that mobilizes UN agencies,
governments, civil society and the private sector around ‘financing’ and four other crosscutting ‘accelerators’. Further, the UN 2023 Water Conference aims to showcase mechanisms
to intensify cooperation and partnerships in relation to financing water security, across
different sectors and geographies, paving the way forward for intensified exchange and new
partnerships for the coming years towards the SDGs and beyond.

Governance:
A ‘whole-of-society’
approach

(Aquafed), and Angie Saleh (SWA)

‘Governance’ – beyond ‘government’ – involves not only relevant government departments
and agencies, but also the private sector and civil society. This chapter explains how a
‘whole-of-society’ approach – involving civil society as well as the public and private sectors
in the joint pursuit of common solutions to complex problems – contributes to building
effective partnerships and cooperation. A whole-of-society approach embraces both formal
and informal institutions in seeking a generalized agreement across society about policy
goals and the means to achieve them. This chapter explores four key elements of this
approach, each essential in building a solid path towards achieving the sixth Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG 6) and the broader pursuits of water, food and climate security.
Trust and hope are fundamental building blocks for social cohesion and security. Trust is the
‘lubricant’ needed to ‘grease the wheels’ of the economy, and hope can be the mortar that
holds societies together.
Meaningful participation and inclusive stakeholder engagement take time but stand to
generate trust and hope. Policy and project processes need to adapt to the concerns and
potential contribution of different groups. Yet, openness, time and resources invested in the
co-creation of a project, a policy or a whole-of-society agreement on an issue will greatly
accelerate the desired behaviour change and cross-societal adherence to agreed pursuits.
Strategic integration of cross-sectoral and stakeholder concerns involves developing norms,
standards and allocation methods that affect water use efficiency and the protection of
resources across sectors. Individuals and organizations take decisions affecting the use and
protection of water all the time. Strategic decision-making about policies and regulation sets
framework conditions that give direction to these every-day decisions. Strategic integration
and policy cohesion stand to make integrated water resources management (IWRM) more
effective.
Good governance, where the ‘good’ includes qualities like transparency, accountability,
professionalism and the capacity of public institutions, along with values of fairness, justice
and the respect for human rights; and where ‘governance’ implies a recognition that it is not
only governments but society as a whole that makes development happen.

13.1
Enhanced
cooperation over
water, food and
climate security

Cooperation and partnerships can manifest as loosely formed networks or people simply
working together to address a joint need or goal. These are the motions through which
societies build water security, food security, and more recently also climate security, for
its populations to thrive. Governments build legitimacy by ensuring conditions that are
conducive for people to meet their basic needs like food and water security (Boccaletti,
2021) and broader aspirations in life. Inversely, interfering with people’s livelihood strategies
undermines government legitimacy (Tripp, 1989). Over the past few years, uncertainty has
unsettled people’s lives and eroded trust in unprecedented ways: people who feel insecure
trust others less and are more prone to politically extreme positions (UNDP, 2022).
The provisioning systems that cater for our daily needs are vulnerable to the destructive
forces of conflict, distrust and hopelessness. This section highlights the cooperation
required to meet the daily needs of humans.
Water security can be understood as “the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable
access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human
well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne
pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and
political stability” (UN-Water, 2013a, p. 1). As suggested in Figure 13.1, water security also
involves good governance, financing and transboundary cooperation.

Food security, as defined by the 1996 World Food Summit, exists “…when all people, at all
times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets
their dietary needs and food preferences…” (FAO, 2006, p. 1). It relates to food availability,
access, utilization, and stability. War, inequality and discrimination obstruct people’s
livelihoods and erode their just ‘entitlement’ to food. Where people are destitute, market
forces may be involved in pulling food and other necessities out of people’s reach, even to the
point of starvation (Sen, 1981).
On top of pre-existing risks to water and food security, the climate crisis is having cascading
effects on the stability and functioning of the natural environment, the economy and society.
Climate change can act as a risk multiplier, exacerbating underlying vulnerabilities and
compounding existing grievances (DPPA, n.d.).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Climate change has already had adverse impacts on water and food provisioning, and roughly
half of the world’s population experience severe water scarcity for at least some part of the
year, due to both climatic and non-climatic drivers (IPCC, 2022). The report States of Fragility by
the Organisation for the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2022) finds the world
to be grappling with a series of crises. A quarter of the world’s population – three quarters of
people living in extreme poverty – encounter themselves in fragile contexts.

A whole-of-society
approach embraces
both formal
and informal
institutions
in seeking a
generalized
agreement across
society about
policy goals and
the means to
achieve them

Peaceful cooperation safeguards water, food and climate security. Water cooperation and
diplomacy involve contacts and cooperation between water users and other groups of society
(e.g. journalists) as well as multilateral treaty-making and institution-building (Yeganeh and
Bakhshandeh, 2022; Klimes et al., 2019). Beyond fortifying integrity and trust, water cooperation
also involves the sharing of benefits from water allocation, use and protection.
In water resources management, explicit benefit-sharing to enhance the productivity of shared
water resources has been advocated as an alternative to water allocation by water volume
(Sadoff and Grey, 2002). Cooperatively exploring options among a variety of benefit streams
from the shared use of water resources is also a key strategy for water security (IUCN, 2020).
Goods and services (benefits) include electricity from hydropower, disaster risk reduction from
flood regulation, increased land productivity from irrigated agriculture, as well as improved
access to markets, goods transport and human interaction from navigation across rivers and
lakes. Strosser et al. (2017) also point to non-economic benefits like improved environmental
stewardship, regional integration and political gains.
Broadly, benefit-sharing can help optimize resource use across economic sectors,
stakeholders and countries (UNECE, 2015). Even without formal partnership agreements,
humans have traded goods and services during millennia. Trading goods for which water is
used in its production is referred to as ‘virtual water’ trade (Hoekstra, 2003).
Early applications of benefit-sharing frameworks were to resolve the rising competition for
water between urban and rural, domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses (Garrick et al.,
2019). Moreover, rather than between different sectors or user groups, one may also delve into
benefit-sharing within communities. The sharing of benefits would at this level closely relate to
the division of labour and control over resources between genders and different social groups.
Analysing such practices from a benefit-sharing perspective could help devise alternative
divisions of control and labour with potentially more equitable outcomes.
Benefit-sharing, by design (where planned as part of water resources management) or by
default (where trade moves virtual water across basins and continents) stands to greatly
enhance allocation efficiency. A broader discussion across society can also engage in a
meaningful discussion regarding the fairness of the outcomes of benefit-sharing and other
development policies.

13.2
Who’s at the table?
On meaningful
participation

Who participates (or not), and how, makes all the difference to the outcomes of any partnership
or cooperative arrangement (United Nations, 2021). This section highlights efforts to broaden
stakeholder participation and the methodologies for meaningful inclusion, mostly at the level of
the United Nations, but also at the more critical regional or local level.
The United Nations has recognized – explicitly since the first United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED), the Earth Summit, in 1992 – that achieving sustainable
development requires active participation of all sectors of society. Nine ‘Major Groups’73

73

The nine ‘Major Groups’ comprise: Women, children & youth; indigenous peoples; non-governmental organizations;
local authorities; workers and trade unions; business & industry; scientific & technological community; and farmers
(Sustainable Development Goals Knowledge Platform, n.d.).

Governance: A ‘whole-of-society’ approach

of stakeholders were formalized in the Agenda 21, and subsequently expanded to other
stakeholders in the deliberations of the High-Level Political Forum (Sustainable Development
Goals Knowledge Platform, n.d.).
Bodies like the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) provide
high-level expert advice to the Economic and Social Council related to the economic and
social development, culture, environment, education, health and human rights of indigenous
communities (UNDESA, n.d.). The Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water
and sanitation has also strongly endorsed compliance with the recommendations of the UNPFII,
in particular regarding indigenous peoples’ human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation
(Arrojo Agudo, 2022).
Seeing accountability as a cornerstone of the human rights framework and essential for the
implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the Sanitation and Water for All partnership has created
a Mutual Accountability Mechanism. This tool encourages partners to register commitments
that are grounded in global and national plans and to hold each other accountable on their
specific, measurable and time-bound actions on achieving SDG 6. The platform also provides an
opportunity to collaborate, discuss, learn, reflect and share experiences. In mid-2022, there were
197 government commitments, supported by 89 commitments from civil society organizations,
33 from research and learning, 18 from the private sector, and 59 from external support agencies
(SWA, n.d.).

With recognition
of the roles that
women fulfil
as leaders and
change-makers in
water governance,
women and
men can foster
more sustainable
resource
management
partnerships

At the local level, on-the-ground research by the International Water Management Institute
(IWMI) in the Saptari district of Nepal illustrates the effects of (the lack of) participation and
inclusion on the distribution of resources. In this case, the deployment of government-subsidized
solar-powered irrigation pumps ignored marginalized and women farmers, who consequently
had lower access to subsidies (Shrestha and Uprety, 2021). All partnerships importantly need to
recognize and manage gender dynamics in order for outcomes to be effective and equitable.
Despite the acknowledged essential role of women in peacebuilding, conflict management
and security (see e.g. landmark resolution 1325 by Security Council in 2000, and subsequent
resolutions; UN Women, n.d.),74 women’s role of women in water diplomacy is still underestimated
(GWP-Med/GWH, 2020). With recognition of the roles that women fulfil as leaders and
change-makers in water governance, women and men can foster more sustainable resource
management partnerships (Aguilar Rojas and Iza, 2011; Fauconnier et al., 2018). Initiated by the
Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) in 2017, ‘Women in Water Diplomacy’ networks are
getting increased visibility (see e.g. the Global Network Forum held in conjunction with the World
Water Week, 202275).
The cruciality of cultural sensitivity and local knowledge (Chambers, 1997; Crewe and Harrison,
1998; Banerjee and Duflo, 2011) is recognized in mainstream development work, but where
participatory processes go wrong, they can also lead to an unjust and illegitimate exercise
of power (Cooke and Kothari, 2001). Whereas multi-stakeholder engagement is lauded as
promoting effective governance – enhancing transparency and accountability (Bäckstrand,
2006; Munyua, 2016) – critics suggest that it may produce multiple and sometimes contradicting
agendas, resulting in unnecessary confusion and complexity (Nunan et al., 2016).
In sum, the challenge of participation resides in the ‘how’. Meaningful participation contributes
greatly to partnerships around the joint pursuit of sustainable development. Ill-conceived
participatory exercises, however, may at best be a waste of people’s time. Development
partners need to be serious, honest and careful about participation.

74

For example, see the landmark resolution 1325 by Security Council in 2000, and subsequent resolutions 1820
(2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013), 2122 (2013), 2242 (2015), 2467 (2019), and 2493 (2019)
(UN Women, n.d.).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

13.3
Strategic
integration,
cross-sectoral
coordination and
multi-use water
systems

This section delves into the need for strengthened horizontal coordination to avoid that a
well-intended measure to address one issue becomes detrimental to (or creates) another, as
for example in the case of climate change ‘maladaptation’ (Schipper, 2020). In this respect,
UN-Water (2016) has examined how approaching different SDG targets may lead to synergies,
but also to counterproductive outcomes.
As agreed to by all countries in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (United Nations,
2015), IWRM remains a primary framework for cross-sectoral coordination to be applied at all
levels (SDG Target 6.5). IWRM is as a process that promotes the coordinated development
and management of water, land and related resources. Graphically, IWRM can be represented
as a ‘comb’ (Figure 13.2), pointing to the importance of the enabling environment, the
institutional framework and management instruments across the different uses in
water-dependent sectors.

Whereas the global call for IWRM implementation was formalized in 1992 (UNCED,
1992), nearly half of the world’s countries still report ‘low’ or ‘medium-low’ levels of
IWRM implementation almost 30 years later (UNEP, 2021). Overcoming the institutional
fragmentation around the different uses of water remains elusive – though the urgency of the
climate crisis may potentially be stimulating progress (UNDP/SIWI/UNICEF, forthcoming).
One way in which cross-sectoral considerations get incorporated in practice is through multipurpose or multi-use infrastructure. Traditional systems have fared well in this regard (see
Section 9.3). For example, the wewa-ellangava or tank cascade system was an ancient water
harvesting technique traditionally used in dry zones of Sri Lanka to provide water for both
agricultural and domestic use. Abandoned during the colonial period, these multi-purpose
systems have since been put to use again, some two millennia after their construction
(Abeywardana et al., 2018). Local partnerships are important in this context, and household
infrastructure investments for self-supply are often in need of greater recognition and
support from governments (Sutton and Butterworth, 2021).
Community-level partnerships have been found to better respond to people’s domestic and
productive water needs (Chapter 4). Such multiple-use water services have been observed
in Africa, Asia and Latin America (Van Koppen et al., 2014), noting that every woman or man,
smallholder or pastoralist, is also a domestic water user. Also, where farmers autonomously
develop irrigation and have an entrepreneurial mindset to invest their own resources, they
can innovate to improve productivity and reach new markets (Izzi et al., 2021). Moving from
a single use to a multi-purpose system may only require low incremental costs but stands to
generate high incremental benefits (Winrock International, 2007). For example, increasing
service levels beyond domestic uses enables productive uses near people’s homes and
promotes nutrition and food security (Vinca et al., 2021; Willaarts et al., 2021).

Governance: A ‘whole-of-society’ approach

177

13.4
Regulation and
public–private
partnerships

In relation to water and sanitation services provision, the role of regulation has
become more prominent with the separation of roles induced by the privatization and
remunicipalization of services (Gerlach and Franceys, 2010; Kjellén, 2006). Mandates and
roles relating to services provision and to infrastructure asset ownership and regulation are
increasingly separated and carried out by different actors (PPP-LRC, 2020; CPI, 2022). The
partner constellations vary, but if the formal private sector plays a key role they are often
referred to as public–private partnerships (PPPs).
Public authorities, acting on behalf of the state, in principle determine whether and how to
bring private operators in to deliver water and sanitation services. The authorities retain
their sovereign duties for ensuring the progressive fulfilment of the human rights to safe
drinking water and sanitation. Financiers may also induce governments to commercialize
or delegate water supply services to the private sector (Kjellén, 2006). “Simultaneously, the
private sector at large has a responsibility in the fulfilment of the rights, and can also violate
the rights through impacts from industrial activities” (Heller et al., 2020, p. 13). In the report
of the Special Rapporteur on the topic of human rights and the privatization of water and
sanitation services (UNGA, 2020), many recommendations were given to states, relating
to transparency, accountability and enforcement mechanisms, as well as the normative
contents of legislation and contract obligations.

Community-level
partnerships have

people’s domestic
and productive
water needs

To be successful, PPPs need to build upon cooperation that is beneficial to all stakeholders;
they need to serve the public interest while providing a decent return to the service provider.
Both private sector and public sector operations are more effective in countries with clear,
predictable and stable legislative frameworks, as these allow long-term investment to
be supported with confidence and receive a reasonable return (BEIS, 2022). Conducive
regulatory arrangements are, however, not always in place. In the case of the New Cairo
Wastewater Treatment Plant (Box 13.1), a central PPP unit was created to support project
delivery (Salvador et al., 2016).
Further, there is an important difference between situations where private services
providers are involved ‘by design’ and situation where involvement happens informally ‘by
default’ as a community response to the lack of formal services provision (Kjellén, 2006;
Kjellén and McGranahan, 2006). Research suggests that pro-poor regulatory outcomes
have been constrained by a limited understanding of alternative providers (Gerlach and
Franceys, 2010). The different prices charged by informal water vendors (by necessity
charging the full cost of the service) and public providers (at times even delivering services
below the cost of water production, typically to the wealthier segments of the population)
explain why the poor pay more for water (Collignon and Vézina, 2000; UNDP, 2006).
Furthermore, poorly designed subsidies can generate perverse incentives for service
providers (Andres et al., 2019). Addressing such inequalities and perverse subsidies would
require a whole-of-society approach to challenge the business models and interests vested
in maintaining the status quo.
A World Bank review of utility reforms in Africa (Heymans et al., 2016) found several cases
with good water services delivered across the population in large, poor and rapidly growing
cities in arid climates, like Ouagadougou and Niamey, as well as in countries with low
governance effectiveness. Exploring what “allowed or enabled” (p. xiii) the turnaround of
underperforming utilities, it was found in all five cases studied that progress “started with
improvements in the political economy of the sector and utility serving the city” (p. xiii). Both
local and international partnerships are of importance for enabling these game changers:
whereas the political and economic conditions and commitments setting these cities on
the path to reform cannot be created by outsiders, external support agencies have a critical
role to play with financing and technical assistance.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Good governance:
a whole-of-society
partnership
approach

Box 13.1 Public–private
partnership on New Cairo
Wastewater Treatment Plant
Establishing good governance
arrangements was essential to
the public–private partnership
(PPP) that created the awardwinning New Cairo Wastewater
Treatment Plant in Egypt. This
plant has the capacity to serve
over one million residents
and reuses wastewater to
increase drinking water supply,
reduce costs and improve
environmental quality.
When the project was initiated,
Egypt did not have a specific
law to regulate PPPs, so the
Ministry of Finance decided to
establish the PPP Central Unit
to promote the involvement
of private companies
(Salvador et al., 2016). This
Unit oversees the study,
application, implementation and
coordination with Ministries to
ensure that project proposals
are supported by sound
analysis and necessary budget
approvals, and that partners
are selected through fair
competition (PPP-LRC, 2021).

Good governance embraces a range of principles, like transparency, the rule of
law, respect for human rights, and commitment to equality, peace and security. It
involves a range of institutions, management instruments and approaches for their
implementation (WWAP, 2019; United Nations, 2021; OECD, 2015). The governance
framework relates to the full chain of principles and instruments through to the
actual policy implementation (Pretorius, 2003; Ménard et al., 2018). Indeed, the
elements of a governance framework are all interrelated, and are ideally formed
‘in partnership’ with the whole population.
The whole-of-society approach has been proposed to foster meaningful
participation for the 2030 Agenda (Cázarez-Grageda, 2018), and the OECD Public
Integrity Handbook (OECD, 2020) asserts that a whole-of-society approach enables
individuals, civil society and companies to interact with public officials, play a
critical role in setting the public agenda and influence public decisions.
In a similar manner, water pollution may be more effectively addressed by way of a
common understanding of the need for improved water quality. The global review
of Environmental Rule of Law (UNEP, 2019) noted that, too often, implementation
of environment laws falls far short of what is required to address environmental
challenges. To address this shortcoming, participatory monitoring and public
disclosure of information can help actors across society and the economy to
understand their own role in avoiding pollution and environmental degradation.
With a whole-of-society agreement, an industry may become more motivated
to invest in clean technology. A broad-based understanding and motivation
across society, underpinned by the necessary regulation and a credible threat of
enforcement, can help further progress towards cleaner and more sustainable
modes of production and consumption.
In 2017, the United Nations Environment Assembly decided to address water
pollution to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. This spurred the
formation of the World Water Quality Alliance (UNEP, n.d.) as an open community
of practice with several workstreams currently under implementation. Among the
workstreams, the Social Engagement Platform76 seeks to promote transparent,
multi-stakeholder processes for water management to bridge the gap between
national-level policy, and governance and implementation on the ground.
Developing policy goals in a participatory manner – even if the process takes
time – accelerates implementation. This is because an inclusive policy process
helps galvanize the necessary whole-of-society agreement and support for the
inclusively formulated goals, which then greatly aids the policy implementation
and realization of development objectives.
If you want to go fast, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Chapter 14

Conclusions
WWAP
Richard Connor, David Coates and Michela Miletto

Nearly every water-related intervention involves some kind of partnership. From local to
global scales, operating across different user groups with varying intentions, and functioning
within a range of formal and informal structures, the sheer number and diversity of examples
presented in this report can be dizzying.
Cooperation is critical to achieving water-related goals and targets, and any ‘acceleration’ of
progress towards the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6) depends heavily on the
efficient and productive performance of partnerships. However, this report has shown that
evaluating their performance – individually or overall – in terms of accelerating progress is
challenging and rarely undertaken.
Partnerships and cooperative arrangements, within the water community and beyond, are not
created equal nor are they necessarily comparable or always entirely beneficial to society at
large. Furthermore, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach given the number of factors at play
in terms of scope, thematic area, beneficiaries, partners, politics and personalities, among
other factors. Consequently, there has never been a formal comparative review of such
initiatives across the water domain.
While some have clearly accomplished their set objective(s), it can be more difficult to assess
the extent to which other partnerships have truly been successful. Indeed, most published
commentaries are inherently subjective. While some – be they instigators, participants,
beneficiaries or outside observers – may regard a given partnership as ‘successful’, others may
deem the outcomes to be inappropriate, insufficient, or even counterproductive. Furthermore,
it is not generally in the nature of agencies (and people) to openly disclose – and even less to
accept responsibility for – their mistakes, shortcomings and failures, even though these can
provide some of the best lessons learned. Case studies that fully disclose failures, budgets and
unintended consequences are rare compared to those showcasing the positive.
Despite the lack of a common performance evaluation methodology, a sound body of
evidence emerges from the examples in this report to support a number of practical
conclusions with respect to partnerships and cooperation over water.

14.1
Guiding principles
for successful
partnerships and
cooperation

Inclusive stakeholder participation promotes buy-in and ownership. Taking account of the
different perspectives of those involved (e.g. ethical and social values) helps determine
a clear, shared vision of the objectives, outcomes and results, based on a common
understanding of the problem(s). Working collectively, where all engaged parties are provided
the opportunity to make tangible contributions, requires open, equitable and transparent
processes (Chapter 13). This is arguably most obvious when pursuing a common objective
(i.e. intra-sectoral partnerships – see Chapter 1), for example in the design and deployment
of water supply and sanitation systems for rural communities, informal settlements and
displacement camps (Chapter 4), or for realizing efficiency gains and improved equity in
irrigation schemes and food security through agricultural water user associations (WUAs)
(Chapter 2). However, participation has also been critical to partnerships aimed at achieving
multiple water-related goals, including health (Chapter 6) and environmental outcomes
(Chapter 3).
There is increasing attention to the role and contributions of local and indigenous
communities in effective partnerships (Chapters 8, 13), taking account of their knowledge
and unique perspectives (Chapters 7, 9). Water-related human rights form a strong theme
throughout this report. But apart from being a desired outcome in itself, a human-rights
based approach that encompasses non-discrimination, transparency, accountability and
sustainability has been shown to promote greater equity and inclusion in collaborative
processes (Chapters 4, 8 and 13).

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

Limited inclusion of women in cooperative mechanisms has been identified as a major
cause of project underperformance (Chapter 2). However, the full and effective involvement
of women in partnerships has been found to greatly improve the design, impact and
delivery of water services and broader water-related goals. A gender perspective can be
particularly effective in the targeted delivery of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
interventions (Chapter 6) and in identifying multiple needs and outcomes (Chapter 3). While
the participation of women often remains low (Chapters 3, 8), there is increasing effort to
proactively engage women; for example through e-learning opportunities (Chapter 9) or
dedicated training and education (Box 5.6).
Diversity expands co-benefits and improves performance. Different partners are likely
to have different interests and motivations, not least in terms of prioritizing co-benefits
(Table 3.1). For example, while public sector/government partners may focus on social and
environmental co-benefits, public and private water utility partners are mainly concerned with
reducing infrastructure risks, ensuring compliance and reducing costs, whereas industry’s
concerns include supply chain resilience and brand value. Diverse motivations, but with a
consensus on actions required, help increase and diversify overall benefits. For example,
cross-sectoral partnerships involving agricultural (Chapter 2), industrial (Chapter 4), domestic
(Chapter 5) and/or environmental (Chapter 3) interests, among others, can help identify and
maximize potential cross-benefits and mitigate negative impacts. Environmental co-benefits
are among those most often highlighted in the report, along with data/information-sharing
and co-financing. The diversity and scale of the benefits forge strong interests among
stakeholders and potential partners across the water domain.
A broad yet integrated approach generates complementary solutions to multiple challenges.
Because of the inter-sectoral nature of water, crossing the social, environmental and
economic pillars of sustainable development, it has often been demonstrated that involving
actors from outside the water community can be central to successful partnerships
(UN-Water, 2016). Extra-sectoral partnerships are needed that go beyond the water
management and services sectors in order to help balance competing needs and promote
equitable benefit-sharing (United Nations, 2018; 2021). For example, efforts to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change through water management
interventions (UNESCO/UN-Water, 2020) can directly benefit from close cooperation with the
climate community through knowledge-sharing as well as financing (Chapter 7). Integrated
water resources management and the various ‘nexus’ approaches (Chapter 2) provide
comprehensive frameworks for achieving multiple objectives.
Reliable data and information strengthen partnerships, and vice versa. Government
agencies tasked with resource monitoring and management often lack the capacity to
generate all the data required to address water-related economic and social challenges
(Chapter 10). Partnerships can facilitate and enhance data-gathering (e.g. joint monitoring)
and information generation for the benefit of all parties. An open and transparent exchange
of data and information is also integral to effective cooperation and builds trust between
partners. The great value of such cooperation has been highlighted throughout the report,
particularly in the context of transboundary basins and aquifers (Chapter 8; Box 10.1).
However, the same applies equally to both intra- and cross-sectoral partnerships.
Cooperation is also critical for the generation of disaggregated socio-economic data
(including for gender) required to target actions towards specific beneficiaries.
Citizen science can act as an agent of social inclusion and local-level participation, and bring
a sense of ownership in shaping evidence-based policies (Chapter 11). It is increasingly used
to build awareness on local issues (e.g. water pollution), has a strong educational dimension,
and often involves and empowers women, youth and young professionals (Chapter 9).
However, better understanding of challenges and drawbacks of citizen science is needed
(Chapter 3).

Conclusions

Collective action creates additional opportunities for financing. It is critical that the course
corrections to achieve SDG 6 include mobilization of financial resources. Funding gaps
impede progress, and funding from different sources is often uncoordinated and sometimes
even counterproductive. This is particularly an issue when funding transboundary basin
projects. Evidence suggests that some water-related funds may be poorly targeted, failing to
reach the projects that maximize benefits (Chapter 12). Partnerships create opportunities to
pool often limited resources and share risks, thus improving the business case for investors
and financiers. Financiers themselves can benefit from cooperation through co-financing
arrangements, as leveraging multiple sources of finance spreads investment risks among
multiple financiers with differing risk thresholds. Innovative funding mechanisms such as
water funds (Boxes 3.1, 8.2; Chapters 11 and 12) illustrate how progress can be accelerated
through a structured, participative approach to financing.
Potential impediments to cooperation need to be identified, acknowledged and avoided.
For example, unclear and/or overlapping mandates among partners can lead to confusion
and the duplication of efforts, and seed internal competition. Corruption, in all its many forms,
and hidden agendas can undermine opportunities for honest cooperation. Authoritarian
approaches, including coercion and non-democratic approaches, asymmetric sharing of
data and information, and exorbitant or otherwise prohibitive costs and expenditures, can
also distort internal processes and, ultimately, impede outcomes. Avoiding such detrimental
conditions requires strong leadership that allows for dissenting views to be heard, thereby
fostering trust in and legitimacy of the process and of the partnership itself.

14.2
Aligning roles,
including
responsibilities
and contributions

At the community and grass-roots levels, local partners, often represented by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), are in a position to give local stakeholders a voice. Local partners can also
help provide more relevant data and information, including monitoring on-the-ground progress.
Beyond these essential contributions, the success of many grass-roots initiatives illustrated
throughout this report demonstrates the value of having local partners actually lead collaborative
processes. Indicator 6.b.1 for SDG 6 specifically refers to this (Figure P.10).
A fundamental role of government is to provide the enabling environment in which
partnerships and cooperation can innovate (Chapter 11) and flourish. They are responsible
for establishing and overseeing regulatory frameworks, and are often expected to contribute
with financial, technical and institutional support. However, as exemplified in the case
of WUAs (Chapter 3), the unilateral imposition of centralized or national directives (often
through by-laws or rules) can fail to take account of local knowledge and leadership and
undermine equitable and inclusive participation in decision-making and benefit-sharing.
Governments should also make all relevant data open-access without costs to users, and
promote their dissemination (Chapter 10). In addition to geophysical data, socio-economic
data need to be made accessible, provided that privacy rights are not infringed.
Regional, and particularly basin-level partnerships, such as river basin organizations, are
the heart and soul of transboundary water resources management. While cooperation over
transboundary basins and aquifers has been shown to deliver multiple benefits (Chapters 7
and 8), the vast majority of the world’s internationally shared aquifers do not yet have any
formal cooperative agreement (Prologue Part 2; United Nations, 2022).
As might be expected in a report developed through UN-Water, many partnerships illustrated
in this report operate at the international level among UN agencies (including all who have
participated in the writing of this report), or between UN agencies and international NGOs.

Par tnerships and cooperation for water

These partnerships provide platforms to deliver on the UN-Water Global Acceleration
Framework accelerators of financing, governance, capacity development, innovation, and data
and information, to “deliver fast results at an increased scale” on the SDG 6 targets (UN-Water,
2020). Partnerships among UN agencies and others are also a conspicuous feature of efforts
to monitor and report on progress towards the SDG 6 targets (Prologue Part 2). The difficulties
encountered due to insufficient or incomplete data across the indicators highlight the need for
even more strengthened partnerships to be able to adequately track progress.
UN Agencies are working closely with international and local NGOs, as well as governments,
to address water-related challenges, for example, issues related to water supply, sanitation,
hygiene and health, including pandemics (Chapter 6), and broader issues such as the ways
in which water is impacted by and/or drives human displacement (Chapter 4). Indeed, all the
super-national forms of cooperation (SDGs, UN Conventions, etc.) require sound data and
scientifically formulated evidence (climate change is another example), which are generated
and disseminated through partnerships.
The business value of adding water-related environmental, social and governance (ESG) and
water stewardship, through strategic partnerships and cooperation, has become increasingly
embedded in corporate models by the private sector (Chapter 5). Partnerships have
supported local and national governments in protecting human rights, realigning business
and environmental goals, creating efficiencies in administration and service delivery,
improving the fairness and transparency of regulation, and advocating for increased quantity
and quality of donor aid to developing countries.
Research and academic institutions are often relied on as knowledge generators and brokers,
and help to underpin science- and evidence-based decision-making. They also play prominent
roles in education and capacity development through partnerships in developing countries.

Coda

Safeguarding water, food and energy security through sustainable water management,
providing water supply and sanitation services to all, supporting human health and
livelihoods, mitigating the impacts of climate change and extreme events, and sustaining and
restoring ecosystems and the valuable services they provide, are all pieces of a great and
complex puzzle.
Only through partnerships and cooperation can the pieces come together.
And everyone has a role to play.

WORLD WATER DAY AND THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD WATER DEVELOPMENT REPORT

The United Nations designates specific days,
weeks, years and decades as occasions to
mark particular events or topics in order to
promote, through awareness and action, the
objectives of the Organization.
International observances are occasions
to educate the general public on issues
of concern, to mobilize political will and
resources to address global problems, and to
celebrate and reinforce achievements of humanity.
The majority of observances have been established by resolutions of the United
Nations General Assembly. World Water Day (22 March) dates back to the
1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development where an
international observance for water was recommended.
The United Nations General Assembly responded by designating 22 March 1993
as the first World Water Day. It has been held annually since then and is one of
the most popular international days together with International Women’s Day
(8 March), the International Day of Peace (21 September) and Human Rights Day
(10 December).
Every year, UN-Water — the UN’s coordination mechanism on water and sanitation
— sets a theme for World Water Day corresponding to a current or future waterrelated challenge. This theme also defines the theme of the United Nations World
Water Development Report that is presented on World Water Day. The publication
is UN-Water’s flagship report and provides decision-makers with tools to formulate
and implement sustainable water policies. The report also gives insight on main
trends including the state, use and management of freshwater and sanitation,
based on work by the Members and Partners in UN-Water.
The report is published by UNESCO, on behalf of UN-Water, and its production is
coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme.

At current rates, progress towards SDG 6 is off-track. The 2023 edition of the United Nations World
Water Development Report (WWDR) describes how building partnerships and enhancing cooperation
across all dimensions of sustainable development are essential to accelerating progress towards all
the targets of SDG 6 and realizing the human rights to water and sanitation.
Partnerships and cooperation take place in almost any water-related endeavour and water resources
management has a long history of experience with partnerships, both good and bad. This report reviews
this experience, highlighting how enhancing positive and meaningful cooperation amongst the water,
sanitation and broader ‘development’ communities is required to accelerate progress.
The intersectoral nature of water, crossing all the social, economic and environmental pillars of
sustainable development, also requires the exploration of opportunities for new models of partnerships
and cooperation across all scales, from the municipal, national and basin levels through to the global.
This report addresses how the water and sanitation community can internally collaborate more
effectively by maximizing complementarity, as well as reach out to other sectors and realms of decisionmaking where water plays a critical (but often times misunderstood or ignored) role in meeting their own
objectives and amplifying co-benefits.
The year 2023 marks the first major conference of the United Nations (UN) dedicated to water since
1977. As the UN system’s principal authoritative report on water, the WWDR 2023 directly informs the UN
conference deliberations, as well as the mid-term comprehensive review of the International Decade for
Action, ‘Water for Sustainable Development 2018–2028’.
The United Nations World Water Development Report is UN-Water’s flagship report on water and
sanitation issues, focusing on a different theme each year. The report is published by UNESCO, on behalf
of UN-Water and its production is coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme.
The report gives insight on main trends concerning the state, use and management of freshwater and
sanitation, based on work done by the Members and Partners of UN-Water. Launched in conjunction
with World Water Day, the report provides decision-makers with knowledge and tools to formulate and
implement sustainable water policies. It also offers best practices and in-depth analyses to stimulate
ideas and actions for better stewardship in the water sector and beyond.
