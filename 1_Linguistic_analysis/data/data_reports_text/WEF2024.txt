Preface
Saadia Zahidi
Managing Director

Last year’s Global Risks Report warned of a world
that would not easily rebound from continued
shocks. As 2024 begins, the 19th edition of
the report is set against a backdrop of rapidly
accelerating technological change and economic
uncertainty, as the world is plagued by a duo of
dangerous crises: climate and conflict.
Underlying geopolitical tensions combined with the
eruption of active hostilities in multiple regions is
contributing to an unstable global order characterized
by polarizing narratives, eroding trust and insecurity.
At the same time, countries are grappling with the
impacts of record-breaking extreme weather, as
climate-change adaptation efforts and resources
fall short of the type, scale and intensity of climaterelated events already taking place. Cost-of-living
pressures continue to bite, amidst persistently
elevated inflation and interest rates and continued
economic uncertainty in much of the world.
Despondent headlines are borderless, shared
regularly and widely, and a sense of frustration at
the status quo is increasingly palpable. Together,
this leaves ample room for accelerating risks – like
misinformation and disinformation – to propagate
in societies that have already been politically and
economically weakened in recent years.
Just as natural ecosystems can be pushed to the
limit and become something fundamentally new;
such systemic shifts are also taking place across
other spheres: geostrategic, demographic and
technological. This year, we explore the rise of global
risks against the backdrop of these “structural
forces” as well as the tectonic clashes between
them. The next set of global conditions may not
necessarily be better or worse than the last, but the
transition will not be an easy one.
The report explores the global risk landscape in this
phase of transition and governance systems being
stretched beyond their limit. It analyses the most
severe perceived risks to economies and societies
over two and 10 years, in the context of these
influential forces. Could we catapult to a 3°C world
as the impacts of climate change intrinsically rewrite
the planet? Have we reached the peak of human
development for large parts of the global population,
given deteriorating debt and geo-economic
conditions? Could we face an explosion of criminality
and corruption that feeds on more fragile states and
more vulnerable populations? Will an “arms race” in

experimental technologies present existential threats
to humanity?
These transnational risks will become harder to
handle as global cooperation erodes. In this year’s
Global Risks Perception Survey, two-thirds of
respondents predict that a multipolar order will
dominate in the next 10 years, as middle and
great powers set and enforce – but also contest
- current rules and norms. The report considers
the implications of this fragmented world, where
preparedness for global risks is ever more critical but
is hindered by lack of consensus and cooperation.
It also presents a conceptual framework for
addressing global risks, identifying the scope for
“minimum viable effort” for action, depending on the
nature of the risk.
The insights in this report are underpinned by
nearly two decades of original data on global risk
perception. The report highlights the findings from
our annual Global Risks Perception Survey, which
brings together the collective intelligence of nearly
1,500 global leaders across academia, business,
government, the international community and civil
society. It also leverages insights from over 200
thematic experts, including the risk specialists that
form the Global Risks Report Advisory Board, Global
Future Council on Complex Risks, and the Chief Risk
Officers Community. We are also deeply grateful
to our long-standing partners, Marsh McLennan
and Zurich Insurance Group, for their invaluable
contributions in shaping the themes and narrative
of the report. Finally, we would like to express our
gratitude to the core team that developed this report
– Ellissa Cavaciuti-Wishart, Sophie Heading and
Kevin Kohler – and to Ricky Li and Attilio Di Battista
for their support.
The future is not fixed. A multiplicity of different
futures is conceivable over the next decade.
Although this drives uncertainty in the short term,
it also allows room for hope. Alongside global risks
and the era-defining changes underway lie unique
opportunities to rebuild trust, optimism and resilience
in our institutions and societies. It is our hope that
the report serves as a vital call to action for open and
constructive dialogue among leaders of government,
business and civil society to take action to minimize
global risks and build upon long-term opportunities
and solutions.

Overview of
methodology
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS)
has underpinned the Global Risks Report for nearly
two decades and is the World Economic Forum’s
premier source of original global risks data. This
year’s GRPS has brought together leading insights
on the evolving global risks landscape from 1,490
experts across academia, business, government,
the international community and civil society.
Responses for the GRPS 2023-2024 were collected
from 4 September to 9 October 2023.
“Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the
occurrence of an event or condition which, if it
occurs, would negatively impact a significant
proportion of global GDP, population or natural
resources. Relevant definitions for each of the
34 global risks are included in Appendix A:
Definitions and Global Risks List.
The GRPS 2023-2024 included the following
components:
–

Risk landscape invited respondents to assess
the likely impact (severity) of global risks over a
one-, two- and 10-year horizon to illustrate the
potential development of individual global risks
over time and identify areas of key concern.

–

Consequences asked respondents to consider
the range of potential impacts of a risk arising,
to highlight relationships between global risks
and the potential for compounding crises.

–

Risk governance invited respondents to reflect
on which approaches have the most potential
for driving action on global risk reduction and
preparedness.

–

Outlook asked respondents to predict the
evolution of key aspects underpinning the global
risks landscape.

Refer to Appendix B: Global Risks Perception
Survey 2023-2024 for more detail on the
methodology.
To complement GRPS data on global risks, the
report also draws on the World Economic Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) to identify risks
that pose the most severe threat to each country
over the next two years, as identified by over
11,000 business leaders in 113 economies. When
considered in context with the GRPS, this data
provides insight into local concerns and priorities
and points to potential “hot spots” and regional
manifestations of global risks. Refer to Appendix
C: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk
Perceptions for more details.
Finally, the report integrates the views of leading
experts to generate foresight and to support
analysis of the survey data. Contributions were
collected from 55 colleagues across the World
Economic Forum’s platforms. The report also
harnesses qualitative insights from over 160 experts
from across academia, business, government,
the international community and civil society
through community meetings, private interviews
and thematic workshops conducted from May
to October 2023. These include the Global Risks
Advisory Board, Global Future Council on Complex
Risks and the Chief Risks Officers Community.

Key findings
The Global Risks Report 2024 presents the findings
of the Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS),
which captures insights from nearly 1,500 global
experts. The report analyses global risks through
three time frames to support decision-makers in
balancing current crises and longer-term priorities.
Chapter 1 explores the most severe current risks,
and those ranked highest by survey respondents,
over a two-year period, analysing in depth the three
risks that have rapidly accelerated into the top
10 rankings over the two-year horizon. Chapter 2
focuses on the top risks emerging over the next
decade against a backdrop of geostrategic, climate,
technological and demographic shifts, diving deeper
into four specific risk outlooks. The report concludes
by considering approaches for addressing complex
and non-linear aspects of global risks during this
period of global fragmentation. Below are the key
findings of the report.

A deteriorating global outlook
Looking back at the events of 2023, plenty of
developments captured the attention of people
around the world – while others received minimal
scrutiny. Vulnerable populations grappled with lethal
conflicts, from Sudan to Gaza and Israel, alongside
record-breaking heat conditions, drought, wildfires
and flooding. Societal discontent was palpable
in many countries, with news cycles dominated
by polarization, violent protests, riots and strikes.

FIGURE A

Although globally destabilizing consequences –
such as those seen at the initial outbreak of the
Russia-Ukraine war or the COVID-19 pandemic
– were largely avoided, the longer-term outlook
for these developments could bring further global
shocks.
As we enter 2024, 2023-2024 GRPS results
highlight a predominantly negative outlook for the
world over the next two years that is expected to
worsen over the next decade (Figure A). Surveyed
in September 2023, the majority of respondents
(54%) anticipate some instability and a moderate
risk of global catastrophes, while another 30%
expect even more turbulent conditions. The outlook
is markedly more negative over the 10-year time
horizon, with nearly two-thirds of respondents
expecting a stormy or turbulent outlook.
In this year’s report, we contextualize our analysis
through four structural forces that will shape the
materialization and management of global risks over
the next decade. These are longer-term shifts in
the arrangement of and relationship between four
systemic elements of the global landscape:
–

Trajectories relating to global warming and
related consequences to Earth systems
(Climate change).

–

Changes in the size, growth and structure of
populations around the world (Demographic
bifurcation).

implies sub-optimal alignment and decision-making,
heightening the risk of missing key moments
of intervention, which would result in long-term
changes to planetary systems.
Chapter 2.3: A 3°C world explores the
consequences of passing at least one “climate
tipping point” within the next decade. Recent
research suggests that the threshold for triggering
long-term, potentially irreversible and selfperpetuating changes to select planetary systems
is likely to be passed at or before 1.5°C of global
warming, which is currently anticipated to be
reached by the early 2030s. Many economies will
remain largely unprepared for “non-linear” impacts:
the potential triggering of a nexus of several related
socioenvironmental risks has the potential to speed
up climate change, through the release of carbon
emissions, and amplify related impacts, threatening
climate-vulnerable populations. The collective
ability of societies to adapt could be overwhelmed,
considering the sheer scale of potential impacts
and infrastructure investment requirements, leaving
some communities and countries unable to absorb
both the acute and chronic effects of rapid climate
change.

A new set of global conditions is taking shape
across each of these domains and these transitions
will be characterized by uncertainty and volatility. As
societies seek to adapt to these changing forces,
their capacity to prepare for and respond to global
risks will be affected.

Environmental risks could hit the
point of no return
Environmental risks continue to dominate the risks
landscape over all three time frames. Two-thirds of
GRPS respondents rank Extreme weather as the
top risk most likely to present a material crisis on
a global scale in 2024 (Figure B), with the warming
phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
cycle projected to intensify and persist until May
this year. It is also seen as the second-most severe
risk over the two-year time frame and similar to last
year’s rankings, nearly all environmental risks feature
among the top 10 over the longer term (Figure C).

As polarization grows and
technological risks remain
unchecked, ‘truth’ will come
under pressure

However, GRPS respondents disagree about
the urgency of environmental risks, in particular
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and
Critical change to Earth systems. Younger
respondents tend to rank these risks far more
highly over the two-year period compared to older
age groups, with both risks featuring in their top
10 rankings in the short term. The private sector
highlights these risks as top concerns over the
longer term, in contrast to respondents from civil
society or government who prioritize these risks
over shorter time frames. This dissonance in
perceptions of urgency among key decision-makers

FIGURE B

Societal polarization features among the top
three risks over both the current and two-year
time horizons, ranking #9 over the longer term. In
addition, Societal polarization and Economic
downturn are seen as the most interconnected
– and therefore influential – risks in the global
risks network (Figure D), as drivers and possible
consequences of numerous risks.

Emerging as the most severe global risk anticipated
over the next two years, foreign and domestic
actors alike will leverage Misinformation and
disinformation to further widen societal and
political divides (Chapter 1.3: False information).
As close to three billion people are expected to
head to the electoral polls across several economies
– including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mexico,
Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United
States – over the next two years, the widespread
use of misinformation and disinformation, and tools
to disseminate it, may undermine the legitimacy of
newly elected governments. Resulting unrest could
range from violent protests and hate crimes to civil
confrontation and terrorism.
Beyond elections, perceptions of reality are likely to
also become more polarized, infiltrating the public
discourse on issues ranging from public health to
social justice. However, as truth is undermined,
the risk of domestic propaganda and censorship
will also rise in turn. In response to mis- and
disinformation, governments could be increasingly
empowered to control information based on what
they determine to be “true”. Freedoms relating to
the internet, press and access to wider sources
of information that are already in decline risk
descending into broader repression of information
flows across a wider set of countries.

Economic strains on low- and
middle-income people – and
countries – are set to grow
The Cost-of-living crisis remains a major concern
in the outlook for 2024 (Figure B). The economic
risks of Inflation (#7) and Economic downturn
(#9) are also notable new entrants to the top 10

risk rankings over the two-year period (Figure C).
Although a “softer landing” appears to be prevailing
for now, the near-term outlook remains highly
uncertain. There are multiple sources of continued
supply-side price pressures looming over the next
two years, from El Niño conditions to the potential
escalation of live conflicts. And if interest rates
remain relatively high for longer, small- and mediumsized enterprises and heavily indebted countries will
be particularly exposed to debt distress (Chapter
1.5: Economic uncertainty).
Economic uncertainty will weigh heavily across most
markets, but capital will be the costliest for the most
vulnerable countries. Climate-vulnerable or conflictprone countries stand to be increasingly locked out
of much-needed digital and physical infrastructure,
trade and green investments and related economic
opportunities. As the adaptive capacities of these
fragile states erodes further, related societal and
environmental impacts are amplified.
Similarly, the convergence of technological
advances and geopolitical dynamics will likely create
a new set of winners and losers across advanced
and developing economies alike (Chapter 2.4: AI in
charge). If commercial incentives and geopolitical
imperatives, rather than public interest, remain
the primary drivers of the development of artificial
intelligence (AI) and other frontier technologies, the
digital gap between high- and low-income countries
will drive a stark disparity in the distribution of related
benefits – and risks. Vulnerable countries and
communities would be left further behind, digitally
isolated from turbocharged AI breakthroughs
impacting economic productivity, finance, climate,
education and healthcare, as well as related job
creation.

Over the longer term, developmental progress and
living standards are at risk. Economic, environmental
and technological trends are likely to entrench existing
challenges around labour and social mobility, blocking
individuals from income and skilling opportunities,
and therefore the ability to improve economic status
(Chapter 2.5: End of development?). Lack of
economic opportunity is a top 10 risk over the
two-year period, but is seemingly less of a concern
for global decision-makers over the longer-term
horizon, dropping to #11 (Figure E). High rates of job
churn – both job creation and destruction – have the
potential to result in deeply bifurcated labour markets
between and within developed and developing
economies. While the productivity benefits of these
economic transitions should not be underestimated,
manufacturing- or services-led export growth might
no longer offer traditional pathways to greater
prosperity for developing countries.
The narrowing of individual pathways to stable
livelihoods would also impact metrics of human
development – from poverty to access to education
and healthcare. Marked changes in the social
contract as intergenerational mobility declines would
radically reshape societal and political dynamics in
both advanced and developing economies.

Simmering geopolitical tensions
combined with technology will
drive new security risks
As both a product and driver of state fragility,
Interstate armed conflict is a new entrant into the
top risk rankings over the two-year horizon (Figure
C). As the focus of major powers becomes stretched
across multiple fronts, conflict contagion is a key
concern (Chapter 1.4: Rise in conflict). There are
several frozen conflicts at risk of heating up in the near
term, due to spillover threats or growing state fragility.
This becomes an even more worrying risk in the
context of recent technological advances. In the
absence of concerted collaboration, a globally
fragmented approach to regulating frontier
technologies is unlikely to prevent the spread of
its most dangerous capabilities and, in fact, may
encourage proliferation (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge).
Over the longer-term, technological advances,
including in generative AI, will enable a range of
non-state and state actors to access a superhuman
breadth of knowledge to conceptualize and develop
new tools of disruption and conflict, from malware
to biological weapons.
Global Risks Report 2024

In this environment, the lines between the state,
organized crime, private militia and terrorist groups
would blur further. A broad set of non-state actors
will capitalize on weakened systems, cementing
the cycle between conflict, fragility, corruption and
crime. Illicit economic activity (#31) is one of the
lowest-ranked risks over the 10-year period but is
seen to be triggered by a number of the top-ranked
risks over the two- and 10-year horizons (Figure D).
Economic hardship – combined with technological
advances, resource stress and conflict – is likely to
push more people towards crime, militarization or
radicalization and contribute to the globalization of
organized crime in targets and operations (Chapter
2.6: Crime wave).
The growing internationalization of conflicts by
a wider set of powers could lead to deadlier,
prolonged warfare and overwhelming humanitarian
crises. With multiple states engaged in proxy, and
perhaps even direct warfare, the incentives to
condense decision time through the integration
of AI will grow. The creep of machine intelligence
into conflict decision-making – to autonomously
select targets and determine objectives – would
significantly raise the risk of accidental or intentional
escalation over the next decade.

Ideological and geoeconomic
divides will disrupt the future of
governance
A deeper divide on the international stage between
multiple poles of power and between the Global
North and South would paralyze international
governance mechanisms and divert the attention
and resources of major powers away from urgent
global risks.
Asked about the global political outlook for
cooperation on risks over the next decade, twothirds of GRPS respondents feel that we will face a
multipolar or fragmented order in which middle and
great powers contest, set and enforce regional rules
and norms. Over the next decade, as dissatisfaction
with the continued dominance of the Global
North grows, an evolving set of states will seek a
more pivotal influence on the global stage across
multiple domains, asserting their power in military,
technological and economic terms.
As states in the Global South bear the brunt of a
changing climate, the aftereffects of pandemicera crises and geoeconomic rifts between major
powers, growing alignment and political alliances
within this historically disparate group of countries
could increasingly shape security dynamics,

including implications for high-stakes hotspots: the
Russia-Ukraine war, the Middle East conflict and
tensions over Taiwan (Chapter 1.4: Rise in conflict).
Coordinated efforts to isolate “rogue” states are
likely to be increasingly futile, while international
governance and peacekeeping efforts shown to be
ineffective at “policing” conflict could be sidelined.
The shifting balance of influence in global affairs
is particularly evident in the internationalization of
conflicts – where pivotal powers will increasingly
lend support and resources to garner political
allies – but will also shape the longer-term trajectory
and management of global risks more broadly. For
example, access to highly concentrated tech stacks
will become an even more critical component
of soft power for major powers to cement their
influence. However, other countries with competitive
advantages in upstream value chains – from critical
minerals to high-value IP and capital – will likely
leverage these economic assets to obtain access
to advanced technologies, leading to novel power
dynamics.

Opportunities for action to
address global risks in a
fragmented world
Cooperation will come under pressure in this
fragmented, in-flux world. However there remain
key opportunities for action that can be taken locally
or internationally, individually or collaboratively – that
can significantly reduce the impact of global risks.
Localized strategies leveraging investment
and regulation can reduce the impact of those
inevitable risks that we can prepare for, and both
the public and private sector can play a key role to
extend these benefits to all. Single breakthrough
endeavors, grown through efforts to prioritize the
future and focus on research and development,
can similarly help make the world a safer place. The
collective actions of individual citizens, companies
and countries may seem insignificant on their own,
but at critical mass they can move the needle on
global risk reduction. Finally, even in a world that is
increasingly fragmented, cross-border collaboration
at scale remains critical for risks that are decisive for
human security and prosperity.
The next decade will usher in a period of significant
change, stretching our adaptive capacity to the
limit. A multiplicity of entirely different futures is
conceivable over this time frame, and a more
positive path can be shaped through our actions to
address global risks today.

Global Risks 2024:
At a turning point
The Global Risks Report analyses global risks
over one-, two- and 10-year horizons to support
decision-makers in adopting a dual vision that
balances short- and longer-term risks. This
chapter addresses the outlook for the first two
time frames and examines selected risks that are

likely to heighten by 2026. Chapter 2 addresses
the 10-year outlook and how evolving risks may
interact to create four potential high-risk outlooks
for the world. The third and final chapter examines
the concept of cooperation, showcasing different
approaches to address global risks.

1.1 The world in 2024
The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and
ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has exposed cracks
in societies that are being further strained by
episodic upheaval. Yet the global system has thus
far proved surprisingly resilient. A widely anticipated
recession failed to materialize last year, and financial
turbulence was quickly subdued, but the outlook
remains uncertain.1 Political strife and violent
conflicts, from Niger and Sudan to Gaza and Israel,
have captured the attention and apprehension of
populations worldwide in some instances while
attracting little focus in others. These developments
have not yet led to wider regional conflicts –
nor have they created globally destabilizing
consequences such as those seen at the initial
outbreak of the war in Ukraine or the COVID-19
pandemic – but their long-term outlook could bring
further shocks.

FIGURE 1.1

As we enter 2024, results of the Forum’s Global
Risks Perception Survey 2023-2024 (GRPS)
highlight a predominantly negative outlook for
the world over the short term that is expected to
worsen over the long term (Figure 1.1). Surveyed
in September 2023, the majority of respondents
(54%) anticipate some instability and a moderate
risk of global catastrophes, while another 27%
expect greater turbulence and 3% expect global
catastrophic risks to materialize in the short term.
Only 16% expect a stable or calm outlook in the
next two years. The outlook is markedly more
negative over the 10-year timeframe, with 63%
of respondents expecting a stormy or turbulent
outlook and less than 10% expecting a calm or
stable situation.

GRPS results for 2024, 2026 and 2034 highlight
current crises that corrode resilience, as well as
new and rapidly evolving sources of risk that will
reshape the next decade. For the one-year time
frame, respondents were asked to select up to
five risks that they feel are most likely to present a
material crisis on a global scale in 2024. Results are
summarized in Figure 1.2.
After the hottest Northern Hemisphere summer
in recorded history in 2023,2 two-thirds of
respondents selected Extreme weather (66%) as
the top risk faced in 2024. El Niño, or the warming
phase of the alternating El Niño-Southern Oscillation

FIGURE 1.2

(ENSO) cycle, is expected to strengthen and persist
until May this year.3 This could continue to set new
records in heat conditions, with extreme heatwaves,
drought, wildfires and flooding anticipated.
AI-generated misinformation and disinformation
(53%) and Societal and/or political polarization
(46%) follow in second and third place. Many
countries are still struggling to regain lost years
of progress that arose from the COVID-19
pandemic, creating fertile ground for misinformation
and disinformation to take hold and polarize
communities, societies and countries.

Mirroring the previous year’s survey results, the
Cost-of-living crisis (42%) and Cyberattacks
(39%) remain major concerns in the outlook overall
and appear as a top-three concern for government
and private-sector respondents, respectively. The
Cost-of-living crisis is ranked higher by younger
age groups: it was selected by 55% of respondents
aged 39 or below, compared to just 28% of those
aged 60 or over.4
Although energy and food crises ranked among
the top risks of 2023, this year less than one-fifth
of respondents selected Disrupted supply chains
for food (18%) or Disrupted supply chains for
energy (14%) as core concerns for 2024. The
survey was conducted in September of 2023,
thus the outlook may have since shifted given the
conflict in the Middle East, particularly if hostilities
escalate. Climate pressures may yet drive prices

higher;5 however, a warmer winter in the Northern
Hemisphere, for example, followed by the easing of
the El Niño cycle over the summer, could partially
alleviate further energy price spikes resulting from
any escalation of the Israel-Gaza or Russia-Ukraine
conflicts.
Notably, while the survey was conducted before
the outbreak of the former conflict, a quarter of
respondents rank the Escalation or outbreak of
interstate armed conflict(s) (25%) as among the
top five risks for 2024, pointing to a broader set of
concerns. At more than 200,000 deaths in 2022,
conflict deaths are at the highest level in decades,
driven predominantly by state-based armed conflict.6
Risks relating to the financial, tech and real-estate
sectors are towards the bottom of respondents’
concerns for 2024.

1.2 The path to 2026
Weakened systems only require the smallest
shock to edge past the tipping point of resilience.
In the second time frame covered by the survey,
respondents were asked to rank the likely impact
of risks in the next two years. The results suggest
that corrosive socioeconomic vulnerabilities will be
amplified in the near term, with looming concerns
about an Economic downturn (Chapter 1.5),
resurgent risks such as Interstate armed conflict
(Chapter 1.4), and rapidly evolving risks like
Misinformation and disinformation (Chapter 1.3).
As discussed in last year’s Global Risks Report, less
predictable and harder-to-handle inflation heightens
the risk of miscalibration of efforts to balance

FIGURE 1.3

price stability and economic growth (Chapter
1.5: Economic uncertainty). Economic risks
are notable new entrants to the top 10 rankings
this year, with both Inflation (#7) and Economic
downturn (#9) featuring in the two-year time
frame (Figure 1.3). Economic risks are prioritized in
particular by public- and private-sector respondents
(Figure 1.5). Geoeconomic confrontation (#14)
is a marked absence from the top 10 rankings this
year (Figure 1.4) and has decreased in perceived
severity compared to last year’s scores. However,
like related economic risks, it features among the
top concerns for both public- and private-sector
respondents (at #10 and #11, respectively) as a
continuing source of economic volatility.

Misinformation and disinformation has risen
rapidly in rankings to first place for the two-year
time frame, and the risk is likely to become more
acute as elections in several economies take
place this year (Chapter 1.3: False information).
Societal polarization is the third-most severe
risk over the short term, and a consistent concern
across nearly all stakeholder groupings (Figures
1.5 and 1.6). Divisive factors such as political

FIGURE 1.6

polarization and economic hardship are diminishing
trust and a sense of shared values. The erosion
of social cohesion is leaving ample room for new
and evolving risks to propagate in turn. Societal
polarization, alongside Economic downturn,
is seen as one of the most central risks in the
interconnected “risks network”, with the greatest
potential to trigger and be influenced by other risks
(Figure 1.7).

Interstate armed conflict (#5) rises in the
rankings for the two-year horizon, across nearly
all stakeholder groups, except for government
respondents. This divergence may simply reflect
different views around defining conflict: interstate
armed conflict in the strict definition has remained
relatively rare thus far, but international interventions
in intrastate conflict are on the rise (Chapter 1.4:
Rise in conflict).
Extreme weather events, a persistent concern
between last year and this year, is at #2, Cyber
insecurity at #4, Involuntary migration at #8 and
Pollution at #10, rounding out the top 10 concerns
in respondents’ risk perceptions through to 2026.
Overall, global risks have lower severity scores
compared to last year’s results.7 Further down in

the two-year time frame rankings, Critical change
to Earth systems comes in at #11, Debt in 16th
place, and Adverse outcomes of AI technologies
and other frontier technologies in 29th and last
place, respectively.
The following sections explore some of the most
severe risks that many expect to play out over the
next two years, focusing on three entrants to the
top 10 risks list over the short term: Misinformation
and disinformation (#1), Interstate armed
conflict (#5) and Economic downturn (#9). We
briefly describe the latest developments and key
drivers for false information, a rise in conflict and
economic uncertainty, and consider their emerging
implications and knock-on effects.

–

Misinformation and disinformation may radically disrupt electoral processes in several economies over
the next two years.

–

A growing distrust of information, as well as media and governments as sources, will deepen polarized
views – a vicious cycle that could trigger civil unrest and possibly confrontation.

–

There is a risk of repression and erosion of rights as authorities seek to crack down on the proliferation
of false information – as well as risks arising from inaction.

The disruptive capabilities of manipulated
information are rapidly accelerating, as open
access to increasingly sophisticated technologies
proliferates and trust in information and institutions
deteriorates. In the next two years, a wide set
of actors will capitalize on the boom in synthetic
content,8 amplifying societal divisions, ideological
violence and political repression – ramifications that
will persist far beyond the short term.

New classes of crimes will also proliferate, such
as non-consensual deepfake pornography or
stock market manipulation.11 However, even
as the insidious spread of misinformation and
disinformation threatens the cohesion of societies,
there is a risk that some governments will act
too slowly, facing a trade-off between preventing
misinformation and protecting free speech, while
repressive governments could use enhanced
regulatory control to erode human rights.

Misinformation and disinformation (#1) is a new
leader of the top 10 rankings this year. No longer
requiring a niche skill set, easy-to-use interfaces
to large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models
have already enabled an explosion in falsified
information and so-called ‘synthetic’ content,
from sophisticated voice cloning to counterfeit
websites. To combat growing risks, governments
are beginning to roll out new and evolving
regulations to target both hosts and creators of
online disinformation and illegal content.9 Nascent
regulation of generative AI will likely complement
these efforts. For example, requirements in China
to watermark AI-generated content may help
identify false information, including unintentional
misinformation through AI hallucinated content.10
Generally however, the speed and effectiveness
of regulation is unlikely to match the pace of
development.
Synthetic content will manipulate individuals,
damage economies and fracture societies in
numerous ways over the next two years. Falsified
information could be deployed in pursuit of diverse
goals, from climate activism to conflict escalation.

Mistrust in elections
Over the next two years, close to three billion
people will head to the electoral polls across
several economies, including the United States,
India, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Indonesia
(Figure 1.9).12 The presence of misinformation
and disinformation in these electoral processes
could seriously destabilize the real and perceived
legitimacy of newly elected governments, risking
political unrest, violence and terrorism, and a
longer-term erosion of democratic processes.
Recent technological advances have enhanced the
volume, reach and efficacy of falsified information,
with flows more difficult to track, attribute and
control. The capacity of social media companies to
ensure platform integrity will likely be overwhelmed
in the face of multiple overlapping campaigns.13
Disinformation will also be increasingly personalized
to its recipients and targeted to specific groups,
such as minority communities, as well as
disseminated through more opaque messaging
platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat.14
The identification of AI-generated mis- and
disinformation in these campaigns will not be
clear-cut. The difference between AI- and humangenerated content is becoming more difficult to

FIGURE 1.9

discern, not only for digitally literate individuals, but
also for detection mechanisms.15 Research and
development continues at pace, but this area of
innovation is radically underfunded in comparison
to the underlying technology.16 Moreover, even
if synthetic content is labelled as such,17 these
labels are often digital and not visible to consumers
of content or appear as warnings that still allow
the information to spread. Such information can
thus still be emotively powerful, blurring the line
between malign and benign use. For example, an
AI-generated campaign video could influence voters
and fuel protests, or in more extreme scenarios,
lead to violence or radicalization, even if it carries a
warning by the platform on which it is shared that it
is fabricated content.18
The implications of these manipulative campaigns
could be profound, threatening democratic
processes. If the legitimacy of elections is
questioned, civil confrontation is possible – and could
even expand to internal conflicts and terrorism, and
state collapse in more extreme cases. Depending
on the systemic importance of an economy, there
is also a risk to global trade and financial markets.
State-backed campaigns could deteriorate interstate
relations, by way of strengthened sanctions regimes,
cyber offense operations with related spillover risks,
and detention of individuals (including targeting
primarily based on nationality, ethnicity and religion).19

Societies divided
Misinformation and disinformation and Societal
polarization are seen by GRPS respondents to be
the most strongly connected risks in the network,
with the largest potential to amplify each other.
Indeed, polarized societies are more likely to trust
information (true or false) that confirms their beliefs.
Given distrust in the government and media as
sources of false information,20 manipulated content
may not be needed – merely raising a question as
to whether it has been fabricated may be sufficient
to achieve relevant objectives. This then sows the
seeds for further polarization.
As identified in last year’s Global Risks Report
(Chapter 1.2: Societal polarization), the
consequences could be vast. Societies may become
polarized not only in their political affiliations, but
also in their perceptions of reality, posing a serious
challenge to social cohesion and even mental health.
When emotions and ideologies overshadow facts,
manipulative narratives can infiltrate the public
discourse on issues ranging from public health to
social justice and education to the environment.
Falsified information can also fuel animosity, from
bias and discrimination in the workplace to violent
protests, hate crimes and terrorism.
Some governments and platforms, aiming to
protect free speech and civil liberties, may fail to act
to effectively curb falsified information and harmful
content, making the definition of “truth” increasingly
contentious across societies. State and non-state
actors alike may leverage false information to widen
fractures in societal views, erode public confidence

in political institutions, and threaten national
cohesion and coherence. Trust in specific leaders
will confer trust in information, and the authority of
these actors – from conspiracy theorists, including
politicians, and extremist groups to influencers
and business leaders – could be amplified as they
become arbiters of truth.

Defining truth
False information could not only be used as a
source of societal disruption, but also of control,
by domestic actors in pursuit of political agendas.21
Although misinformation and disinformation have
long histories, the erosion of political checks and
balances, and growth in tools that spread and
control information, could amplify the efficacy
of domestic disinformation over the next two
years.22 Global internet freedom is already in
decline and access to wider sets of information
has dropped in numerous countries.23 Falls in
press freedoms in recent years and a related lack
of strong investigative media, are also significant
vulnerabilities that are set to grow.24
Indeed, the proliferation of misinformation and
disinformation may be leveraged to strengthen digital
authoritarianism and the use of technology to control
citizens. Governments themselves will be increasingly
in a position to determine what is true, potentially
allowing political parties to monopolize the public
discourse and suppress dissenting voices, including
journalists and opponents.25 Individuals have already
been imprisoned in Belarus and Nicaragua, and
killed in Myanmar and Iran, for online speech.26

The export of authoritarian digital norms to a wider
set of countries could create a vicious cycle: the
risk of misinformation quickly descends into the
widespread control of information which, in turn,
leaves citizens vulnerable to political repression
and domestic disinformation.27 GRPS respondents
highlight strong bilateral relationships between
Misinformation and disinformation, Censorship
and surveillance (#21) and the Erosion of human
rights (#15), indicating a higher perceived likelihood
of all three risks occurring together (Figure 1.10).

used to consolidate existing control, particularly in
flawed democracies or hybrid regimes. Yet more
mature democracies could also be at risk, both
from extensive exercises of government control
or due to trade-offs between managing mis- and
disinformation and protecting free speech. In
January last year, Twitter and YouTube agreed to
remove links to a BBC documentary in India.28
In Mexico, civil society has been concerned about
the government's approach to fake news and its
implications for press freedom and safety.29

This is a particular concern in those countries
facing upcoming elections, where a crackdown
on real or perceived foreign interference could be

Escalation in three key hotspots – Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan – is possible, with high-stakes ramifications
for the geopolitical order, global economy, and safety and security.

–

Geographic, ideological, socioeconomic and environmental trends could converge to spark new and
resurgent hostilities, amplifying state fragility.

–

As the world becomes more multipolar, a widening array of pivotal powers will step into the vacuum,
potentially eroding guardrails to conflict containment.

The world has become significantly less peaceful
over the past decade, with conflict erupting in
multiple regions last year.30 Active conflicts are
at the highest levels in decades, while related
deaths have witnessed a steep increase, nearly
quadrupling over the two-year period from 2020
to 2022 (Figure 1.12), largely attributable to
developments in Ethiopia and Ukraine. While difficult
to attribute to a single cause, longer-term shifts in
geopolitical power, economic fragility and limits to
the efficacy and capacity of international security
mechanisms have all contributed to this surge.

Interstate armed conflict (#5) is a new entrant
to the top 10 risk rankings this year. Specific
flashpoints could absorb focus and split the
resources of major powers over the next two years,
degrading global security and destabilizing the
global financial system and supply chains. Although
war between two states in the strict definition
remains relatively rare (Figure 1.12), this could
contribute to conflict contagion, leading to rapidly
expanding humanitarian crises that overwhelm the
capacity to respond.

Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), 2023.

The UCDP Armed Conflict Database’s definition of state-based armed conflict is defined as “a
contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed
force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least
25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year”. This may include intrastate armed conflict
(occurring between a government and a non-governmental party), internationalized intrastate
armed conflict (occurring between a government, and one or more internal opposition groups,
with intervention from other states on either side), and interstate armed conflict (occurring
between two or more states or governments). The definition of interstate armed conflict adopted
by the GRPS is broader than the UCDP’s definition of “interstate armed conflict”, encompassing
some elements of “internationalized intrastate armed conflict”.

High-stakes hotspots
Over the next two years, the attention and
resources of global powers are likely to be focused
on three hotspots in particular: the war in Ukraine,
the Israel-Gaza conflict and tensions over Taiwan.
Escalation in any one of these hotspots would
radically disrupt global supply chains, financial
markets, security dynamics and political stability,
viscerally threatening the sense of security and
safety of individuals worldwide.
All three areas stand at a geopolitical crossroads,
where major powers have vested interests: oil and
trade routes in the Middle East, stability and the
balance of power in Eastern Europe, and advanced
technological supply chains in East Asia. Each
could lead to broader regional destabilization,
directly drawing in major power(s) and escalating
the scale of conflict. All three also directly involve
power(s) reckoned to possess nuclear capabilities.

Over the next two years, the war in Ukraine could
sporadically alternate between intensifying and
refreezing. Despite sanctions, Russia has continued
to benefit from energy profits and commodity
exports – and this could increase further if the
conflict in the Middle East widens.31 Pro-Russian
or neutral sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe
could soften support from Ukraine’s European
allies,32 while support in the United States could
wane under domestic pressures, other international
priorities, or under a new government. Global
divisions with respect to the Middle East conflict
may also complicate efforts by Ukraine to maintain
unity with Western allies, while also garnering
support from the Global South.33 If the conflict
intensifies, it is still more likely to do so through
conventional rather than nuclear means, but it could
also expand to neighbouring countries. While postconflict scenarios for both Ukraine and Russia are
difficult to predict, the war could ‘refreeze’ into a
prolonged, sporadic conflict that could last years or
even decades.34

Global Risks Report 2024

Proximate developments in the Middle East are a
source of considerable uncertainty, risking further
indirect or direct confrontation between global
powers. If the Israel-Gaza conflict destabilizes into
wider regional warfare, more extensive intervention
by major powers is possible, including Iran and the
West.35 Beyond potentially seismic shocks to global
energy prices and supply chains, escalation could
split the attention and resources of the EU and the
United States between Ukraine and Israel.36 The
scale of Gulf countries’ or Western intervention is
uncertain; it’s likely to continue to be deeply polarizing
domestically and hold significant political sway.

Numerous GRPS respondents also cited Taiwan
and disputed territories in East and South-East Asia
as areas of concern. In contrast to Russia, which
doubled its defense spending target to more than
$100 billion in 2023, and the United States, which
allocated over $113 billion in assistance relating to
the war in Ukraine alone,37 China has largely acted
as a non-interventionist power in both the Ukraine
and Middle East conflicts, avoiding the risk of
overstretch.38 While there is no evidence to suggest
that escalation is imminent, there remains a material
possibility of accidental or intentional outbreak of
hostilities, given heightened activity in the region.39

Conflict contagion

could include the Balkans, Libya, Syria, Kashmir,
Guyana, the Kurdish region and Korean peninsula.41
These risks are well-recognized by business
leaders: Interstate armed conflict features as
a top-five risk in 20 countries (18%) surveyed
in the Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (EOS,
see Appendix C: Executive Opinion Survey:
National Risk Perceptions), including Egypt,
Iraq, Kazakhstan and Serbia, and is the top risk in
Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Japan.

As high-stakes hotspots undermine global security,
a wider set of trends may fuel a combustible
environment in which new and existing hostilities are
more likely to ignite. As conflicts spread, guardrails
to their containment are eroding and resolve for
long-term solutions have stalled.40 In parallel, the
internationalization of conflicts by a wider set of
alternate powers will accelerate ‘multipolarity’ and
the risk of inadvertent escalation.
First, simmering tensions and frozen conflicts
that are proximate to existing hotspots could
heat up. For example, spillover impacts from a
high concentration of conflicts, such as in Asia
and Africa (Figure 1.13), could range from more
readily available arms trafficking to conflict-driven
migration. Other states could also deliberately
stoke tensions in neighbouring countries to divert
attention and resources, through disinformation
campaigns or the deployment of state-backed
militia groups, for example. Frozen conflicts at risk

Second, resource stress, economic hardship
and weakened state capacity will likely grow
and, in turn, fuel conflict.42 There may also be a
rise of ‘ungoverned countries’, where non-state
actors fight for control over large swathes of
territory, or where parties not recognized by the
international system gain full control. For example,
resource-rich countries could become caught in
a battleground of proxy warfare between multiple
powers, including neighbouring economies,
organized crime networks and paramilitary groups
(Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).43

Third, with instant information networks and
reinforcing algorithms, the symbolism of highstakes hotspots could trigger contagion beyond
conflict geographies. Deeply ingrained ideological
grievances are in some cases driving hostilities, and
these divisions are resonating with communities and
political parties elsewhere. This expands beyond
religious and ethnic divisions to broader challenges
to systems of governance. National identities,
international law and democratic values are
coming into question, contributing to civil unrest,
threatening human rights, and reigniting violence,
including in advanced democracies and between
the Global North and South.

North-South rift
Dissatisfaction with the continued political, military
and economic dominance of the Global North
is growing, particularly as states in the Global
South bear the brunt of a changing climate,
the aftereffects of pandemic-era crises and
geoeconomic rifts between major powers. Historical
grievances of colonialism, combined with more
recent ones regarding the costs of food and fuel,
geopolitical alliances, the United Nations and
Bretton Woods systems, and the loss and damage
agenda, could accelerate anti-Western sentiment
over the next two years. In conjunction with more
thinly spread resources and tighter economic

conditions, military power projection by the West
could fade further, potentially creating power
vacuums in parts of Africa, the Middle East and
Asia. France, for example, has withdrawn troops on
request from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger over the
past two years.44
As the dominance of long-held power centres
wanes, alternate powers will compete for influence
in interstate and intrastate conflicts, potentially
leading to deadlier, prolonged proxy warfare and
overwhelming humanitarian crises.45 There are
a number of incentives to this involvement, from
access to raw resources, such as minerals and
oil, to the protection and promotion of trade,
investment and security interests. Pivotal powers
will also increasingly lend support and resources
to garner political allies, taking advantage of this
widening rift between the Global North and the
Global South.
As a new set of influences in global affairs takes
shape, political alliances and alignment within
the Global South will also shape the longer-term
trajectory of internationalized conflicts. A deep
divide on the international stage could mean that
coordinated efforts to isolate ‘rogue’ states may be
increasingly futile, while international governance
and peacekeeping mechanisms shown to be
ineffective at ‘policing’ conflict could be sidelined.

The near-term outlook remains highly uncertain due to domestic factors in some of the world's largest
markets as well as geopolitical developments.

–

Continued supply-side pressures and demand uncertainty could contribute to persistent inflation and
high interest rates.

–

Small- and medium-sized companies and heavily indebted countries will be particularly exposed to
slowing growth amid elevated interest rates.

According to one narrative, the global economy has
shown surprising resilience in the face of the most
aggressive global tightening of monetary policy
in decades. Despite widespread predictions of a
recession in 2023 (Figure 1.15),46 the perception
of a ‘softer landing’ appears to be prevailing.
Inflation is falling amid tight labour markets and
stronger-than-anticipated consumer spending
and growth, particularly in the United States.47

FIGURE 1.15

In another version, persistently elevated inflation
in many countries and high interest rates are
weighing heavily on economic growth, particularly in
export- and manufacturing-led markets. An already
visible economic downturn is likely to spread,
with a risk that new economic shocks would be
unmanageable in such fragility and debt passes the
tipping point of sustainability.

These contrasting narratives encapsulate the
highly uncertain economic outlook. Fears of an
Economic downturn are widespread among
private-sector respondents, featuring as a top-five
risk in 102 countries (90%) surveyed in the EOS,
a significant uptick from 2022 (Figure 1.16). A
slowdown in global growth is already occurring, but
it is taking place under a different set of economic
parameters than previous cycles, heightening
uncertainty. Over the next two years, there may

within and between economies, particularly with
respect to inflation, interest rates and growth
rates. With contrasting views about the future,
the risk of miscalibration by central banks,
governments and companies will rise accordingly,
potentially deepening and prolonging economic
risks. Additionally, continued trade conflicts and
geoeconomic rifts between the United States,
European Union and China add to the significant
economic uncertainty ahead.

Supply-driven price pressures
Markets are already anticipating interest rate cuts
in key economies in the first half of this year.48
However, there are several inflationary pressures that
may stymie expectations and present a less-smooth
path to inflation targets. If price pressures continue,
central banks could be hesitant to cut rates in
response to signals of weaker growth, resulting in
higher-for-longer inflation and interest rates.
Reflecting tighter financial conditions, both headline
and core inflation have dropped in the United States

FIGURE 1.17

and the Eurozone (Figure 1.17).49 In parallel, there
has been a slowdown in economic growth in key
industries and markets. The global economy had
been propped up by continued strength in services
throughout 2023, which is now flagging, while
manufacturing has already been in contraction
for over a year (Figure 1.18).50 Economic growth
is stagnant in the European Union, at 0.6% last
year, with estimates suggesting that the economic
powerhouse of Germany contracted by 0.3%
in 2023.51 Profits of the S&P 500, excluding the
‘Magnificent 7’ tech stocks, were estimated to
contract by 8.6% last year.52

Yet even as inflation has been partially tamed
through higher interest rates, it has not reached
central bank targets of two percent and there
remains a material risk of largely supply-side price
pressures over the next two years. For example,
El Niño-impacts to food production and logistics
could drive inflation and costly disruptions to supply
chains. Any amplification of the Middle East conflict
could trigger price spikes in energy and further
disrupt shipping routes, compounding continued
impacts from the war in Ukraine.53 The cost-ofliving impact of persistent inflation, perceived to be
declining in 2024, could resurge as the continued
impact of elevated prices persists. A wage-price
spiral is still possible, with EOS respondents
anticipating labour shortages in key sectors and
economies over the next two years (Chapter
2.5: End of development?). Stronger industrial
policies and trade controls emanating from
advanced economies, targeting the green transition
and advanced technology, could also remain a
persistent inflationary trend over this period.

Uncertainty within global
powerhouses
The outlooks for the two largest economies – China
and the United States – are highly complex, and
these two key sources of uncertainty could lead to
unanticipated, and possibly divergent, implications
for the trajectory of the global economy.
China’s economy is widely expected to slow this
year, with the weakening of the property market
and local and external demand generally cited
as primary causes.54 Despite retaining its ‘A1’
long-term credit rating, the outlook for China’s
government debt was recently downgraded from
‘neutral’ to ‘negative’, reflecting risks relating
to ‘structurally and persistently lower medium-

term economic growth’.55 Yet investment in both
manufacturing and energy infrastructure have been
key drivers of growth in recent years, replacing
lost construction demand to a degree.56 Although
challenges remain, in the absence of further
shocks, there is room for an upside surprise –
local consumption may revive, growth may be
less sluggish and the slowdown shallower than
pervasive market expectations. In addition, in the
absence of further geoeconomic backlash, excess
capacity in advanced manufacturing, particularly in
green technologies, could help counteract global
price pressures, lending momentum to the green
transition and global demand.57
There is similar uncertainty in the United States.
Some forecasts are already pricing in up to 2.4%
economic growth for 2024, and others predict rate
cuts in the early half of the year.58 Fiscal policy has
remained loose even as monetary policy tightened,
with the United States running a $1.7 trillion deficit
in 2023, effectively doubling the deficit in the past
year alone.59 This could continue to keep demanddriven price pressures high. The correlation
between consumer sentiment and spending is also
adding to uncertainty: economic pessimism may
be widespread, but it is not necessarily dampening
demand – yet.60 On the other hand, debt servicing
hit over $981 billion in Q3 2023 – an increase of
over $753 billion compared to the same period in
2022, a sum similar to the budgetary spend on
defense.61 Any fiscal consolidation in the United
States – or a political stand-off relating to debt
loads – could have a profound effect on global
markets and trade, while any overestimation of
the slowdown could lead to earlier or sharper
intervention on interest rates and re-spark
demand-side price pressures. The outcome of
the US presidential elections in November creates
additional uncertainty for the country’s economic
outlook, depending on the policy choices of the
next government.62

Debt distress

start-ups struggle and larger, more financially robust
corporations consolidate their position, including in
the tech sector (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge).

Higher interest rates amid slowing growth will strain
debt loads for the public and private sector alike.
The corporate debt default rate remains far lower
than peaks hit during the 2008-09 Global Financial
Crisis (Figure 1.19).63 The majority of corporate debt
is also years from maturity. Less than 14% of S&P
500 debt is set to mature in the next two years,
with nearly half to mature after 2030.64 In essence,
the world’s largest companies will be effectively
insulated from higher interest rates for more than
half a decade.

Heavily indebted countries are also exposed to
these economic conditions. The risk of sovereign
debt defaults is rising but notably, even with a
strong US dollar, larger emerging economies
such as Mexico and Brazil have largely avoided
debt distress to date.65 This has been attributed
to structurally different conditions in these
markets than in the past, including central bank
independence and the accumulation of large
foreign-exchange reserves.66 In other parts of the
world, like in Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon,
Pakistan, and Tunisia, the risks are much higher.
The impacts of tighter financial conditions will
build over time, and pressures on fiscal balances
will rise. Given historically high debt loads, many
governments might be unable or unwilling to help
cushion economic impacts to the same degree as
they have in recent years, sharpening the slowdown
for companies and individuals.

However, small and medium-sized companies, that
form the backbone of many domestic markets,
will be particularly sensitive to slowing economic
growth and persistently high interest rates. As
struggling companies cut costs, unemployment
may rise, reducing consumer spending and creating
a negative feedback loop that can contribute to
a deeper economic downturn. This could also
contribute to heightened market concentration, as

1.6 Looking ahead
These results point to a global risks landscape
where economic, geopolitical and societal
vulnerabilities will continue to build. Worrying
developments emerging today have the potential to
become chronic global risks over the next decade.
As constant upheaval becomes the norm, decades
of investment in human development – and
human resilience – are slowly being chipped away,
potentially leaving even comparatively strong
states and individuals vulnerable to rapid shocks
from novel and resurgent sources. The impacts of
extreme weather may deplete available economic
resources to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
Increasing vulnerabilities, brought about by resource
stress, conflict and increasing polarization, could
expose societies and whole economies to crime

and corruption. Exponential technology growth may
leave the next generation without a clear path to
improve human potential, security and wellbeing.
How these global risks evolve will reflect the global
conditions that are slowly taking shape across
multiple spheres: geostrategic, environmental,
demographic and technological. Chapter 2
discusses a world that is being stretched beyond
its limit, highlighting a series of emergent risks that
are arising in the context of these structural regime
shifts. A multiplicity of futures are conceivable over
the next decade. While the next chapter explores
the most concerning potential outcomes, Chapter 3
explores how a more positive path can be shaped
through acting today.

Global Risks 2034:
Over the limit

2

This chapter focuses on the longer-term horizon,
highlighting risks that may become the most severe
over the next decade. While the short-term risks
landscape described in Chapter 1 may, if not

addressed, contribute to these negative, longerterm outcomes, attention, planning and action
today can still set us on a markedly more positive
trajectory.

2.1 The world in 2034
The next decade will usher in a period of significant
change, stretching our adaptive capacity to the limit.
GRPS respondents are far less optimistic about
the outlook for the world over the longer term than
the short term. As noted in Chapter 1, nearly two-

FIGURE 2.1

thirds (63%) of respondents to the GRPS predict a
turbulent or stormy outlook, with upheavals and an
elevated risk of global catastrophes at best (Chapter
1, Figure 1.1).

Global Risks Report 2024

Comparing the two- and 10-year time frames
reveals a deteriorating global risks landscape.
Thirty-three of the 34 global risks increase in
severity score over the longer-term, reflecting
respondents’ concerns about the heightened
frequency or intensity of these risks over the course
of the 10-year horizon (Figure 2.1).
Environmental and technological risks are among
those expected to deteriorate the most in severity
over this period and dominate the longer-term
global risks landscape. Nearly all environmental
risks are included in the top 10 rankings for the
decade ahead (Figure 2.2). Extreme weather
events are anticipated to become even more
severe, as the top ranked risk over the next decade.

FIGURE 2.2

Mirroring last year’s results, the perceived severity
of Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
worsens the most of all risks, increasing by a full
two Likert points, rising from #20 in the short-term
to 3rd place. Critical change to Earth systems
(#2) and Natural resource shortages (#4) are also
among those perceived to materially deteriorate,
contributing to their entrance into the top 10 ranking
of risks over the next 10 years, while the related risk
of Involuntary migration rises one place to #7 over
the next decade. Pollution remains in 10th place. In
contrast, Non-weather related natural disasters
(#33) falls close to the bottom of rankings over both
time horizons, likely reflecting the nature of such a
tail risk and the often geographically isolated nature
of these events.

These results highlight divergent perceptions
around the comparative urgency of environmental
risks. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
(#20 in the two-year time frame) and Critical
change to Earth systems (#11 in the two-year
time frame) feature in the longer-term rankings for
all stakeholder groups (Figure 2.3). However, it
appears that younger respondents prioritize these
risks as a more urgent concern, ranking them
higher in the two-year period compared to other
age groups (Chapter 1, Figure 1.6). Private-sector
respondents, unlike those from civil society or
government, feel that most environmental risks will
materialize over a longer time frame (Figures 1.5
and 2.3). This dissonance in perceptions among
key decision-makers could mean the time to act
may soon pass, without sufficient progress made
(Chapter 2.3: A 3°C world).
Concerns around the possible implications of
recent technological developments are also clearly
evident. Adverse outcomes of AI technologies
is anticipated to experience one of the largest
deteriorations in severity. It rapidly rises from #29

over the two-year period to #6 over the 10-year
period, likely reflecting the possible systemic
or even existential nature of related risks as AI
penetrates economic, social and political systems
(Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). Despite worsening
severity scores over this time frame, the most
prominent technological risks in the short term,
Misinformation and disinformation and Cyber
insecurity, drop in ranking but remain in the
top 10 over the longer-term, at 5th and 8th
place, respectively. The related risk of Societal
polarization also drops from 3rd place in the short
term to 9th place over the longer-term horizon.
Despite a small increase in perceived severity, the
societal risk of Lack of economic opportunity
falls from #6 over two years to #11 in the global
rankings; however, it makes the top 10 rankings for
both civil society and academia respondents over
the longer-term horizon (Figure 2.3). The divergence
from perceptions of the public sector – which do
not rank this risk in the top 10 – coupled with the
long-term, cumulative effects of a low-opportunity
world on the next generation make this a risk to

watch over the coming years (Chapter 2.5: End
of development?). The related economic risk of
Illicit economic activity is perceived to be of lower
severity over both time periods. However, it is seen
to be driven by several risks ranked in both the
short- and longer-term top 10, suggesting it may be
an underappreciated risk over the coming decade
(Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).
Inflation is the only risk with a severity score
predicted to improve over the next decade, and
it moves from #7 to #32. In fact, most economic
risks fall rapidly in comparative rankings of risk
perception over the next decade, with, for example,
Economic downturn dropping from #9 to #28
over the longer-term horizon. This may reflect that
Geoeconomic confrontation (#16), a key driver of

many of economic risks, has decreased significantly
in perceived severity over both time horizons when
compared to last year’s scores.1
Indeed, geopolitical risks are noticeably absent
from the top 10 rankings over the next decade.
Interstate armed conflict exhibits the same longterm severity score as last year but falls from 5th
to 15th place over the 10-year period. Similar to
last year, Terrorist attacks sits in the bottom left
quadrant of Figure 2.1, indicating lower perceived
severity over both the short and long term. While
the latest available data indicates that overall
lethality remains contained compared to other risks,
at 6,701 global fatalities in 2022, terrorism has the
potential to spark broader conflict and unrest, such
as the current conflict in the Middle East.2

2.2 Structural forces
Across several spheres – geostrategic,
technological, climatic and demographic – we are
transitioning to a new underlying set of conditions
and parameters. These shifts form the backdrop
to the global risks that will play out over the
next decade. This year, the Global Risks Report
introduces the concept of structural forces to
our analysis of global risks over the next decade.3
We define these as the long-term shift in the
arrangement of, and relation between, the
systemic elements of the global landscape.
These forces have the potential to materially impact
the speed, spread or scope of global risks, and will
be influenced in turn by each other.

BOX 2.1

There are four structural forces that are the most
materially influential to the global risks landscape.
These are summarized in Box 2.14 and include:
technological acceleration; geostrategic shifts;
climate change; and demographic bifurcation. While
all four forces have global ramifications, some, such
as the changing climate, are more multi-directional
in their development, which could allow for several
potential futures. Similarly, while all represent
longer-term shifts to the structural landscape,
some have the potential to manifest more quickly
due to underlying variables. Geostrategic shifts, for
example, may lead to a lack of alignment between
powers, while technological acceleration can foster
new discoveries that transform systems rapidly.

Structural forces
Technological acceleration relates to development
pathways of emerging technologies.
A subset of key technologies, including general-purpose
AI, is anticipated to experience significant, accelerated
development over the next 10 years.
Given the sheer scope of frontier development and
general-purpose applications, multiple trajectories
may arise. Quantum computing, for example, could
allow compute power to leapfrog and, alongside
anticipated benefits, rapidly give rise to novel global risks.
Technological experimentation, such as brain-computer
interfaces, could blur the boundaries between technology
and humanity, to unknown effects.

Geostrategic shifts refers to evolving sources and
concentration of geopolitical power.
This, in turn, influences the alignment of the geopolitical
order, impacting related alliances and dynamics, as well
as the offensive and defensive projection of soft and
hard power over the next decade. Economic power is
becoming more diffuse, for instance, reflecting changes
in currency dependencies, sources of energy, available
capital and size of consumer markets. Concentrations
of economic and military power are also highly related to
technological and resource assets.
While alternate futures are possible, an array of powers
will likely assert their dominance on the global stage in a
multipolar world.

Climate change encompasses the range of possible
trajectories of global warming and consequences to
Earth systems.
Climate change is characterized as a systemic shift
in this year’s analysis because the threshold of 1.5°C
above pre-industrial temperatures, specified in the
2015 Paris Agreement, is anticipated to be crossed by
the early to mid-2030s.
However, global warming pathways will still be
influenced by the speed at which decarbonization
takes place, and deployment of climate solutions.
Degradation of environmental systems could also
accelerate estimated trajectories, to the extent that
they “naturally” contribute to global warming and
related effects (such as the reversal of carbon sinks).
Demographic bifurcation refers to changes in the
size, growth and structure of populations around the
world.
The demographic divide is widening. Polarizing growth
at the top and bottom end of population pyramids,
and between countries and regions, will have material
implications for related socioeconomic and political
systems.
Asia continues to dominate in terms of absolute
population growth. Most countries will continue to
grapple with an ageing population, combining a longterm rise in life expectancy with declining fertility rates.
In contrast, Africa faces a radically different policy
challenge: by 2030, young Africans are expected to
constitute 42% of global youth.

As these structural forces interact, we consider four
emerging global risks and how they may evolve
over the next decade:
–

–

–

Earth systems: all stakeholder groups agree
that Critical change to Earth systems (#2)
poses one of the most severe risks faced over
the next decade. Could anthropogenic (in)action
and climate change push select Earth systems
past the tipping point, catapulting towards a
3°C world to which we cannot adapt?
AI technologies: a number of Adverse
outcomes of AI technologies (#6) are
anticipated to rapidly rise over the next decade.
Could powerful frontier technologies destabilize
global economic and security dynamics and put
tech – and its concentrated owners – in charge?
Human development: featuring as a top
risk over the two-year period and just out of
the top 10 over the next decade, Lack of

economic opportunity (#11) is a persistent but
lower priority risk for global decision-makers
over the longer-term horizon. Could closing
developmental pathways leave vulnerable
populations and countries, and the next
generation, with little hope for a brighter future?
–

Organized crime: Illicit economic activity
(#31) is one of the lowest-ranked risks in the
global risks network, but the convergence of
several top-ranked risks could turn an underthe-radar chronic risk into a pressing crisis. Will
transnational crime networks subsume fragile
states and vulnerable populations, capitalizing
on highly disruptive technologies and weakened
state capacity?

The futures highlighted in each of the following
sections is only one of a multiplicity of possibilities,
and we highlight opportunities to shape a more
positive path forward by acting today.

–

Thresholds for large-scale and self-perpetuating changes to planetary systems are likely to be exceeded
within the next decade.

–

The pace and scale of climate-change adaptation efforts are already falling short, with societies
increasingly exposed to environmental impacts to which they may be unable to adapt, fueling
displacement and migration.

–

Nascent mitigation technologies, while attractive in some respects, could have unintended
environmental and social consequences, with implications for legal liabilities, geopolitical dynamics and
the climate agenda.

Current trajectories of global warming mean that at
least one “climate tipping point”5 (or the threshold
at which long-term, potentially irreversible and
self-perpetuating change to a planetary system
occurs) could be passed within the next 10 years.6
Under nearly all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) scenarios, the 1.5°C threshold will
be crossed in the early 2030s.7 Based on the latest
research, at least four systems are considered likely
to tip at 1.5°C (Figure 2.5): low-latitude coral reefs
die-off (high confidence), collapse of the Greenland
and West Antarctic Ice Sheets (high confidence),
and abrupt thawing of permafrost (medium
confidence).8 There is also new evidence to suggest
that the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre circulation
could additionally be placed at risk at 1.5°C,
while the boreal forest, mangroves and seagrass
meadows will start to become vulnerable.9
With Critical change to Earth systems a
new entrant to the global risks list this year,
all stakeholder groups agreed that it poses
one of the most severe risks faced over the
next decade (Figure 2.3). While these changes
emerge comparatively silently, with their effects
building over the long term, impacts are felt on

a systemic level, intensifying impacts to food,
water and health security. Yet as the need for
climate solutions become more urgent, the risk of
technology-induced tipping points – such as from
geoengineering – will also grow.

Breached thresholds
It remains challenging to define climate tipping
points and assess their likelihood. However, the
latest research increasingly suggests that long-term
changes to planetary systems will be triggered
over the next decade, possibly without the world
realizing that the point of no return – the point of
intervention - has passed. Importantly, most of the
IPCC scenarios allow for temperature overshoot
– however, the breaching of critical thresholds will
trigger long-lasting and fundamental changes,10 with
a fresh set of climate and environmental conditions
that could rewrite our collective understanding of
the risks posed by climate change.
While recent research suggests that the trajectory
of 1.5°C may be locked in regardless of action

taken today, estimates relating to climate tipping
points may be conservative or even optimistic.11
Most climate models, whether public, private
or academic, do not adequately capture nonlinear impacts. For example, the transition of the
Amazon into savannah will likely be caused by a
combination of climate and ecological impacts,
possibly transitioning well before 3°C of warming
(Figure 2.5), due to land-use changes and
deforestation.12 Most models also fail to capture
the interconnectedness of these systems: how
could cascading effects from the passing of one
tipping point lower the critical threshold for others?
For example, melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet
could lead to an influx of fresh water, destabilizing
the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(AMOC) and creating conditions that melt the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet faster.13
Early warning signs suggest that several systems,
including the Greenland Ice Sheet, AMOC and
Amazon rainforest, are losing resilience,14 and
it is possible that some critical thresholds have
already been crossed.15 Indeed, not all tipping
points will be observed. Some will manifest as
distinct changes, such as an ocean heatwave that
precipitates the collapse of coral reefs. The “edge”
of these thresholds can be sharp – for example,

the point at which the Greenland Ice Sheet reflects
less heat than it absorbs. But not all tipping points
will be visible at the current level of modelling and
monitoring. The comparatively slow velocity of most
critical changes to Earth systems – time between
the tipping point and when impacts are fully felt
– means that most will be silent, with impacts
gradually building over the longer-term.
As such, climate tipping points are risks that are
well-known but not necessarily well-understood.
GRPS results indicate that the impacts of climate
change are well-recognized by global decisionmakers. However, if critical changes to Earth
systems are seen as longer-term risks – with
likelihoods or impacts underestimated, or simply
dismissed as too uncertain – intervention may come
too late to prevent cascading planetary change,
hindering our ability to fully adapt to related impacts.

Limits to climate adaptation
Over the next 10 years, many economies could
remain largely unprepared for these non-linear
impacts of climate change. This is not the first time
that abrupt changes to our planetary system have

The next global shock?
Collapse of the AMOC
Research suggests that the tipping point of
the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(AMOC) is “possible” at 1.4°C, but only “likely”
at 4.0°C.16 However, a profound shift at much
lower temperatures cannot be ruled out.17 While
timescales and temperature thresholds are heavily
debated among the scientific community, there is
some evidence to suggest that the circulation of
this current is at its weakest point in over 1,000

occurred: tipping points in our planet’s history have
led to alternative stable states to which life has
adapted over time.20 Rather, the risk is posed to
socioeconomic structures: is the alternate state one
to which we as human societies can adapt?
Climate tipping points could result in a socioenvironmental crisis, intensifying current risks.

of environmental risks, with bilateral connections to

shortages (Figure 2.6). Alongside environmental
impacts, several GRPS respondents also highlight
possible socioeconomic implications, including
Involuntary migration, Chronic health conditions,
Infectious diseases and Economic downturn.
Indeed, as explored in last year’s Global Risks
Report (Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems), this
nexus of socioenvironmental risks have the potential
to accelerate climate change, through the release of
emissions, and amplify related impacts, threatening
climate-vulnerable populations.
The collective ability to adapt to these impacts may
be overwhelmed by several factors.

First, adaptation efforts are unlikely to radically
progress over the next decade, particularly in
the most climate-vulnerable economies. Despite
persistent and extreme weather impacts, Failure
of climate-change adaptation was a top-five risk
in only six countries for the two-year time frame
(compared to 16 in 2023). Figure 2.721 presents a
regional comparison of the latest Executive Opinion
Survey (EOS) results, highlighting a number of
climate-vulnerable markets across developing
regions (shaded orange),22 but where a failure to
adapt to climate change is not a relatively high
concern for some. This likely reflects far more
pressing challenges, including state fragility, poverty
and conflict – such as in Yemen and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo – but could hinder climateadaptive action from being undertaken, in advance
of these impacts intensifying further.

FIGURE 2.7

Indeed, adaptation efforts in developing countries
could be constrained by finances, paired with the
sheer scope of infrastructure investment needs over
the next decade (Figure 2.8).23 As the fragility of
highly-exposed, low-resilience states rises, internal
conflicts and border clashes over resources could
become more common (Chapter 1.4: Rise in
conflict),24 and many countries could increasingly
be seen as too high risk to operate or invest in
(Chapter 2.5: End of development?), eroding
adaptive capacities further. Related socioeconomic
tipping points – such as land abandonment or the
exit of investment and insurance in high-risk regions
– could therefore occur even before planetary tipping
points are demonstrably breached.25 Advanced
economies will not be insulated from some of these
effects. For example, in Australia nearly 521,000
homes are predicted to be uninsurable by 2030 due
to the risks of extreme weather.26

In addition, long lead times for developing
appropriate infrastructure may challenge readiness
for regional or local changes that manifest abruptly.
For example, the collapse of coral reef systems
– which absorb more than 90% of wave energy
– could leave coastal communities vulnerable to
storm surges, potentially doubling annual flood
damage on a global scale.27 Extreme weather, a
parallel phenomenon occurring alongside planetary
changes, is mutually reinforcing: the former can
push a planetary system into an alternative state
(for example a heatwave collapsing coral systems),
while many of the climate tipping points are
anticipated to shift weather patterns and increase
extreme weather in turn, creating positive feedback
loops of greenhouse gas emissions.28

several global and regional powers. China, South
Korea, Japan, Russia and Saudi Arabia are among
the largest net importers of food and agricultural
products, whereas Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and the United
States comprise some of the largest exporters.31
At a domestic level, intensifying competition for
resources could spark disputes over dwindling
freshwater sources, arable land and habitable
areas. On the international stage, changes to
agricultural productivity and water availability
could alter global trade patterns and alliances, or
even become a bargaining chip in the contentious
management of migration flows between host
countries, adding an additional layer of complexity
to shifting geostrategic dynamics.

Together, these environmental and planetary
changes could radically impact economic growth
and insurability over the next decade,29 driving food,
water and health insecurity. Immediate impacts
could reduce agricultural productivity and potentially
cause simultaneous harvest failures in key regions.
For example, some studies suggest that the loss of
significant ice mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet
could lead to droughts and agricultural loss in the
Sahel region, in northern Africa, at the same time as
it reduces marine primary productivity in the North
Atlantic.30 Although specific geographic impacts
are highly complex due to the influence of multiple
planetary systems, food and water insecurity
are a key source of exposure – or leverage – for

There are also clear limits to adaptation, and
tipping points will induce changes that, although
longer-term in nature, are likely to overwhelm
even well-implemented adaptation solutions and
make relocation and migration more likely.32 For
example, the Thwaites Glacier, which plays a key
role in stabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, may
have already passed an irreversible tipping point.33
Although research is evolving and impact time
frames are highly uncertain, this could cause a sea
level rise of more than half a metre, or, through the
destabilization of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, up
to 3.2 metres over longer timescales according to
some estimates,34 dramatically altering coastlines
and submerging some island states (Figure 2.9).35

The next global shock?
Ancient pandemic
The Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth,
experiencing global warming levels that are more
than double those of the global average.36 Further
warming will lead to gradual reductions in the
permafrost, while abrupt thawing could occur due
to heatwaves, wildfires and other environmental
shifts.37 Although an “improbable” tail risk, it does
not require the full collapse of the permafrost

to release harmful contaminants and ancient
“new” diseases, both microbial and virus-related,
to which humans have little natural resistance,
within the next decade.38 Further, as both states
and animals exploit the warming of the Arctic
region, hosts will become more readily available,
increasing the likelihood of the biological threat.39

Technological tipping points
As critical thresholds are breached, the pressure
to act fast and at scale will mount, and the focus
of the Net Zero agenda will increasingly expand
beyond decarbonization, to the “reversal” of climate
change through frontier technological solutions,
like geoengineering.40 However, these nascent
technologies could pose severe externalities of
their own, raising complex questions around
accountability.
Geoengineering solutions have the potential to
counter key drivers to climate change and related
environmental impacts. Some directly remove
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (for example,
through direct air capture and carbon storage),
while others intervene to cool the climate, such as
solar radiation management (SRM).41 Investment in
carbon capture and storage has already doubled
to hit a record high of $6.4 billion in 2023, and
the United States has already granted $1.2 billion
in long-term funding to two Direct Air Capture
hub developments in the states of Texas and
Louisiana42 – a bipartisan move that could survive
the outcomes of the 2024 elections.
Deployment of geoengineering technologies is
nuanced, posing global benefits but also presenting
system-wide and localized risks. First, a growing
focus on “abated” emissions (fossil fuel emissions
caught through technologies) could shift capital
and focus away from emissions reduction and
adaptation. This complacency could take hold
before carbon removal is able to sufficiently scale

over the next decade, given significant infrastructure
and investment requirements, resulting in an overall
slowdown in climate mitigation at a critical time.
Second, dependent on the specific frontier
technology in question, consequences are unknown
or highly uncertain. Deployment could possibly lead
to unintended changes to, for example, regional
precipitation.43 In addition, geological storage
of carbon risks future “venting”, with potentially
harmful consequences for nearby communities.44
SRM could reduce the frequency and intensity of
temperature extremes, but involves significant risks,
like sudden termination shocks and large-scale salt
and acid deposition.45
As the impacts of climate change become
increasingly evident, these externalities could
complicate existing questions around legal
accountability for climate change. The loss and
damage agenda, as well as climate-related
litigation, is likely to gain speed, targeting local,
state and national governments.46 However,
deployment of these technologies by select actors
could challenge these legal avenues, simultaneously
giving rise to additional liabilities. For example,
economic damage, agricultural losses or health
problems from shifting weather patterns, acid
rain, changes to air quality, or the spread of
communicable diseases is possible under both
climate change and an “engineered” climate47 –
and modelled attribution could be challenging if
both effects are in play. In some cases, engineered
effects may exceed anticipated local impacts from
climate change, leading to geopolitical tensions and
possibly even cross-border conflict.48

The next global shock?
Ungoverned deployment
Deliberate climate manipulation may form the next

that can be scaled and delivered in policy-relevant
time frames.49 Although highly unlikely, the
unilateral and ungoverned deployment of climate
manipulation technology is possible within the next

Acting today
Addressing the risk of critical changes to Earth
systems requires an evolved approach to climate
risk management and decision-making. While
climate models are effective at illustrating potential
hazards, vulnerabilities and exposures for decisionmakers,51 the current limitations of these tools
means that we are still entering unchartered
territory. Climate and economic modelling could
be improved to fully consider the longer-term,
non-linear and cascading impacts of Earth system
changes through more powerful tools for analysing
the Earth as an integrated whole, combining climate
and ecological tipping points with broader planetary
boundaries.52 Part of these efforts will require the
translation of scientific findings to inform decisionmaking, which has proved difficult in a climate
context, but may be even more challenging when
overlaid with the nature context.
Indeed, around one-half of GRPS respondents
highlight the need for enhanced Research and
development with respect to both Critical

outcomes of frontier technologies, including
geoengineering (Figure 2.10). These efforts could
be supported through the creation of a global data
commons for climate science alongside further
investment in relevant equipment (such as remote
sensing equipment and computing power) and
ecological forecasting.
GRPS respondents feel that Global treaties and
agreements have the most potential for driving
action. More credible emissions reductions remain
the fastest and most effective means to avoid or
mitigate the likelihood of climate tipping points.
However, with evidence suggesting that some of
these tipping points are already locked in, the ratio
of adaptation to mitigation efforts will need to be
rebalanced through National and local regulation,
as complementary objectives. Expanding access
to existing adaptation solutions will be essential,
including early-warning systems, and decentralized
renewable energy (disconnected from the grid)
to empower local communities. States and
development banks will need to work closely
together to de-risk investment for the private sector
in priority areas and markets.

–

Market concentration and national security incentives could constrain the scope of guardrails to AI
development.

–

Adverse outcomes of advanced AI could create a new set of divides between those who are able to
access or produce technology resources and intellectual property (IP) and those who cannot.

–

Deeper integration of AI in conflict decisions could lead to unintended escalation, while open access to
AI applications may asymmetrically empower malicious actors.

Unchecked proliferation of increasingly powerful,
general-purpose AI technologies will radically
reshape economies and societies over the coming
decade – for better and for worse. Alongside
productivity benefits and breakthroughs in fields
as diverse as healthcare, education and climate
change, advanced AI carries major societal risks.
It will also interact with parallel advancements in
other technologies, from quantum computing to
synthetic biology, amplifying adverse consequences
posed by these frontier developments (Boxes 2.5
and 2.7). Intentional misuse is not required for the
implications to be profound. Novel risks will arise
from self-improving generative AI models that are
handed increasing control over the physical world,
triggering large-scale changes to socioeconomic
structures.53
Adverse outcomes of AI technologies is another
new entrant to the top 10 rankings, deteriorating
significantly in perceived risk severity over the
longer-term horizon (Figure 2.11). Alongside the
possibility of an entity achieving artificial general
intelligence (AGI) – learning to accomplish any
human or animal task – key concerns cited by

GRPS respondents include: misinformation and
disinformation (Chapter 1.3: False information);
job loss and displacement (Chapter 2.5:
End of development?); criminal use and
cyberattacks (Chapter 2.6: Crime wave); bias and
discrimination; use in critical decision-making by
both organizations and states; and AI’s integration
into weaponry and warfare.
To date, the precautionary principle (prudence in
the face of uncertainty) has largely not been applied
in the development of AI, as regulators erred on
the side of innovation. However, rapidly evolving
development of and reliance on advanced machine
intelligence is outpacing our ability to adapt – both
to understand the technology itself (the “Black Box
Problem”) and to create regulatory safeguards (the
“Pacing Problem”), with regulation playing catch
up to the technology.54 The speed of advances,
depth of market power and strategic importance of
the industry will continue to challenge the appetite
and regulatory capacity of governance institutions.
Downstream risks could endanger political systems,
economic markets and global security and stability.

Entrenched market concentration
Private sector-led development of a powerful dualuse (both civilian and military) technology makes
regulatory guardrails even more essential. However,
commercial incentives and national security-driven
“tech wars” may outstrip regulatory efforts to curb
adverse societal and security outcomes.
GRPS respondents highlight Cyber insecurity
and Technological power concentration as
the only risk drivers of Adverse outcomes of AI
technologies (Figure 2.12). The production of AI
technologies is highly concentrated, in a singular,
globally integrated supply chain that favors a few
companies and countries (Figure 2.13).55 This
creates significant supply-chain risks that may
unfold over the coming decade. For example,
export controls over early stages of the supply
chain (including minerals), could raise overall
costs and lead to persistent inflationary pressures.
Restricted access to more complex inputs (such as
semiconductors) could radically alter the trajectory
of advanced technological deployment within a
country. The extensive deployment of a small set

of AI foundation models,56 including in finance
and the public sector, or overreliance on a single
cloud provider, could give rise to systemic cyber
vulnerabilities, paralyzing critical infrastructure.
Given the strategic significance of AI technologies,
national security objectives will likely remain the
primary objective of innovation and industrial
policy in several economies in response to market
concentration, shaping upstream market dynamics
(Figure 2.14). States will aim for securing their
supply chains, onshoring and friend-shoring
where possible. For example, China is pursuing
a largely independent supply chain, given export
controls that block access to the most advanced
semiconductor chips.57 Some states may seek to
capture lucrative economic gains associated with
these technologies, while others will aim to address
concentration, potentially at the price of innovation.
Building on a history of tackling anti-competitive
practices in the tech sector,58 the EU plans to
deploy new mechanisms to disrupt the dominance
of digital “gatekeepers” and is also reportedly
considering an investigation into anti-competitive
practices in graphics processing unit (GPU) chips.59

However, despite substantial state intervention –
and in some cases, because of offensive economic
policy – production will remain heavily concentrated.
Barriers to entry remain high, and there are limits to
the extent to which state policies can lower them.
Sizeable upfront capital expenditure for innovation
and infrastructure, economies of scale and scope,
a niche talent pool, information asymmetries,
and proprietary data pools will continue to favor
established companies.60 Vertical integration could
become more prevalent, as producers of foundation
models increasingly expand to downstream uses or
partner with platform companies that control online
data pools or offer cloud services.61
Regulatory controls on downstream applications
could entrench market power further. For example,
the use of a licensing regime could embed the
power of existing players, even as it enhances
oversight of frontier AI.62 As governments seek to
manage the higher risk applications, widespread
dependence on the underlying tech stack (the
technologies used to develop an application) will
likely lend tech leaders a disproportionate influence
on legislative discourse, shaping industry norms and
standards over the next decade. While downstream
applications are far more competitive, upstream
commercial motives – rather than public interest –
could become the guiding force of AI development
and deployment. This trade-off can already be seen
in the distinct lack of consistent self-regulation by
the industry, with responsible AI teams among the
first to be subject to redundancies as the sector
downsized in recent years.63 Tech companies could
be left largely in charge of prices as well as privacy,
and they may hold excessive sway over preventing
competitive innovation.
If monopoly- or oligopoly-led profit maximization is
the primary objective of AI deployment over the next
decade, the consequences for applications across
healthcare, education, military, legal and financial
sectors will be vast. In healthcare, for example, as
the volume and granularity of health data increases
exponentially, the commercialization of related
data pools for downstream AI applications could
compromise individual privacy and erode trust

BOX 2.5

in healthcare systems. In the absence of strong
ethical guardrails, medical data obtained from a
fitness tracker, for instance, could individualize
advertising, facilitate discriminatory profiling for
health insurance, or underpin new, more invasive
forms of employee monitoring. Even as data
access enables new healthcare solutions and early
diagnosis, medical research and development could
be geared towards the wealthy – those who have
the resources to afford this type of pervasive daily
data collection and monitoring that is then used
to train AI for various applications. Additionally,
the influence of upstream companies could
mean that accountability for related risks, from
biased algorithms to diagnostic errors, is pushed
downstream in some jurisdictions, particularly in
countries with more limited market power, in return
for access to these technologies.

The next global shock?
Breakthrough in quantum computing
Quantum computing could break and remake
monopolies over compute power, posing radical
risks in its development.64 Criminal actors have
already launched harvest attacks (also known
as “Store Now, Decrypt Later”, or SNDL) in
anticipation of a cryptographically significant
computer. Trade secrets across multiple industries,
including pharmaceuticals and technological
hardware, could be compromised, alongside
critically sensitive data such as electronic health

records and sold to the highest bidder.65 Large or
even global infrastructure – such as banks, power
grids and hospitals – could also be paralyzed. Yet
it is not just widespread proliferation of this level
of compute power that is concerning. Although
arguably a tail risk,66 if cryptographically-significant
quantum computing capability is covertly achieved
and subsequently uncovered, it may rapidly
destabilize global security dynamics.

AI winners and losers
Indeed, extensive integration of AI technologies
may create a new set of winners and losers
across advanced and developing economies alike.
The digital gap between high- and low- income
countries is likely to lead to stark disparities in
the societal impact – both benefits and risks – of
AI technologies. The most vulnerable countries
and communities in advanced and developing
economies could be left further behind, digitally
isolated from turbocharged AI breakthroughs
in economic productivity, finance, climate,
education and healthcare (Chapter 2.5: End of
development?). Dominance of the Global North in
tech stack development could perpetuate social,
cultural and political biases, while resilience to
risks posed by AI, from mis- and disinformation to
criminal use, may also be lower in the Global South.
Tech talent – and therefore the deep understanding
of these technologies – is concentrated in limited
markets, with the resulting knowledge gap making
effective regulation challenging. Across countries,
AI tools could be licensed or repurposed as tools
of repression, where relevant norms or regulations
are nascent or non-existent (Chapter 1.3: False

BOX 2.6

information).67 Imbalances in military capabilities
could also be entrenched, with related applications
raising significant ethical and human rights
concerns around accountability.
As such, access to the tech stack will become
an even more critical component of soft power
for rival states to cement their influence. The
self-reinforcing nature of AI development is such
that producers of these technologies will only
become more firmly established as AI is utilized to
achieve the next technological breakthrough (or
the “rich-get-richer” effect).68 However, a widening
array of pivotal powers could leverage their own
competitive advantages in the highly concentrated
value chain to obtain access to these technologies
on more favorable terms, leading to novel power
dynamics. This could range from suppliers of
critical minerals, including Australia, Canada,
Indonesia, Morocco, Viet Nam and Chile, to those
that could leverage IP, such as Japan and South
Korea, or capital, like Norway and Singapore.
Further, a handful of states, such as India, may
soon have the scale and economic might to
disrupt technology development directly, with new
innovations capturing market share or key stages
of the value-added supply chain.69

The next global shock?
The unelected billionaire
Technological power in the hands of the unelected
is seen by numerous GRPS respondents to be
a bigger concern than power concentrated in
government. The influence of Big Tech companies
is already transnational, competing with the likes
of nation states,70 and generative AI will continue
to catalyse the power of these companies and
associated founders. Although the influence of

these companies is predominantly exercised in
the regulatory sphere for now, control over dualuse, general purpose technologies will continue
to confer significant and direct power to private
actors. The risk of unilateral action by individuals
could rise in a variety of new domains with
significant consequences – such as the use of
civilian satellites in the war in Ukraine.71

AI escalation
The application of AI technologies to military
objectives could threaten global stability over
the next decade, with the integration of machine
intelligence into conflict decision-making posing a
severe risk.72
AI will boost cyber warfare capabilities, enabling
entire offensive and defensive systems that could
act autonomously, with unpredictable impacts
to networks and connected infrastructure. When
it comes to kinetic warfare, global and regional
powers have invested heavily in developing
AI-driven weapons systems, and the degree of
autonomy afforded to these is increasing: land, air
and sea-based weapons can already undertake
surveillance without human input.73 Attempts have
been made to establish international governance
around their use; however, agreements have yet
to be established.74 Abstentions and votes against
a draft UN resolution relating to autonomous
weapons systems last year were notable, including
China, North Korea, Iran, Israel, Türkiye, United
Arab Emirates, India and Russia.75 There remains
a material chance, therefore, that these systems
could be empowered to autonomously take
decisions on lethal actions, including goal creation
and the selection of targets.76 The potential for
miscalculation in these scenarios is high.77 For
example, AI could misinterpret the “unwritten”
norms of geopolitical posturing, such as flying
fighter jets close to airspace or military assets of
rival powers, as a material threat, initiating conflict.

The most severe risk lies in AI applications to
nuclear weapons. While governments have
indicated that human control will be maintained over
nuclear weapon systems, in principle AI may offer
the greatest defense by condensing decision time:
making decisions at silicon, not biological speed.78
At the same time, AI-enabled launch systems
could erode strategic stability, given its theoretical
potential to target nuclear assets and second strike
capability, combined with the near impossible
detection of its development by rival states.79
If states incorporate AI into nuclear weaponry, this
would significantly raise the risk of accidental or
intentional escalation over the next decade, with
potentially existential consequences.
In contrast to the upstream tech stack, the
downstream application of AI is a more competitive
market. Despite being among the most powerful
of emerging dual-use technologies, the economic
and technical barriers to accessing frontier AI
are significantly lower than for its technological
counterparts, such as geoengineering and quantum
computing. Many GRPS respondents highlight
concerns around sudden and widespread access
to generative AI applications, given that access
to the internet effectively equates to access to
these models. Malicious actors can leverage a
superhuman breadth of knowledge to conceptualize
and proliferate dangerous capabilities, from
misinformation and malware to biological weapons
(Box 2.7), threatening human rights and safety in a
myriad of ways.

BOX 2.7

The next global shock?
Novel bioweapons
The attempted use of biochemical weapons by
non-state actors has historically been limited,
primarily due to high knowledge barriers.80
Without regulation limiting open access to the
most powerful applications of AI technologies, a
combination of AI tools could enable the creation
of more targeted and severe biological weapons
by a wide spectrum of non-technical actors. Large
language models could provide information on
dual-use topics, laboratory assistance and,

eventually, autonomous research, while biological
design tools could allow the creation of new
proteins and biological agents that overcome the
trade-off between transmissibility and virulence
of pathogens.81 Impacts could be devastating,
with pathogens potentially used to disable military
personnel before a conflict, mimic a widespread
global pandemic or even lethally target specific
ethnicities.

Global Risks Report 2024

Acting today
GRPS respondents identify Public awareness and
education as one of the most effective mechanisms
to address risk preparedness and reduction of
Adverse outcomes of AI technologies (Figure
2.15) and as a key tool to manage local impacts
as well as build governance capacity and societal
resilience. Literacy in generative AI is essential, for
regulators and for broader society. AI literacy could
be integrated into public education systems and
trainings for journalists and decision-makers to not
only understand capabilities of AI systems but also
to identify trustworthy sources of information.
GRPS respondents also highlight the need for
National and local regulations. While nationallevel efforts will not necessarily prevent the rapid
global proliferation of AI and related risks, robust
but flexible standard-setting can help ensure that
technological development and deployment are
aligned with societal needs. The application of
existing legislation around intellectual property,
employment, competition policy, data protection,
privacy, and human rights will need to evolve to
address new challenges posed by generative AI.82
Other key areas anticipated to be addressed by
various regulatory regimes over the short term
include the identification of AI-generated products,
blocks or limitations to the riskiest uses, and
determination of liability for AI-induced harms.83

FIGURE 2.15

Solutions proposed include but are not limited to:
registration and licensing of the most powerful
versions of the technology, tiering access to
computing power, implementation of provenance
and/or watermarking systems, Know-YourCustomer procedures and mandatory incident
disclosures, and creating a robust auditing and
certification system.84
GRPS respondents also note the role of Global
treaties and agreements in the management of
both Adverse outcomes of AI technologies and
Technological power concentration. Several AI
governance frameworks have already emerged at
a global level to provide high level guidance for AI
development, including the latest G7 Hiroshima
Process on Generative Artificial Intelligence, as well
as the Bletchley Declaration. In addition, there have
already been calls for an “AI version” of the IPCC.85
This entity could, in collaboration with the private
sector, enable global scientific consensus around the
risks and opportunities posed by frontier AI. Similarly,
it could communicate findings to decision-makers,
based on best available projections of global AI
hardware and software, albeit with faster assessment
cycles by necessity. Oversight could also extend to a
reporting database and registry of crucial AI systems.
However, the most existential of these risks will require
extensive cooperation between powers, to achieve
mutual restraint around the proliferation of high-impact
technologies, as well as the inadvertent escalation in
military AI (Chapter 3: Responding to global risks).

–

Human development and prosperity may stall as barriers to economic mobility arise from climate,
technological and geopolitical constraints.

–

Deeply bifurcated labour markets could widen inequality between – and create additional risks within –
developed and developing economies, as demographic structures and job demand and supply diverge.

–

Living standards could recede for populations suffering entrenched unemployment and economic
distress, radically reshaping political dynamics.

The world has made rapid strides across most
human development indicators over recent
decades, but the fragility of these collective gains
is evident. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic
challenged global advancement, with visible
reversals in 2020 across multiple economies and
regions (Figure 2.17), as progress slid with respect
to education, healthcare and poverty.86 Economic
mobility – or the ability to improve economic
status and related outcomes – is perceived to be
dwindling in developed and developing economies
alike, as job markets change and current education,
labour and social policies become outdated against
a backdrop of changing demographics.

economic mobility will stall and reverse. The climate
transition, advances in AI, demographic shifts
and geopolitical dynamics could interact over the
coming decade to cement the mismatch between
the demand and supply of labour between and
within countries. The consequences for societal
cohesion and political outcomes are wide-reaching,
threatening standards of living for a large segment
of the population in many economies.

Lack of economic opportunity is a new entrant
to the global risks list. It features in the top 10 risks
list over the two-year horizon and is expected to
worsen in perceived severity over the longer term
(Figure 2.16). Alongside Unemployment as the
primary driver, GRPS respondents consider a Lack
of economic opportunity to stem from a complex
mix of other global risks. This includes short-term
economic risks, such as Economic downturn
and Inflation, and pressing societal risks such as
Erosion of human rights, Intrastate violence and
Societal polarization (Figure 2.18).

Bifurcated markets
Disruptions to labour markets are likely to escalate
worldwide as a result of the two large-scale
economic transformations that are concurrently
taking place, driven by climate action and AI
integration. These twin transitions will dramatically
reshape the quality, quantity and distribution of
job creation as well as job loss, driving divergent
risks. Some economies and communities, isolated
from job-creation and reskilling opportunities,
will encounter saturated labour markets,
hindering development. In others, challenges to
social and labour mobility could contribute to
shortages in critical industries, slowing economic
transformations and progress.
Both transitions offer valuable opportunities to
tackle economic inequality through the generation

of new income opportunities across a range of
sectors. For example, AI and Machine Learning
Specialists is anticipated to be the fastest-growing
job, growing by 40% (1 million jobs) by 2027, while
the green transition is estimated to lead to more
than 30 million jobs by 2030.87 Mirroring demand
for renewable infrastructure, the global construction
sector is expected to double in size in the 10-year
period from 2020 to 2030, while related jobs,
including those in trades and engineering, are
among those anticipated to experience the largest
growth in the coming years (Figure 2.19).88
However, related job churn is likely to be significant,
as these transitions displace workers in parallel,
potentially leading to net job loss overall. The latest
estimates anticipate structural job growth of 69
million, set against job losses of 83 million, over
the next five years.89 This level of job churn will be
particularly challenging to manage, as these impacts

will not be evenly distributed between or within
economies. In many cases, jobs created will not
be in the same location, industry or skills bracket
as available or displaced workers, thus relying
on labour mobility to fill them. A growing labour
mismatch between countries is already evident
from EOS results: Labour shortages feature in the
top five risk rankings for 52 countries over the next
two years, while, in comparison, Unemployment
features in the top five risks in 30 countries. As
shown in Figure 2.20, nearly all countries surveyed
include at least one of these risks in their top 10

rankings: low- and lower-middle income countries
tend to rank Unemployment higher, while uppermiddle and high-income respondents are more
concerned about Labour shortages.
Job creation in respective economies over the coming
decade will be materially shaped by access to and
selected deployment of investment for the climate
and tech-related transitions. For example, both are
being widely supported by governments, with funding
and subsidies targeted at the domestic growth of
related industries (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge).

The top right box indicates that both Labour shortages and Unemployment feature in the top
10 risks at a national level.

However, as capital – and therefore risk – remains
costly, investment will likely become even more
heavily concentrated in comparatively stable
advanced economies. Inflows of public and private
capital to accelerate the energy transition have been
particularly pronounced in the United States, China
and the EU, due to more sophisticated financing
mechanisms and policy incentives.90
In contrast, relatively less stable, lower-income,
conflict-prone or climate-vulnerable developing
economies may be seen as too high-risk for

investment or operations. With many already
holding sub-investment-grade credit ratings, private
interest could dry up further, given heightened
political, regulatory, societal and economic
instability, as well as the adverse effects of climate
change.91 Indeed, experts consulted worry that
even published estimations of climate-related
migration could drive capital elsewhere (Chapter
2.3: A 3°C world). This would exacerbate existing
challenges in terms of public and development
financing.92 Many of the Least Developed Countries
(LDCs), grappling with debt distress, already face

large financing gaps in reaching development goals
in the medium term (Figure 2.21) – and geopolitical
instability could further hinder international financial
efforts to support these economies, from debt
restructuring to foreign aid (Box 2.8).
This global gap between job-creating investments
and willing workforces will therefore lead to
divergent risks in the demand and supply of
labour. The demographic dividend of some
developing markets may quickly turn into a
demographic dilemma in which unemployment
becomes a chronic risk. In the absence of
substantive domestic or foreign investment, some
economies may be unable to generate sufficient
green- and tech-related income opportunities to

FIGURE 2.21

absorb a growing workforce, while other sectors
also could become at risk in a low growth, highrate, low-investment world. This is a challenge
that will not be limited to the LDCs – select
middle-income economies that have sought
growth through an export-led model may also
face substantial job erosion.93 Mirroring trends
in manufacturing, several countries have relied
on rapid growth in digitally delivered services
exports (Figure 2.22),94 yet the industries and job
functions most impacted by generative AI are
among those most commonly outsourced and
offshored, such as information technology, finance
and human resources.95 Although higher-value
income opportunities will be created through
AI augmentation, these jobs are likely to be

concentrated in technologically advanced regions,
building on existing divides in educational and
digital literacy that cannot be bridged without
investment (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). The
lower cost of labour may still incentivize offshoring
to a degree; however, protectionism in digital
services could strengthen. For example, stronger
data localization requirements would effectively
“reshore” these industries.96 As such, a more
fundamental question is rapidly emerging: can
manufacturing- and services-led export growth
remain an accessible pathway to greater prosperity
for developing countries?

for the largest emitters in the medium term and, given
geopolitical dynamics and societal discontent, is
more likely to incentivize the replacement of lowerskilled, routine jobs (muscle to machine power)
than encourage immigration and improved labour
mobility. Indeed, grappling with shrinking and ageing
workforces, companies in advanced economies will
seek to capitalize on the productivity benefits offered
by AI, deploying them rapidly and at scale. Generative
AI will increasingly be substituted for middle-skilled
workers (biological to machine intelligence), particularly
in the services sector. The rapid deployment of these
technologies could crowd out human competencies
within a relatively short period of time – leading to
shifts from talent shortages to underemployment and
unemployment in some parts of these economies and
creating knock-on effects in developing economies.

In most advanced economies, the creation of
“boots-on-the-ground” green infrastructure jobs
could exacerbate already tight labour markets.97 This
could be a severe constraint to the green transition

BOX 2.8

The next global shock?
Post-SDGs
As 2030 approaches, demonstrable erosion in
critical pillars of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) could set the tone for the next
decade, as international support for sustainable
development pathways narrow. In light of
domestic challenges and declining international
cooperation, there is a risk of an accompanying
rise in deprivation. The distribution of aid could
become primarily driven by narrow security
interests, rather than broader, traditional

development imperatives, resulting in selective
efforts to create good for a few, rather than
good for all. For example, aid financing could
be diverted from nature restoration or education
to the building of dual-use infrastructure such
as ports. Amid slowing growth, investment
from China could dry up further, resulting in
cancellations and delays of critical infrastructure
projects, destabilizing low- and middle-income
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.98

Stranded people

Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Türkiye, South
Africa, Australia, Brazil and Argentina.

Individual pathways to economic prosperity could
also diverge because of these twin economic
transitions, perpetuating technological, educational
and societal divides. In the absence of effective
policies encouraging reskilling alongside labour
and social mobility, access to income opportunities
will narrow for a widening segment of the global
population, creating pockets of unemployment and
economic distress that impact blue- and whitecollar workers alike.

The latest estimates suggest that three in
five workers will require training before 2027.
However, barriers of socioeconomic class and
age may hinder economic mobility, entrenching
existing inequalities. For example, despite AIdriven advances in education, not all workers –
between and within countries – will have access
to adequate reskilling opportunities.100 Those with
the economic resources to adapt to new industries
will have a better chance at maintaining economic
stability and capture higher wages. Those without
access to quality retraining will be forced into
less stable or secure means of employment.
Additionally, the automation of entry level functions
could create a higher educational barrier to entry
into the workforce, magnifying challenges of
social mobility. Over the longer term, the jobs of
higher-skilled, more expensive workers may also
come under threat from both machine intelligence
and machine power, with barriers arising due
to skills obsolescence and atrophy, as well as
advancements in technology.

This disruption is imminent but may catch the
workforce by surprise. For example, four in 10
executives believe AI will lead to net job losses this
year – compared to only one in 10 employees.99
EOS results point to a potential skills gap within
several countries, suggesting that domestic workers
will face barriers to matching job demand within the
next two years. Respondents in numerous countries
selected both Unemployment and Labour
shortages in their top 10 rankings (Figure 2.20).
This includes a range of high-, upper-middle, and
lower-middle income countries, such as the United

If adequate social protection systems are not in
place, displaced workers who struggle to re-enter
the workforce could face higher rates of poverty,
hunger and homelessness, particularly in the near
term if costs and inflation remain higher for longer.
Access to basic necessities, including healthcare
and housing, could become restricted. In the
absence of supported pathways to safe and secure
livelihoods, more individuals could also be pushed
into crime, militarization or radicalization (Chapter
2.6: Crime wave). Forced economic displacement
could become more common, with individuals
migrating in search of better economic opportunity
and, possibly, social assistance – yet even this may
be a pathway that some individuals cannot afford.
While many of these consequences may be felt
most acutely in developing economies, with less

BOX 2.9

fiscal space to ease the transition for individuals,
these risks remain a concern in advanced
economies, too. For example, workers from
“dirty” sectors could become stranded in fossil
fuel-dependent local economies, with few other
opportunities available. Displaced older workers will
exacerbate the growing strain on social systems
and healthcare, creating a different but related
livelihood crisis: growing retirement insecurity.
Anticipated job disruption could also enable
knowledge, technology, income and wealth to
become even more concentrated, perpetuating
cycles of poverty. An individual born into a less
privileged background is likely to face formidable
and potentially higher barriers to reaching their full
potential, undermining notions of meritocracy and
fairness that underpin stable and inclusive societies.

The next global shock?
Green lash meets tech lash
Deepening frustration with economic conditions
will drive societal divisions, as individuals demand
better opportunities, income equality and
improved living standards. The anti-tech and antisustainability backlash will be fueled by workers
threatened by these two transitions. Related
strikes and riots could grow, disrupting business
continuity on a regular basis and disrupting
essential infrastructure, from financial institutions
to public services and transport. Both

white- and blue-collar displacement could feature
heavily in political platforms during election cycles,
interacting to polarize electorates in some cases
or align historically unlikely groupings in others.
This could be a dynamic to watch in upcoming
elections in both the United States and United
Kingdom, where trade unions have historically
represented key parts of voting coalitions, and
whose electoral power could ultimately slow the
rollout of the twin economic transitions.

Stalled living standards
As the livelihoods and well-being of individuals
come under threat, fiscal space and political
appetite will interact to shape the response of
governments in both advanced and developing
economies. If these economic transformations are
not managed carefully, related economic hardship
could mean that metrics of human development –
from poverty to access to education and healthcare
– recede for large swathes of the global population.
And if standards of living are not preserved for the
current and next generation, societal and political
dynamics could radically shift in many economies.
As outlined in last year’s Global Risks Report
(Chapter 2.6: Economic stability), competing
demands for investment mean that few countries
are likely to have the fiscal headroom to invest in
human capital for the longer term – in education
and healthcare systems, components that are
fundamental to the realization of economic
opportunities. This will be felt most acutely in the
most vulnerable markets, which as previously
noted, could face a potential investment crisis
with corrosive long-term impacts. As fiscal
space is squeezed and private finance remains
constrained, these markets will be increasingly
forced to choose between, for instance, paying
external debt, providing a strong and immediate
safety net for struggling individuals, investing in
the future growth dividends offered by climate
action and technological development, managing
and adapting to climate change, or shoring up the
longer-term adaptive capacities of human capital
through health and education systems.

In this environment, public demands for more
interventionist governments may recalibrate fiscal
policies, with governments facing increasing
pressure to implement policies that prioritize
generous safety nets and employment stability.
Support for technological (automation or AI) taxes
and wealth redistribution could grow.101 Generally,
however, given debt sustainability concerns, the
ability of governments to afford to mitigate the risks
of climate- and AI-related job displacement on
individuals – through higher unemployment benefits,
more generous minimum wages or subsidies for
retraining for example – will be driven partially by
related productivity enhancements, leading to
growth in GDP and tax revenue. As labour markets
bifurcate, the ability of governments to support their
workforces through these radical transformations,
and maintain developmental progress and
standards of living, could diverge in turn.
In economies where government efforts are – or
are seen to be – inadequate, populist movements
will capitalize on the disillusionment of the
lower- and middle-classes, who see very little
opportunity in their own and their children’s future.
Although it may equally encourage innovation
and entrepreneurship, an aspiration gap will fuel
frustration. Digitally connected people in developing
and advanced economies alike will see a better
life elsewhere, but limited economic opportunities
in their own environment will prevent them from
accessing this level of living standards. Even small
shifts in access to income and opportunity –
perceived or actual – may spark protests and civil
unrest and deepen anti-immigration sentiment and
hate crimes against migrant populations. In the
most extreme scenarios, discontent with the status
quo could even push societies towards more open
rebellion and calls for regime change.

Global Risks Report 2024

Acting today

the potential private investor base – or blended
finance structures, including with the support of
philanthropic investors, could improve the perceived
risk-return profile, opening these investment
opportunities to institutional investors.102

As much as the green transition and frontier AI pose
radical disruptions to traditional economic models
and pathways to development, they also offer
substantial opportunities. With careful management
and a degree of international cooperation,
effective labour and social mobility can ensure that
prosperity, rather than risks, are shared across
borders, unleashing productivity benefits offered
by both economic transformations, and enhancing
human development.

In the face of these structural shifts to the
employment landscape, very few demographic
groups, industries or countries can remain
complacent. Recognizing that both the impacts of
climate and AI on job markets will not be uniform,
solutions to improve economic mobility must be
tailored to address specific vulnerabilities, such
as labour shortages, on an industry- and countrylevel basis. For example, human capital that is
“stranded” by the green transition – i.e., displaced
workers from carbon-intensive industries – could
help address green labour shortages if geographic,
economic or skills barriers can be overcome. A
stronger focus on sectors that go beyond narrow
definitions of tech and green, such as health, care,
education, tourism, hospitality, agriculture, personal
services and culture – each of which tends to
favour human traits and generate large-scale
employment – can also help countries support the
structural transitions of their labour markets and
workforces. The public and private sector will need
to work together to ensure the skills transition from
sunset to sunrise roles.

For example, while Unemployment is considered
to be addressed primarily by Corporate strategies
and National and local regulations (Figure 2.23), a
rise in remote work and non-traditional employment
arrangements, alongside technology and skills
transfers, could help address global inequalities
in access to economic opportunities. Current
efforts to reshape the global tax regime should also
target emerging sources of inequity and support
developing markets in capturing a share of the
next generation of value chains. The support of
multilateral and international finance mechanisms
could also reduce real and perceived risks in the
most vulnerable countries to unlock financing flows.
The expanded use of guarantees could broaden

–

State fragility, fueled by climate change, conflict and economic hardship, will create or widen a
governance gap in which transnational organized crime can flourish.

–

Technological advances will open new markets and allow crime networks to spread, and the human and
economic cost of crime may rise in tandem.

–

As the ease and attractiveness of these parallel economies grows, the lines between criminals and the
state likely will blur.

Organized crime may continue to globalize in
terms of both targets and operations, and in doing
so, could become a powerful and destabilizing
presence in a wider set of countries. The latest
data suggests that activity has already started to
rise across all criminal markets and actors (Figure
2.25).103 Notwithstanding a drop in homicide rates,
organized crime remains a significant contributor to
lethal violence: between 2000 and 2019, it resulted
in roughly the same number of killings as all armed
conflicts across the world combined, at a rate of
approximately 65,000 deaths per year.104
Illicit economic activity is an under-the-radar
risk – it ranks comparatively low in terms of
perceived severity over both the two- and 10year time horizons, at #28 and #31 respectively
(Figure 2.24). While narrower than the definition
adopted by the GRPS, this section will focus
specifically on organized crime in light of these
recent data trends to explore whether emerging
geostrategic, environmental, demographic and
technological forces could turn the already-chronic
risk of organized crime into a pressing crisis over
the next decade. Indeed, many of the perceived

drivers to Illicit economic activity are among the
most severe perceived risks over the short- and
longer-term horizon. It is among the top 10 most
connected risks in the network, seen to be driven
by Economic downturn, Lack of economic
opportunity, Cyber insecurity and Involuntary
migration, together with Unemployment,
Intrastate violence and Geoeconomic
confrontation, among others (Figure 2.26).
There are three concurrent trends that will fuel
crime syndicates and related illicit markets over the
next decade. First, societal fragility, arising from
geopolitical, socioeconomic and environmental
vulnerabilities, may drive an expansion in illicit
markets. In parallel, advances in technology will
break down barriers to entry – borders, languages,
skill sets – opening alternate revenue streams,
particularly in the cyber domain, and allowing
transnational criminal networks to spread. Finally,
the erosion of legitimate governance may create
a vacuum of power for criminal organizations to
flourish, contesting fragile regimes for territorial
control, or capitalizing on lucrative partnerships with
state actors.

Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2023.

Global averages 2021 versus 2023. A number of new indicators were added to the Global
Organized Crime Index in 2023, identified by an asterisk. Financial crimes refers to organized
crime that results in a financial loss to the state, entity and / or private individuals through a
range of activities. However, given overlap with other categories, where such activities are
attributable to another criminal market under the index, financial crimes fall under their
respective market indicator (for example, procurement fraud for logging contracts falls under
flora crime).

Vulnerable markets
Over the coming decade, parallel economies (or
black markets)105 are likely to proliferate, creating
lucrative revenue streams and recruitment pools for
organized crime networks, as the costs of crime
spread more widely to citizens.
Resource stress, conflict and economic hardship
will interact to drive more pervasive demand
for smuggling as well as vulnerability to criminal
activities.106 Demand for illegal smuggling of drugs,
weapons, resources, cash, pharmaceuticals and
people will increase in tandem with geopolitical,
economic and environmental developments.
Expanded sanctions regimes (Chapter 1.4: Rise in
conflict), offensive geoeconomic policies, climaterelated involuntary migration, and even anticipated
price volatility in the licit economy – in food, fuel,
health or critical minerals – could all drive an
expansion in illegal smuggling in new geographic
markets or in new products.107 For example,
ongoing market concentration in the tech value
chain means that technology-related smuggling,
including in semiconductors, is likely to continue

to expand (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge).108 Illegal
mining of critical resources will be a major source of
instability across multiple regions, from South-East
Asia to Latin America, driving violence, corruption,
the displacement of Indigenous populations and
environmental destruction.109 As scarcity drives up
resource value, environmental crimes such as illegal
logging could drive forced labour and human rights
abuses, and accelerate broader environmental
impacts in turn.110 Similarly, the fisheries sector could
increasingly attract the interest of organized crime
groups. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is
a revenue stream that can be engaged in with relative
impunity, with jurisdictional challenges hampering
enforcement. The practice also complements other
forms of marine trafficking, including drugs and
people.111
At the same time, socioeconomic vulnerabilities
arising from these same trends will heighten
exposure to criminal networks. Conflict- or climaterelated migration will likely drive exploitation
by criminal actors engaging in, for example,
child labour and cyber slavery.112 Additionally,
social disintegration, urban segregation, poverty
and economic inequalities are all well-known

potential drivers of criminal activity and could
lead more people towards criminal activity.113
Unemployment is seen to be the strongest
driver of Illicit economic activity (selected by
more than 40% of GRPS respondents). If poverty
and unemployment become chronic concerns in
countries vulnerable to livelihood crises (Chapter
2.5: End of development?), crime may become
the predominant source of income and the only way
to access necessities for some communities.

new technologies to diversify illicit funding and
fragment the physical presence of organized crime.
This will pose significant risks to individuals and
legal businesses – and has the potential to lead to
violence that challenges the power of governments
and threatens the territorial control of states.114
New tools and capabilities will open new markets
for criminal networks, with cybercrime offering an
increasingly low-risk and low-cost revenue stream for
organized crime.115 Phishing attacks, for example, can
now be easily and accurately translated into minority
languages using generative AI. Over the coming
years, more sophisticated cyber defenses will shift
targets towards less digitally literate individuals or less
secure infrastructure and systems. Already prevalent
in Latin America, cybercrime will continue to spread
to parts of Asia and West and Southern Africa, as
affluency grows and internet connectivity brings large
swathes of the global population online.116

Cyber vulnerabilities
In parallel, rapid integration of advanced
technologies are exposing a broader subset
of the global population to potential digital and
physical exploitation. Organized crime networks will
increasingly adopt blended business models utilizing

of their networks to strengthen strategic footholds
of economic and political activity. Enabled by
technology, crime networks can spread to exploit
heightened demand, regulatory and enforcement
gaps, and negative public perceptions of police
and state legitimacy, with financing, suppliers,
customers and violence originating in separate
markets.119 EOS results suggest that this may
be an underappreciated risk among business
perceptions, with more traditional forms of crime
– including illicit trade and trafficking – anticipated
to remain largely concentrated in Latin America
and the Caribbean over the next two years (Figure
2.28). Of note are several economies, such as
Nigeria, Kenya, Türkiye and Indonesia, that are
already experiencing higher levels of criminality
(shaded darker orange), despite Illicit economic
activity not ranking as highly in risk perceptions.

Figure 2.27 outlines a growing concern around the
risk of Cybercrime and cyber insecurity among
business leaders in developing regions. It ranks
among the top 10 risks over the next two years
for markets already grappling with higher levels
of criminality, such as Cameroon, Mali, Thailand
and the United Arab Emirates. The adoption of
these digitally blended models, leveraging cyber
and physical revenue streams, was seen by some
experts consulted to potentially lead to a drop in
violence if these activities supersede alternate forms
of illicit revenue, such as drug trafficking. Notably,
however, the destructive influence of cybercrime
puts more civilians at risk than when concentrated
between criminal actors in intergang warfare, in
addition to being associated with other forms of
physical violence, such as human trafficking.117
Organized crime groups will also increasingly utilize

Technology-enabled proliferation of illicit activities
in new markets and geographies could have
numerous implications at a state, company and
individual level. Alongside cybersecurity concerns, it
could expose businesses to a range of heightened
risks, from reputational threats and regulatory
scrutiny relating to financial flows and supply
chains to impacts on the long-term viability and
success of legitimate markets. In more extreme
scenarios, geographic expansion of these criminal

BOX 2.10

syndicates could also lead to political violence that
challenges the power of governments, mirroring
recent developments throughout Latin America
and the Caribbean, such as in Haiti.120 A rise in
“ungoverned” spaces will also likely be seen in
the growth of armed and radicalized groups and
disenchanted youths in many cities throughout the
developed world, threatening public safety and
security.

The next global shock?
Global fentanyl epidemic
Enforcement of the Taliban’s ban and the near
eradication of poppy production in Afghanistan
could have widespread implications for the global
drug trade.121 Historically accounting for around
80% of opium production, Afghanistan’s rapid
shortfall in supply could be largely met through
synthetic drugs. Fentanyl, for example, offers
significant advantages to crime groups: it is
less labour-intensive, requires smaller volumes
of precursor materials and offers a lower cost
revenue stream. Some experts consulted
referenced early signs of on-shored production

in industrialized economies, enabled by “crime
as a service” construction of illicit laboratories.
Concerningly, however, fentanyl is far more potent
than natural opium, with severe health implications
if it were to penetrate markets more broadly. It is
the leading cause of death in young adults in the
United States, with overdose deaths attributable
to fentanyl use reaching almost 110,000 in 2022
– although the United States and China recently
reached a deal to limit the export of pre-cursor
chemicals.122

State-enabled criminality
Growing state fragility will strengthen the ease and
attractiveness of these parallel economies for a
broader set of actors, either because of reduced
state capacity to respond or, in some cases,
blurring of the lines between criminals and the state.
Indeed, the state itself could support or become
susceptible to organized crime over the next
decade.123
Fueled by fragility, more widespread corruption
could create a vicious cycle whereby states are
unable to rebuild the resilience to effectively
counter organized crime and could instead be
captured by criminal networks. For example,

corruption could effectively lead to control of
transportation hubs, law enforcement and
parts of the public sector by organized crime
groups.124 This in turn would undermine the rule
of law, distort competition and weaken economic
growth further, eroding both societal trust and
enforcement capacities. Figure 2.30125 depicts
this symbiotic relationship, whereby criminality is
generally found hand-in-hand with fragile states
that have higher levels of conflict and corruption.
State “sponsorship” of illicit activities may also
become more common (Box 2.11). In cyberspace,
for example, commodified products (including
ransomware) and services-for-hire (such as money
laundering) are now easily accessible for less
technically competent actors.126 This includes
Global Risks Report 2024

73

procurement by states and state-backed actors to
conduct espionage and foreign interference.127 The
lines between organized crime, private militia and
terrorist groups will also blur. Symbiotic partnerships
between states and organized crime could grow,
such as in acquiring the data of investigative
journalists amid a broader crackdown on
information flows (Chapter 1.3: False information),
in return for concessions and bilateral agreements.
State-sponsored groups may increasingly adopt
blended business models, undertaking both licit and
illicit activities. For example, the Wagner Group is a
private military company that has been designated

FIGURE 2.29

as a “transnational criminal organization” by the
United States. The organization has a network of
economic entities, including mining companies,
particularly across Africa.128 The presence of these
groups could further fuel the cycle between conflict,
fragility, corruption and crime, particularly where the
state does not have the capacity to enforce legal
rights. Not only can the presence of these groups
drive lethal violence, but they also offer an economic
pathway for illicit activities as other pathways stall.
For example, climate change has led to a decline in
arable land and fish stocks in Lake Chad, prompting
some individuals to join armed groups as an
alternative source of income.129

BOX 2.11

The next global shock?
State criminal
In a more extreme scenario, the state itself may
become the criminal. Cybercrime could create
lucrative illicit funding streams that are difficult
to attribute to any particular state and that can
be used for government services, illegal political
activities (such as assassinations or disinformation
campaigns) or even political campaigns. For

Acting today
To effectively prevent the spread of illicit activity
across both geographic and economic markets,
three key areas could be tackled: the capability to
launder illicit profits; communications that enable
extensive criminal networks; and corruption.131 For
example, while the counter-risk of surveillance needs
to be handled carefully, the dismantling of encrypted
communications could be a radical tool to disrupt
transnational crime networks. The takedown of
EncroChat, for instance, led to 6,558 arrests and
close to EUR900 million in criminal funds seized or
frozen.132 All three pillars can be tackled at multiple
layers of governance; however, GRPS respondents
feel that National and local regulations have the
most potential for driving action on risk reduction
and preparedness with respect to Illicit economic
activity (Figure 2.30).

FIGURE 2.30

example, North Korea stole $200 million in
cryptocurrencies over an eight-month period
last year, allegedly to fund their nuclear weapons
programme.130 Autocratic governments, fragile
regimes and “ungoverned states” are more
susceptible to such capture.

With constraints to international cooperation,
there may be a shift towards unilateral, bilateral
and regional agreements on crime, although
these may prove less effective at addressing
transnational criminal networks that transcend
political alliances and country borders. GRPS
respondents recognize the continued need for
Global treaties and agreements to boost local
efforts. While it was considered comparatively
less important in the context of Cyber insecurity,
the development of a UN treaty on cybercrime
is seen by some to be an encouraging step,
notwithstanding that it is accompanied by deep
concerns around related government repression
of human rights.133 If adopted, it would be the first
framework for international cooperation on a cyber
issue, addressing the prevention, investigation
and prosecution of cybercrime.134 Alongside these
efforts, a focus on socioeconomic drivers will also
be essential to reduce entry pathways into, and
demand for, criminal activities.

When asked about the global political outlook
for cooperation on risks over the next decade,
two-thirds of respondents (66%) believe that we
will face a multipolar or fragmented order, in which
middle and great powers contest, set and enforce
regional rules and norms (Figure 2.31). Cooperation
on urgent global issues, from an interrelated

global risks) explores different types of global risks
and how to address them ahead of the next decade
in a new multipolar context.

Longer-term, macro, structural trends and uncertainties are often used in conducting strategic foresight exercises. For
example, the EU’s 2023 Strategic Foresight outlines a set of key social and economic challenges, including the rise of
geopolitics and reconfiguration of globalization. The US National Intelligence Council’s Global Trends 2024 Report outlines
four “structural forces”, defined as “conditions and trends that are somewhat knowable or forecastable with data because
of existing conditions of patterns”, and includes a detailed set of predictions relating to demographics and human
development, environment, economics and technology. The structural forces adopted for the purposes of this report
build on and adapt these concepts, to define the most material longer-term shifts in the systemic elements of the global
landscape, identified through expert stakeholder consultation. For more information, see: National Intelligence Council,

The global population is projected to increase by nearly 0.7 billion people over the next decade, but population growth
has been slowing over the past 50 years, with the global growth rate hitting 0.82% in 2021. This reflects rapidly
falling fertility rates over the same period, dropping to around 2.3 births per woman, globally, in 2021. In contrast, life
expectancy globally grew by almost nine years since 1990. See the following for further details: PRB, Africa’s Future:

irreversibly”. IPCC, IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_

At the current level of global warming (~1.1°C), five climate systems could have passed tipping points in theory, including:
low-latitude coral reefs; the permafrost; the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets; and the Labrador-Irminger Seas
Convection. At 1.5°C of warming, another five could be placed at risk: the Boreal Forests (North and South); Atlantic M.O.
Circulation (AMOC); Barents Sea ice; and Mountain Glaciers. Notably, however, this is the minimum temperature level in
what can be quite large uncertainty bandings. See: McKay, David I. Armstrong, et. al., “Exceeding 1.5°C global warming

Also worth noting is the contribution of climate tipping points to climate change more broadly. Over the next century,
alongside methane, the collapse of permafrost could release more than double the remaining carbon budget for
maintaining warming below 1.5°C (888 Gt against 400 Gt), which also represents three-quarters of the budget for
maintaining warming below 2°C. See: OECD, 2022.

It should be noted that cyber-dependent criminal activity may operate under a different organizational model, compared
to cyber-enabled or cyber-assisted criminal activity. For an overview, see United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime

There is a positive nexus between crime, income and inequality, which suggests that even countries becoming more
affluent face a higher crime risk. Notably, however, low-income countries will remain largely excluded as targets, as weak
economic conditions tend to contain the pervasiveness of criminal activity, even though deeper poverty levels may trigger
more criminal actions. See: Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2023, and Sugiharti, et al., 2023.

The interaction of technology with crime can be differentiated into three categories: cyber-assisted crimes are facilitated
by information communication technologies (ICT); cyber-enabled crimes are traditional crimes that are magnified by ICT;
and cyber-dependent crimes are those that can only be committed using computers, computer networks or other forms
of ICT. See: UNODC, 2021, and Di Nicola, 2022.

Responding
to global risks
The previous chapters outlined a global landscape
where a myriad of vulnerabilities are stretching
our capacity to respond to key global challenges.
This chapter considers the ways in which we can
address global risks, given increasingly complex
and non-linear aspects of how they will evolve,
against a backdrop of a fragmented geopolitical
environment where cooperation may be in short
supply.
Managing a volatile risk landscape in a low
cooperation world
Some of the challenges we face are risks familiar
to human history – pandemics and geopolitical
conflicts – while others are new and fast-evolving,
such as Earth system changes or the adverse
effects of new technologies. Many global risks
are inherently interconnected and may have far
reaching consequences to human development
- eroding resilience and reducing our collective
capacity to respond.
While collaborative effort remains the cornerstone
of addressing global risks, not all require deep
global cooperation as the only viable solution. In an
increasingly fragmented world, examining alternative
paths with varying degrees of cooperation can
provide a broader mental model to support planning
and preparation.
Implementing global risk reduction measures is
equivalent to providing a global public good.1
These goods are defined as non-excludable and
non-rivalrous, which means that, unlike common

goods, use by one country neither prevents access
nor reduces availability to others. For example, if a
single national government implements a policy that
slows the spread of an infectious disease, the entire
global community will benefit from it.
As with global public goods, risk reduction efforts
tend to suffer from the “free rider problem.” In
a world characterized by different and at times
competing power centres pursuing their own
interests, governments may be incentivized to
transfer the burden of prevention or preparedness
to others, while reaping the benefits of others’
investments without incurring the costs. Similarly,
not all efforts of risk reduction require the same level
of cooperation to be implemented, falling along a
spectrum ranging from those that require the effort
of only one country or stakeholder, to those that
demand the collaboration of all.2
Building upon established notions of public
goods,3 there are four broad categories of
approaching global risk reduction, based on the
level of cooperation required: localized strategies;
breakthrough endeavors; collective actions; and
cross-border coordination.
Both the degree of complexity and the speed of
the global risks discussed in this report will demand
flexible and agile approaches that employ all
available levers at our disposal. There are actions
that can be taken individually or collectively to
implement preparedness measures for the risks we
cannot avoid – and to come together to prevent or
lessen the likelihood of the risks that we can.

3.1 Localized strategies
Localized strategies that address global risks
at a local level require little or no cross-border
coordination. They are concerned mainly with
increasing a community's preparedness to bear
the effects of inevitable global risks, but do not
significantly mitigate their impact beyond national
borders.
With looming urgency to adapt to avoid the worst
impacts of a changing climate, local measures
present a relatively agile response to risk,
unencumbered by lengthy processes that are
common to global agreements. Measures range
from instigating more resilient building codes
to making investments in wildfire management,
flood defenses and heatwave mitigation.
Infrastructure investment can also enhance a
country’s preparedness to tackle pandemics.
When COVID-19 hit, it was the capacity of national
health systems – i.e., availability of hospital beds,
intensive care units and medical personnel – that
largely dictated its local impact. While localized
strategies are generally associated with boosting
preparedness, there are some cases where they
prevent global risks from materializing altogether.
Local compliance with vaccine guidance, for

FIGURE 3.1

example, can eliminate diseases such as polio.
There are several global risk governance
approaches highlighted within the GRPS that would
fall under local measures: Public awareness and
education, Financial instruments and National
and local regulations. Public awareness and
education initiatives can be effective in reducing the
impact of AI-enabled misinformation on local media
environments. While it is difficult for single countries
to control the diffusion of AI-generated content,
it is in their power to include AI-literacy in public
education systems and to prioritize the issues
of understanding AI’s capabilities and identifying
trustworthy sources of information. Financial
instruments – including insurance, catastrophe
bonds or public-risk pools – can alleviate the effects
of natural disasters and geoeconomic shocks, while
social safety nets and pensions represent important
tools in managing longer-term risks associated with
demographic trends and societal polarization.
National and local regulations are identified
by the majority of GRPS respondents as key for
driving action on a number of economic risks
(Figure 3.1). Appropriate fiscal and monetary

policies are employed to control Inflation and build
resilience against Asset bubble bursts. National
governments also have the power to act against
Illicit economic activity and reduce their countries’
vulnerability to organized crime. Protection against
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as
well as Pollution can also be managed via local or
national environmental regulation.
Localized strategies can be enacted
independently, and thus face fewer hurdles in
terms of cooperation requirements. However,
they are not free from challenges. Investment to
boost resilience is costly and not all countries or
jurisdictions have the same resources, technology
and capacity. In an environment of rising costs and
narrow approaches to international investment, the
capacity and financing for implementing effective
local measures tend to be more concentrated
in higher-income countries, perpetuating rather
than addressing inequality. They may also have
unintended spillover effects across borders; for

example, economic levers to tackle inflation in one
economy can lead to debt concerns in another
(Chapter 1.5: Economic uncertainty).
The public and private sectors, alone and in
partnership, can play a role in scaling local
responses, bringing down costs and expanding
risk reduction capabilities to all. Businesses are
key developers, testers and early adopters of new
technologies, such as foods that rapidly grow in
extremely adverse environments or AI tools to spot
nascent wildfires.4 Likewise, governments have the
ability to step in and de-risk investments to help
close the gap in economic opportunity and bolster
resilience (Chapter 2.5: End of development?).
Novel approaches to ownership of local
infrastructure, involving regulator intervention and
community ownership, can allow projects to become
more bankable, feasible and targeted, while local
action groups can often mobilize effective disaster
response as well as direct funds to prevention.5

3.2 Breakthrough endeavors
In some cases, the action of an individual or
entity can be enough to provide a “breakthrough”
development to address risk or to serve as the
positive tipping point to an alternate “safe state.”
These breakthrough endeavors are as equally
relevant for preventing or mitigating the likelihood of
risk as they are for lessening the impact.
Many breakthrough endeavors fall under the approach
of Research & development (R&D), encompassing
activities such as medical breakthroughs, new
technologies or a novel approach to quantifying and
governing risk. A prominent example of the latter is the
formation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) by the United Nations Environment
Programme and the World Meteorological Association
in 1988, endorsed by the UN the same year. There
are also examples of industrial transformations that

have pivoted based on a single idea or action, such as
the targeted effort of eliminating chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) to protect the ozone layer, resulting in a
significant impact on a global problem.
GRPS respondents note that R&D can play a
key role in addressing health, environmental
and technological risks (Figure 3.2). During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the concentrated efforts of a
few pharmaceutical companies made a difference
for the global community. Supported by significant
funding from governments, their innovations
to develop a novel vaccine in record time was
crucial to lowering death rates, demonstrating
the immense potential of scientific breakthroughs
on reducing the impact of health-related risks like
Infectious diseases.

R&D can boost preparedness for inevitable
environmental risks such as Extreme weather
events and Non-weather related natural
disasters, as well as allowing us to reduce the
likelihood of Critical changes to Earth systems
and Natural resources shortages. A significant
leap forward in research leading to viable nuclear
fusion power generation for example, could
represent a turning point, providing clean energy
and accelerating the transition to Net Zero, at the
same time as reducing the risk of Pollution.6 As
discussed in Chapter 2.3: A 3°C world, however,
the unilateral application of climate mitigation
technologies also carry risks.
There are other hurdles to overcome. Despite
potentially being on the precipice of a “golden age”
of scientific discovery, the strategic importance of
emerging technologies, such as AI and quantum
computing, is resulting in a fragmentation of R&D
initiatives, with some opting for political isolationism
to safeguard technological advancements. The
formation of a new body equivalent to the IPCC
to synthesize key perspectives relating to AI risk
has been mooted; to be effective, it would need
to overcome the challenges of ensuring balance
of representation and of being nimble enough to
address rapidly emerging scientific developments.
And while R&D can result in game-changing

solutions, the institutions involved often lack the
funds or political might needed to translate into
impact. With carbon capture and storage (CCS) for
example, the sheer scale of the costs associated
with deployment act as barriers, alongside limited
confidence in the success of the outcomes.
Technology is seen as both a source of risk and
as part of the solution. Adverse outcomes of AI
technologies is viewed as a top risk that can be
addressed by R&D. However, AI may also prove to
be the key to unlocking a multitude of the world’s
problems. Recent research, for example, suggests
that it could revolutionize materials science,
allowing us to make leaps forward in terms of
batteries, solar panels, computer chips and other
vital technologies that will be required in efforts to
address a multitude of risks.7
Strengthening global research networks that connect
researchers, institutions and industries worldwide can
facilitate communication and the sharing of resources.
Public-sector support remains crucial. Healthcare
companies alone would not have been able to roll
out an effective vaccine for COVID-19 in such a short
time frame had they not been co-funded, and this
model of governments de-risking liability to fast-track
deployment could be extended to other challenges,
potentially coupled with enhanced conditionalities

to ensure returns are more equally shared. Fiscal
incentives can be deployed to encourage further
innovation within the private sector, while acceptance
of new technologies and approaches would be
bolstered by governance and oversight. The role of
philanthropy, should also not be overlooked as a key
source of funding for ambitious projects to eradicate
disease and boost climate resilience, for example.8

Policy-makers need to adopt a dual vision,
harnessing the power of innovation to address
present challenges, while keeping an eye on the
future. Investing in breakthrough endeavors is often
a long-term bet, involving some degree of risk-taking
and failure, but coupled with wins that boost our
ability to mitigate or adapt in the face of global risks.

3.3 Collective actions
When the sum of individual actions are directed
towards a common goal, change can be effected on
a global scale. Collective action is not the result of
collaboration, but of the aggregate and independent
effort of single citizens, companies and countries.
Examples include expanding the adoption of a
vegetarian diet or reducing combustion-engine
cars and air travel to slash carbon emissions.
These changes in lifestyle or consumption
patterns are insignificant when pursued by a single
individual. But if a material number of people
take such actions concurrently, such aggregate
efforts have the power to alter market dynamics
and move the dial on climate-change mitigation.

FIGURE 3.3

The same is true for business actions. If a critical
number of companies commit to building ethical
supply chains, respect for human rights and labour
standards will improve worldwide.
Collective action can also play a role in terms of
preparing for global risks. Japan’s CommunityBased Disaster Risk Management9 and
Bangladesh’s Cyclone Preparedness Program10
both demonstrate the power of collective
preparedness to address inevitable environmental
risks and how communities can be mobilized to
mitigate their impacts. Borne out of the necessity
to prepare for environmental risks in one of the
most seismically active regions in the world, a

core component of Japan’s preparedness strategy
centres on building momentum for a nationwide
movement from local preparedness and resilience
measures. Likewise, ensuring rapid dissemination of
official cyclone warning signals across communities
encourages collective preparedness measures to be
implemented along Bangladesh’s coast. Technology
can act as an enabler for collective action.
Information and communication technologies,
including social media, have transformed the speed
and the way in which information is shared, and
while there are risks associated with this (Chapter
1.3: False information), there are also benefits in
terms of mass mobilization for public good.
There are several risk governance approaches
identified within the GRPS that would fall under
collective action: Public awareness and
education, Multistakeholder engagement, and
Corporate strategies. Public awareness and
education campaigns amplify (grassroot) initiatives
that have yet to reach a critical mass in order to
make an impact. In some cases, governments have
established specific units to effect change through
encouraging collective behaviours, such as those
to prevent the spread of disease.11 Multistakeholder
engagement platforms favour knowledge and best
practice sharing to support and guide individual
efforts towards a common goal.
GRPS respondents recognize Corporate strategies
as having the most potential to reduce economic
risks relating to financial and labour markets (Figure

3.3). If companies adopt responsible business
practices and investment decisions, they will reap
reputational and performance benefits12 while making
the wider economic and financial system more
resilient and prepared to face the risk of Economic
downturn. Businesses can also contribute to
shoring up the labour market, both locally and
globally, by addressing Labour shortages and
Unemployment risks through investing in skills
development, upholding workers’ rights and granting
contract security.
In order for collective action to be sufficiently
effective, there must be some degree of consensus
on the nature and urgency of the risk, the type
of action required to address it and the intended
outcome. This is no small feat in a world increasingly
subject to societal polarization and where short-term
cost-of-living pressures continue to bite.
It is crucial therefore to build platforms that
set standards and favour knowledge-sharing,
channeling individual efforts towards a common
goal. Tax incentives can strengthen collective action
by business and individuals. Policy-makers can also
strengthen regulation on environmental, social and
corporate governance (ESG) reporting to ensure
transparency on corporate social responsibility
strategies. This contributes to creating a positive
cycle where investors can recognize and reward
the businesses that act, which in turns incentivizes
more and more companies to align.

3.4 Cross-border coordination
Cooperation may be constrained in an increasingly
fragmented world, but it remains imperative to solve
the biggest, most existential risks. Cross-border
coordination for risk reduction takes many forms
and is typically centred on mitigating likelihood. It
ranges from mutual restraint (agreement between
two or more parties that possess dangerous

capabilities to refrain from using them), to
addressing the weakest link in a system (enforcing
commitment to minimum standards and guardrails
or by investing in a country that has the potential
to destabilize others), to international agreements
(such as those that aim to limit global warming,
maintain security and ensure free trade).

agreements, Development assistance, corporate strategies, Research & development, Public
awareness and education, Multi-stakeholder engagement.

Pressing risks requiring mutual restraint often
involve the proliferation and malign use of
advanced and potentially destructive technologies.
Restraining the use of weapons of mass destruction
or restricting the incorporation of AI into lethal
weapons and nuclear decision-making systems
are needed to avoid the risk of inadvertent conflict
escalation (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge).
When it comes to global risks such as terrorism
or pandemic outbreaks, it is often the weakest
link that dictates the risk. Technological advances
in AI mean that bio-engineered pathogens have
become a reality, and a security breach of a highcontainment bio-laboratory or bio-foundry, for
example, is a global concern.
GRPS respondents highlight Minilateral treaties
and agreements and Global treaties and
agreements as risk governance approaches
within the category of cross-border coordination.
Minilateral treaties – or agreements involving a
smaller number of parties and often backed by
regional financing – represent a feasible solution
to many global risks faced by a fragmented world,
where it is difficult to have a large number of
countries endorsing the same cause.

Global treaties and agreements, the result of
constructive dialogue, negotiation and compromise,
are fundamental to mitigating and preparing for
many global risks. They enable involved parties to
identify common ground and cooperate towards
shared objectives. GRPS respondents recognize
such treaties as the most appropriate lever to
manage key geopolitical risks such as Interstate
armed conflict; Geoeconomic confrontation; and
Biological, chemical or nuclear hazards; as well
as inherently globalized environmental risks such as
Critical changes to Earth systems (Figure 3.4).
Amid growing geopolitical rifts, global treaties and
agreements face numerous challenges. Agreements
regarding global trade and financial integration are
under pressure from trade conflicts between China
and the United States, Brexit and national postCOVID-19 economic recovery efforts. While there
is emerging consensus on the need for a universal
regulatory framework for AI to address concerns
surrounding ethical standards, data privacy and
potential misuse, the first steps in this arena seem
to be faltering, with the EU’s landmark AI Act
coming under pressure from governments13 and
technology companies14 alike. Striking a balance
between fostering innovation and addressing
Global Risks Report 2024

91

ethical concerns within an international framework
is proving complicated, given varying perspectives
and economic interests.
Yet cross-border coordination remains a necessary
– and, in some cases, the only – path to address
the global risks that threaten human prosperity and
security. Minilateral treaties and agreements may
be increasingly appropriate to resolve conflict and
ensure economic prosperity at a regional level; but
they are unlikely to replace wider agreements in
maintaining global security.
Progress has been made through international
collaboration in addressing climate change; but
action needs to be deepened, widened and, most
crucially, sped up. National representatives that
attended the 2023 United Nations Climate Change

Conference (COP28) approved for the first time a
roadmap for “transitioning away from fossil fuels”
– but the deal stopped short of a long-demanded
call for a “phaseout” of oil, coal and gas.15 “Climate
Clubs”, or coalitions of the willing,16 represent a
practical path for progress given the challenges
of traditional multilateralism. These coalitions of
countries commit to ambitious climate goals and
adopt measures to enforce compliance, while
offering incentives for membership.
When it comes to security, much momentum is
with the private sector, where applications with
dual use potential are being developed.17 As
technology evolves faster than regulation, private
producers must take responsibility to not only be
transparent, but to show restraint when releasing
new frontier models.

3.5 Conclusion
The world is undergoing multiple long-term
structural transformations: the rise of AI, climate
change, a shift in the geopolitical distribution
of power, and demographic transitions. These
structural forces are global, pervasive and charged
with momentum. Against this backdrop, known
and newly emerging risks need preparation and
mitigation (see Figure 3.5 for the full picture of
GRPS responses regarding drivers of risk reduction
and preparedness).
Localized strategies, breakthrough endeavours,
collective actions and cross-border coordination all
play a part in addressing these risks.

Localized strategies, leveraging investment and
regulation, are critical for reducing the impact
of global risks, and both the public and private
sector can play a key role in extending benefits
to all. Through prioritizing the future and focusing
on breakthrough research and development, the
efforts of single entities can make the world a safer
place. The actions of individual citizens, companies
and countries – while perhaps insignificant on their
own – can move the needle on global risk reduction
if they reach a critical mass. Finally, cross-border
coordination remains the only viable pathway for the
most critical risks to human security and prosperity.

Appendix A
Definitions and Global Risks List
Definitions
For the purposes of this report, “Climate
change” is a structural force that encompasses
the trajectories of global warming and possible
consequences to Earth systems, reflecting
anthropogenic actions and environmental changes.
“Demographic bifurcation” is a structural force
that refers to changes to the size, growth and
structure of national, regional or global populations,
and the resulting impact on socioeconomic and
political structures. It includes, but is not limited to,
migration, fertility and ageing rates.
“Geostrategic shifts” is a structural force that
refers to changing geopolitical power dynamics.
It encompasses global and regional alliances and
relations, the offensive and defensive projection of
different sources of power (including economic),
and national attitudes relating to key actors,
governance mechanisms and strategic goals.
“Global risk” is the possibility of the occurrence
of an event or condition which, if it occurs, would
negatively impact a significant proportion of global
GDP, population or natural resources.
“Structural force” is the long-term shift in the
arrangement of and relation between the systemic
elements of the global landscape. These shifts

TA B L E A . 1

are not risks in and of themselves, but have the
potential to materially influence the speed, spread
and scope of global risks. These include but are
not limited to: geostrategic shifts, technological
acceleration, climate change and demographic
bifurcation.
“Technological acceleration” is a structural force
that refers to technological developments enabled
by exponential growth in computing power and
analysis. It has the potential to blur boundaries
between technology and humanity, and rapidly give
rise to novel and unpredictable global risks.
“Under-the-radar risk” is a global risk where new
intelligence, a marked deterioration, key decision
point or similar suggests that the severity of the risk
(likelihood or impact) is increasing and/or is higher
than indicated by global risk perceptions.

Global risk list
Table A.1 presents the list of 34 global risks and
definitions adopted in the Global Risks Perception
Survey 2023-2024.

Appendix B
Global Risk Perception Survey 2023-2024

The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the
World Economic Forum’s source of original risks
data, harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s
extensive network of academic, business,
government, civil society and thought leaders.
Survey responses were collected from 4 September
to 9 October 2023 from the World Economic
Forum’s multistakeholder communities.

Updates to the GRPS 2023-2024
The list of 34 global risks included in the survey was
updated in 2023 as follows.
Seven new risks were added in response to
observed trends across all five categories
(economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and
technological):
1. Censorship and surveillance

“Ineffectiveness of multilateral institutions and
international cooperation”, as well as “Failure of
climate-change adaptation” and “Failure to mitigate
climate change”. These updates were made to
ensure the global risks list focused on the core risk
itself, rather than a related exposure or vulnerability
to that risk through in/action.
The names and definitions of the remaining
risks have been revised and, where applicable,
merged, modified and/or expanded to reflect
new ways in which the risks may materialize and
the potential adverse outcomes they may cause.
However, to ensure comparability over time, the
fundamental concept of each risk has remained
broadly consistent with that of previous versions of
the survey, although names and definitions were
modified.

Methodology

3. Concentration of strategic resources (minerals,
materials)

The GRPS 2023–2024 was further refined this year
to gather more granular perceptions of risk and to
incorporate new approaches to risk management
and analysis. To that end, the GRPS 2023–2024
was comprised of seven sections:

4. Erosion of human rights and/or civic freedoms

–

2. Critical change to Earth systems (climate tipping
points)

5. Inequality or lack of economic opportunity
6. Intrastate violence (civil strikes, riots, coups)
7. Talent and/or labour shortages
In addition:
“Misinformation and disinformation” was
recategorized from a societal to a technological
risk, while “Disruptions to critical infrastructure” was
recategorized from a technological to an economic
risk.
“Adverse outcomes of AI technologies” was
split out from “Adverse outcomes from frontier
technologies (quantum, biotech, geoengineering)”,
while “Natural disasters and extreme weather
events” was delineated into two separate categories
(“Extreme weather events” and “Non-weatherrelated natural disasters”).
Global risk categories relating to a failure in
governance were removed. This includes

Current risk landscape asked respondents to
select up to five risks among 20 pre-selected
risks that they believe are the most likely to
present a material crisis on a global scale in
2024. The final rank is based on the share
of respondents who selected the particular
risk. The 20 options included: Accidental
or intentional nuclear event; Accidental or
intentional release of biological agents; AIgenerated misinformation and disinformation;
Attacks on critical infrastructure; Censorship
and erosion of free speech; Cost of living crisis;
Cyberattacks; Disrupted supply chains for
critical goods or resources; Disrupted supply
chains for energy; Disrupted supply chains
for food; Economic downturn; Escalation
or outbreak of interstate armed conflict(s);
Extreme weather events; Housing-bubble
burst; Institutional collapse within the financial
sector; Public-debt distress; Skills or labour
shortages; Societal and/or political polarization;
Tech bubble burst; and Violent civil strikes and
riots. Respondents were also able to write in
additional risks to Other, a free-text field. Results
are illustrated in Figure 1.2.

Short- and long-term risks landscape asked
respondents to estimate the likely impact
(severity) of each of the 34 global risks, on a 1-7
scale [1 – Low severity, 7 – High severity], over
both two-year and 10-year periods. “Severity”
is meant to take into consideration the impact
on populations, the economy or environmental
resources on a global scale. Respondents
were also allowed to nominate any other risk
considered missing from the 34 global risks. A
simple average based on the scores selected
was calculated and the results are illustrated in
Figures 1.3 and 2.2. In addition, if a respondent
selected the highest severity score (7) for any
of the 34 risks, they were asked a follow-up
question to identify areas of particular concern
with respect to the identified risk.
Consequences seeks to understand the
potential consequences of risks, to create a
network map of the global risk landscape.
Respondents were provided 10 randomly
selected global risks (from the full list of 34
global risks) and were then asked to select
up to five global risks (from the full list) likely
to be triggered by each of the 10 randomly
selected risks. Results are illustrated in Figure
1.7. In visual results, “Nodes: Risk influence”
is based on a simple tally of all bidirectional
relationships identified by respondents. “Edges:
Relative influence” is based on a simple tally
of the number of times the risk was identified
as a consequence. However, visual results do
not show all connections: weaker relationships
identified by less than 25% of respondents were
not included as edges.
Risk governance asked respondents to identify
approach(es) that they expect to have the most
potential for driving action on risk reduction
and preparedness over the next 10 years,
with respect to the most severe risks (severity
score of 6 or 7 over the 10-year timeframe).
Respondents could choose up to three answers
from the following nine approaches: Financial
instruments (e.g. insurance, catastrophe
bonds, public risk pools); National and local
regulations (e.g. environmental, operational,
financial regulations and incentives); Minilateral
treaties and agreements (e.g. Basel, Wassenaar,
regional free trade agreements); Global treaties
and agreements (e.g. UNFCC, Paris, Montreal,
NPT, WTO); Development assistance (e.g.
international aid for disaster risk response
and reduction); Corporate strategies (e.g.
ESG reporting, resilient supply chains, social
initiatives, PPPs); Research and development
(e.g. new technologies, early-warning systems,
global risk research); Public awareness and
education (e.g. campaigns, school curricula,
media products); Multistakeholder engagement
(e.g. platforms for exchanging knowledge,
best practices, alignment). A simple tally of the
number of times an approach was identified
was calculated for each risk. Results are
illustrated in Figure 3.5. To ensure legibility, the

names of some of the global risks have been
abbreviated in the figures. The portion of the full
name used in the abbreviation is in bold.
–

Risk outlook asked respondents to
characterize the evolution of the global risks
landscape based on a number of factors.
It first asked respondents to indicate which
statement best characterizes current and
future global efforts to manage the Earth’s
resources. Respondents were provided with
the same 7-point Likert scale for both the
current and future timescales, ranging from “We
need to respect Earth’s limits and restrict the
consumption of natural resources to make our
lifestyles sustainable” (1) to “We need to change
Earth’s limits using science and technology
to increase the supply of goods to create
abundance” (7). A simple tally for each of the
seven options was calculated.

–

Respondents were then asked to select a
statement that they believe best characterizes
the global political environment for
cooperation on global risks in 10 years.
Respondents were provided with four options:
(1) Continuation or reinvigoration of the US-led,
rules-based international order; (2) Multipolar
or fragmented order in which middle and great
powers contest, set and enforce regional rules
and norms; (3) Bipolar or bifurcated order
shaped by strategic competition between
two superpowers; (4) Realignment towards a
new international order led by an alternative
superpower. A simple tally for each of the four
options was calculated. Results are illustrated in
Figure 2.31.

–

Finally, respondents were asked to select
a statement which best characterizes their
outlook for the world over the next two and
10 years. Respondents were provided with
the same five options for both time periods: (1)
Calm: negligible risk of global catastrophes; (2)
Stable: isolated disruptions, low risk of global
catastrophes; (3) Unsettled: some instability,
moderate risk of global catastrophes; (4)
Turbulent: upheavals and elevated risk of global
catastrophes; (5) Stormy: global catastrophic
risks looming. A simple tally for each of the five
options was calculated. Results are illustrated in
Figure 1.1.

Over 11,000 respondents were presented with the
following question: “Which five risks are the most
likely to pose the biggest threat to your country
in the next two years?” and were asked to select
these from the list of 36 risks listed in Table C.1.
“Risk 1” indicates the most frequently selected
risk in each economy. Tied risks are presented
in alphabetical order, with the tie indicated by
numbering. For example, in Türkiye, two risks
(“Inequality (wealth, income)” and “Erosion of social
cohesion and wellbeing”) are tied for third place and
there is, therefore, no risk listed in fourth place.

For the purposes of more intuitive visual
representation of results in the report, risks which
were selected by zero respondents within a country
tie last at #36. Further, to analyse the results of
country or economy groups (such as the G20 or
EU), country-level results are aggregated by taking
a simple average of the ranking of the risk (from
1-36) by the countries or economies included in the
group.
