Global Risks Report 2023

Preface
Saadia Zahidi
Managing Director

Last year’s Global Risks Report warned that a
divergent economic recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic risked deepening divisions at a time
when collaboration was urgently required to address
looming global challenges. Yet despite hard-learned
lessons around the interdependence of global risks,
few would have anticipated the extent of instability
that would soon unfold, this time driven by a new war
in Europe.
The health and economic aftereffects of the pandemic
have quickly spiraled into compounding crises.
Carbon emissions have climbed, as the postpandemic global economy fired back up. Food and
energy have become weaponized by the war in
Ukraine, sending inflation soaring to levels not seen in
decades, globalizing a cost-of-living crisis and fueling
social unrest. The resulting shift in monetary policy
marks the end of an economic era defined by easy
access to cheap debt and will have vast ramifications
for governments, companies and individuals, widening
inequality within and between countries.
As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine
approaches one year, economies and societies
will not easily rebound from continued shocks. In
this year’s Global Risks Perception Survey, more
than four in five respondents anticipated consistent
volatility over the next two years. The persistence
of these crises is already reshaping the world that
we live in, ushering in economic and technological
fragmentation. A continued push for national resilience
in strategic sectors will come at a cost – one that only
a few economies can bear. Geopolitical dynamics
are also creating significant headwinds for global
cooperation, which often acts as a guardrail to these
global risks.
The 18th edition of the Global Risks Report considers
this backdrop of simmering geopolitical tensions
and confluence of socioeconomic risks. It identifies
the most severe perceived risks to economies
and societies over the next two years. The world's
collective focus is being channeled into the “survival”
of today’s crises: cost of living, social and political
polarization, food and energy supplies, tepid growth,
and geopolitical confrontation, among others.

Yet much-needed attention and resources are being
diverted from newly emerging or rapidly accelerating
risks to natural ecosystems, human health, security,
digital rights and economic stability that could
become crises and catastrophes in the next decade.
A low-growth, low-investment and low-cooperation
era further undermines resilience and the ability to
manage future shocks. In recognition of growing
complexity and uncertainty, the report also explores
connections between these risks. The analysis
focuses on a potential "polycrisis", relating to
shortages in natural resources such as food, water,
and metals and minerals, illustrating the associated
socioeconomic and environmental fall-out through a
set of potential futures.
The report is underpinned by our annual Global
Risks Perception Survey, which brings together
leading insights from over 1,200 experts across the
World Economic Forum’s diverse network. It draws
on the collective intelligence of the world’s foremost
risk experts, including the Global Risks Advisory
Board and the Chief Risk Officers Community, as
well as thematic experts from academia, business,
government, the international community and
civil society. The report has also benefited greatly
from the expertise of the World Economic Forum’s
platforms, which work daily to drive tangible,
system-positive change for the long term. We are
deeply grateful to our long-standing partners in the
report’s development: Marsh McLennan and Zurich
Insurance Group.
The 2023 edition of the Global Risks Report
highlights the multiple areas where the world is
at a critical inflection point. It is a call to action, to
collectively prepare for the next crisis the world may
face and, in doing so, shape a pathway to a more
stable, resilient world.

Global Risks Report 2023

Overview of
methodology
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) has
underpinned the Global Risks Report for nearly two
decades and is the World Economic Forum’s premier
source of original global risks data. This year’s
GRPS has brought together leading insights on the
evolving global risks landscape from over 1,200
experts across academia, business, government, the
international community and civil society. Responses
for the GRPS 2022-2023 were collected from 7
September to 5 October 2022.
“Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the
occurrence of an event or condition which, if it
occurs, would negatively impact a significant
proportion of global GDP, population or natural
resources. The GRPS 2022-2023 included the
following components:
•

Outlook invited respondents to predict global
volatility to provide context to the evolution of the
global risks landscape.

•

Severity assessed the perceived likely impact
of global risks over a one-, two- and 10-year
horizon, to illustrate the potential development of
individual global risks over time.

•

Consequences asked respondents to consider
potential impacts of a risk arising, to highlight
relationships between global risks and the
potential for compounding crises.

•

Risk preparedness and governance invited
respondents to assess the current effectiveness
of the management of global risks and reflect on
which stakeholders are best placed to effectively
manage them, to elicit opportunities for global
action and collaboration.

•

Qualitative questions on risks sourced expert
knowledge to identify new and emerging risks.

Refer to Appendix A: Technical Notes: Global
Risks Perception Survey 2022-2023 for more
detail, including relevant definitions for each of the 32
global risks.
To complement GRPS data on global risks, the
report also draws on the World Economic Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS) to identify risks
that pose the most severe threat to each country
over the next two years, as identified by over
12,000 business leaders in 121 economies. When
considered in context with the GRPS, this data
provides insight into local concerns and priorities
and points to potential “hot spots” and regional
manifestations of global risks. Refer to Appendix
B: Executive Opinion Survey: National Risk
Perceptions for more detail.
Finally, the report integrates the views of leading
experts to generate foresight and to support
analysis of the survey data. The Global Risks Report
harnesses contributions from over 40 colleagues
across the World Economic Forum’s platforms.
Qualitative insights were also collected from over
50 experts from across academia, business,
government, the international community and
civil society through community meetings, private
interviews and thematic workshops conducted from
July to November 2022. These include the Global
Risks Advisory Board and the Chief Risks Officers
Community. Refer to Contributors for more detail.

Global Risks Report 2023

Executive Summary

FIGURE A

The first years of this decade have heralded a
particularly disruptive period in human history. The
return to a “new normal” following the COVID-19
pandemic was quickly disrupted by the outbreak of
war in Ukraine, ushering in a fresh series of crises in
food and energy – triggering problems that decades
of progress had sought to solve.

development after decades of progress, rapid and
unconstrained development of dual-use (civilian and
military) technologies, and the growing pressure of
climate change impacts and ambitions in an evershrinking window for transition to a 1.5°C world.
Together, these are converging to shape a unique,
uncertain and turbulent decade to come.

As 2023 begins, the world is facing a set of risks
that feel both wholly new and eerily familiar. We have
seen a return of “older” risks – inflation, cost-of-living
crises, trade wars, capital outflows from emerging
markets, widespread social unrest, geopolitical
confrontation and the spectre of nuclear warfare –
which few of this generation’s business leaders and
public policy-makers have experienced. These are
being amplified by comparatively new developments
in the global risks landscape, including unsustainable
levels of debt, a new era of low growth, low global
investment and de-globalization, a decline in human

The Global Risks Report 2023 presents the results
of the latest Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS).
We use three time frames for understanding global
risks. Chapter 1 considers the mounting impact of
current crises (i.e. global risks which are already
unfolding) on the most severe global risks that many
expect to play out over the short term (two years).
Chapter 2 considers a selection of risks that are
likely to be most severe in the long term (10 years),
exploring newly emerging or rapidly accelerating
economic, environmental, societal, geopolitical and
technological risks that could become tomorrow’s

Governments and central banks could face stubborn
inflationary pressures over the next two years, not
least given the potential for a prolonged war in
Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering
pandemic, and economic warfare spurring supply
chain decoupling. Downside risks to the economic
outlook also loom large. A miscalibration between
monetary and fiscal policies will raise the likelihood
of liquidity shocks, signaling a more prolonged
economic downturn and debt distress on a global
scale. Continued supply-driven inflation could lead
to stagflation, the socioeconomic consequences
of which could be severe, given an unprecedented
interaction with historically high levels of public
debt. Global economic fragmentation, geopolitical
tensions and rockier restructuring could contribute to
widespread debt distress in the next 10 years.

crises. Chapter 3 imagines mid-term futures,
exploring how connections between the emerging
risks outlined in previous sections may collectively
evolve into a “polycrisis” centred around natural
resource shortages by 2030. The report concludes
by considering perceptions of the comparative state
of preparedness for these risks and highlighting
enablers to charting a course to a more resilient
world. Below are key findings of the report.

Cost of living dominates global
risks in the next two years while
climate action failure dominates
the next decade
The next decade will be characterized by
environmental and societal crises, driven by
underlying geopolitical and economic trends. “Costof-living crisis” is ranked as the most severe global
risk over the next two years, peaking in the short
term. “Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse”
is viewed as one of the fastest deteriorating global
risks over the next decade, and all six environmental
risks feature in the top 10 risks over the next 10
years. Nine risks are featured in the top 10 rankings
over both the short and the long term, including
“Geoeconomic confrontation” and “Erosion
of social cohesion and societal polarisation”,
alongside two new entrants to the top rankings:
“Widespread cybercrime and cyber insecurity”
and “Large-scale involuntary migration”.

As an economic era ends, the
next will bring more risks of
stagnation, divergence and
distress
The economic aftereffects of COVID-19 and the war
in Ukraine have ushered in skyrocketing inflation, a
rapid normalization of monetary policies and started
a low-growth, low-investment era.

Even if some economies experience a softer-thanexpected economic landing, the end of the low
interest rate era will have significant ramifications
for governments, businesses and individuals. The
knock-on effects will be felt most acutely by the
most vulnerable parts of society and already-fragile
states, contributing to rising poverty, hunger, violent
protests, political instability and even state collapse.
Economic pressures will also erode gains made by
middle-income households, spurring discontent,
political polarization and calls for enhanced
social protections in countries across the world.
Governments will continue to face a dangerous
balancing act between protecting a broad swathe of
their citizens from an elongated cost-of-living crisis
without embedding inflation – and meeting debt
servicing costs as revenues come under pressure
from an economic downturn, an increasingly urgent
transition to new energy systems, and a less
stable geopolitical environment. The resulting new
economic era may be one of growing divergence
between rich and poor countries and the first
rollback in human development in decades.

Geopolitical fragmentation will drive
geoeconomic warfare and heighten
the risk of multi-domain conflicts
Economic warfare is becoming the norm, with
increasing clashes between global powers and state
intervention in markets over the next two years.
Economic policies will be used defensively, to build
self-sufficiency and sovereignty from rival powers,
but also will increasingly be deployed offensively to
constrain the rise of others. Intensive geoeconomic
weaponization will highlight security vulnerabilities
posed by trade, financial and technological
interdependence between globally integrated
economies, risking an escalating cycle of distrust
and decoupling. As geopolitics trumps economics,
a longer-term rise in inefficient production and rising
prices becomes more likely. Geographic hotspots
that are critical to the effective functioning of the
global financial and economic system, in particular in
the Asia-Pacific, also pose a growing concern.

Global Risks Report 2023 7

Interstate confrontations are anticipated by GRPS
respondents to remain largely economic in nature
over the next 10 years. However, the recent uptick
in military expenditure and proliferation of new
technologies to a wider range of actors could
drive a global arms race in emerging technologies.
The longer-term global risks landscape could be
defined by multi-domain conflicts and asymmetric
warfare, with the targeted deployment of new-tech
weaponry on a potentially more destructive scale
than seen in recent decades. Transnational arms
control mechanisms must quickly adapt to this new
security context, to strengthen the shared moral,
reputational and political costs that act as a deterrent
to accidental and intentional escalation.

Technology will exacerbate
inequalities while risks from
cybersecurity will remain a
constant concern
The technology sector will be among the central
targets of stronger industrial policies and enhanced
state intervention. Spurred by state aid and military
expenditure, as well as private investment, research
and development into emerging technologies will
continue at pace over the next decade, yielding
advancements in AI, quantum computing and
biotechnology, among other technologies. For
countries that can afford it, these technologies will
provide partial solutions to a range of emerging
crises, from addressing new health threats and a
crunch in healthcare capacity to scaling food security
and climate mitigation. For those that cannot,
inequality and divergence will grow. In all economies,
these technologies also bring risks, from widening
misinformation and disinformation to unmanageably
rapid churn in both blue- and white-collar jobs.
However, the rapid development and deployment
of new technologies, which often comes with
limited protocols governing their use, poses its
own set of risks. The ever-increasing intertwining
of technologies with the critical functioning of
societies is exposing populations to direct domestic
threats, including those that seek to shatter
societal functioning. Alongside a rise in cybercrime,
attempts to disrupt critical technology-enabled
resources and services will become more common,
with attacks anticipated against agriculture and
water, financial systems, public security, transport,
energy and domestic, space-based and undersea
communication infrastructure. Technological risks
are not solely limited to rogue actors. Sophisticated
analysis of larger data sets will enable the misuse
of personal information through legitimate legal
mechanisms, weakening individual digital sovereignty
and the right to privacy, even in well-regulated,
democratic regimes.

Climate mitigation and climate
adaptation efforts are set up for a
risky trade-off, while nature
collapses
Climate and environmental risks are the core focus of
global risks perceptions over the next decade – and
are the risks for which we are seen to be the least
prepared. The lack of deep, concerted progress on
climate targets has exposed the divergence between
what is scientifically necessary to achieve net zero
and what is politically feasible. Growing demands
on public-and private-sector resources from other
crises will reduce the speed and scale of mitigation
efforts over the next two years, alongside insufficient
progress towards the adaptation support required
for those communities and countries increasingly
affected by the impacts of climate change.
As current crises diverts resources from risks arising
over the medium to longer term, the burdens
on natural ecosystems will grow given their still
undervalued role in the global economy and overall
planetary health. Nature loss and climate change
are intrinsically interlinked – a failure in one sphere
will cascade into the other. Without significant policy
change or investment, the interplay between climate
change impacts, biodiversity loss, food security
and natural resource consumption will accelerate
ecosystem collapse, threaten food supplies and
livelihoods in climate-vulnerable economies, amplify
the impacts of natural disasters, and limit further
progress on climate mitigation.

Food, fuel and cost crises
exacerbate societal vulnerabilities
while declining investments in
human development erode future
resilience
Compounding crises are widening their impact across
societies, hitting the livelihoods of a far broader
section of the population, and destabilizing more
economies in the world, than traditionally vulnerable
communities and fragile states. Building on the most
severe risks expected to impact in 2023 – including
“Energy supply crisis”, “Rising inflation” and
“Food supply crisis” – a global Cost-of-living crisis
is already being felt. Economic impacts have been
cushioned by countries that can afford it, but many
lower-income countries are facing multiple crises:
debt, climate change and food security. Continued
supply-side pressures risk turning the current cost-ofliving crisis into a wider humanitarian crisis within the
next two years in many import-dependent markets.
Associated social unrest and political instability will
not be contained to emerging markets, as economic
pressures continue to hollow out the middle-income
bracket. Mounting citizen frustration at losses in
human development and declining social mobility,
together with a widening gap in values and equality,
are posing an existential challenge to political systems
around the world. The election of less centrist leaders
as well as political polarization between economic
superpowers over the next two years may also reduce
space further for collective problem-solving, fracturing
alliances and leading to a more volatile dynamic.
With a crunch in public-sector funding and competing
security concerns, our capacity to absorb the next

global shock is shrinking. Over the next 10 years,
fewer countries will have the fiscal headroom to invest
in future growth, green technologies, education,
care and health systems. The slow decay of public
infrastructure and services in both developing and
advanced markets may be relatively subtle, but
accumulating impacts will be highly corrosive to the
strength of human capital and development – a critical
mitigant to other global risks faced.

As volatility in multiple domains
grows in parallel, the risk of
polycrises accelerates
Concurrent shocks, deeply interconnected risks
and eroding resilience are giving rise to the risk of
polycrises – where disparate crises interact such
that the overall impact far exceeds the sum of each
part. Eroding geopolitical cooperation will have ripple
effects across the global risks landscape over the
medium term, including contributing to a potential
polycrisis of interrelated environmental, geopolitical
and socioeconomic risks relating to the supply of and
demand for natural resources.
The report describes four potential futures centred
around food, water and metals and mineral shortages,
all of which could spark a humanitarian as well as an
ecological crisis – from water wars and famines to
continued overexploitation of ecological resources
and a slowdown in climate mitigation and adaption.
Given uncertain relationships between global risks,
similar foresight exercises can help anticipate potential
connections, directing preparedness measures
towards minimizing the scale and scope of polycrises
before they arise.

Global Risks Report 2023 9

FIGURE C

In the years to come, as continued, concurrent
crises embed structural changes to the economic
and geopolitical landscape, they accelerate the
other risks that we face. More than four in five
GRPS respondents anticipate consistent volatility
over the next two years at a minimum, with multiple
shocks accentuating divergent trajectories. However,
respondents are generally more optimistic over
the longer term. Just over one-half of respondents
anticipate a negative outlook, and nearly one in five
respondents predict limited volatility with relative – and
potentially renewed – stability in the next 10 years.

leveraging the interconnectivity between global
risks can broaden the impact of risk mitigation
activities – shoring up resilience in one area can
have a multiplier effect on overall preparedness for
other related risks. As a deteriorating economic
outlook brings tougher trade-offs for governments
facing competing social, environmental and security
concerns, investment in resilience must focus on
solutions that address multiple risks, such as funding
of adaptation measures that come with climate
mitigation co-benefits, or investment in areas that
strengthen human capital and development.

Indeed, there is still a window to shape a more
secure future through more effective preparedness.
Addressing the erosion of trust in multilateral
processes will enhance our collective ability to
prevent and respond to emerging cross-border
crises and strengthen the guardrails we have in
place to address well-established risks. In addition,

Some of the risks described in this year’s report are
close to a tipping point. This is the moment to act
collectively, decisively and with a long-term lens to
shape a pathway to a more positive, inclusive and
stable world.

chose “Energy supply crisis”; “Cost-of-living
crisis”; “Rising inflation”; “Food supply crisis”
and “Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure”
as among the top risks for 2023 with the greatest
potential impact on a global scale (Figure 1.1).
Those that are outside the top 5 for the year but
remain concerns include: failure to meet netzero targets; weaponization of economic policy;
weakening of human rights; a debt crisis; and failure
of non-food supply chains.
News headlines all over the world make these
results largely unsurprising. Yet their implications
are profound. Our global “new normal” is a return
to basics – food, energy, security – problems our
globalized world was thought to be on a trajectory
to solve. These risks are being amplified by the
persistent health and economic overhang of a
global pandemic; a war in Europe and sanctions
that impact a globally integrated economy; and an
escalating technological arms race underpinned
by industrial competition and enhanced state
intervention. Longer-term structural changes to

The result is a global risks landscape that feels both
wholly new and eerily familiar. There is a return of
“older” risks that are understood historically but
experienced by few in the current generations
of business leaders and public policy-makers. In
addition, there are relatively new developments
in the global risk landscape. These include
widespread, historically high levels of public and
in some cases private-sector debt; the ever more
rapid pace of technological development and
its unprecedented intertwining with the critical
functioning of societies; and the growing pressure
of climate change impacts and ambitions in an evershorter time frame for transition. Together, these
are converging to shape a unique, uncertain and
turbulent 2020s.

The path to 2025
The complex and rapid evolution of the global risks
landscape is adding to a sense of unease. More than
four in five GRPS respondents anticipated consistent
volatility over the next two years at a minimum, with
multiple shocks accentuating divergent trajectories
(Figure 1.10).
Respondents to the GRPS see the path to 2025
dominated by social and environmental risks,
driven by underlying geopolitical and economic
trends (Figure 1.2).

FIGURE 1.2

geopolitical dynamics – with the diffusion of power
across countries of differing political and economic
systems – are coinciding with a more rapidly
changing economic landscape, ushering in a lowgrowth, low-investment and low-cooperation era
and a potential decline in human development after
decades of progress.

There were some notable differences between the
responses of government and business respondents,
with “Debt crises”, “Failure to stabilize price
trajectories”, “Failure to mitigate climate change”
and “Failure of climate change adaptation”
featuring more prominently for governments, and
“Widespread cybercrime and cyber insecurity” and
“Large-scale environmental damage incidents”
featuring higher for business (Figure 1.3).

global risks that many expect to play out over the
next two years, within the context of the mounting
impacts and constraints being imposed by the
numerous crises felt today. These are: cost-of-living
crisis, economic downturn, geoeconomic warfare,
climate action hiatus and societal polarization. We
describe current trends associated with each risk,
briefly cover the reasons behind them and then note
their emerging implications and knock-on effects.

Cost-of-living crisis
Ranked as the most severe global risk over the next
two years by GRPS respondents, a global Cost-ofliving crisis is already here, with inflationary pressures
disproportionately hitting those that can least afford
it. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the price
of basic necessities – non-expendable items such
as food and housing – were on the rise.1 Costs
further increased in 2022, primarily due to continued
disruptions in the flows of energy and food from
Russia and Ukraine. To curb domestic prices, around
30 countries introduced restrictions, including export
bans, in food and energy last year, further driving
up global inflation.2 Despite the latest extension, the
looming threat of Russia pulling out of the Black Sea
Grain Export Deal has also led to significant volatility in
the price of essential commodities.

Although global supply chains have partly adapted,
with pressures significantly lower than the peak
experienced in April last year,3 price shocks to core
necessities have significantly outpaced general
inflation over this time (Figure 1.4). The FAO Price
Index hit the highest level since its inception in 1990
in March last year.4 Energy prices are estimated to
remain 46% higher than average in 2023 relative
to January 2022 projections.5 The relaxation of
China's COVID-19 policies could drive up energy
and commodity prices further - and will test the
resilience of global supply chains if policy changes
remain unpredictable as infections soar.
Cost-of-living crisis was broadly perceived by
GRPS respondents to be a short-term risk, at peak
severity within the next two years and easing off
thereafter. But the persistence of a global cost-ofliving crisis could result in a growing proportion of
the most vulnerable parts of society being priced out
of access to basic needs, fueling unrest and political
instability. Continued supply-chain disruptions
could lead to sticky core inflation, particularly in
food and energy. This could fuel further interest rate
hikes, raising the risk of debt distress, a prolonged
economic downturn and a vicious cycle for fiscal
planning.
Despite some improvement during the pandemic,
household debt has been on the rise in certain

economies. Global mortgage rates have reached their
highest level in more than a decade. Some estimates
suggest that the increase in rates amounts to a 35%
increase in mortgage payments for homeowners.6
Rent inflation has also followed suit – in the United
States of America, it is estimated to peak at over 8%
in May this year before easing,7 disproportionately
affecting lower socioeconomic groups who are more
likely to rent but least able to afford rental price hikes.
Retirees will also be impacted as pensions fail to
keep pace with higher inflation.8 Higher costs of food,
energy and housing, causing lower real incomes, will
result in trade-offs in essential spending, worsening
health and wellbeing outcomes for communities.
Economic impacts are often cushioned by expansive
fiscal policy and government programmes in
countries that can afford them.9 Advanced economies
continue to roll out measures, many of which have
been broad-brush in approach – ranging from caps
on electricity bills, fuel rebates and subsidized public
transport tickets for consumers, to export controls
on food, tax relief, enhanced state aid and support
for affected companies. The resulting pressure on
fiscal balances may exacerbate debt sustainability

concerns, leaving emerging and developing countries
with far less fiscal room to protect their populations in
the future.
Both affordability and availability of basic necessities
can stoke social and political instability. Last year,
the increase in fuel prices alone led to protests in
an estimated 92 countries, some of which resulted
in political upheaval and fatalities, alongside strikes
and industrial action.10 The impact of insecurity will
continue to be felt most acutely in already vulnerable
states – including Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and
the Syrian Arab Republic – but may also exacerbate
instability in countries facing simultaneous food and
debt crises, such as Tunisia, Ghana, Pakistan, Egypt
and Lebanon.11
A combination of extreme weather events and
constrained supply could lead the current cost-ofliving crisis into a catastrophic scenario of hunger
and distress for millions in import-dependent
countries or turn the energy crisis towards a
humanitarian crisis in the poorest emerging markets.
Energy shortages – as a result of supplier shutoffs or natural, accidental or intentional damage

to pipelines and energy grids – could cause
widespread blackouts and fatalities if combined with
seasonal extreme weather. There is also a material
possibility of a global food supply crisis occurring in
2023, with the continuation of the war in Ukraine,
the lagged effect of a price spike in fertilizer last year
and the impact of extreme weather conditions on
food production in key regions. Estimates suggest
that over 800,000 hectares of farmland were wiped
out by floods in Pakistan – increasing commodity
prices significantly in a country that was already
grappling with record 27% inflation.12 Predicted
droughts and water shortages may cause a decline
in harvests and livestock deaths across East Africa,
North Africa and Southern Africa, exacerbating food
insecurity.13
Although some regions anticipate above-average
yields next year, unexpected production or
transportation shocks in key exporters – including
water shortages in the Netherlands and droughts
and large-scale insect loss in the United States
of America and Brazil14 – or controls imposed by
these countries could further destabilize global
food security, explored in Chapter 3: Resource
Rivalries. “Severe commodity price shocks or
volatility” was a top-five risk over the next two
years in 47 countries surveyed by the Forum’s
Executive Opinion Survey (EOS), while “Severe
commodity supply crises” registered as a more
localized risk, as a top-five concern across 34
countries, including in Switzerland, South Korea,
Singapore, Chile and Türkiye. The catastrophic
effects of famine and loss of life can also have spillover effects further afield, as the risk of widespread
violence grows and involuntary migration rises.

FIGURE 1.5

Economic downturn
Last year’s edition of the Global Risks Report
warned that inflation, debt and interest rate rises
were emerging risks. Today, governments and
central banks – led by developed markets, notably
the United States of America, Eurozone and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain – are walking
a tightrope between managing inflation without
triggering a deep or prolonged recession, and
protecting citizens from a cost-of-living crisis while
servicing historically high debt loads. Public-sector
respondents to the GRPS ranked Debt crises (#6),
Failure to stabilise price trajectories (#8) and
“Prolonged economic downturn” (#10) in the top
10 risks over the next two years (Figure 1.3).
Managing inflation is a worldwide concern. “Rapid
and / or sustained inflation” was also highlighted
as a top-five risk over the next two years in 89 of
the countries surveyed in the EOS, a significant
increase from 2021 (Figure 1.5). It was ranked
as the top threat in a number of G20 countries –
including Brazil, South Korea and Mexico – although
inflationary pressures have affected both developed
and developing economies. Inflation rates rose
above 80% in Argentina and Türkiye, while
Zimbabwe, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and Sudan
witnessed triple-digit inflation. Inflation in the United
States of America peaked above 9% in June last
year and hit record highs in the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and the Eurozone in October, at 11.1%
and 10.6%, respectively, forcing interest rates higher
and inflicting more pain on emerging economies.15

Global Risks Report 2023 17

The IMF’s most recent projections anticipate a
decline in global inflation from almost 9% in 2022
to 6.5% this year and 4.1% in 2024, with a sharper
disinflation in advanced economies.16 However,
downside risks to the outlook loom large. The
complexity of inflationary dynamics is creating a
challenging policy environment for both the public
sector and central banks, given the mix of demand
and supply-side drivers, including a prolonged war
in Ukraine and associated energy-supply crunch,
potential for escalating sanctions, and continued
bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic or new
sources of supply-side controls.
Given currently low headline unemployment in
advanced economies, persistent price pressures will
likely lead to higher interest rates to avoid inflation
de-anchoring. Central banks have sped up the postpandemic normalization of monetary policy. Nearly
90% (33 of 38) of central banks monitored by the
Bank for International Settlements raised interest
rates in 2022, a dramatic shift away from the loose
financial conditions that characterized the previous
decade.17 With a rapid rise in rates, the risk of
unintended consequences and policy error is high,
with possible overshoot leading to a deeper and
more prolonged economic downturn and potential
global recession.

FIGURE 1.6

Even if the economic fallout remains comparatively
contained, global growth is forecast to slow to
2.7% in 2023, with around one-third of the world’s
economy facing a technical recession – the thirdweakest growth profile in over 20 years.18 This
downturn will be led by advanced markets, with
projected growth falling to 1.1% in 2023, while the
largest economies – the EU, China and the United
States of America – face continued challenges to
growth. However, for developing economies, there
is a risk of further economic distress and tougher
trade-offs. Stubbornly high inflation and more
disorderly containment will raise the likelihood of
stagnant economic growth, liquidity shocks and
debt distress on a global scale. Energy importers in
particular will bear the brunt of higher energy prices
stemming from a strengthened US dollar, but its
continued strength is importing inflation worldwide.
Globalized capital flows over recent decades have
increased exposure of emerging and developing
markets to rising interest rates, especially those
with a high proportion of USD-denominated debt,
such as Argentina, Colombia and Indonesia.19 Early
tightening of monetary policy in many markets –
including Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia –
minimized initial exposure. But while some countries
have resorted to foreign-exchange interventions

to limit currency depreciation and debt-servicing
loads, heightened volatility continues to drive
demand for US assets. This has led to record capital
outflows from markets with weaker macroeconomic
fundamentals, with investors already withdrawing
$70 billion from emerging market bond funds by
October last year.21
Growth agendas, including the critical pivot to
greener economies, have been based on the
availability of cheap debt. The extent to which
countries can continue to finance development
will be dependent on domestic political and debt
dynamics. Sri Lanka’s recent crisis provides a very
real example of the spiraling risks to human security
and health that can arise from economic distress,
where a debt default and shortage in foreign
currency limited imports; disrupted access to food,
fuel, healthcare and electricity; and led to violent
protests and the resignation of the President.
The scale of sovereign debt defaults could
significantly rise in weaker emerging markets over
the next two years, in terms of both the percentage
value of total global debt and number of states in
default (Figure 1.6). Although unlikely under the
current trajectory to reach globally destabilizing
levels, the proportion of countries in or at high risk of
debt distress has already doubled from 2015 levels.22
This will increase the global influence of creditor
nations and heighten state fragility as the capacity
to address simultaneous crises in food and energy
will be limited.23 Some countries will be unable to
contain future shocks, invest in future growth and

impacts exacerbated by the most powerful and
disproportionately borne by the most vulnerable, as
explored in Chapter 2.6: Economic stability.

Geoeconomic warfare
“Geoeconomic confrontation” was ranked the
third-most severe risk over the next two years by
GRPS respondents. Interstate confrontations were
anticipated by both GRPS and EOS respondents
to remain largely economic in nature over the short
term. Geoeconomic confrontation – including
sanctions, trade wars and investment screening –
was considered a top-five threat over the next two
years among 42 countries surveyed by the EOS and
featured as the top risk in many East and SouthEast Asian countries, among others. In comparison,
“Interstate conflict” was ranked as a top-five risk in
28 countries surveyed by the EOS (Figure 1.7).
The weaponization of economic policy between
globally integrated powers has highlighted
vulnerabilities posed by trade, financial and
technological interdependence - for the public and
private sector alike. The Ukraine conflict triggered
the imposition of sanctions, nationalization of key
players, and government appropriation of assets,
such as Germany’s seizure of Russian energy
companies' stakes in local refineries last year.24
Reputational and legal risks for multinational
company operations in certain markets also grew:

consumer good companies faced boycotts after
continuing to provide basic necessities to Russia,
and a European energy company was accused
of “complicity in war crimes” due to linkages to a
Russian gas field.25
In the face of vulnerabilities highlighted by the
pandemic and then war, economic policy, particularly
in advanced economies, is increasingly directed
towards geopolitical goals. Countries are seeking
to build “self-sufficiency”, underpinned by state aid,
and achieve “sovereignty” from rival powers, through
onshoring and “friend-shoring” global supply chains.
Defensive measures to boost local production and
minimize foreign interference in critical industries
include subsidies, tighter investment screening,
data localization policies, visa bans and exclusion of
companies from key markets.
While initially driven by tensions between the United
States of America and China, many policies are
extra-territorial in nature or have been similarly
adopted by other markets, with spill-over effects
across a broad range of industries. For example,
Switzerland is considering the introduction of a
general cross-sectoral foreign direct investment
screening regime for the first time. Expanded state
aid to support self-sufficiency in “strategically
important products”, including climate mitigation and
adaptation, has also heightened competition within
global blocs. The EU has already raised concerns
about the USA's Inflation Reduction Act, which
includes significant tax credits and subsidies for local
green technologies.26
Economic levers are also being used to proactively
constrain the rise of rivals. This includes delisting
of foreign companies, extensive use of the foreign
direct product rule and export controls on key
technologies and intellectual property as well as
broad constraints on citizens and entities working
with designated foreign companies. The introduction
of an outbound investment screening regime has

also been contemplated by the United States of
America.27
Together, these trends towards geoeconomic
warfare risk creating widespread spillovers. More
extensive deployment of economic levers to meet
geopolitical goals risks a vicious and escalating cycle
of distrust. Financial and technological ramifications
may highlight further vulnerabilities, leading states to
proactively wind back other interdependencies in the
name of national security and resilience over the next
two years. This may spur contrary outcomes to the
intended objective, driving resilience and productivity
growth lower and marking the end of an economic
era characterized by cheaper and globalized capital,
labour, commodities and goods.
This will likely continue to weaken existing
alliances as nations turn inwards, with enhanced
state intervention perceived to drive a “race to
the bottom”. Further pressure will be placed on
multilateral governance mechanisms that act as
mitigants to these risks, potentially mirroring the
politicization of the World Health Organization
(WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
near paralysis of trade enforcement on more
contentious issues by the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in recent years.28 It will also likely embed
the importance of broader geopolitical spheres
of influence in “dependent” markets, with global
powers extensively exercising trade, debt and
technological power. Although some developing
and emerging markets may wield critical resources
as leverage, considered in Chapter 3: Resource
Rivalries, anticipated controls on capital, labour,
knowledge and technological flows risk widening the
developmental divide.
In addition, spheres of influence will not be purely
contained to global powers, nor “dependent”
developing and emerging markets. The influence and
alignment of the Middle East in regional and global
politics will shift. Although the challenge of longerGlobal Risks Report 2023 20

term economic diversification remains a significant
distraction domestically, the current energy crisis
will raise economic, military and political capital
of numerous countries over the next two years.
Comparative ties of the United States of America
and China will have significant ramifications for the
balance of power in the region, as well as global
military dynamics, considered further in Chapter 2.4:
Human security.29
Strategies to enhance security may also come
at a wider economic cost. Intensified geopolitical
tensions risk weakening the economic landscape
even further, resulting in lingering inflation or
depressed growth even if current pressures subside.
If on- and friend-shoring continue to be prioritized
– particularly in strategic industries such as
technology, telecommunications, financial systems,
agriculture, mining, healthcare and pharmaceuticals
– consumers will potentially face rising costs well into
the future. As costs of compliance with divergent
political and economic systems climb, multinational
companies may pragmatically pick a side, speeding
up divergence between various market models.
While intended to lower risks associated with
geopolitical and economic disruption, shortened
supply chains may also unintentionally heighten
exposure to geographically concentrated risks,
including labour shortages, civil unrest, pandemics
and natural weather events. Geopolitical risks
posed by geographic hotspots that are critical to
the effective functioning of the global financial and
economic system, in particular in the Asia-Pacific,
also pose a growing concern.

what is scientifically necessary and what is politically
expedient. Current pressures should result in
a turning point, encouraging energy-importing
countries to invest in “secure”, cleaner and cheaper
renewable energy sources.32 Yet geopolitical tensions
and economic pressures have already limited – and
in some cases reversed – progress on climate
change mitigation, at least over the short term. For
example, the EU spent at least EUR50 billion on new
and expanded fossil-fuel infrastructure and supplies,
and some countries restarted coal power stations.33

Climate action hiatus

Despite some longer-term government action on
the energy transition, such as the USA’s Inflation
Reduction Act and the EU’s REPowerEU plan,
overall momentum for climate mitigation is unlikely to
rapidly accelerate in the next two years. Negotiations
at the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC
(COP27) failed to reach a much-needed agreement
to phase out all fossil fuels, laying bare the difficulty
of balancing short-term needs with longer-term
ambitions. Policy-makers are increasingly confronted
by perceived trade-offs between energy security,
affordability and sustainability. The stark reality of 600
million people in Africa without access to electricity
illustrates the failure to deliver change to those
who need it and the continued attraction of quick
fossil-fuel powered solutions – despite the risks
of stranded assets, energy security challenges of
exported fossil fuel commodities and lifetime carbon
emissions that exceed the 1.5°C limit.

Despite 30 years of global climate advocacy and
diplomacy, the international system has struggled
to make the required progress on climate change.
The potential failure to address this existential global
risk first entered the top rankings of the Global
Risks Report over a decade ago, in 2011. Today,
atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide have all reached record highs. Emission
trajectories make it very unlikely that global ambitions
to limit warming to 1.5°C will be achieved.30
A Failure to mitigate climate change is ranked
as one of the most severe threats in the short term
but is the global risk we are seen to be the least
prepared for, with 70% of GRPS respondents rating
existing measures to prevent or prepare for climate
change as “ineffective” or “highly ineffective”
(Figure 4.1). According to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the chance of
breaching the 1.5°C target by as early as 2030
stands at 50%. Current commitments made by the
G7 private sector suggest an increase of 2.7°C by
mid-century, way above the goals outlined in the
Paris Agreement.31
Recent events have exposed a divergence between

There is also growing recognition that not only the
pace of the transition but also effectiveness and
integrity matter: climate litigation is increasing and
concerns about emissions under-reporting and
greenwashing have triggered calls for new regulatory
oversight for the transition to net zero.34 While some
countries have made disclosure mandatory, much
of the corporate world have not yet assessed or
started to manage their climate risks. In the absence
Global Risks Report 2023 21

of clearer policy signals and consistent regulation
and enforcement, mitigation efforts will be shaped
by increasingly disruptive climate activism, raising
the likelihood of stranded assets – as well as people.
A just transition that supports those set to lose
from decarbonization is increasingly invoked by
countries heavily dependent on fossil-fuel industries
as a reason to slow down efforts. These challenges,
against the backdrop of a deteriorating economic
landscape and inflated input costs, may postpone
investments in greener production methods –
particularly in heavier, “dirtier” industries.35
All of this implies that the risks of a slower and more
disorderly transition (extensively covered in last year's
Global Risks Report) have now turned into reality,
potentially leading to dire planetary and societal
consequences. Any rollback of government and
private action will continue to amplify risks to human
health (explored in Chapter 2.3: Human health) and
spur the deterioration of natural capital, as discussed
in Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems. Climate
change will also increasingly become a key migration
driver and there are indications that it has already
contributed to the emergence of terrorist groups and
conflicts in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.36
Indeed, with 1.2°C of warming already in the
system, the compounding effect of a changing
climate is already being felt, magnifying humanitarian
challenges such as food insecurity, and adding
another hefty bill to already stretched fiscal
balances.37 In the GRPS results, “Natural disasters
and extreme weather events” was considered the
second-most severe risk over the next two years. As
with many of the global risks featured in this year’s

FIGURE 1.8

report, the impact of these events disproportionately
affects low- and middle-income countries. It
registered as a top-five risk in 25 countries surveyed
by the EOS, in particular in developing coastal states
across Latin America, Africa and South-East Asia.
As floods, heatwaves, droughts and other extreme
weather events become more severe and frequent,
a wider set of populations will be affected. In
parallel, a consolidation of public- and privatesector resources may set up emerging and pressing
trade-offs between disaster recovery, loss and
damage, adaptation and mitigation. Although climate
mitigation has been overwhelmingly favoured over
adaptation in terms of financing to date, particularly
in the private sector,38 EOS results indicate that
climate adaptation may now be seen as a more
immediate concern in the short term by business
leaders. Failure of climate change mitigation only
featured in the top five risks over the next two years
in one economy, Zambia, whereas the Failure of
climate-change adaptation was a top-five risk
in 16 countries, such as the Netherlands, where it
ranked first (Figure 1.8). The diversion of attention
and resources towards adaptation may further
slow progress on global-warming targets in the
economies that remain the biggest contributors to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.39
Despite plans for a global goal on adaptation
to be agreed at COP28, there has also been
insufficient progress towards the support required
for infrastructure and populations already affected
by the fallout from climate change. Adaptation has
not been adequately funded, with 34% of climate
finance currently allocated to adaptation worldwide.40

Nor do new investments in infrastructure or capital
allocation decisions adequately consider current and
future risks. Investors and policy-makers are locking
themselves into costly futures, likely to be borne
by the most vulnerable. Disagreements on what
constitutes adaptation, and the lack of shared goals
and best practices, robust regulatory frameworks
and metrics, add to a high risk of overshooting and
undershooting adaptation efforts.
Limits to adaptation are also increasingly evident.
This has been highlighted by the Loss and Damage
agenda which, after decades on the sidelines of the
climate discourse, has now reached the mainstream.
A new financing mechanism was tentatively agreed
at COP27, although the contribution to this fund by
high-emitting economies remains unclear. Even as
more funding is unlocked, there is a risk of ignoring or
avoiding climate-proofing against future disasters, as
governments scramble to provide relief and support
in disaster-hit areas. Market-based mechanisms for
managing financial shocks are inadequate and may
diminish further within the next two years. There is a
risk of retreat by insurers from some areas of natural
catastrophe coverage, with the gap in insurance
estimated to have grown from $117 billion in 2020 to
$161 billion in 2021.41 Only 7% of economic losses
from flood events in emerging markets – and 31%
in advanced economies – have been covered by
insurance in the last 20 years.42

FIGURE 1.9

Societal polarization
“Erosion of social cohesion and societal
polarisation” has been climbing in the ranks of
perceived severity in recent years.43 Defined as the
loss of social capital and fracturing of communities
leading to declining social stability, individual and
collective wellbeing and economic productivity, it
ranked as the fifth-most severe global risk faced in
the short term by GRPS respondents. It was also
seen as one of the most strongly influenced risks
in the global network, triggered by many other
short- and longer-term potential risks – including
debt crises and state instability, cost-of-living crises
and inflation, a prolonged economic downturn and
climate migration (Figure 1.9).
A widening gap in values and equality is posing
an existential challenge to both autocratic and
democratic systems, as economic and social divides
are translated into political ones. Polarization on
issues such as immigration, gender, reproductive
rights, ethnicity, religion, climate and even secession
and anarchism44 have characterized recent elections,
referendums and protests around the world – from
the United States of America and China to the
Islamic Republic of Iran. Mounting citizen frustration
at perceived gaps in direct governmental action,
human development and social mobility manifested

in frequently divisive and unruly civil protests last
year. More protests were observed between January
and October than in all of 2021.45
Consequences of societal polarization are vast,
ranging from a drag on growth to civil unrest and
deepening political fissures. And there are indications
that increasing polarization is contributing to the
decline of democracies and accompanying rise
in hybrid regimes, with the share of the world’s
population living in autocratizing countries rising
from 5% in 2011, to 36% in 2021. Only 13% of
the world’s population are currently living under a
liberal democracy, compared to 44% living under an
electoral autocracy.46
The erosion of the social and political centre risks
becoming self-perpetuating. Divisions incentivize
the adoption of short-term, more extreme policy
platforms to galvanize one side of the population
and perpetuate populist beliefs. Notably, the
contest between two, non-centrist candidates or
positions is often close.47 Although heralded as
a resurgence of leftist movements, the Brazilian
presidential election of 2022 was won by President
Lula by 1.8 points – the slimmest margin recorded
since it became a democratic nation.48 As such, a
large proportion of the population can feel alienated
and angered by leadership in the following term,
acting as a multiplier to existing societal concerns
and civil unrest. This is further amplified by social
media, which increases polarization and distrust in
institutions alongside political engagement.49
“Misinformation and disinformation” are,
together, a potential accelerant to the erosion of
social cohesion as well as a consequence. With
the potential to destabilize trust in information and
political processes,50 it has become a prominent tool
for geopolitical agents to propagate extremist beliefs
and sway elections through social media echo

chambers. It was perceived as a moderately severe
risk by GRPS respondents, ranking 16th over the
short term. Regulatory constraints and educational
efforts will likely fail to keep pace, and its impact
will expand with the more widespread usage of
automation and machine-learning technologies,
from bots that imitate human-written text to
deepfakes of politicians.51
Polarization undermines social trust and, in some
cases, has reflected power struggles within a political
elite more than underlying divisions in ideologies.52
Often, hardened polarization on key issues lead to
government gridlocks. "Swings" between parties
each electoral cycle may stymie the adoption of a
longer-term policy outlook, causing greater strife,
especially when navigating the difficult and uncertain
economic outlook of the coming years. Additionally,
although less likely in more democratically robust
states, an increasing presence of anocracies (those
forms of government that are part democracy,
part autocracy, referred to in Chapter 2.5: Digital
rights) and factionalism may radicalize polarization.
This could lead to increased incidences of threat
campaigns and political violence, hate crimes, violent
protests and even civil war.53
Social and political polarization may also further
reduce the space for collective problem-solving to
address global risks. The far right has been elected
in Italy and are now the second largest party in
Sweden, while the left has resurged in Latin America.
National elections will take place in several G20
countries within the next two years, including the
United States of America, South Africa, Türkiye,
Argentina, Mexico and Indonesia. The election of
less-centrist leaders and adoption of more “extreme”
policies in economic superpowers may fracture
alliances, limit global collaboration and lead to a
more volatile dynamic.

1.3

Looking ahead
The way risks play out over the next two years
has ramifications for the decade to come. Nearly
one in five respondents to the GRPS felt optimistic
about the outlook for the world in the longer term,
predicting limited volatility with relative – and
potentially renewed – stability over the next 10 years
(Figure 1.10). Yet, over half anticipated progressive
tipping points and persistent crises leading to
catastrophic outcomes over the next 10 years,
or consistent volatility and divergent trajectories.
Notably, younger age groups were more hopeful for
the future: one in three respondents under the age
of 40 shifted to a neutral or positive stance over the
longer time frame.
Shocks of recent years – most notably, the war in
Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic – have reflected
and accelerated an epochal change to the global
order. Risks that are more severe in the short term

FIGURE 1.10

are embedding structural changes to the economic
and geopolitical landscape that will accelerate other
global threats faced over the next 10 years. And
as the confluence of current crises distracts focus
and resources from risks arising over the medium
to longer-term horizon, we may face increasing
burdens on natural and human ecosystems. Some
of these risks are close to a tipping point, but
there is a window to shaping a more secure future.
Understanding them is vital.
The next chapter considers the potential global
shocks we are heading towards over the next
decade, highlighting worrying developments
emerging from the crises of today that are eroding
the resilience and stability of the global system.
It highlights a series of such emergent risks – the
shocks of tomorrow – that can be reduced through
collective attention and action today.

Tomorrow’s Catastrophes

Global Risks 2033:
Tomorrow’s Catastrophes
The world in 2033
As risks highlighted in the past chapter unfold
today, much-needed attention and resources are
being diverted from global risks that may become
tomorrow’s shocks and crises. The Global Risks
Perceptions Survey (GRPS) addresses a one-,
two- and 10-year horizon. Chapter one addressed
the present and two-year time frame, focusing on
currently unfolding and shorter-term risks. This
chapter focuses on the third time frame: risks that
may have the most severe impact over the next 10
years.

FIGURE 2.1

Based on GRPS results, the longer-term global
risks landscape is also dominated by deteriorating
environmental risks (Figure 2.1). More specifically,
climate- and nature-related risks lead the top 10
risks, by severity, that are expected to manifest
over the next decade. Differentiated as separate
risks for the first time in the GRPS, Failure to
mitigate climate change and Failure of climatechange adaptation top the rankings as the most
severe risks on a global scale, followed by Natural
disasters and extreme weather events and
“Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse”.

Comparing the two-year and 10-year time frames
provides a picture of areas of increasing, decreasing
and continued concerns according to GRPS
respondents (Figure 2.2). The top right of the graph
indicates global risks that are perceived to be
the most severe in both the short and long term.
These are consistent areas of global concern and,
arguably, attention. Four environmental risks have

worsening scores over the course of the 10-year
time frame, indicating respondents’ concerns about
increased severity of these risks in the longer term.
“Large-scale involuntary migration, rises to fifth
place in the 10-year time frame, while Erosion
of social cohesion and societal polarization is
perceived to be slightly more severe over the longer
term.

FIGURE 2.2

Risks that are growing in severity over the
longer term include “Biodiversity loss and
ecosystem collapse” and “Misinformation and
disinformation”. Among other technological risks,
as indicated in the far left of the graph, “Digital
inequality and lack of access to digital services”
and “Adverse outcomes of frontier technologies”
are also anticipated to significantly deteriorate over
the 10-year time frame.

The far right of the graph indicates that today’s
most prominent risk, the “Cost-of-living crisis”, is
anticipated to drop in severity over the longer term.
Towards the center, the scores of geopolitical risks
were mixed, with the “Use of weapons of mass
destruction” remaining consistent, “State collapse
or severe instability” and “Ineffectiveness of
multilateral institutions” worsening and Interstate
conflict perceived as decreasing in severity.

The scores of multiple social risks are also worsening,
including “Severe mental health deterioration”,
“Collapse or lack of public infrastructure and
services”, and “Chronic diseases and health
conditions”. In contrast, economic risks such
as “Failure to stabilize price trajectories”, “A
prolonged economic downturn”, “Collapse of a
systemically important industry or supply chain”,
and “Asset bubble burst” are perceived to fall slightly
in expected severity over the 10-year time frame.

This year, we look at five newly emerging or rapidly
accelerating risks clusters – drawn from the
economic, environmental, societal, geopolitical and
technological domains, respectively – that could
become tomorrow’s crisis. We explore their current
drivers and emerging implications, and briefly touch

Natural ecosystems: deteriorating risks to
natural capital (“assets” such as water, forests
and living organisms) due to growing trade-offs
and feedback mechanisms relating to climate
change, taking us past the point of no return.
Human health: chronic risks that are being
compounded by strained healthcare systems
facing the social, economic and health
aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Digital rights: the potential evolution of data
and cyber insecurity, given the slow-burning,
insidious erosion of the digital autonomy of

Economic stability: growing debt crises, with
repercussions for financial contagion as well
as collapse of social services, emerging from a
global reckoning on debt and leading to social
distress.

The newly emerging or rapidly accelerating risk
clusters identified this year are not intended to be
exhaustive. Rather, they aim to provide topic-specific
analysis, nudge pre-emptive action and attention,
and serve as examples for applying similar analysis
to a range of other future risk domains.

Human security: a nascent reversal in
demilitarization and growing vulnerability of nucleararmed states to emerging technologies, emerging
from new weapons and multi-domain conflicts.

Natural ecosystems: past the point of no return
Biodiversity within and between ecosystems is
already declining faster than at any other point
during human history.1 Unlike other environmental
risks, Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
was not seen as pressing of a concern by GRPS
respondents over the short term. Yet it accelerates
in perceived severity, rising to 4th place over the 10year time frame (Figure 2.1).

for a dangerous mix (Figure 2.3). Given that over
half of the world's economic output is estimated
to be moderately to highly dependent on nature,
the collapse of ecosystems will have far-reaching
economic and societal consequences. These include
increased occurrence of zoonotic diseases, a fall
in crop yields and nutritional value, growing water
stress exacerbating potentially violent conflict, loss
of livelihoods dependent on food systems and
nature-based services like pollination, and ever more
dramatic floods, sea-level rises and erosion from the
degradation of natural flood protection systems like
water meadows and coastal mangroves.

Human interventions have negatively impacted a
complex and delicately balanced global natural
ecosystem, triggering a chain of reactions. Over the
next 10 years, the interplay between biodiversity
loss, pollution, natural resource consumption,
climate change and socioeconomic drivers will make

Terrestrial and marine ecosystems are facing
multiple pressure points due to their undervalued
contribution to the global economy as well as overall
planetary health. While not the sole drivers, at the
heart of this potential catastrophe are key tradeoffs and feedback mechanisms emerging from
current crises. Without significant policy change or
investments, the complex linkages between climate
change mitigation, food insecurity and biodiversity
degradation will accelerate ecosystem collapse.

and other natural disasters are already degrading
nature-based solutions to climate change, such
as wildfires in forests used for carbon offsetting.7
In addition, a variety of ecosystems are at risk of
tipping over into self-perpetuating and irreversible
change that will accelerate and compound the
impacts of climate change. Continued damage to
carbon sinks through deforestation and permafrost
thaw, for example, and a decline in carbon storage
productivity (soils and the ocean) may turn these
ecosystems into “natural” sources of carbon and
methane emissions.8 The impending collapse of
the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets may
contribute to sea-level rise and coastal flooding,
while the “die-off” of low-latitude coral reefs, the
nurseries of marine life, are sure to impact food
supplies and broader marine ecosystems.

Exponentially accelerating nature
loss and climate change
Nature loss and climate change are intrinsically
interlinked – a failure in one sphere will cascade
into the other, and attaining net zero will require
mitigatory measures for both levers.2 If we are
unable to limit warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C, the
continued impact of natural disasters, temperature
and precipitation changes will become the dominant
cause of biodiversity loss, in terms of composition
and function (Figure 2.4).3 Heatwaves and droughts
are already causing mass mortality events (a single
hot day in 2014 killed more than 45,000 flying foxes
in Australia), while sea level rises and heavy storms
have caused the first extinctions of entire species.4
Arctic sea-ice, warm-water coral reefs and terrestrial
ecosystems have been found most at risk in the
near term, followed by forest, kelp and seagrass
ecosystems.5

Trade-offs between food security
and nature conservation
Land-use change remains the most prolific threat
to nature, according to many experts.9 Agriculture
and animal farming alone take up more than 35% of
Earth's terrestrial surface and are the biggest direct
drivers of wildlife decline globally. The ongoing crisis
in the affordability and availability of food supplies
positions efforts to conserve and restore terrestrial
biodiversity at odds with domestic food security, as
explored in Chapter 3: Resource Rivalries.
Conservation efforts and nature-based solutions
(which can offer biodiversity co-benefits) will struggle
to be commercially competitive with intensive,
yield-focused agricultural practices, particularly in

The impacts of climate change on ecosystems can
further constrain their mitigation effects. Increased

densely populated, agrarian nations. State incentives
to boost local production and reduce reliance on
imports – in a reaction to current geopolitical and
supply pressures – could come at the cost of
ecosystem preservation. Technology will provide
partial solutions in the countries that can afford it. For
example, the global vertical farming market has been
predicted to grow at a compound annual rate of
26% and hit $34 billion by 2033.10 These agricultural
production techniques increase food output per unit
area with a smaller water and biodiversity footprint,
but can actually be more carbon-intensive and may
have an indirect land footprint that exceeds openfield farming in some regions.11
Given a highly uncertain economic outlook,
developing and emerging markets may struggle
to close the funding gap to increase agricultural
productivity. Pressure on biodiversity will likely be
further amplified by continued deforestation for
agricultural processes, with an associated demand for
additional cleared cropland,12 especially in subtropical
and tropical areas with dense biodiversity such as
Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.13 Biodiversity
and ecosystem preservation could be supported
through the expanded use of concessional financing
and debt restructuring: 58 developing countries
exposed to climate change have almost $500 billion
in collective debt reservicing payments due in the
next four years.14 Increased deployment of debt-fornature swaps, for example, could be targeted towards
conservation and restoration. In fact, this type of
restructuring is being pursued by Ecuador, Sri Lanka
and Cape Verde.15 However, these mechanisms
could contribute to shorter term challenges of
food insecurity, rising cost of living and declining
government revenue.16 In addition, indigenous
communities can be disproportionately at risk from
these activities. “Fortress conservation” can encroach
on indigenous land tenure and has previously been
linked to forced evictions, even fatalities.17

Yet, there is a more existential feedback mechanism
to consider: biodiversity contributes to the health and
resilience of soil, plants and animals, and its decline
puts both food production yields and nutritional value
at risk.18 This could then fuel deforestation, increase
food prices, threaten local livelihoods and contribute
to diet-related diseases and mortality (explored in
Chapter 2.3: Human health). It may also lead to
Large-scale involuntary migration, a new entrant
in the Top 10 rankings in the GRPS survey (Figure
2.1) and analysed in last year’s Global Risks Report
chapter ‘Barriers to Migration’.

New battlefronts between ecosystems and “green” energy sources
The transition to clean energy is critical for the
mitigation of climate change by reducing the carbon
footprint of energy compared to fossil fuels. Yet
the rapid expansion of green infrastructure in a
quest for energy security may have unintended
impacts on domestic and broader ecosystems,
as the dependencies on and risks to natural
ecosystems of these technologies are, presently,
less well understood. Although renewable energy
infrastructure can be “nature-positive” – for example,
wind farms acting as a “safe haven” for the recovery
of marine populations and the seabed – green
sources of energy can also cause environmental
degradation, such as habitat loss, sound and
electromagnetic pollution, introduction of nonindigenous species and changes to animal migratory
patterns.19
Renewable energy technologies are also reliant
on non-renewable, abiotic natural capital (metals
and minerals, as explored in Chapter 3: Resource
Rivalries). These are sourced from the geosphere,
which, together with the hydrosphere, provide the
physical habitat for the global ecosystem. These
resources are often concentrated in countries with
poor governance of nascent, artisanal and illicit
mining, or less stringent environmental and social
regulations – increasing the likelihood of more
widespread destruction of nature and devastation of
local communities and indigenous groups. Mining of
rare earth elements in Myanmar and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo have already caused
widespread deforestation, habitat destruction of
endangered species and water pollution, and have
been linked to human rights abuses and financing
of militia groups.20 While offering the possibility of
socioeconomic development and diversification, the
expansion of green metals mining in nature-rich or
ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Plurinational
State of Bolivia and Greenland, has the potential to
destabilize water tables and disrupt ecosystems.21
The pressure to push ahead with deep-sea mining
also entails significant risks, due to the unknown
impacts to critical oceanic ecosystems.22
It is clear that both the scale and pace needed
to transition to a green economy require new
technologies. However, some of these technologies
Global Risks Report 2023 33

risk impacting natural ecosystems in new ways,
with limited opportunity to “field-test” results. The
urgency of climate change mitigation is incentivizing
the deployment of new technologies, potentially
with less stringent testing and protocols. Carbon
removal technologies will be particularly essential to
achieve a net zero world if anthropogenic emissions
do not sufficiently decline, or emissions from natural
resources continue to increase. Gene editing to
enhance natural carbon capture productivity,
geoengineering for carbon removal,23 and solar
radiation management all pose major future risks
– from enhanced water stress, nutrient “robbing”
and redistribution of diseases to termination shock
and the weaponization of stratospheric aerosol
technologies.24 Unintended consequences relating to
technological “edits” to the atmosphere, biosphere,
hydrosphere and geosphere can occur at speed,
raising the risk of accidental extinction events.

restoring 30% of the planet’s degraded ecosystems.
These significant steps confirm that the global
community recognizes that the risks associated
with nature loss, food production, energy generation
and climate change cannot be fully mitigated in
isolation. However, the translation into public- and
private-sector action remains to be seen, particularly
given limited progress on previous biodiversity – and
climate – targets to date.

Acting today

A focus on biodiversity preservation should drive and
prioritize local adaptation and community resilience
– and in doing so, contribute to the mitigation of
climate change globally. Altered land management
practices like afforestation, micro-irrigation and
agroforestry are a low-cost way to increase resilience
to extreme weather. The protection and restoration
of marine biodiversity, such as mangrove systems,
can enhance rather than compete with domestic
food web productivity and security. It can also
support local industries and livelihoods and provide
protection from extreme weather. Such activities
also produce co-benefits at a global level, such
as enhancing carbon sequestration and climate
regulation, offering potential revenue streams for
developing nations in the form of carbon credits.
Similarly, scaling up practices such as biocultural
preservation, indigenous community management
and integration of traditional knowledge into
food production and cultivation can provide dual
socioeconomic and environmental benefits.25

Averting tipping points requires a combination of
conservation efforts, interventions to transform the
food system, accelerated and nature-positive climate
mitigation strategies, and changes to consumption
and production patterns. This involves realigning
incentives and upgrading governance structures,
fueled by better data and tools to capture the
interdependencies of food, climate, energy and
ecosystems.
There are already initial signs of shifts in this
direction. The increasing visibility and influence of
multilateral and market-led initiatives such as the
Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures
(TFND) set to launch later this year, are positive
developments. The 15th Conference of Parties to
the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD COP15)
resulted in the Montreal-Kunming agreement, setting
out new global targets for 2030 such as reforming
environmentally damaging subsidy systems and

Although the relationship between climate and nature
heightens the likelihood of a series of escalating and
potentially irreversible feedback loops, it can equally
be leveraged to broaden the impact of risk mitigation
activities. Given increasing financial and capacity
trade-offs, investment in resilience must focus
on solutions that build preparedness for multiple
risks. By restoring biodiversity in soils, for example,
regenerative agriculture has the potential to store
large amounts of carbon.

2.3

Human health: perma-pandemics and chronic
capacity challenges
Global public health is under growing pressure
and health systems around the world are at risk
of becoming unfit for purpose. The COVID-19
pandemic further amplified ever-present spectres
and emerging risks to physical and mental health,
including antimicrobial resistance (AMR), vaccine
hesitancy and climate-driven nutritional and
infectious diseases (described in ‘False Positive:
Health Systems under New Pressures’ in our
2020 edition, published before the pandemic took
hold). Given current crises, mental health may also
be exacerbated by increasing stressors such as
violence, poverty and loneliness.
There is also a rising risk of a “panic-neglect”
cycle. As COVID-19 recedes from the headlines,
complacency appears to be setting in on preparing
for future pandemics and other global health
threats. Healthcare systems face worker burnout
and continued shortages at a time when fiscal
consolidation risks deflecting attention and resources
elsewhere. More frequent and widespread infectious
disease outbreaks amidst a background of chronic
diseases over the next decade risks pushing
exhausted healthcare systems to the brink of failure
around the world.26

Pandemic aftershocks meet
silent health crises
Global health outcomes have been weakened by
the COVID-19 pandemic, with lingering effects.
Early evidence points to a post-COVID-19 condition
impacting the quality of life and occupational status
of individuals – contributing to work absences
and early retirements, tighter labour markets and
a decline in economic productivity. The resulting
economic hit is estimated to be from roughly
$140-600 billion to up to $3.7 trillion in the United
States of America, and close to AUD$5 billion per
year in Australia if current costs persist, reflecting
loss of quality of life, lost earnings and output, and
higher spending on medical care.27 The pandemic
also diverted resources from other diseases
such as cancer screening and tuberculosis,28
and immunization campaigns were put on hold.
Vaccination rates for polio fell to the lowest level in
14 years, perhaps ushering in the return of the wild
strain to Africa in 2021.29
Beyond the lingering impact of COVID-19, the
potential stresses imposed by climate change and
nature loss on health are likely to grow, ranging
from air pollution and heightened exposure to wet
heatwave days (which increase heat stress on
humans), to disrupted access to safe water and
sanitation and increases in waterborne diseases
due to floods. Urbanization, land use change

and nature loss are heightening the emergence
and re-emergence of diseases, including invasive
fungal diseases, while global warming is increasing
the number of months suitable for transmission
of existing diseases such as malaria and dengue
fever.30 Climate change is also expected to
exacerbate malnutrition as food insecurity grows.
Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
can result in nutrient deficiencies in plants, and even
accelerated uptake of heavy minerals, which have
been linked to cancer, diabetes, heart disease and
impaired growth.31
Expanding sources of disease will combine with
persistent disease burdens to entrench a growing
health burden in developing and advanced
economies alike. There has been a noticeable shift
towards non-communicable diseases over the past
decade (Figure 2.5), linked to population growth
and ageing alongside lagging coverage by health
systems. A key implication is the resulting loss of
functional health and rise in disabilities, rather than
deaths. Medical advances have made it possible
for people to live with multiple co-morbidities
(such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease
and depression), but these remain complex and
expensive to manage. People are living more years
in poor health, and we may soon face a more
sustained reversal in life expectancy gains beyond
the influence of the pandemic.
Notably, although some disease burdens are
growing, all health-related risks fell into roughly
the bottom third of the GRPS’ global risk rankings
over both the two- and 10-year period (Figure
2.2). “Infectious diseases” plummeted in risk

perceptions, from the sixth-most severe risk on a
global scale over the next 10 years in last year’s
Global Risks Report, to 27th place this year. Further,
female respondents to the GRPS consistently
assessed health-related risks as more severe than
their male counterparts. Chronic diseases and
health conditions and Severe mental health
deterioration were ranked 13th and 14th by female
respondents, with the related Collapse or lack of
public infrastructure and services in 19th place,
compared to rankings of 23rd, 28th and 27th,
respectively, by male respondents.
The decline in risk perception is likely driven by
pandemic fatigue and the human tendency to
focus on fresh, recent and more visible crises.
Yet “silent” crises with cumulative impacts can
quickly outpace a one-off, catastrophic event. The
COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to nearly
6.6 million deaths globally at the time of writing
noting that this figure will likely increase with China’s
lifting of stringent COVID-19 restrictions after three
years.33 In comparison, an estimated 4.95 million
deaths were associated with drug-resistant bacteria
(AMR) in 2019 alone, with roughly 1.27 million of
these considered directly attributable to AMR.34
Air pollution was estimated to be responsible
for a further 9 million deaths in the same year,
corresponding to one in six deaths worldwide.35
While there are limitations to the collection and
analysis of data in all three cases, and COVID-19’s

outcomes may have been far worse in the absence
of rapid action, the comparisons highlight the
potential of silent crises to create compounding,
runaway damage.

Chronic capacity challenges
As disease burden grows and innovation widens
the scope of what medicine can treat, inexorable
demand for healthcare is running up against chronic
capacity challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic
disrupted the delivery of prevention and treatment
services, resulting in a backlog for hospital and
community care that may prove challenging to clear.
More than 7 million people in the United Kingdom of
Great Britain (more than one-tenth of the population)
were waiting for non-emergency medical care in
September 2022, while 10% of job posts remained
vacant as the National Health Service struggled to
retain staff.36
Health systems are likely to face intensifying financial
pressure – with budget cuts or revenue loss as well
as higher costs of goods and labour – as inflation
persists, economies grow slowly or stagnate, and
governments reprioritize expenditure to address
more salient social and security concerns. Even
before the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated staff
shortages, the World Health Organization (WHO)
Global Risks Report 2023 36

predicted a global shortfall of 15 million health
workers by 2030.37 Some health systems are seeing
productivity decline as experienced employees leave
due to exhaustion, burnout and concerns about
staff and patient safety. Skills and infrastructure
gaps undermine capacity further as staff become
overwhelmed by challenges for which they are not
adequately equipped or supported to solve, leading
to more strikes over pay and staffing levels.
Medical inflation is expected to continue to outstrip
GDP growth in many countries,38 and financial
pressures on working populations will intensify
as dependency ratios rise. The United States of
America already spends nearly 20% of its GDP on
healthcare, even before its largest population cohort
(the “Baby Boomers”) has retired.39 Governments,
insurers or employers may respond by limiting
coverage and shifting a greater proportion of
the costs to individuals, reducing access and
affordability of healthcare. Two-tier health systems,
already prevalent in many advanced and developing
economies, may become further entrenched, with
a profitable private sector catering to patients with
greater ability and willingness to pay, while poorer
people remain reliant on increasingly threadbare
public provision.40
A persistent mismatch between demand and supply
gradually weakens the ability of health systems even
in richer countries to cope and adapt, eroding care
quality and shrinking healthcare access. Fragile
health systems could quickly become overwhelmed
by one or more catastrophic events. A large-scale
cyberattack, war, extreme weather event or new or
re-emergent infectious diseases could trigger health
system collapse within one or more regions, resulting
in a sudden surge of deaths from all causes. More
gradual deterioration of health systems would also
weaken overall health, widen health disparities,
slow economic activity and undermine political and
societal stability as a safety net disintegrates.

Socioeconomic syndemics
Combined with fragile health systems, there is a risk
of a rise in “syndemics”: a set of concurrent, mutually
enhancing health problems that impact the overall
health status of a population, within the context of
political, structural or social environments.41 The
concept has long been applied to HIV research.
More recently, it has been considered in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic and chronic disease
burdens, which have resulted in higher morbidity
and mortality rates among socially disadvantaged
communities.42 A similar pattern could now play out
at a systemic level: deteriorating social, economic
and political contexts will contribute to endemic
diseases and lead to poorer health outcomes for
select communities.
Inequality and conflicts in societal values could
precipitate regulatory changes regarding education,
employment, housing, gender, immigration and the

environment, some of which could have unintended
compounding effects on specific diseases. For
example, a lack of LGBTQ protection has been
linked to poorer health outcomes relating to HIV,
due to the resulting avoidance of healthcare.43
Current crises might further derail health outcomes
and equity. Chronic financial stress and rationing
of essentials – such as having to choose between
heating and eating – will have long-term physical
and psychological impacts even on healthy people.44
Lower confidence in public institutions has already
resulted in less effective pandemic responses, and
growing misinformation and disinformation could
further increase vaccine hesitancy, which has
already led to the re-emergence of locally-eradicated
diseases such as polio.45 These patterns may be
reinforced as there is a clear rise in the erosion
of social cohesion (see Chapter 1.2: Societal
polarisation).
Geopolitical tensions could limit the co-development
and sharing of new scientific breakthroughs,
limiting respective abilities to address ever-present
risks such as AMR as well as new ones. Export
restrictions applied to medicine and medical
products could cause a humanitarian crisis and spiral
into controls over even more existential resources –
most notably food – with compounding effects on
health. Disparities in healthcare access may also
worsen across and within countries as a result of
economic inequality. For example, while advances
such as in personalized, genomic and proteomic
medicine can vastly improve health outcomes for
chronic and degenerative conditions, they come with
hefty price tags that may constrain widespread use;
gene therapies can cost upwards of $2 million.46 A
rise in state instability and conflict would further limit
the delivery of aid, disrupt vaccination programmes
and put health workers at risk. This was evident
in the case of polio vaccination workers killed in
Afghanistan last year.47

Global Risks Report 2023 37

Acting today
It is essential that we embed hard-earned lessons in
preparedness for the next iteration of health crises.
A continued focus on public health policy and
interventions can have outsized impacts at national
and regional levels, as a great deal of chronic
disease burden is, in fact, preventable.48 Realizing
public health gains will require governments and
business to promote the conditions that underpin
wellbeing and encourage healthy lifestyles, such
as good food, clean air, secure housing and social
cohesion.
Public health agencies, healthcare providers and
funders can play a key role by improving interactions
and coordination between different parts of the
health system to share information, expand capacity
and improve overall population health. Planning for
the long run will help governments better assess
and manage health system risks, as will aligning
policies that directly or indirectly affect health (such
as agricultural policies that drive antibiotic use and
increase AMR risk). Governments and businesses
will also need to add a health dimension to crisis
preparedness plans to withstand emerging risks.

2.4

In parallel, national and global health institutions
and systems need to be strengthened in the face
of multiple challenges. Innovation in care delivery,
staffing and funding models are required for health
systems to provide disease prevention, early
detection and complex care cost-effectively for
an increasingly frail and chronically ill population.
There is also potential for healthcare to reap the
advantages of technological advances and digital
transformation that other sectors have embraced,
such as augmenting capacity with technology and
combining virtual and in-person care to reduce
costs.
Opportunities to strengthen public health exist
across countries, too, especially in the areas of
pandemic surveillance and preparedness, scientific
collaboration, and in mitigating global threat drivers
such as climate change and AMR. It is essential
that health nationalism is avoided in the face
of the geopolitical and security considerations
already underway today. Continued collaboration
and information flows in the field of healthcare,
pharmaceuticals and life sciences underpin efforts
to ensure that our understanding and capability can
continue to effectively address emerging health risks.

Human security: new weapons, new conflicts
GRPS results suggest that economic and information
warfare will continue to pose a more severe threat
than hot conflict over the next decade. Interstate
conflict and Use of weapons of mass destruction
were ranked lower in anticipated severity
compared to “Geoeconomic confrontation” and
Misinformation and disinformation over the
10-year time frame (Figure 2.2).
Past decades were defined by the non-deployment
of humanity’s most powerful weapons and no direct

clashes between global powers. Prior to 2022,
militarization had fallen in all regions, with recent
data showing an overall decline in nearly 70% of the
countries covered by the Global Peace Index 2022
over the past 15 years.49 Even between 2021 and
2022, the holdings of nuclear and heavy weapons,
military expenditure, weapons imports and armed
services personnel rates declined (Figure 2.6). Yet
the world still became less peaceful, with more violent
demonstrations, external conflict and intense internal
conflicts during the same fifteen-year period.50

A reversal of the trend towards demilitarization will
heighten the risk of conflict, on a potentially more
destructive scale. Growing mistrust and suspicion
between global and regional powers has already
led to the reprioritization of military expenditure and
stagnation of non-proliferation mechanisms. The
diffusion of economic, technological and, therefore,
military power to multiple countries and actors is
driving the latest iteration of a global arms race.
Unlike previous power dynamics that were shaped
by weapons of deterrence, the next decade could
be defined by devastation from precision attacks and
expanded conflicts.

New military architects and
architecture
The 2010s saw global military expenditure growing
in line with GDP and government budgets (5% of
expenditure, down from 12% in the early 1990s).51
However, today, global military expenditure as
proportion of GDP is rising, driven predominantly by
higher spending by the United States of America,
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Russia, India, China
and Saudi Arabia. Japan announced a proposal to
double its defence budget to $105 billion (2% of
its GDP) in May last year, and Qatar has increased
spending by 434% since 2010 in response to
blockades.52 The war in Ukraine – as well as
lukewarm condemnation by a few key geopolitical
players – has driven recent pledges by NATO
members to meet or exceed the target of 2% of

GDP, which, if met by all members, would represent
an increase in total budget by 7% in real terms.53
Widespread defence spending, particularly on
research and development, could deepen insecurity
and promote a race between global and regional
powers towards more advanced weaponry.54
The private sector is set to increasingly drive the
development of military technologies, yielding
advancements in semiconductor manufacturing,
AI, quantum computing, biotechnology and even
nuclear fusion, among other technologies.55 Many
of these are general purpose in nature with civilian
applications, but are also a force multiplier of military
power, enhancing the capabilities of autonomous
weapons, cyberwarfare and defensive capabilities.
Emerging technologies will be increasingly subject
to state-imposed limits to cross-border flows of
talent, IP, data and underlying technologies (such
as extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment) and
resources (such as critical metals and minerals),
to constrain the comparative rise of foreign rivals.
Enhanced focus and investment will drive innovations
– global research and development expenditure
hit 2.63% in 2021, the highest in decades.56 There
are sure to be multiple architects (Figure 2.7), with
parallel innovations and interoperable ecosystems
that will not only undermine efficiencies and
duplicate efforts – even prior to the tightening of
market conditions, technological fragmentation was
estimated to result in losses of up to 5% GDP for
many economies57 – but may also increase risk.
Military-driven innovations in relevant fields will

have knock-on benefits for economic productivity
and societal resilience, including personalized
and preventative medicine, climate modelling and
material science development. The influence of blocs
will grow, closely tying together alliances across
security, investment, trade, innovation, talent and
standards. For example, Australia, Japan, South
Korea and New Zealand were recently invited to
participate at a NATO summit for the first time.59
As developing economies seek to enhance their
security in the new military architecture, they will be
pulled deeper into the wider economic and military
expansion of larger powers.60 However, the Global
South also risks being priced out of security and
broader technological advancements. For example,
the diffusion of dual-use technologies may be
constrained or subject to high royalties, widening
global inequality.

Next-generation technologies and
multi-domain conflicts
New technologies will change the nature of the
threat to national and international security, with a
rise in multi-domain conflicts that blur the definition
of conventional warfare. “Future battlefields”
and methods of confrontation are expanding,
encompassing the land, sea, air, cyberspace
and outer space (explored in the Crowding and
Competition in Space Chapter in last year’s Global
Risks Report).61 Anti-satellite and hypersonic weapon
capabilities have already been demonstrated by

some states.62 Directed Energy Weapons are
expected to make significant progress over the
next decade, with the potential to disable satellites,
electronics, communications and positioning
systems, and some of these weapons may be more
cost-effective than traditional munitions.63 Quantum
computing may be harnessed to identify new
materials for use in stealth technologies, and cyber
and information warfare will be deployed to target
vulnerabilities in increasingly sophisticated military
technologies, which could range from disinformation
campaigns to hacking hardware in nuclear defence
systems.64
Importantly, these technologies are emerging in
parallel – with the potential for simultaneous and
compounding impacts on global security.65 The
testing and demonstration of enhanced capabilities
could destabilize geopolitical relationships and
accelerate an arms race, even in the absence of
triggering conventional or nuclear strikes. This race
will also slow the development of and adherence to
norms, standards and safety protocols governing the
development and use of these technologies, leaving
fundamental questions unanswered – such as how
to pursue fields like quantum computing, without
simultaneously destabilizing the world’s encryption
systems and accelerating a global arms race.66 As a
result, self-regulation by the private sector will likely
rise, as will consumer campaigning against military
applications of technologies, such as the “Stop Killer
Robots” coalition.
While social and global norms constraining the use

of nuclear weaponry remain high, the unconstrained
pursuit of lower-yield weaponry and stronger
defensive military technologies could undermine the
perceived security provided by nuclear weapons,
putting in jeopardy a delicate strategic balance.
Emerging technologies heighten the actual or
perceived vulnerability of countries to attack,
including nuclear-armed ones.67 Advanced sensing
technologies, particularly once enabled by quantum
computing, could theoretically expose second-strike
capabilities (mobile nuclear weapons) to real-time
targeting and elimination.68 The potential for loweryield, more targeted nuclear weaponry has already
brought into question the viability of the current
threshold of activation for the “nuclear umbrella” of
the United States of America. An escalating arms
race may cause countries to roll back the no-firstuse principle to enhance deterrence.

largest number of annual ballistic missiles launches
last year, and there is escalating rhetoric in the
context of the war in Ukraine.71 The possibility of
nuclear-sharing arrangements or even potential
acquisition in limited circumstances has been raised
in some non-nuclear states, such as Japan and
the South Korea.72 Negotiations on the revival of
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
have also stalled.73 Although both the United
States of America and Russia have continued to
adhere to the New START Treaty, and disarmament
technically continues, the usable military stockpiles
of both countries - accounting for 90% of all nuclear
weapons - remained stable in 2021.74

Together, these new technologies are escalating
rhetoric and the pressure on existing governance
mechanisms. This could lead to an increase in
the global inventory of nuclear warheads for the
first time since the Cold War,69 raising the risk of
accidental, miscalculated or deliberate clashes,
with devastating results. Nuclear-armed countries
continue to modernize arsenals and develop new
types of delivery systems; late last year, the United
States of America unveiled its first new nuclearcapable strategic bomber in more than three
decades. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons, which entered into force in early 2021,
continues to be opposed by all nine declared
nuclear-armed states.70 North Korea conducted the

Proliferation of more destructive and new-tech
military weaponry may enable newer forms of
asymmetric warfare, allowing smaller powers and
individuals to have a greater impact at a national and
global level. Financial, information and intelligence
thresholds are lower in many dual-use technologies.
For example, advances in biotechnologies could
enable the creation of pathogens by small groups or
even individuals.75 Low-cost drones utilizing swarm
intelligence can be used to attack high-value units,
including bases and fuel tanks.76 The most recent
available data suggests a consolidation of arms
exports, with North America and Europe accounting
for 87% of all arms exports from 2017-2021,
alongside an accompanying decline from China and

Russia.77 However, any future diffusion of market
share will increase the likelihood of advanced military
systems being shared with more adversaries, across
a broader geographic area.78
The lower cost and potential spread of conventional
or chemical, biological, or nuclear weaponry to rogue
actors will further erode the government’s “monopoly
on violence". This can increase the vulnerability of
states and fuel migration, corruption and violence
that can spill over borders.79 Drones have already
been used by non-state actors in Syria, Libya and
Yemen, and both military and civilian drones have
been used by formal security forces, paramilitary
groups and non-combatants in Ukraine.80 Despite
limited transparency and accountability, there has
also been a growing reliance on private militia and
security services to protect assets and infrastructure,
including vessels, commercial shipping, offshore
platforms and ports. The use of these proxy, hybrid
and private armies in multiple security contexts
has been linked to violations of human rights
and international law in conflict, post-conflict and
peacetime settings.81
The distinction between civilian and military spheres
is blurring further: these technologies expose
populations to direct domestic threats, often with
the objective of shattering societal functioning.
This includes the physical and virtual disruption
of critical resources and services at both a local
and national level, such as agriculture and water,
financial systems, public security, transport,
energy, and domestic, space-based and undersea
communication infrastructure. “Breakdown of
critical information infrastructure” was ranked
tied 16th by GRPS respondents in terms of
perceived severity over the next 10 years, but
its relationship with Interstate conflict was not
highlighted (Figure 2.8). Concerted attempts at
cyberattacks against Ukraine were made last year,
including against communication services, financial
websites and electricity grids. Data theft and deepfake technology also sought to prevent access to
services, targeting flows of refugees, medicines,
food and relief supplies.82 The critical functioning of
whole economies will only become more exposed

2.5

with breakthroughs in dual-use technologies, most
notably quantum computing.

Acting today
An international environment that is at greater
risk of conflict and the less transparent attribution
of unconventional engagement may weaken the
shared moral, reputational and political costs
that partially act as a deterrent to the deployment
of destructive weaponry, including nuclear
engagement. Undoubtedly, the strengthening of
arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation
agreements and norms, covering both existing and
newer forms of military technologies, are essential
to provide transparency. This can also reduce the
risk of unintended escalation, for example by limiting
the spillover of conflicts across domains, such as
a cyberattack on critical infrastructure escalating
into a targeted destructive exchange with lethal
autonomous weapons.83 Establishing norms will be
essential to ensuring the right balance is struck so
that technological innovation can continue to be
harnessed to improve socioeconomic outcomes for
humanity.
However, achieving effective arms control will
be even more challenging than in the past. It will
require engagement with a broader range of actors
– including academic researchers and the private
sector – given the dual-usages of many of these
technologies. Developments are quickly outpacing
global governance processes. An escalating
arms race will further hinder collaboration, but the
regulation of new weapons technologies to control
proliferation and usage can only be achieved through
transnational cooperation. The first step should
include greater recognition by global powers of
the strategically beneficial value to agreements on
key arms control issues. In the longer term, new
strategies for global governance that can adapt
to this new security context must be explored to
assuage the concerns of nations and avoid a spiral
of instability and accidental or intentional destruction.

Digital rights: privacy in peril
Digital tools - increasingly sophisticated AI applications,
interoperable edge computing and Internet of Things
(IOT) devices, autonomous technologies - underpin the
functioning of cities and critical infrastructure today and
will play a key role in developing resilient solutions for
tomorrow’s crises. Yet these developments also give
rise to new challenges for states trying to manage the
existing physical world and this rapidly expanding digital
domain.
Based on GRPS results, “Widespread cybercrime
and cyber insecurity” is a new entrant into the top 10
rankings of the most severe risks over the next decade.

As highlighted in last year’s Global Risks Report chapter
‘Digital Dependencies and Cyber Vulnerabilities’,
malicious activity in cyberspace is growing, with more
aggressive and sophisticated attacks taking advantage
of more widespread exposure. It was seen as a
persistent threat by GRPS respondents as well as a
strong driver of other risks (Figure 2.9).
The proliferation of data-collecting devices and datadependent AI technologies could open pathways
to new forms of control over individual autonomy.
Individuals are increasingly exposed to the misuse of
personal data by the public and private sector alike,

ranging from discrimination of vulnerable populations
and social control to potentially bioweaponry.84
Not all threats to the digital autonomy and
sovereignty of individuals are malicious in nature.
Larger data sets and more sophisticated analysis
also heighten the risk of the misuse of personal
information through legitimate legal mechanisms,
weakening the human right to privacy,85 even
in democratic and strongly regulated regimes.
Legal incursions on privacy can be motivated by
public safety considerations, crime prevention and
response, economic development and better health
outcomes. The privacy of personal and sensitive
data is coming under increasing pressure by
national security concerns, combining the protection
of societies and states and the desire to gain a
competitive technological and economic advantage.

Commercialized privacy
The right to privacy as it applies to information about
individuals incorporates two key elements: the right
not to be observed and the right to control the flow
of information when observed.86 As more data is
collected and the power of emerging technologies
increases over the next decade, individuals will be
targeted and monitored by the public and private
sector to an unprecedented degree, often without
adequate anonymity or consent.87
Surveillance technologies are becoming increasingly

sophisticated through new technologies and
techniques for gathering and analyzing data. The
oft-cited examples are biometric identification
technologies. In recognition of the potential risks
posed to privacy and the freedom of movement,
some companies have self-regulated the sale of
facial recognition to law enforcement, and the use of
this technology in public spaces faces an upcoming
ban in the EU.88 Concerns also extend to the use
of biometric technologies to analyze emotions.
Other forms of monitoring are already becoming
commonplace. Automated AI-based tools such as
chatbots collect a wide amount of personal data to
function effectively. The mass move to home working
during the pandemic has led to tracking of workers
through cameras, keystroke monitoring, productivity
software and audio recordings – practices which are
permitted under data-protection legislation in certain
circumstances, but which collect deeper and more
sensitive data than previous mechanisms.89
More insidiously, the spread of networked data
is increasing surveillance potential by a growing
number of both public- and private-sector actors,
despite stringent regulatory protection.90 As our
lives become increasingly digitalized over the
next decade, our “everyday experience” will be
recorded and commodified through internet-enabled
devices, more intelligent infrastructure and “smart”
cities – a passive, pervasive and persistent form of
networked observations that are already being used
to create targeted profiles.91 This pattern will only
be enhanced by the metaverse, which could collect
and track even more sensitive data, including facial
Global Risks Report 2023 43

expressions, gait, vital signs, brainwave patterns and
vocal inflections.92
Individuals have usually consented to the collection of
data for the associated beneficial use of the service
or product, given the wave of new and stronger data
protection policies in many markets.93 However, as
the collection, commercialization and sharing of data
grows, consent in one area may reveal far more than
intended when aggregated with other data points.
This is known as the “mosaic effect”, which gives rise
to two key privacy risks: re-identification and attribute
disclosure.94 Research suggests that 99.98% of US
residents could be correctly re-identified in any data
set – including those that are heavily sampled and
anonymized – using 15 demographic attributes.95
Researchers have used this theory to uncover the
political preferences of streaming users,96 match
DNA from publicly-available research databases to
randomly selected individuals,97 and link medical
billing records from an open data set to individual
patients.98
In consequential terms, this means that an
international organization may share anonymized data
with partner governments to support effective and
efficient crisis responses. However, when combined
with other data sets, it could allow the identification
and tracking of vulnerable refugees and displaced
persons – or compromise the location of camps
and the supply chains of critical goods.99 Data on
race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and immigration
status can be legally obtained in some markets
and re-identified to varying degrees, enabling civil
harassment and abuse. In one such example, the
sexual orientation of a priest was obtained through
the purchase of smartphone location data and
announced by a religious publication.100

companies, particularly as it relates to terrorist
investigations, despite broader implications to the
ongoing security of civilians’ data.104
Potential for misuse will be especially problematic
for users residing in countries with poor digital
rights records, inadequate regulatory protection
frameworks, or authoritarian tendencies. Forms
of digital repression to quell politically motivated
uprisings, such as the use of spyware to track
activist activities, are already driving significant
human rights violations in the Middle East.105
Recent reports have also highlighted potential
digital rights violations in Africa stemming from
the rapid expansion of biometric programmes
that include voter registration, CCTV with facial
recognition, mandatory SIM card registration and
refugee registration.106 As more emerging markets
look towards progressing their smart city plans, the
collection of sensitive citizen data could expose
societies to additional peril if poorly governed and
protected.107
Security concerns posed by sensitive data and its
potential abuse are well-recognized by governments.
Countries have adopted more widespread data
localization policies, tightened regulation of
research collaborations, and banned some foreignowned companies from certain markets, including
telecommunications, surveillance equipment and
mobile applications, to limit the collection and
possession of sensitive data by non-allied states.108
Yet, less attention is being paid to the potential for
overreach and abuse of this data in the name of
national security. The slow and legal erosion of the
digital sovereignty of individuals can have unintended
and far-reaching consequences for social control and
the erosion of democracies – including, for example,
by compromising freedom of the press.

Data-enabled anocracies
The right to privacy is not absolute; it is traded-off
against government surveillance and preventative
policing for the purposes of national security.
However, the surveillance potential of data has
meant that access to sensitive information can
increasingly be obtained without due process or
transparency.101 In some cases, data protection
laws that require consent effectively waive the legal
protections against electronic surveillance of private
communications and location data.102
In the United States of America, data is aggregated
and sold on the open market with limited regulatory
restrictions, meaning enforcement agencies can
purchase GPS location data without warrants or
public disclosure. For example, theoretically, police
could use automated licence plate data (obtained
by both private- and public-sector organizations) to
prosecute out-of-state abortions – leading Google
to announce that it would auto-delete location
data for users that visit related centres.103 There is
also increasing political and regulatory pressure to
weaken encryption mechanisms adopted by private
Global Risks Report 2023 44

Growing trade-offs between
innovation and security
Data is an important factor of production, and
collection and flows are essential to fuel innovation
for enhanced economic productivity (including
automation), as well as socially beneficial uses.109
More expansive and innovative applications of
AI and other emerging technologies will require
cross-industry and public-private data aggregation.
The centralization and consolidation of some
types of data can lend a competitive advantage
to economies, such as through improved
health outcomes associated with advances in
biotechnology.110 Yet governments may also
increasingly struggle to balance the potential harm
of privacy loss against the benefits of more rapid
development of emerging technologies.
At the same time, to address the growing
concentration of data in the hands of a small
number of private-sector companies, governments
may increasingly push for open-data policies from
both public- and private-sector sources, mirroring
recent regulatory moves by the EU around data
spaces and marketplaces.111 Such policies – like the
creation of public data trusts for research purposes
– will likely affect both domestic companies and
industries, as well as allied countries. This may
benefit more widespread and diffused innovation,
but it will also expand risks as they enable privacy
breaches at a much larger scale. Privacy will
strongly influence these agreements: the US
government recently committed to heightened
safeguards for transatlantic data flows, including
from US intelligence activities.112
However, many of these data sets may still be
subject to the threat of re-identification, even
with recent developments in privacy-enhancing
technologies such as synthetic data, federated
learning and differential privacy.113 Research
suggests that sensitive databases and technologies,
such as pools of biological data and DNA
sequencing, are already vulnerable to attack.114
Sensitive health data is governed inconsistently
and the creation of large pools of personal data
are creating lucrative targets for cybercriminals,
particularly given the less stable geopolitical
environment and limited norms currently governing
cyberwarfare. The potential consequences of the
large-scale theft of biometric or genomic information
are largely unknown but may allow for targeted
bioweaponry.

Acting today

level will enable more effective, less complicated
cross-border data-sharing mechanisms to power
innovation while still ensuring adequate protection
for individuals.
Developing a more globally consistent taxonomy,
data standards, and legal definition of personal
and sensitive information is a key enabler. These
frameworks should recognize that sensitivity can
rise from data-driven inferences that are enabled
by large data sets, the proliferation of online social
networks, and the blurring of personal and industrial
data in the roll-out of the IOT and implementation of
“smarter” cities.115 For example, one company was
recently fined under the EU’s GDPR (General Data
Protection Regulation) for targeted advertising that
inferred a medical condition (deemed as a special
category of data) on the basis of purchase history.116
Historically severe fines for data loss are also
helping change the cost-benefit assessment
around investment in cybersecurity measures,
but questions remain around the individual rights
to action, damage and compensation in cases of
breach.117 It will be incumbent on organizations to
consider the ethics of data collection and usage
to minimize reputational considerations beyond
regulatory compliance. In addition, spurred by both
increased cyberattacks and tighter data laws, the
voluntary disposal and destruction of personal data
may become a stronger priority – with potential
environmental co-benefits of minimizing data
storage needs. Finally, governments will also need
to development emergency capabilities to respond
to data breaches and violation of privacy to minimize
follow-on repercussions.

At a national level, a patchwork of fragmented data
policy regimes at local or state levels raises the risk
of accidental and intentional abuses of data in a
manner that was not considered by the individual’s
original consent. Harmonizing policies at a national

Economic stability: global debt distress
The threat of a sovereign debt crisis has been
brewing, with public debt growing as interest rates
have fallen. Governments have leveraged cheap
money to invest in future growth and help stabilize
distressed financial systems, providing massive
fiscal support during the pandemic and to shield
households and businesses from the current costof-living crisis. However, high levels of debt may not
be sustainable under tighter economic conditions.
The rapid and widespread normalization of monetary
policies, accompanied by a stronger US dollar and
weaker risk sentiment, has already increased debt
vulnerabilities that are likely to remain heightened for
years.
Stagflation on a global scale, combined with
historically high levels of public debt, could have
vast consequences.118 Even with a softer landing,
the consequences of debt-trap diplomacy and
rockier restructuring raise the risk of debt distress –
and even default – spreading to more systemically
important markets, paralysing the global economic
system. Further, even comparatively orderly fiscal
consolidation is likely to impact spending on human
capital and development, ultimately threatening the
resilience of economies and societies in the face of
the next global shock, whatever form it might take.

The rising price of debt
General government gross debt in advanced
economies hit 112% of GDP in 2022, compared
to roughly 65% of GDP for emerging and
developing markets.119 Yet as identified in Chapter
1.2, Economic downturn, some developing
and emerging markets are feeling the impacts
of tightening monetary policy and deteriorating
economic conditions first and most acutely. For
example, Ghana recently reached an agreement with
the IMF regarding a $3 billion bailout and Zambia is
seeking to conclude restructuring of $15 billion in
external debt early this year. A broad-based global
recession within the year120 could temper inflation
and cap interest rate rises, but there is a higher risk
of balance-of-payments crisis in the short-term,
alongside a credit crunch over the mid to longer
term.121 Emerging market banks also hold a larger
proportion of domestic public debt, with the potential
for distress to spread to banks, households and
pension funds.122 Larger emerging markets exhibiting
a heightened risk of default include Argentina, Egypt,
Ghana, Kenya, Tunisia, Pakistan and Türkiye.123
Downside risks loom large, and another global shock
could result in deeper and more prolonged economic
disorder. Stagflation remains a severe risk for many
economies. Current crises, such as the war in
Ukraine and lingering impacts of COVID-19, are still
impacting basic inputs, including labour, energy and
food. Continued tightness in major labour markets

may exacerbate wage inflation – meaning there may
need to be a material increase in unemployment to
contain consumer inflation. Extended supply-driven
inflation could drive more painful interest rate rises,
even amidst a slowdown in growth, leading to a
harder landing and more widespread debt distress.
A more systemically important emerging and
developing economy – the likes of Mexico, South
Africa and Poland – could face distress in coming
years, raising the risk of financial contagion.124
As cautioned by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), miscalibration between fiscal and monetary
policies could exacerbate this further, and in
unexpected markets.125 Questions around the
independence of central banks risk de-anchoring
market expectations, and monetary intervention
to counteract inflationary fiscal policies will only
heighten the risk of longer economic malaise. The
United Kingdom of Great Britain's near-crisis in
September last year is an example of the potential
instability that could arise. The interest payable on
the country's public debt is expected to hit £120.4
billion for the financial year ending March 2023, up
from £69.9 billion, the highest on record.126 The Bank
of England raised rates from 0.1% in December
2021 to 3.5% in December 2022, yet was forced
to intervene with an emergency quantitative easing
programme in September to counter the market
reaction to the UK government’s proposed fiscal
stimulus.127 In the absence of a global shock, the
“veto power” of the markets will increasingly limit
fiscal expansion, even in advanced economies.128

The new geopolitics of debt
For now, the ratio of defaulted versus total global
public debt remains very low by historic standards
Global Risks Report 2023 46

and far lower than peaks experienced in the 1980s
(Figure 1.6). However, this partially reflects the
growth in absolute public debt levels. Despite record
IMF emergency lending and a $650 billion allocation
in special drawing rights,129 more than 54 countries
are currently in need of debt relief, representing
less than 3% of the global economy. Yet these
countries represent 18% of the global population
and account for more than 50% of people living in
extreme poverty.130 Fears of contagion and further
capital flight could weaken debt sustainability in a
growing number of lower-income countries. The
scale of debt defaults will influence the depth of
available restructuring, with some creditor countries
hesitant to bail out distressed states on sufficiently
concessionary terms, due to their own tightening
fiscal space and rising domestic needs. There may
also be a shift away from overseas development
assistance towards loans to continue to support
development and wield economic power. This has
a lower domestic cost but exacerbates the debt
burden on these markets and increases the risk of a
larger wave of defaults in the future.
It is not only the scale but the complexity of potential
debt restructuring and need for global cooperation
that will determine the extent to which defaults can
be contained (Figure 2.10). Creditors have expanded
to include quasi-sovereign entities and the private
sector, such as commodity traders and producers.
Although this expansion has provided new avenues
of financing, the coordination of relief between
international organizations, the “Paris Club” and

FIGURE 2.10

other state creditors, as well as the private sector will
continue to complicate attempts at restructuring. For
example, only three countries – Chad, Ethiopia and
Zambia – are currently undergoing treatment under
the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments.
All remain unresolved, reflecting challenging
geopolitical and economic dynamics as well as a
lack of transparency.131
The call for wealthier economies to intervene
bilaterally is growing – likely increasing longer-term
geopolitical tensions. China has become a large
bilateral creditor to many low-income countries
and, by some estimates, has become the largest
official creditor globally.132 Energy exporters, such as
the Middle East and the United States of America,
are also well-placed to step into the gap over the
medium-term. Renewed soft power approaches
and debt-trap diplomacy could redraw regional
and global political lines, driving currency blocs
and possibly exacerbating pressures on developing
countries as supply chains shift to mirror economic
alliances.133 This trend could also destabilize security
dynamics, as debt is leveraged to pull developing
economies into the military expansion of larger
powers (see Chapter 2.4: Human security).
Yet as the number of sovereign defaults grow,
creditor countries and companies could become
more exposed to debt contagion, including
systemically important banks, pension funds and
state creditors. This will interact with other domestic
debt vulnerabilities, including the private sector

and state-owned entities,135 to raise aggregate
exposure and place pressure on the solvency of
even advanced and large emerging economies. A
sovereign debt default in a systemically important
economy could result in systemic proliferation with a
devastating impact on a global scale.

A looming investment shortfall
Even in the absence of a global crisis, the 1980s
“lost decade” of development in Latin America and
Sub-Saharan Africa provides a very real example of
the economic and humanitarian crisis that can arise
from a sovereign debt default, including currency
free falls, collapses in output, cost-of-living crises
and rapid increases in poverty. The 41 countries
that defaulted on their debt in the first half of the
decade required eight years, on average, to reach
their pre-crisis GDP per capita.136 Debt distress and
restructuring will also have an impact on investment.
According to GRPS results, the risk of Debt crises
drops in perceived severity over the longer-term
time frame, but the Collapse or lack of public
infrastructure and services becomes more severe.
The ability to finance continued productivity and
resilience will be hampered by economic and political
dynamics on both a global and national level.
Advanced economies will have more autonomy
to invest in future priorities, while developing
markets may be more beholden to the demands
of the creditor, meaning money could be diverted

from the areas of greatest social need, including
expenditure in public goods and infrastructure.
Beyond the growing financial cost of natural
disasters, emerging and developing economies will
need to spend a higher proportion of GDP on the
green transition and sustainable infrastructure, with
knock-on ramifications for other public spending
and services.137 By contrast, within the limits of
inflationary pressures, advanced economies can
continue to leverage more accessible financing for
economic development, such as stronger industrial
policy, to underpin the energy transition, widening
the divide between countries. Necessary fiscal
consolidation in emerging and developing economies
may also rely heavily on spending cuts, which
could rapidly remove social protection available to
low-income and vulnerable populations, increasing
poverty and inequality within countries, alongside
social and political unrest.
Yet in a structurally different low-growth, lowinvestment economic era, even advanced economies
will need to make trade-offs. Rising unemployment,
social unrest and political polarization, and even
technologically-driven churn in both blue- and whitecollar jobs may influence the prioritization of current
expenditure over longer-term capital expenditure,
while security considerations may mean there is
less fiscal headroom for social and environmental
development over the medium term. The potential
result is the de-prioritization of investment and slow
decay of public infrastructure and services in both
developing and advanced markets.138 Around twofifths of low- and lower-middle-income countries

cut expenditure on education by an average of
13.5% since 2020, which, despite a minor rebound,
fell again in 2022.139 As referenced in Chapter 2:
Human health, the lingering economic, educational
and healthcare overhang of the pandemic continues
to weaken the capacity of public systems that also
face compounding pressure from ageing populations
in advanced economies, and rapidly expanding
populations in some developing markets. This is a
slow-burning risk: impacts are subtle, lagged and
cumulative in nature, but can be highly corrosive in
overall impact to the strength of human capital and
development – a critical mitigant to the impact and
likelihood of other global risks.

increased deployment of debt-for-development deals
(see Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems), particularly
relating to climate-positive adaptation, to help break
the correlation between exposure to climate change
and debt vulnerability.141 However, this should not
just be limited to environmental concerns. Social
bond issuances have already jumped sevenfold, to
$148 billion in 2022, targeting healthcare, education
and small and medium-sized enterprises.142 While
debt swaps may not create fiscal space beyond the
specific objective, SDG-linked conditionality may
enhance the willingness of creditors to consider debt
relief, particularly for countries where other forms of
fiscal support, including write-downs and conditional
grants, may be less likely.143

Acting today

Finally, we are unlikely to be able to double down on
debt to the same extent to cushion the next crisis.
A more proactive approach to countries that are not
yet on the verge of debt distress could help mitigate
the systemic risk of sovereign debt contagion.
Recognition of simultaneous crises – debt, climate
impacts and food security – could be integrated
into greater flexibility and more concessional forms
of financing available to vulnerable markets. With
particular respect to the climate agenda, there is
a growing expectation that packages will include
grants, rather than rely solely on loans that add to
overall debt burdens.144 Bilateral and multilateral
underwriting of risk could also enable much-needed
flows of private capital, while support for longer-term
projects that can help crowd-in private capital, such
as the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust, is
also critical.145

In recognition of the risks posed to broader financial
stability, timely and deeper debt write-downs could
allow a faster return to developmental progress for
vulnerable countries and render a future default less
likely. The private sector could be incentivized to
participate in debt restructuring through a variety
of mechanisms, including issuing of new bonds
with stronger legal protections, loss reinstatement
commitments and value recovery instruments – with
the latter enabling private creditors to gain from
upside developments in debtor countries in the
future, such as GDP-linked instruments in Costa
Rica, Argentina, Greece and Ukraine.140
As a complementary mechanism to more
comprehensive debt restructuring, there may be

Global Risks Report 2023

Resource Rivalries:
Four Emerging Futures
Anticipating “polycrises”
Chapter one and Chapter two highlighted newly
emerging and rapidly accelerating risks over the
current, two- and 10-year time frame to provide
analysis on risks currently unfolding or those that
may become the next global shock. However, these
present and future risks can also interact with each
other to form a “polycrisis” – a cluster of related
global risks with compounding effects, such that the
overall impact exceeds the sum of each part.1
Scenario thinking can be a useful tool to enable
better anticipation of polycrises, as key drivers
can interact in unanticipated ways and lead to

3.2

Resource Rivalries: Four Emerging Futures

unexpected consequences. Bearing this in mind,
this chapter explores how connections between the
emerging risks outlined in previous sections may
evolve by 2030. This year, we explore Resource
Rivalries - a potential cluster of interrelated
environmental, geopolitical and socioeconomic risks
relating to the supply of and demand for natural
resources. The intent is not to exhaustively outline
all scenarios but to provide a structured approach
to identifying potential futures for the polycrisis that
may be triggered, providing a framework for better
preparedness and risk mitigation efforts today.

Polycrisis: natural resources, climate
and cooperation
A growing demand-supply gap
for natural resources
Supply-chain crises of recent years have highlighted
the need for resilience in traditional strategic sectors.
Reliable and cheap access to the most basic of
necessities – food, water and energy – underpins the
critical functioning of societies. Early data suggests
that current crises are driving a worrying reversal of
recent progress. An additional 200 million people
faced acute food insecurity last year compared
to 2019, and the number of people worldwide
without electricity rose to an estimated 774 million,
the equivalent of pre-pandemic levels.2 As noted
in Chapter 1.2, Cost-of-living crisis, supply
crises of this nature can be highly destabilizing,
exposing the fragility of states and leading to loss
of life, widespread violence, political upheaval and
involuntary migration.
Demand for food, water and critical metals and
minerals is escalating. This reflects a range of
factors, including continued population growth,
anticipated to reach 8.5 billion by 2030,3 and
socioeconomic advancement, with a push to achieve
the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by
the target date of 2030. Global food consumption

is projected to increase by 1.4% annually over the
next decade, concentrated in low- to middle-income
countries, versus a 1.1% per annum increase in
production.4 One estimate places the gap between
water demand and supply at 40% by 2030, with a
dramatic and unequal increase in demand between
Global Risks Report 2023 57

countries.5 The continued expansion into secure,
renewable energy and related infrastructure will also
drive exponential demand for finite critical metals and
minerals.6 Significant even in absolute terms, annual
demand for these resources, such as graphite,
lithium and cobalt, is anticipated to hit 450% of 2018
production levels by 2050.7

FIGURE 3.1

Together, the set of emerging demand and supply
concerns around natural resources are already
becoming an area of growing alarm. GRPS
respondents identified strong relationships and twoway linkages between “Natural resource crises”
and the other risks identified in previous chapters
(Figure 3.1), pointing to the potential polycrisis that
may evolve over the medium term.

Cooperation and climate as key
forces for disruption
In the 2030 time frame, two critical factors will
determine the trajectory of our ability to match
supply and demand for these resources as well
as the scale of the associated polycrisis: 1) the
degree of global cooperation that allows the flow of
resources across national borders, and 2) the impact
of climate change on the supply of natural resources
and speed of the low-carbon transition (Box 3.1).
Together, these two axes lead to four hypothetical
futures for 2030:
•

Resource collaboration – the danger of
natural scarcity: effective climate action
measures and flexible supply chains enabled by
global cooperation largely absorb the impacts
of climate change on food production. However,
shortages in water and metals and minerals

cannot be avoided. Persistently high commodity
prices slow climate mitigation – despite ambitions
– and add to inflationary pressures in broader
value chains, while water stress leads to a
growing, but comparatively contained, health and
humanitarian crisis in developing nations.
•

Resource constraints – the danger of
divergent distress: current crises draw focus
and slow climate action, exposing the most
vulnerable countries to hunger and energy
shocks, even as countries cooperate to
partially address constraints. In the absence of
intervention, the water and mineral shortages
experienced in the Resource collaboration
scenario act as a multiplier to broader risks. A
multi-resource, humanitarian crisis emerges in
developing markets as food and water resources
are impacted by the physical consequences of
climate change, alongside global disruptions to
trade, political stability and economic growth.

Given the nature of the polycrisis in each scenario,
we face various environmental and socioeconomic
upsides and downsides. The following section
outlines an illustrative, but non-exhaustive set of midterm futures to help support business leaders and
policy-makers in preparing for – and preventing – the
progression of the crises we are facing today.

geopolitical dynamics exacerbate climateinduced shortages in food and water. This
results in a truly global, multi-resource crisis, with
widespread socioeconomic impacts that exceed
those faced in other futures in both scope
and scale, including famine and water scarcity
refugees. Geoeconomic warfare is widespread,
but more aggressive clashes between states
become one of the few means to ensure supply
of basic necessities for populations.

Resource competition – the danger of
resource autarkies: distrust drives a push
for self-sufficiency in high-income countries,
limiting the need for rivalry over food and water
to a degree, but widening divides between
countries. State intervention is centred on the
resource most exposed to a concentration in
supply – critical metals and minerals – leading
to shortages, price wars and the transformation
of business models across industries. Resource
power shifts, driving the formation of new blocs
as well as wedges in existing alliances between
mineral-rich and -poor countries, while the
potential for accidental or intentional conflict
escalates.

Slow climate action

We use two global drivers – geoeconomic
confrontation and speed of climate action –
to create four futures we may face by 2030,
considering potential implications based on the
evolution of these risks and their interactions
(Figure 3.2).

In parallel, the intensity of the demand-supply gap
in natural resources will reflect the mechanisms
by which states look to boost security in key
resources. We consider the extent to which
the evolution of Geoeconomic confrontation,
highlighted in Chapter 1.2, Economic warfare,
could create conditions of scarcity, by considering
two ends of a continuum (x-axis):
•

Geoeconomic cooperation: characterized by
open dialogue and broadscale, but not always
successful, economic and trade collaboration
between powers through relevant bilateral and
multilateral mechanisms and forums. Wellestablished principles governing trade policies
and state aid are respected.

•

Geoeconomic confrontation: direct and
indirect clashes between global and regional
powers through the extensive exercise of hard
or soft economic, industrial and technological
power. There is limited collaboration on global
economic and trade issues and a breakdown
or paralysis of mechanisms of cooperation, as
well as alliances.

First, we explore the potential risks of a failure of
climate-change adaptation and failure of climate
mitigation efforts, described in Chapter 1.2,
Climate action hiatus, and the extent to which
these failures could result in conditions of scarcity,
on a continuum (y-axis):
•

Accelerated climate action: climate action
and associated funding and innovation are
prioritized. By 2030, we see persistently
expanding but largely well-managed impacts of
climate change, nature loss, natural disasters
and extreme weather events at a global level,
alongside a more rapid energy transition and

Slow climate action: trade-offs between
environmental, social and security goals slow
the prioritization of attention and resources
to address climate change. By 2030, there
has been insufficient or ineffective progress
towards the adaptation support required to
protect infrastructure and populations from
changing climactic conditions. Paired with
relatively slow efforts at mitigation, this has
resulted in continued damage to natural
ecosystems and an increasing financial and
humanitarian impact.

Slow climate action

By 2030, the world is subject to more widespread
and dramatic climate impacts – but we are prepared.
Capital, intellectual property and technological
innovations flow relatively freely across borders (x-axis).
Multilateral and market-led initiatives have unlocked
a range of financing mechanisms and innovation to
support climate-proofing against future disasters
and a rapid shift to climate mitigation efforts (y-axis).
In response to public pressure, governments have
broadly prioritized spending towards adaptation – and
in some cases mitigation – alongside other social and
security concerns, dampening the impact of climate
change on societal vulnerabilities. In this future, the
scaling of food has been supported by international
flows of financing and technology, and shortages
muted by flexible supply chains. Downside impacts
are primarily focused on resources that face barriers to
trading or scaling: water and critical minerals.
Climate-driven declines in agricultural productivity
have been met with a range of measures in
most countries, with climate and nature-based
interventions helping to transform food systems to
be regenerative, climate-smart and healthy. Global
sharing of data and technologies has allowed
more effective pre-emptive adaptation measures
to be taken, such as the targeted use of floodand drought-resilient seeds in some vulnerable
geographies. Although environmental degradation
continues to threaten aquaculture and fisheries,
targeted nature-based adaptation measures have
shored up domestic food networks (see Chapter
2.2: Natural Ecosystems).
The allocation of risk has begun to shift away from
vulnerable workforces and communities. The burden
of continued weather shocks has been partially
offset through adaptation actions, financed by fit-forpurpose financial products, including weather-based
index insurance, climate-related loan products,
guaranteed credit lines, and well-managed riskbased exits from extreme-event-prone geographies.8
Supply shocks stemming from natural disasters are
quickly absorbed by flexible, market-driven supply
chains, and global food insecurity continues to slowly
trend downwards.

Risks remain: some natural resources are scarce,
even in a climate-adapted, geopolitically cooperative
world. Demand for geographically concentrated
critical metals and minerals has risen dramatically,
reflecting a push for secure, renewable energy
sources in the wake of the war in Ukraine, and
renewed urgency of net-zero ambitions over recent
years. Despite sufficient resource deposits in most
minerals,9 this exponential increase in demand has
proved difficult to meet through a rapid expansion
of supply. Shortages initially stemmed from limited
exploration and significant capital requirements,
but the rise in commodity prices have subsequently
helped to scale production, with companies now
targeting deposits previously deemed unextractable
for economic or technological reasons.
However, shortages in key materials remain a nearand mid-term concern, given time lags to production.
Further, environmental concerns have limited
domestic extraction in several advanced and some
emerging economies, as well as by multinational
mining companies headquartered in the West.
Scrutiny from investors, downstream industries and
the public have led to longer approval processes and
more stringent environmental and social standards.
For example, since the early 2020s, the expansion
of lithium mining in Portugal has been significantly
delayed due to environmental approvals; projects
in Canada and Australia have slowed based on
concerns relating to indigenous communities; and
a rare species of buckwheat has limited domestic
mining in key locations in the United States of
America.10
Higher commodity prices have driven inflationary
impacts along the wider value chain, explored further
(and felt more acutely) in the section on Resource
competition. This has encouraged some countries
and multinational companies to accelerate efforts
to turn towards the circular economy as a means
of securing and diversifying the supply of critical
minerals and metals, reducing the need for extraction
and associated emissions. Industry coalitions are
working with future-focused governments to establish
the incentives, policy frameworks, standards and
certifications, and circularity-focused capabilities that
are necessary to scale.11 In some markets, business
models are being transformed to decrease demand
and increase both the recovery potential and actual
recovery of metals and minerals, partially mitigating
the demand-supply gap going forward.
Despite these efforts and continued climate
ambitions, higher prices and shortages are slowing
momentum for the green energy transition in the
short-term. In lower-income economies without local
minerals and metals assets, the promise of support
with green energy infrastructure is partly unfulfilled,
and some are considering reverting to carbonintensive energy sources to secure energy.12
The ability to scale water supply has similarly been

constrained. Water monitoring, efficiency and
production measures have been prioritized by cities,
local and national governments to address more
frequent and severe droughts and the growing water
footprint of food production. Water remains heavily
subsidized, but pricing is used to curb demand and
encourage investment by the private sector and
households in water-efficient, re-usable solutions,
including rainwater harvesting and stormwater
runoffs. Some countries have limited the use of price
controls to industrial use, while others apply them
more broadly across populations, further fueling
inflation, cost-of-living pressures and unrest. But even
significant drops in water demand and waste have not
kept pace with the impact of climate change on water
resources in the most exposed regions (Figure 3.3).
The capacity to scale supply through mechanisms
such as desalinization and purification differ between
countries for geographical and economic reasons.
Water security continues to be threatened in some of
these countries, with growing regional impacts from
hygiene and health crises, urban migration, internal
displacement and involuntary migration.

Despite strong headwinds in the early 2020s,
geoeconomic cooperation resumes in the latter
half of the decade, with stronger global trade as
well as efforts on climate cooperation (x-axis),
mirroring Resource collaboration. However,
domestic funding – and therefore overall investment
– in adaptation measures as well as technological
innovation has not kept pace with climate impacts
to date (y-axis), given competing priorities, a
growing insurance gap and continued costs of
disaster recovery. In this future, even international
coordination cannot address triple-shortages in
food, water and energy in the most vulnerable
nations, with extended climate-induced distress
and disruptions to trade, and political and economic
stability.
In the absence of appropriate intervention,
water availability is now a concern in all regions.
Snowmelt, glacial melt and groundwater availability
has diminished, while 10% of global land area has
experienced an increase in extremely high and
low river flows in the same location. Continued
geopolitical cooperation is evident through
widespread engagement in the range of multilateral
mechanisms governing these resources, from the
1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of
Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes
(Water Convention) and the 1997 Convention on the
Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International
Watercourses (Watercourses Convention), to bilateral
and regional agreements.
However, water stress acts as a multiplier to
shortages of other key resources. In the absence
of effective adaptation, agricultural productivity is
severely impacted by climate change, diverging in
intensity between regions. Crop yields have fallen in
volume and nutritional value due to heat, changing
Global Risks Report 2023 61

including Brazil, South Africa, China, Germany and the
United States of America, increasingly turning these
markets towards alternate energy sources.

High-latitude, high-income and high-tech countries
are comparatively less impacted, either due to
contained climate impacts for now, or leveraging of
rapid innovation to address food and water security
challenges.18 Free-flowing global supply chains have
helped distribute the overall hit to food production
levels, but the most resource-insecure countries are
those vulnerable to two prolonged crises: debt and
climate change. Given the extended capital flight
earlier in the decade, and without the fiscal space to
speed up adaptation measures (see Chapter 1.2,
Economic downturn), these countries have become
even more heavily import-dependent, unable to scale
food production to meet the demands of population
growth, given water stress and deteriorated soil
conditions.
Green-energy supply is also at risk. Companies
mining critical metals and minerals in water-stressed
regions face regular interruptions to operations or
closures, or are forced to invest in water sources that
do not directly compete with human consumption,
partially exacerbating shortages, as described in
Resource collaboration. This elevates commodity
prices further, slowing the roll-out of green energy
infrastructure. In parallel, the frequency and severity
of heatwaves and droughts has forced green energy
sources – biofuels, hydropower and nuclear – into
periodic production cuts, and some are on the verge
of becoming stranded assets. Electrical supply has
been destabilized in the near-term for many countries,

weather patterns, dry and wet precipitation extremes,
and shifts to the distribution of insects, pests and
diseases.14 Agricultural output in the United States
of America has declined overall due to decreased
production of rice, corn, soy and wheat.15 Russian
agricultural yields have fallen in the country’s most
productive southern regions and have not been
fully balanced by the expansion of arable land in the
country’s north, where soils remain less productive.16
Climate change has reduced rice, wheat and
corn yields by 8% in China.17 Without focused
conservation and restoration efforts, ocean warming
and acidification has caused broadscale declines in
aquaculture and fisheries, threatening not only food
security but also livelihoods in some of the most
climate-exposed countries.

Even in the absence of geopolitically fuelled shocks
or constraints, continued price pressures on food,
water and energy have resulted in an elongated
cost-of-living crisis in selected markets, ushering in
wage strikes, violent protests and state instability.
Socioeconomic impacts have also begun to spread
to more advanced economies, with a risk of partial
deindustrialization caused by combined energy-water
shortages. The shutdown of waterborne transport
of trade is more regularly disrupting global supply
chains, placing pressure on road and rail transports
and dampening global economic growth.19 Energyand water-intensive strategic industries, such as
semiconductor manufacturing, located in resourceinsecure areas, have become new geopolitical
hotspots, raising the risk of prolonged disputes and
possible conflicts.

Slow climate action

In this future, there is accelerated climate action by
2030 (y-axis) but global powers are aiming for selfsufficiency in key resources, leaving many emerging
and developing countries comparatively exposed.
Heightened geopolitical confrontation is focused
in the most geographically concentrated resource:
metals and minerals (x-axis).
In anticipation of a deteriorating geopolitical
environment, self-sufficiency in sources of food
production has been scaled up in countries that
can afford it, alongside a focus on adaptation,
as considered in Resource collaboration. Food
productivity has been enhanced, in part via
technology, such as gene editing of crops, even in
the absence of extensive multilateral cooperation on
such technology. A sharper focus on productivity
of existing farmlands, dietary shifts and reductions
in food loss and waste are being utilized as levers.
Efficiency in agricultural practices, land-use and food
systems have allowed some countries to decouple
food security and biodiversity trends, partially
addressing the estimated 33% of global food
production previously wasted through unsustainable
production and consumption.
While this has led to enhanced food production

overall in many advanced economies, the benefits
have not been widely shared, with significant
divergence in the level of food security between
countries. Even as some global trade in protein has
continued, shortages and higher prices have hit
lower socioeconomic groups, and developing and
emerging countries the hardest, particularly those
least able to scale food production in the absence
of international support. This includes parts of
Africa, Central and South America, Small Island
Developing States (SIDS) and South Asia, where
many economies have faced nearly decade-long
triple crises: debt, population growth and climate
change. Global poverty, climate-sensitive livelihood
crises, malnutrition and diet-related diseases,
state instability and involuntary migration have all
risen, elongating and spreading the instability and
humanitarian crises described in Chapter 1.2,
Cost-of-living crisis.
Critical metals and minerals are a key area of
geopolitical confrontation due to their geographic
concentration. These resources are not only
essential to renewable energy capture, storage
and efficiency, but also continue to be leveraged
for a wide range of other industrial applications,
including technological and military end-uses (Figure
3.4).21 Indium is part of touch screens as well as
solar panels; lithium compounds are utilized by
the pharmaceutical industry; cobalt has multiple
aerospace applications but is also of increasing
interest as a catalyst for green hydrogen production;
and vanadium is used as an input for industrial-scale
batteries as well as a steel alloy in nuclear reactors,
space vehicles and aircraft carriers. The resulting
demand-supply gap described in Resource
collaboration is exacerbated in this future because
of geopolitical rivalries, exposing the brittleness of
global supply chains with limited opportunities for

geographic diversification. For example, in the early
half of the 2020s, the United States was 100%
net import-reliant for 14 critical minerals, including
gallium, natural graphite, indium and vanadium.22
At the time, China was the leading producer for
16 of the 32 strategic minerals, including the
aforementioned resources, representing 98%, 82%,
58% and 66%, respectively, of the world’s total
production.23
With a trend towards remilitarization (see Chapter
2.4: Human security), these strategic resources
have become one of the primary fronts of economic
warfare over the latter half of the decade. Despite
competing fiscal priorities, more states have sought
to diversify supply through domestic extraction
where available, although many face environmental
constraints outlined in Resource collaboration.
Enhanced capacity in processing and refining
has been targeted in particular by states with
limited resource reserves (Figure 3.5). Resilience,
particularly for import-reliant markets, has partially
translated into redundancies, with the building of
stockpiles of key materials exacerbating supply
crises. Inbound investment screening – which only
advanced economies have been able to afford
the opportunity cost – has been expanded to
mining and related industries to minimize foreign
interference. Other countries have followed the
lead of Canada, ordering certain foreign companies
to unwind investments in mining due to the
perceived threats to national security.24 With limited
options, outbound investment screening is now
being contemplated by import-reliant markets
as a potential lever, although most major powers
continue to leverage increasingly state-directed
investment in emerging export markets across Latin
America and Africa as a means of securing access
to these resources.

The importance and influence of allied blocs have
grown, with countries building and favouring
domestic and “trusted” supply chains in their search
for resource security. The geographic distribution
of numerous metals and minerals has ensured a
degree of mutual interdependence. For example,
Brazil has scaled lithium, rare earth elements and
nickel production, but has remained dependent
on others for refining and on neighbours for other
resources such as copper and cobalt.26 The EU and
Canada have continued their Strategic Partnership
on Raw Materials, extending the scope of the
agreement beyond the development and financing
of critical mineral projects to increased collaboration
on related technologies.27
Yet resource nationalism has also driven cracks
in existing alliances – becoming the next Airbus
vs. Boeing – with disputes arising first around the
application of state aid to boost domestic mining
and processing industries. The expanding use of
the national security exemption at the WTO has also
increasingly paralysed multilateral trade mechanisms,
rendering them ineffective in addressing geopolitical
confrontation in a world where local resilience and
security is prioritized over comparative advantage
and efficiency. Bilateral mechanisms are elevated in
importance as the primary vehicle for disputes.

Shortages artificially inflated by geoeconomic rivalries
and price volatility, including of related products such
as batteries and semiconductors, have reverberated
throughout the supply chains of multiple industries.
Shorter supply chains reflecting geopolitical alliances
have ensued. State intervention has become more
common and stringent, with government planning
directly and indirectly allocating available resources
for prioritised industries; some followed Mexico’s
suit by renationalizing assets associated with key
metals and minerals.28 Multiple “civilian” sectors
have been forced to adapt to greater cross-industry
competition. For example, Tesla built a lithium
refinery in the United States of America,29 and an
uptick in offtake agreements have quickly spiralled
into direct investments and more vertical integration,
creating fresh challenges for competitiveness
regulations.
A number of developing and emerging markets
have become net beneficiaries of this heightened
interest of both the public and private sector,
including Indonesia, Morocco and the lithium
triangle of Plurinational State of Bolivia, Argentina
and Chile. However, these countries have had to
walk a tightrope as global powers exert control
through trade, investment and technological ties and
seek to constrain access by rival states. Alongside
enhanced nationalization, this has led to the relatively
Global Risks Report 2023 64

recent creation of OMEC: an organization of mineral
exporting countries, similar to OPEC.30 While the
resource boom has offered a path to growth for
some of these countries, for others the focus
on these assets has created a “Dutch Disease”
phenomenon, or led to increased corruption,
inequality, violence and humanitarian crises.31
Further, illicit activities and the risk of accidental or
intentional escalation into hot warfare over resources
has risen, particularly in the border zones and global
commons. Export constraints on minerals have
placed upwards pressure on broader international
governance and enforcement mechanisms that
oversee new exploration zones – including those
relating to mining in international waters, polar
regions and in space. As the hunt for new mineral
sources turns to the ocean, national marine
jurisdictions are increasingly contentious, with a
growing proportion of territory under dispute.32

resulted in even more emissions, including the very
potent methane. Intensive and inefficient farming has
exacerbated soil degradation, water stress, pollution
and the decline in production capacity. This has
created broader domestic trade-offs, particularly with
sectors directly dependent on biological resources,
with knock-on impacts for economic growth and
productivity and the speed of the green transition.
Arable land has been increasingly prioritized for
agriculture, shifting away from biofuels and green
energy infrastructure.

Slow climate action

By 2030, investment in adaptation measures has
not kept pace with climate impacts to date (y-axis).
At the same time, geopolitical dynamics have turned
the natural resource crisis from one of affordability
to one of availability (x-axis), creating a cascading
economic, environmental and humanitarian crisis in
all but a handful of select countries – but even these
remain exposed through cross-border effects. In this
future, the resulting socioeconomic fall-out exceeds
the scope and scale of all other futures, and state
intervention turns even more aggressive, expanding
beyond economic confrontation to secure supply of
necessities for populations.
Building on Resource constraints, both affordability
and availability concerns are widening inequality.
Reflecting Resource competition, self-sufficient
sources of food production have been scaled
up, but with limited sharing of innovation and
financing, the tipping point of overall productivity
growth in agriculture has already passed. Without
effective policy, financing and technological support
for adaptation practices, lower socioeconomic
communities and countries have resorted to changes
in crop choice and large shifts in land-use patterns to
maintain current production growth.33 Agriculture has
become an even larger driver of global emissions.
Land-clearance for crops and grazing have led
to deforestation, and an increase in livestock has

Similar to Resource constraints, water stress
is now widespread. In developing countries, this
particularly impacts women and girls responsible
for water collection, with knock-on impacts for
health and education outcomes. More widespread
scarcity, combined with paralysis of international
cooperation mechanisms, has necessitated a degree
of water nationalism, resulting in prolonged disputes
between neighbouring countries.34 In the face of
spreading humanitarian crises and state instability,
water infrastructure continues to be used both as
a weapon and target, mirroring past water conflicts
and terrorism in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.35 In
addition, there is less visible abuse and depletion of
shared “non-renewable” groundwater reserves, such
as in Saharan Africa and the Middle East, raising the
risk of conflict.36
Conditions of scarcity initially consolidated the
influence of geopolitical blocs, heavily reflecting raw
resource trade dependences, as well as innovation
and information flows. Increasingly however, distrust
between global powers is artificially exacerbating
supply crises on a global scale. Beyond Resource
competition, all three resources are weaponized
by resource-rich countries where possible, as
both offensive and defensive tools in a more
zero-sum geopolitical environment (see Chapter
1.2, Economic warfare). In this world, the export
of resources will soon supplant investment as a
measure of global soft power, although economic
Global Risks Report 2023 65

power will continue to be leveraged to achieve
strategic objectives by more subtle, indirect means.
Facing actual or perceived shortages, states
continue to quickly and regularly exercise control
over key resources to protect their own population,
which will fracture alliances, deepen conditions of
scarcity, and result in escalating trade tensions that
restrict the flow of climate technologies. Exposed on
multiple fronts, state intervention grows in a broader
range of industries, including renationalization of
industries.
Confrontations regularly extend beyond the
economic sphere. Transboundary conflicts and
violence have become more common as one of
the few ways in which states can secure supply
of strategic resources. Hotspots reflect shifts to
biodiversity patterns, heightened competition over
terrestrial and marine foodstocks, and the pressing
need for metals and minerals that underpin secure
energy and technological development. Food,

energy and water insecurity becomes a driver of
social polarisation, civil unrest and political instability
in advanced and developing economies alike. It also
becomes a driver for cross-border terrorism, with
devastating impacts given the proliferation of hightech weaponry (see Chapter 2.4: Human security).
In this future, there has been little incentive – or
fiscal room – to invest in climate change and
environmental protection. Overexploitation and
pollution – the tragedy of the global commons –
has expanded, but continues to go unpunished
or undiscovered, and existing agreements and
regulations are regularly breached or not enforced.
Famine has returned at a scale not seen in the
last century. The sheer scale of humanitarian and
environmental crises showcases broader paralysis
and ineffectiveness of key multilateral mechanisms
in addressing crises facing the global order,
spiralling downwards into a self-perpetuating and
compounding polycrises.

Global Risks Report 2023

Conclusion: is preparedness possible?

Conclusion:
is preparedness possible?
While ongoing shocks unfold, the world stands
at a crossroads. As we enter a low-growth, lowinvestment and low-cooperation era, the actions that
we take today will dictate our future risk landscape.
We must ensure that addressing current crises does
not detract from the longer-term view.
Recent and current events such as COVID-19
and the cost-of-living crisis are steadily eroding
economic, educational and health-related gains
in a widening proportion of the population, with
a growing divergence between advanced and
developing countries. This in turn is interacting with
a multiplicity of environmental and geopolitical risks
– climate change, ecosystem collapse, multi-domain
conflicts – to further threaten the security and
stability of societies around the world.
In this context, defensive, fragmented and crisisoriented approaches are short-sighted and often
perpetuate vicious cycles. Lack of preparedness
for longer-term risks will destabilize the global risks
landscape further, bringing ever tougher trade-offs
for policy-makers and business leaders scrambling
to address simultaneous crises. A rigorous approach
to foresight and preparedness is called for, as we
aim to bolster our resilience to longer-term risks and
chart a path forward to a more prosperous world.
Each risk requires concerted, specific and
customized efforts but several cross-cutting
principles can support preparedness across themes.
In this concluding section, we outline four principles
for preparedness in this new era of concurrent
shocks: 1) strengthening risk identification and
foresight, 2) recalibrating the present value of “future”
risks, 3) investing in multi-domain risk preparedness,
and 4) strengthening preparedness and response
cooperation.

Improving risk identification
and foresight
A wide range of disciplines aim to gather intelligence
about the future, ranging from economics, business
management, investment funds and insurance,
to urban planning, climatology, virology and civil
protection – but the track record around the use of
foresight to enhance risk mitigation efforts remains

mixed. The underestimation of – and therefore lack
of preparedness for – emerging macro risks (like
“grey rhinos” and “black swans”) reflect challenges
posed by high levels of uncertainty, low levels of
information, conflicting data and cognitive biases.
Yet systematic progress is possible. Enhanced risk
identification and foresight can be a key enabler
for strategic decision-making, agenda-setting and
resilience measures, helping to prioritize areas that
would benefit from data collection and monitoring,
risk controls and resources, and redundancies.
The first task of foresight is to identify future
developments, risks and opportunities. Both horizon
scanning and scenario planning are useful tools
that can examine and build on “weak signals” in
qualitative and quantitative data sources to better
anticipate emerging trends. Established methods
can help crystallize expert disagreements,1 while a
greater distinction between risk and uncertainty –
imperfect knowledge, such that likelihood cannot be
scientifically quantified or known – will help challenge
core assumptions. Greater levels of uncertainty
should shift the focus from the probable to the
possible: the study of potential outcomes needs
to be expanded to ensure that risk mitigation and
preparedness addresses the full scope of possible
impacts.2 This is then complemented by risk
monitoring, which focuses on providing early warning
for when specific risks are about to materialize to
enable advanced preparedness measures.
Another step to enhance risk foresight is to explore
dynamics of change, to map interconnections
between risks, including dependencies between
critical systems. More sophisticated methods
of analyzing interconnected risks (beyond linear
relationships) can support the evaluation and
prioritization of risk resources. Risks that are most
influenced by or exposed to other risks will be the
most challenging to mitigate, while those that exert
an outsized influence on the outcome of the network
can be prioritized as key points of intervention. The
need for a systemic view of and approach to global
risks is reflected in the rising call for the appointment
of National Risk and Resilience Officers, to mirror the
increasingly important role of the Chief Risk Officer
in the private sector. While the mandate of this role
may vary in practice, it reflects the need for a crosscutting and whole-of-society view around external
risk foresight, mitigation and crisis management.3
Global Risks Report 2023 69

Rethinking ‘future’ risks
Cognitive biases channel public attention towards
recent, “catastrophic” events. Business and
political imperatives tend to prioritize risks with
a direct, immediate and localized impact, such
as food, fuel or other commodities’ shortages or
local environmental disasters. This is necessary to

FIGURE 4.1

manage crises, especially when millions of lives and
livelihoods are at risk. However, when such risks
manifest, resources and attention are often diverted
from addressing global risks, especially those that
form the root causes of local catastrophes or those
that may arise outside the time frames relevant to
today’s leaders.
This can skew preparedness efforts in the public

and private sector alike. For better planning and
preparedness, institutions must de-anchor risk
prioritization from shorter-term incentives. Despite
regularly featuring in the top rankings, the most
severe global risks – pertaining particularly to climate
and nature – are those we are still the least prepared
for. The majority of GRPS respondents assessed
existing measures to prevent or prepare for the
Failure to mitigate climate change, Failure of
climate-change adaptation, and Biodiversity loss
and ecosystem collapse as ineffective or highly
ineffective (Figure 4.1). Similarly, most respondents
considered preparedness to be inadequate for
Misinformation and disinformation, Erosion
of social cohesion and societal polarization,
Involuntary migration and Cost-of-living crisis.
The growing global awareness of these risks is clear,
but further action will likely continue to be stymied,
given perceived shorter-term and localized crises
and trade-offs. Without minimizing the need for an
effective response, the over-prioritization of current
challenges can quickly descend into a doom-loop
of continuous global shocks, whereby resources
are absorbed by crisis management, rather than
directed to preparedness for future risks. Complex
challenges cannot be solely solved by short-term
decision-making – and yet long-term thinking alone
is insufficient in the face of currently unfolding crises.
To break the cycle, business leaders and policymakers need to embrace complexity and adopt a
dual vision that more effectively balances current
crisis management with a longer-term lens. For
example, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,
governments will not only need to target resources
to stabilize distressed healthcare systems, but at
the same time work to ensure that environments
conducive to zoonotic disease spread are
adequately monitored, gain-of-function research
is regulated, and that synthesis requests to biolaboratories are screened to prevent future outbreaks
from natural spillovers, accidents and threat actors.4

Investing in multi-domain,
cross-sector risk preparedness

longer-term, multi-domain resilience. Not all global
risks pose a preparedness trade-off, and solutions
that address both current needs and future risks
can rebalance the cost-benefit ratio for necessary
investment. For example, investment in health and
education, key tenets of managing present needs
in all societies as well as longer-term human capital
and economic development, strengthens societal
resilience to multiple shocks and risks including
climate change.
Additionally, many global risks have the potential to
impact economies and societies in an analogous
way, with similar consequences. For example,
cyberattacks, social unrest or extreme weather
could each cause the outage of critical information
infrastructure; or, on a more catastrophic scale,
volcanic eruptions and war may disrupt food
security.5 Strengthening resilience efforts in critical
areas therefore pays off in all scenarios and improves
preparedness for a multiplicity of risks, both known
and unknown, and short and long term.

In addition, actions taken to address current
challenges should, at a minimum, avoid exacerbating
future risks, such as the potential trade-off between
food security, nature loss and climate change.
Recent crises have seen an extraordinary level
of fiscal intervention to protect individuals and
companies from the financial impacts of crises –
from the COVID-19 pandemic to energy prices.
While necessary and perhaps unavoidable in the
circumstances at hand, it remains to be seen how
significantly these rapid, large-scale actions will
result in debt sustainability concerns and how widely
they distracted decision-makers from other risks
highlighted in this report.

Following recent shocks – the pandemic, inflation,
war, among others – national governments are
increasingly focusing on addressing vulnerabilities
in critical systems, including potential disruptions to
food, water, shelter, basic communication services
and public safety, and developing multi-domain
responses. A bill has been introduced in the United
States of America to form an interagency committee
to assess all global catastrophic risks over the next
30 years and develop strategies to ensure continuity
of operations and critical infrastructure if these risks
arise.6 In addition, the UK Government is developing
a tool to measure socioeconomic resilience to key
civil contingencies risks, to provide a more nuanced,
data-driven view on how risks impact across different
communities and groups.7

Conversely, many shorter-term actions can also act
as wider stabilizers, embedding and accelerating

As global risks become more intertwined,
preparedness also needs to become more of a

shared responsibility between sectors, with local
and national governments, business and civil society
each playing to their strengths, rather than traditional
models of governments addressing market failures
when they occur.8 For example, private-public
partnerships can help close key gaps in innovation,
financing, governance and implementation of
preparedness measures for emerging and wellestablished risks, such as food and water insecurity,
weakened education and healthcare systems, and
insufficient regulation of dual-use technologies, or
addressing the looming insurance gap relating to
cyberwarfare.9 Innovative collaborations can also
minimize overall exposure to potential impacts, as
organizations across geographies and sectors are
rarely exposed to the same risks at the same time.
For example, data centres of different institutions
in differing geographies are highly unlikely to be
exposed to the same cyber or extreme weather
risks, meaning effective mitigation could include
regular backups of each other’s systems.10

Re-building and strengthening
global risk preparedness
cooperation
While national risk preparedness can enhance the
ability of societies and economies to rebound from
shocks, most global risks are ‘owned’ by no one
and sit outside the direct control of any one public
or private sector entity – meaning many global risks
are most effectively tackled through coordinated,
global action. Respondents to the GRPS shared their
views on which stakeholders were best prepared
to tackle the key risks covered in the survey (Figure
4.1). The majority consider national governments,
multi-country efforts and international organizations
to be the most relevant stakeholders for governing
these global risks – recognizing that global risks are
complex, and effective preparedness can require
action at local, national, regional and global levels.
International cooperation has reached levels that
may have been unimaginable even a century ago.
However, the recent overload of crises has turned the
focus of nations inwards and the emerging outlook
for international cooperation is deteriorating. Actions
taken to shore up national resilience can be selfperpetuating. For example, stockpiling and export
controls can directly exacerbate global shortages
and position trade, financial and technological
dependencies as a strategic vulnerability, spurring
further disintegration. Similarly, the pursuit of
domestic and global security goals may have
unintended consequences for the geopolitical

landscape, leading to spiralling distrust, declining
safeguards against mutually assured economic
destruction, and currency and technological tools
that are less influential. Even areas traditionally
open to collaboration, such as international climate
research, are under threat. For example, data
regarding Russia’s boreal forests –the biggest landbased carbon store on the planet – is no longer
available for international scientific research because
of the war in Ukraine.11
International organizations will continue to play
an essential role in global preparedness, even as
they face significant headwinds that risk degrading
the guardrails in place to address well-established
issues. There have been numerous examples of the
politicization and partial paralysis of key international
mechanisms and organizations in recent crises.
These pressures may impede the development
of meaningful norms and agreements required to
mitigate emerging global risks – from the proliferation
of military technologies to governing the global
commons. Re-invigorating multilateral processes and
organizations is critical to the future of preparing for
and managing global risks.
Additionally, specific cooperation at sectoral, bilateral
and regional levels will become even more important
in this environment. Robust data exchange and
collaborative monitoring processes have already
been established for some global risks (natural
disasters, extreme weather events and terrorist
attacks, among others). Further, open-source data
and scenario development have helped increase
the effectiveness of individual risk responses, such
as the extensive work undertaken by the IPCC
to develop a range of climate scenarios that has
improved understanding, informed decarbonization
strategies and allowed for collective alignment on
science-based targets. However, efforts are more
nascent or non-existent in other areas, such as the
long-term trajectory and impact of transformative AI.
Greater collaboration across industries and between
countries – in terms of coordinated funding, research
and data sharing – is critical to help identify weak
signals of emerging threats at both a national and
global level.
In a complex risks outlook, there must be a better
balance between national preparedness and
global cooperation. We need to act together, to
shape a pathway out of cascading crises and build
collective preparedness to the next global shock,
whatever form it might take. Leaders must embrace
complexity and act on a balanced vision to create a
stronger, prosperous shared future.

of an event or condition which, if it occurs, would
negatively impact a significant proportion of global
GDP, population or natural resources.

To ensure legibility, the names of some of the global
risks have been abbreviated in the figures.
The portion of the full name used in the abbreviation
is in bold.

Table A.1 presents the list of 32 global risks and
definitions adopted in the Global Risks Perception
Survey 2022-2023.

Technical notes
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the
World Economic Forum’s source of original risks
data, harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s
extensive network of academic, business,
government, civil society and thought leaders.
Survey responses were collected from 7 September
to 5 October 2022 from the World Economic
Forum’s multistakeholder communities.

Updates to the GRPS 2022-2023
The list of 32 global risks included in the survey was
updated in 2022.

modified and/or expanded to reflect new ways in
which the risks may materialize and the potential
adverse outcomes they may cause. However, to
ensure comparability over time, although names and
definitions were modified, the fundamental concept
of each risk has remained consistent with that of
previous versions of the survey.

Methodology
The GRPS 2022–2023 was further refined this year
to gather more granular perceptions of risk and to
incorporate new approaches to risk management
and analysis. The GRPS 2022–2023 was comprised
of six sections:
1.

Outlook for the World asked respondents to
characterize their outlook for the world over
the short term (two years) and the long term
(10 years). Respondents were provided with
five options: (1) Progressive tipping points
and persistent crises leading to catastrophic
outcomes, (2) Consistently volatile across
economies and industries with multiple shocks
accentuating divergent trajectories, (3) Slightly
volatile with occasional localized surprises,
(4) Limited volatility with relative stability, and
(5) Renewed stability with a revival of global
resilience. A simple tally for each of the five
options was calculated. The result is illustrated
in Figure 1.10.

2.

Currently Manifesting Risks asked

Two new risks were added in response to observed
economic, geopolitical and environmental trends:
1. “Cost-of-living crisis”
2. “Misinformation and disinformation”
In addition, “Climate action failure” was delineated
into two separate risks:
1.

“Failure of climate-change adaption”

2.

“Failure to mitigate climate change”

The names and definitions of the remaining risks
have been revised and, where applicable, merged,

respondents to rank the top five risks among
14 pre-selected risks in order of how severe
they believe their impact will be on a global
level in 2023. The final rank is the average rank
estimated by the respondents, weighted by
the number of respondents who selected the
particular risk. Options included: Continued
waves of COVID-19, Cost-of-living crisis,
Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure,
Debt crisis, Deployment of chemical and
biological weapons on a catastrophic scale,
Deployment of nuclear weapons on a
catastrophic scale, Disruptions in global
supply chains for non-food goods, Energy
supply crisis, Failure to set and meet
national net-zero targets, Food supply crisis,
Rising inflation, Structural failures in health
systems, Weakening of human rights, and
Weaponization of economic policy such as
sanctions and trade controls. To ensure legibility,
the names of some of the global risks have
been abbreviated in the figures. The portion of
the full name used in the abbreviation is in bold.
The result is illustrated in Figure 1.1.

into account any mechanism in place to prevent
the risk from occurring or prepare to mitigate
its impact. The respondent was provided 10
randomly selected global risks, and was asked
to rate current effectiveness based on five
options: (1) Highly ineffective, (2) Ineffective, (3)
Indeterminate effectiveness, (4) Effective, and (5)
Highly effective. A simple tally of the number of
times a risk was identified on each level of the
five-point effectiveness scale was calculated on
this basis. The result is illustrated in Figure 4.1.
Respondents were then asked to identify
up to three stakeholders who can effectively
manage the most severe risks identified in
Section 3. Respondents could choose among
the following eight entities: local government,
national government, bilateral, multi-country,
regional, international organization, businesses,
public-private cooperation. A simple tally of the
number of times a stakeholder was identified as
effective was calculated on this basis. The result
is illustrated in Figure 4.1.
6.

3.

Global Severity 2 Years and 10 Years asked
respondents to estimate the likely impact
(severity) for each of the 32 global risks, on a
1-7 scale [1 – Low severity, 7 – High severity],
over both a two-year and 10-year period.
Respondents were asked to evaluate the
severity, considering the impact on populations,
GDP or environmental resources on a global
scale. They were also allowed to nominate
any other risk considered missing from the 32
global risks. A simple average based on the
scores selected was calculated. The results are
illustrated in Figure 1.2 and Figure 2.1.

4.

Global Risks Consequences seeks to
understand of the potential consequences of
risks, to create a network map of the global
risk landscape. Respondents were provided
10 randomly selected global risks (from the full
list of 32 global risks), and were then asked
to select up to five global risks (from the full
list) likely to be triggered by each of the 10
risks materializing. In visual results, “Nodes:
Risk influence” is based on a simple tally of
all bidirectional relationships identified by
respondents. “Edges: Relative influence” is
based on a simple tally of the number of times
the risk was identified as a consequence.
However, visual do not show all connections:
weaker relationships identified by less than 25%
of respondents were not included as edges.
"Employment crises" was not offered as a
randomly selected risk, and is shown only as a
consequence. “Prolonged economic downturn”
was not offered as a consequence, and is only
shown as a cause.

5.

Risk Preparedness and Governance
asked respondents to indicate the current
effectiveness of risk management across
economies and multiple stakeholders, taking

Future Outlook for the World captured the
respondents’ outlook on global cooperation
over the next 10 years. Respondents were
asked to select from among three options:
(1) Broad-base convergence to a multilateral
rules-based order, (2) Fractures between
competing economies which consolidate into
blocs and new structures for cooperation,
and (3) Wide-scale division of economies into
competing blocks with divergent standards,
values and paradigms with limited collaboration.
A simple tally for each of the three options was
calculated.
