Note: Global risks may not be strictly comparable across years, as definitions and the set of global risks have evolved with new issues emerging on the 10-year horizon. For example, cyberattacks, income disparity and unemployment entered
the set of global risks in 2012. Some global risks were reclassified: water crises and rising income disparity were re-categorized first as societal risks and then as a trend in the 2015 and 2016 Global Risks Reports, respectively. The 2006 edition

Preface

As in previous years, the analysis
contained in this Report builds on the
annual Global Risks Perception Survey,
completed by almost 750 members of
the World Economic Forum’s global
multistakeholder community.

The year 2016 has seen profound
shifts in the way we view global risks.
Societal polarization, income inequality
and the inward orientation of countries
are spilling over into real-world politics.
Through recent electoral results in G7
countries, these trends are set to have
a lasting impact on the way economies
act and relate to each other. They are
also likely to affect global risks and the
interconnections between them.
Against the background of these
developments, this year’s Global Risks
Report explores five gravity centres
that will shape global risks. First,
continued slow growth combined with
high debt and demographic change
creates an environment that favours
financial crises and growing inequality.
At the same time, pervasive corruption,
short-termism and unequal distribution
of the benefits of growth suggest that
the capitalist economic model may not
be delivering for people. The transition
towards a more multipolar world order
is putting global cooperation under
strain. At the same time, the Fourth
Industrial Revolution is fundamentally
transforming societies, economies,
and ways of doing business. Last but
not least, as people seek to reassert
identities that have been blurred by
globalization, decision-making is
increasingly influenced by emotions.
In addition to these gravity centres, this
year’s Global Risks Report presents
deep-dive discussions of risks posed
by ongoing political and societal
transformations, including challenges
to democracy, closing space for civil
society, and outmoded social
protection systems. It also discusses
risks related to emerging technologies
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and
the associated governance challenges.

The Global Risks Report 2017

The year 2017 will present a pivotal
moment for the global community. The
threat of a less cooperative, more
inward-looking world also creates the
opportunity to address global risks and
the trends that drive them. This will
require responsive and responsible
leadership with a deeper commitment
to inclusive development and equitable
growth, both nationally and globally. It
will also require collaboration across
multiple interconnected systems,
countries, areas of expertise, and
stakeholder groups with the aim of
having a greater societal impact. We
hope that The Global Risks Report
2017 and the subsequent deliberations
at the World Economic Forum’s Annual
Meeting 2017 will contribute to a
debate about pragmatic solutions.

Executive
Summary

For over a decade, The Global Risks
Report has focused attention on the
evolution of global risks and the deep
interconnections between them. The
Report has also highlighted the
potential of persistent, long-term trends
such as inequality and deepening
social and political polarization to
exacerbate risks associated with, for
example, the weakness of the
economic recovery and the speed of
technological change. These trends
came into sharp focus during 2016,
with rising political discontent and
disaffection evident in countries across
the world. The highest-profile signs of
disruption may have come in Western
countries – with the United Kingdom’s
vote to leave the European Union and
President-elect Donald Trump’s victory
in the US presidential election – but
across the globe there is evidence of a
growing backlash against elements of
the domestic and international status
quo.

The Global Risks
Landscape
One of the key inputs to the analysis of
The Global Risks Report is the Global
Risks Perception Survey (GRPS), which
brings together diverse perspectives
from various age groups, countries and
sectors: business, academia, civil
society and government.
This year’s findings are testament to
five key challenges that the world now
faces. The first two are in the economic
category, in line with the fact that rising
income and wealth disparity is rated by
GRPS respondents as the most
important trend in determining global
developments over the next 10 years.
This points to the need for reviving
economic growth, but the growing
mood of anti-establishment populism
suggests we may have passed the
stage where this alone would remedy
fractures in society: reforming market
capitalism must also be added to the
agenda.
With the electoral surprises of 2016 and
the rise of once-fringe parties stressing
national sovereignty and traditional
values across Europe and beyond, the
societal trends of increasing
polarization and intensifying national
sentiment are ranked among the top
6

Global Risks 2015

five. Hence the next challenge: facing
up to the importance of identity and
community. Rapid changes of
attitudes in areas such as gender,
sexual orientation, race,
multiculturalism, environmental
protection and international cooperation
have led many voters – particularly the
older and less-educated ones – to feel
left behind in their own countries. The
resulting cultural schisms are testing
social and political cohesion and may
amplify many other risks if not resolved.
Although anti-establishment politics
tends to blame globalization for
deteriorating domestic job prospects,
evidence suggests that managing
technological change is a more
important challenge for labour markets.
While innovation has historically created
new kinds of jobs as well as destroying
old kinds, this process may be slowing.
It is no coincidence that challenges to
social cohesion and policy-makers’
legitimacy are coinciding with a highly
disruptive phase of technological
change.
The fifth key challenge is to protect
and strengthen our systems of
global cooperation. Examples are
mounting of states seeking to withdraw
from various international cooperation
mechanisms. A lasting shift in the
global system from an outward-looking
to a more inward-looking stance would
be a highly disruptive development. In
numerous areas – not least the ongoing
crisis in Syria and the migration flows it
has created – it is ever clearer how
important global cooperation is on the
interconnections that shape the risk
landscape.
Further challenges requiring global
cooperation are found in the
environmental category, which this year
stands out in the GRPS. Over the
course of the past decade, a cluster of
environment-related risks – notably
extreme weather events and failure of
climate change mitigation and
adaptation as well as water crises – has
emerged as a consistently central
feature of the GRPS risk landscape,
strongly interconnected with many
other risks, such as conflict and
migration. This year, environmental
concerns are more prominent than
ever, with all five risks in this category
assessed as being above average for
both impact and likelihood.

Social and Political
Challenges

Managing the Fourth
Industrial Revolution

After the electoral shocks of the last
year, many are asking whether the
crisis of mainstream political parties in
Western democracies also represents
a deeper crisis with democracy itself.
The first of three “risks in focus”
considered in Part 2 of the Report
assesses three related reasons to think
so: the impacts of rapid economic and
technological change; the deepening of
social and cultural polarization; and the
emergence of “post-truth” political
debate. These challenges to the
political process bring into focus policy
questions such as how to make
economic growth more inclusive and
how to reconcile growing identity
nationalism with diverse societies.

The final part of this Report explores
the relationship between global risks
and the emerging technologies of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). We
face a pressing governance
challenge if we are to construct the
rules, norms, standards, incentives,
institutions and other mechanisms that
are needed to shape the development
and deployment of these technologies.
How to govern fast-developing
technologies is a complex question:
regulating too heavily too quickly can
hold back progress, but a lack of
governance can exacerbate risks as
well as creating unhelpful uncertainty
for potential investors and innovators.

The second risk in focus also relates to
the functioning of society and politics: it
looks at how civil society organizations
and individual activists are increasingly
experiencing government crackdowns
on civic space, ranging from
restrictions on foreign funding to
surveillance of digital activities and even
physical violence. Although the stated
aim of such measures is typically to
protect against security threats, the
effects have been felt by academic,
philanthropic and humanitarian entities
and have the potential to erode social,
political and economic stability.
An issue underlying the rise of
disaffection with the political and
economic status quo is that social
protection systems are at breaking
point. The third risk in focus analyses
how the underfunding of state systems
is coinciding with the decline of
employer-backed social protection
schemes; this is happening while
technological change means stable,
long-term jobs are giving way to
self-employment in the “gig economy”.
The chapter suggests some of the
innovations that will be needed to fill the
gaps that are emerging in our social
protection systems as individuals
shoulder greater responsibility for costs
associated with economic and social
risks such as unemployment,
exclusion, sickness, disability and old
age.

Currently, the governance of emerging
technologies is patchy: some are
regulated heavily, others hardly at all
because they do not fit under the remit
of any existing regulatory body.
Respondents to the GRPS saw two
emerging technologies as being most
in need of better governance:
biotechnologies – which tend to be
highly regulated, but in a slow-moving
way – and artificial intelligence (AI) and
robotics, a space that remains only
lightly governed. A chapter focusing on
the risks associated with AI
considers the potential risks associated
with letting greater decision-making
powers move from humans to AI
programmes, as well as the debate
about whether and how to prepare for
the possible development of machines
with greater general intelligence than
humans.
The Report concludes by assessing
the risks associated with how
technology is reshaping physical
infrastructure: greater
interdependence among different
infrastructure networks is increasing
the scope for systemic failures –
whether from cyberattacks, software
glitches, natural disasters or other
causes – to cascade across networks
and affect society in unanticipated
ways.

The Global Risks Report 2017

This 12th edition of The Global
Risks Report is published at a time
of heightened political uncertainty,
following a year of unexpected electoral
results, particularly in the United States
and the United Kingdom. Polarized
societies and political landscapes
are taking centre stage in many
countries, with deepening generational
and cultural divisions amplifying
the risks associated with sluggish
economic recovery and accelerating
technological change.
These tensions have been building
for some time, and over the past
10 years a nexus of social, political
and economic fragilities has been a
consistent focus of The Global Risks
Report. The events of 2016 should
serve as a wake-up call and prompt us
to reassess our preparedness in the
face of an evolving risk landscape.
While we should be wary of attributing
too much influence to a series of
very recent electoral results, the
consequences of which are still
unknown, major unexpected events
can serve as inflection points. Longterm trends – such as persistent
inequality and deepening polarization,
which ranked first and third in
perceived importance in the Global
Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) this
year – can build to a point at which
they become triggers for change. This
kind of change might involve risks
intensifying or crystallizing, but it is
important to recognize that shocks and
releases of tension might also lead to
a brightening of the risk outlook. We
are in a period of flux; paradoxically this
is therefore a time when things could
improve.
The world is undergoing multiple
complex transitions: towards a lowercarbon future; towards technological
change of unprecedented depth and
speed; towards new global economic
and geopolitical balances. Managing
these transitions and the deeply
interconnected risks they entail will
require long-term thinking, investment
and international cooperation. It will
also require policy-makers to bring
voters with them – one of the lessons
of 2016 is that we are very far from
consensus on how to proceed.

This year’s Global Risks Report takes
as its starting point the societal and
political polarization that besets an
increasing number of countries and
that looks set to be a determining
feature of the political landscape not
just for the next few years but for the
next few electoral cycles. In Part 1, the
Report draws on the trends and risks
highlighted in the latest GRPS to outline
the key challenges that the world now
faces: reviving economic growth;
reforming market capitalism; facing
up to the importance of identity and
community; managing technological
change; protecting and strengthening
our systems of global cooperation; and
deepening our efforts to protect the
environment.
Part 2 explores three social and
political risks in greater depth. The
first chapter considers whether recent
political trends amount to a crisis
of Western democracy. It looks at
underlying patterns that have led to a
weakening of democratic legitimacy
and points to three strategies that
might help to restore it. The second
piece highlights the importance of civil
society in mitigating risks and assesses
trends towards the curtailment of
civil society organizations’ freedom
to operate. The final chapter in this
part of the Report looks at one of the
gravest long-term challenges facing
the world: how to build systems of
social protection that can cope with the
seismic demographic, economic and
other changes that have transfigured
social structures and individual lives
over the last three decades.
Part 3 turns towards technology, which
is at once a source of disruption and
polarization and an inevitable part of
whatever responses to these trends
we choose to pursue. Informed by the
results of a special GRPS module on
emerging technologies, the urgency
of the governance challenge in this
area is stressed. This is followed by
two in-depth assessments of specific
technological risks: first, in relation to
artificial intelligence, and second, in
relation to our rapidly changing physical
infrastructure needs and vulnerabilities.

Part 1

That discontent with the current
order has now become an electionwinning proposition clearly increases
the urgency of understanding and
responding to these global risks. The
World Economic Forum has identified
five key challenges that will require
greater global attention and action:
– fostering greater solidarity and
long-term thinking in market
capitalism,

–

–

–

revitalizing global economic
growth,
recognizing the importance of
identity and inclusiveness in
healthy political communities,
mitigating the risks and exploiting
the opportunities of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, and
strengthening our systems of
global cooperation.

The remainder of Part 1 looks at
each of these challenges, drawing
on the latest Global Risks Perception
Survey (GRPS) to identify potential
trigger points that might create new
risks, exacerbate existing risks or
– an under-appreciated possibility
– provide opportunities to do things
differently in a way that mitigates risks.
Part 1 concludes with a reflection
on environmental risk, which again
stands out in the GRPS as a source
of concern, and which would be
particularly vulnerable to any loss of
momentum in global cooperation.

Economy: Growth and
Reform
Despite unprecedented levels of
peace and global prosperity, in many
countries a mood of economic malaise
has contributed to anti-establishment,
populist politics and a backlash against
globalization. The weakness of the
economic recovery following the global
financial crisis is part of this story,
but boosting growth alone would not
remedy the deeper fractures in our
political economy. More fundamental
reforms to market capitalism may
be needed to tackle, in particular, an
apparent lack of solidarity between
those at the top of national income and
wealth distributions and those further
down.
Economic concerns pervade the latest
GRPS results. This is not immediately
evident from the evolution of the topfive risks by impact and likelihood,
as illustrated in Figure 2 (inside front
cover), which shows economic risks
fading in prominence since the height
of the global financial crisis, and
missing entirely for the first time in the
latest survey. However, in addition
to asking respondents to assess the

impact and likelihood of individual risks,
the survey asks ask them to consider
the influences and interconnections
that shape the risk landscape. Here
the economy is paramount. “Growing
income and wealth disparity” is seen
by respondents as the trend most likely
to determine global developments over
the next 10 years (see Table 1.1), and
when asked to identify interconnections
between risks, the most frequently
mentioned pairing was that of
unemployment and social instability
(see Table 1.2 and Appendix A).
Table 1.1: Top 5 Trends that
Determine Global Developments

Part 3

These developments should not
surprise us. Over the past decade
The Global Risks Report has drawn
attention each year to a persistent
cluster of economic, social and
geopolitical factors that have helped
shape the global risks landscape.
In 2007 and 2008, for example,
The Global Risk Report’s rankings
showed deglobalization in advanced
economies as tied for the risk with the
highest impact; in 2011, the Report
focused on “economic disparity and
global governance failures”; in 2014
it highlighted “societal concerns
includ[ing] the breakdown of social
structures, the decline of trust in
institutions, the lack of leadership and
persisting gender inequalities”; and in
2015 it observed that “the fragility of
societies is of increasing concern” and
cautioned against excessive economic
optimism, noting that it might “reflect a
false sense of control, as history shows
that people … are often taken by
surprise by the same risks.”3

–

Part 2

Years of building pressure in many
parts of the world, at least since the
global financial crisis,1 crystallized
into dramatic political results during
2016 as public disaffection with the
status quo gained traction. In the
West, consensus expectations were
defied by the United Kingdom’s
decision to leave the European Union,
by President-elect Donald Trump’s
victory in the United States and by the
Italian electorate’s rejection of Matteo
Renzi’s constitutional reforms. The
implications of results such as these
are potentially far-reaching – some
people question whether the West has
reached a tipping point and might now
embark on a period of deglobalization.2
But the uncertainty and instability that
characterized 2016 are not Western
phenomena alone: we saw variations
of them in countries across the world,
including Brazil, the Philippines and
Turkey.

Globally, inequality between countries
has been decreasing at an accelerating
pace over the past 30 years.4 Within
some countries, however, the data tell
a different story. Inequality had been
falling consistently in the industrialized
world since the beginning of the 20th
century, but since the 1980s the
share of income going to the top 1%
has increased in the United States,
United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and
Australia (although not in Germany,
Japan, France, Sweden, Denmark or
the Netherlands).5 Reasons include
skill-biased technological change6
– which increases the returns to
education – combined with scale
effects as markets became more
interconnected, increasing global
competition for talent. Among
other things, this has led to an
increase in CEO compensation as
firms have become larger.7 Global
communications have also driven
up returns for individuals who can
successfully cater to a global audience
– what Sherwin Rosen described as
“the economics of superstars”.8

In advanced economies, the incomes
of the traditionally well-off middle
classes have grown at a comparatively
slower pace9 – and slower also than
the incomes of the emerging middle
classes of countries in Latin America,
Africa, and particularly Asia.10 The
slow pace of economic recovery since
2008 has intensified local income
disparities,11 with a more dramatic
impact on many households than
aggregate national income data would
suggest. This has contributed to antiestablishment sentiment in advanced
economies, and although emerging
markets have seen poverty fall at record

speed,12 they have not been immune
to rising public discontent – evident,
for example, in large demonstrations
against corruption across Latin
America. Larrain et al. argue that rising
prosperity and a growing middle class
lead to greater demands for better
government and public goods, which
governments across the developing
world have been unable to meet.13
In the wake of the financial crisis,
economic policy-making has been
predominantly monetary rather than
fiscal. Unorthodox countercyclical
policies such as quantitative easing –
large-scale purchases of government
bonds by central banks – have evolved
into enduring features of economic
policy frameworks. And although
evidence points to positive impacts on
growth and employment,14 quantitative
easing has also exacerbated income
inequality by boosting returns enjoyed
by the owners of financial assets,15
while workers’ real earnings have been
growing very slowly.16
This is not the only source of concern
about exceptional monetary policies.
Sustained low interest rates can
distort the financial mechanisms that
underpin healthy economic activity:
they make it unusually cheap for
struggling companies to roll over their
debts, inhibiting the process of reallocating resources from inefficient to
more innovative parts of the economy.
This in turn complicates the process
of clearing the debt overhangs that in
many countries remains an unresolved

legacy of the pre-crisis boom, weighing
on growth by diverting income towards
debt servicing rather than fresh
consumption or investment.
Is it time for the pendulum to swing
from monetary to fiscal policy? In
the United States, President-elect
Trump campaigned on the promise
of increased infrastructure spending,
and globally there is tentative evidence
of a gradual move towards fiscal
loosening.17 This presents its own
risks: borrowing costs for governments
have been exceptionally low in recent
years, but if investors were to re-price
risk sharply, the adjustment this would
require from high-deficit countries could
have significant economic and political
consequences. However, it is not only
concerns about market responses
that shape governments’ reluctance to
turn to fiscal policy. Policy preferences
matter too. In the Eurozone, for
example, governments have been slow
to respond to repeated exhortations
from Mario Draghi, the president of
the European Central Bank, to find
more space for fiscal loosening.18
Using Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) data, Figure 1.2 illustrates the
divergence of fiscal trends in the United
States and Eurozone since 2015.
Beyond monetary policy and fiscal
stimulus, productivity growth has also
been slow to recover from the crisis.
Structural rates of unemployment
remain high, particularly among young
people in Europe, and the United States

has seen a marked slump in labour
participation rates. And in contrast
with the pre-crisis era, when China’s
rapid expansion bolstered overall
growth rates, there is no emergingmarket game-changer on the horizon.19
China is in a gradual slowdown as
its economy transitions from an
investment-led to a consumptionled growth model, and many other
emerging markets are undergoing
a traumatic adjustment to the end
of a commodities super-cycle that
underpinned much of their growth so
far this century.
In sum, it is difficult to identify routes
that will lead back to robust global rates
of economic growth. However, growth
is now only part of the challenge policymakers need to address. Concerns
over income and wealth distribution are
becoming more politically disruptive,
and much greater emphasis is needed
on the increasing financial insecurity
that characterizes many people’s
lives. As socio-economic outcomes
are increasingly determined globally,
popular frustration is growing at the
inability of national politics to provide
stability. Economist Dani Rodrik coined
the phrase “the globalization trilemma”
to capture his view that, among
democracy, national sovereignty and
global economic integration, only
two are simultaneously compatible –
and recent events in Europe and the
United States suggest an appetite for
rebalancing towards democracy and
national sovereignty.

The combination of economic
inequality and political polarization
threatens to amplify global risks, fraying
the social solidarity on which the
legitimacy of our economic and political
systems rests. New economic systems
and policy paradigms are urgently
needed to address the sources of
popular disenchantment.20 These could
include more effective human capital
policies, to enable more people to
benefit from skill-biased technological
change; better public goods (whether
publicly or privately provided) to
address the ambitions of the growing
middle class around the world; and
more responsive governance systems
to empower individuals at the local level
without sacrificing the many benefits of
globalization.

Society: Rebuilding
Communities
Issues of identity and culture were
central to the two most dramatic
Western political results of 2016, in the
United Kingdom and the United States.
This is part of a broader trend affecting
both international and domestic
politics. Across the European Union,
parties stressing national sovereignty
and/or values have prospered,21
boosted in part by migration flows that
GRPS respondents continue to point to
as a major geopolitical risk. Outside the
European Union, polarization in Turkey
has deepened since 2010,22 while
Russia has been expressing its national

In the West, decades of rapid social
and economic change have widened
generation gaps in values, disrupted
traditional patterns of affiliation and
community, and eroded the support
of mainstream political parties.25 Early
analysis by political scientists Ronald
Inglehart and Pippa Norris points to
the populism behind the victories of
Brexit and President-elect Trump as
being driven more by demographics
and cultural factors than income
inequality:26 a backlash among older
and less-educated voters who “feel
that they are being marginalized within
their own countries” by changing
values in areas such as gender, sexual
orientation, race, multiculturalism,
environmental protection and
international cooperation. Pew
research found stark divisions in the
self-described values of supporters of
President-elect Trump and Democrat
candidate Hillary Clinton: for example,
72% of President-elect Trump’s
supporters described themselves as
“traditional”, versus 31% of Clinton
supporters; other big differences

In the latest GRPS, respondents
ranked “increasing polarization” as
the third most important trend for
the next 10 years – it was cited by
31% of respondents, with “increasing
national sentiment” cited by 14%. The
survey recorded an increase in the
perceived impact of “failure of national
governance” but, perhaps surprisingly,
“profound social instability” dropped
in the rankings for both perceived
likelihood and impact. One possibility
is that the global decision-makers
who mostly comprise the GRPS panel
have not been sufficiently attuned to
this risk. Another way of interpreting
the GRPS, however, is to focus on
the underlying trends rather than the
risks. By placing both polarization and
intensifying national sentiment among
the top five trends (see Table 1.1),
GRPS respondents have highlighted
long-term patterns that, if they persist,
are likely to continue to amplify a range
of social and political risks.

political identity in increasingly assertive
foreign policy stances.23 Globally,
politics is increasingly defined by the
rise of charismatic “strongman” national
politicians and emotive political debate:

Dictionary’s word of the year.24

core values” (59% vs 35%); “typical
American” (72% vs 49%), “feminist”
(5% vs 38%) and “supporter of LGBT

Many established political parties
are ill-equipped to respond to voters’
placing greater emphasis on culture
and values, because the parties have
shifted towards the centre of the
political spectrum and a managerial
or technocratic style of politics.28 They
have lost touch with their traditional
core constituencies, particularly those
with class-based roots.29 In 2013,
political scientist Peter Mair wrote that
political parties’ failure to engage voters
meant democracy was starting to
buckle as electorates “are becoming
effectively non-sovereign”.30 Events
last year suggest that verdict may
have been premature. Both the Brexit
and President-elect Trump victories
featured (1) outsiders to major party
politics (2) successfully engaging
traditionalist voters with (3) appeals to
sovereignty rooted in national identity
and pride. Unusually, older voters were
in the vanguard of these disruptive
movements – and with populations
ageing, the pendulum may not swing
back towards the younger generation’s
views for some time.31

The Global Risks Report 2017

Dramatic events can have complex
effects on the risk landscape. They can
trigger new risks or exacerbate existing
ones, but they can also open the way
to responses that mitigate risks. As
many of the West’s democracies face
up to the growing electoral influence
of traditionalist political identities,
there are potential gains for social
solidarity and democratic legitimacy
if processes of political debate and
compromise re-connect with the older,
less-educated and predominantly male
voters who currently feel excluded.
However, it will be challenging to find
political narratives and policies that can
repair decades-long cultural fault-lines
while preserving, for example, gender
and minority rights. Failure could
further undermine social and cultural
cohesion: Daron Acemoglu, author with
James Robinson of Why Nations Fail,
has cautioned that current divisions
in the United States risk undermining
not just the electoral process but the
institutions and norms on which it is
founded.32

Evidence suggests that technological
change provides a better explanation
than globalization for the industrial
decline and deteriorating labour-market
prospects that have catalyzed antiestablishment voting in many of the
world’s advanced economies. Today’s
world is one in which production,
mobility, communication, energy
and other systems are changing with
unprecedented speed and scope,
disrupting everything from employment
patterns to social relationships and
geopolitical stability. Driven by the
convergence between digital, biological
and physical technologies, the Fourth
Industrial Revolution (4IR) is creating
new global risks and exacerbating
existing risks.
Perhaps because of the increasing
ubiquity of innovative technology,
respondents to the GRPS have tended
not to include technological risks
among the most impactful or the most
likely to occur. This can be seen in
the comparatively few technological
risks that appear in the evolving risk
matrix (Figure 2, inner cover). There
are possible signs of change, however.
The year 2014 was the first in which
two technological risks made it into
the evolving risk matrix, and this year,
although only one is included (“massive
incident of data fraud/theft”), another
(“large-scale cyberattacks”) came sixth
in the list of risks most likely to occur in
the next 10 years.
According to the economists Michael
Hicks and Srikant Devaraj, 86% of
manufacturing job losses in the United
States between 1997 and 2007
were the result of rising productivity,
compared to less than 14% lost
because of trade. Most assessments
suggest that technology’s disruptive
effect on labour markets will accelerate
across non-manufacturing sectors in
the years ahead, as rapid advances in
robotics, sensors and machine learning
enable capital to replace labour in an
expanding range of service-sector
job. Estimates of the number of jobs
at risk to technological displacement
vary: a frequently cited 2013 Oxford
Martin School study has suggested
that 47% of US jobs were at high risk
from automation; in 2016 an OECD

Part 1

We can shape the dynamics of the
4IR. Careful governance can guide
the distribution of benefits and
impact on global risks, because the
evolution of new technologies will
be heavily influenced by the social
norms, corporate policies, industry
standards and regulatory principles
being debated and written today.38
Unfortunately, however, current legal,
policy-making and standard-setting
institutions tend to move slowly. For
example, the US Federal Aviation
Authority took eight months to grant
Amazon an “experimental airworthiness
certificate” to test a particular model of
drone, by which time the model was
obsolete;39 Amazon conducted its trials
in Canada and the United Kingdom
instead. In 2015, the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved
an application by AquaBounty
Technologies for regulatory approval
of genetically modified salmon – an
application made in 1995. The salmon
still cannot be sold in the United
States, pending an update to labelling
regulations.40

We are in a highly disruptive phase of
technological development, at a time
of rising challenges to social cohesion
and policy-makers’ legitimacy. Given
the power of the 4IR to create and
exacerbate global risks, the associated
governance challenges are both huge
and pressing, as further discussed in
Part 3. It is critical that policy-makers
and other stakeholders – across
government, civil society, academia
and the media – collaborate to create
more agile and adaptive forms of local,
national and global governance and risk
management.

Geopolitics: Strengthening
Cooperation
In a worrying sign of deteriorating
commitment to global cooperation,
states are stepping back from
mechanisms set up to underpin
international security through mutual
accountability and respect for common
norms. For example, 2016 saw Russia,
South Africa, Burundi and Gambia
withdraw from the International
Criminal Court, and China reject the
verdict of the international tribunal on
the South China Sea. At the time of
writing, the incoming US president
is considering withdrawal from the
recent Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (Iran nuclear deal) and the Paris
Climate Change agreement. The exit
of major stakeholders from economic
agreements such as the Trans-Pacific
Partnership and Trans-Atlantic Trade

and Investment Partnership also carries
geopolitical significance.
In Syria, the drawn-out nature of the
war indicates how the absence of a
great-power accord handicaps the
United Nations, compounding the
difficulties of brokering a settlement to
a conflict with multiple stakeholders at
global, regional and non-state levels, or
even organizing a limited intervention
to facilitate humanitarian relief or
protect civilians. The death toll among
non-combatants – including from
chemical weapons – has been met
with despairing rhetoric but no effective
action to enforce long-standing
humanitarian laws and norms.
In parallel to their withdrawal of support
for collective solutions, major powers
now openly trade accusations of
undermining international security or
interfering in their domestic politics. For
years President Putin has accused the
United States of seeking to undermine
global stability and Russian sovereignty,
and in 2016 the US National Security
Agency blamed Russia for interference
in the presidential election. Tensions
rose between the United States and
China over freedom of navigation in the
South China Sea and the deployment
of US missile defence systems to the
Republic of Korea, which led to Beijing
warning the United States not to “harm
China’s strategic security interests”.
In response to the general loss of faith
in collective security mechanisms,
regional powers and smaller nations are
increasingly exploring the acquisition of
new conventional weapons capabilities,
offensive cyber weapons and even
nuclear ones. Notwithstanding the
normative and practical obstacles
confronting a state seeking nuclear
capability, political leaders in nuclear
and non-nuclear weapons states alike
have increasingly made reference to
the utility of nuclear weapons in the
context of changing threat perceptions
and wavering confidence in alliance
structures. If this rhetoric turns into
policy, it could entail a huge diversion
of resources into a new nuclear arms
race and a jump in the risk of preemptive strikes aimed at preventing an
adversary gaining nuclear capability.

In summary, developments in 2016
present numerous reminders that
international security requires collective

Part 3

Technology has always created
jobs as well as destroying them, but
there is evidence that the engine of
technological job creation is sputtering.
The Oxford Martin School estimates
that only 0.5% of today’s US workforce
is employed in sectors created since
2000, compared with approximately
8% in industries created during the
1980s.35 Technological change is
shifting the distribution of income
from labour to capital: according to
the OECD, up to 80% of the decline
in labour’s share of national income
between 1990 and 2007 was the
result of the impact of technology.36 At
a global level, however, many people
are being left behind altogether: more
than 4 billion people still lack access to
the internet, and more than 1.2 billion
people are without even electricity.37

Such regulatory delays can mean social
and economic benefits are missed –
but when health, the environment and
broader social impacts are at stake,
a cautiously deliberative approach
is prudent. How best to strike this
balance is currently causing debate,
for example, in efforts to accelerate
the regulation of self-driving vehicles.41
Although populist movements have
recently tapped public hostility to
globalization more than to technology,
there is still the risk of backlash against
technological change. For example,
public concerns about genetically
modified foods have consistently
exceeded scientific assessments of
the risks associated with them, and
concerns about climate change have
not precluded public opposition to wind
farms.42

working paper put the figure lower,
at 9%.33 In 2015 a McKinsey study
concluded that 45% of the activities
that workers do today could already
be automated if companies choose to
do so.34 As discussed in Chapter 3.1,

commitments and investment to define
a positive vision, as well as political
will to make responsible trade-offs
and commit resources (Box 1.1). As
technological, demographic and
climate pressures intensify the danger
of systems failure, competition among
world powers and fragmentation of
security efforts makes the international
system more fragile, placing collective
prosperity and survival at risk.

Part 3

Environment: Accelerating
Action
As Figure 2 (inside front cover)
illustrates, a cluster of interconnected
environment-related risks – including
extreme weather events, climate
change and water crises – has
consistently featured among the topranked global risks for the past seven
editions of The Global Risks Report.
Environment-related risks again stand
out in this year’s global risk landscape
(see Figure 3 (inside rear cover), with
every risk in the category lying in
the higher-impact, higher-likelihood

quadrant. Environmental risks are also
closely interconnected with other risk
categories. Four of the top ten risk
interconnections in this year’s GRPS
involve environmental risks, the most
frequently cited of these being the
pairing of “water crises” and “failure
of climate change mitigation and
adaptation”.
This shows that ineffective
management of the “global commons”
– the oceans, atmosphere, and climate
system – can have local as well as
global consequences. For example,
changing weather patterns or water
crises can trigger or exacerbate
geopolitical and societal risks such
as domestic or regional conflict and
involuntary migration, particularly in
geopolitically fragile areas.
Further progress was made during
2016 in addressing climate and other
environmental risks, reflecting firm
international resolve on the transition to
a low-carbon global economy and on
building resilience to climate change:
– The Paris Agreement on climate
change entered into force on 4

–

–

–

November 2016; it is now ratified by
more than 110 countries;
a strong signal of support for
implementing the Paris Agreement
was made by 196 governments,
including China, at the Marrakesh
Climate Conference in late
November 2016;43
the International Civil Aviation
Organisation agreed a “marketbased measure” that will ensure
no net growth in aviation emissions
after 2020 – this is significant
because international aviation, like
shipping, falls outside the scope of
the Paris Agreement; and
also in October, parties to the
Montreal Protocol on ozonedepleting substances agreed an
important amendment that could
help avoid an additional 0.5°C of
warming by 2050 through reducing
the use of hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), which have an extremely
high global warming potential.44

The year 2016 also saw positive
empirical evidence that the transition to
a low-carbon economy is underway:

Box 1.1: Five Factors Exacerbating Geopolitical Risks
Five factors aggravate the impact on global risks of the current geopolitical atmosphere of rising competition, loss of trust and
heightened suspicion:
First, international cooperation is giving way to unilateral or transactional approaches to foreign policy just as a host of issues –
such as global growth, debt and climate change – demand urgent collective action. If allowed to fester, such issues could spawn
a range of new problems with costs falling disproportionately on fragile communities.
Second, the inter-connected nature of the global system produces cascading risks at the domestic level. In Syria, for example,
failures of governance have produced civil conflict, driving migration that transfers economic, social and political pressures into
countries already experiencing frustrations with low growth and rising inequality, fuelling radicalization and acts of violence.
Third, a declining sense of trust and mutual good faith in international relations makes it harder to contain the resulting pressures
through domestic policy. The current climate of mutual suspicion can exacerbate domestic political tensions through
accusations of outside actors interfering to shape popular perceptions via proxy forces, media manipulation or threatening
military gestures.
Fourth, technological innovation exacerbates the risk of conflict. A new arms race is developing in weaponized robotics and
artificial intelligence. Cyberspace is now a domain of conflict, and the Arctic and deep oceans are being opened up by remote
vehicle access; in each case, there is no established system for policing responsible behaviour. Because research and
development of “dual-use” technologies takes place largely in the private sector, they can be weaponized by a wider range of
state and non-state actors – for example, the self-proclaimed “Islamic State” has used commercial drones to deliver bombs in
Syria, and open-source technology could potentially create devastating biological weapons. Existing counter-proliferation
methods and institutions cannot prevent the dissemination of technologies that exist in digital form.
Fifth, while risks intersect and technologies develop quickly, too often our institutions for governing international security remain
reactive and slow-moving.

The Emissions Gap Report 2016
from the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) shows that even if
countries deliver on the commitments
– known as Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) – that they made
in Paris, the world will still warm by 3.0
to 3.2°C.50 To keep global warming
to within 2°C and limit the risk of
dangerous climate change, the world
will need to reduce emissions by 40%
to 70% by 2050 and eliminate them
altogether by 2100.51 While attention
will be focused on China, the United
States, the European Union, and India –
which collectively comprise more than
half of global emissions – all countries
will need to ratchet up their action in
order to limit warming to 2°C.
Increasingly, legal action is being
taken against national governments
in an attempt to force action on
environmental issues. The United
Kingdom is being sued for failing to deal
with a “national air pollution crisis”,52
and it has also been threatened with
legal action if it fails to reduce its
greenhouse emissions;53 a group of
teenagers has challenged the US
government for not protecting them
from climate change;54 the Netherlands
has been ordered by a court to cut its
emissions;55 and Norway is being sued

over Arctic drilling plans.56 Meanwhile,
the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)’s Clean Power Plan is
being challenged in court and has
divided the electricity industry: coal
miners, some labour unions, and 27
states support the challenge while the
renewable energy industry, leading tech
firms, and 18 states are supporting the
EPA’s legislation.57
As warming increases, impacts grow.
The Arctic sea ice had a record melt in
2016 and the Great Barrier Reef had
an unprecedented coral bleaching
event, affecting over 700 kilometres
of the northern reef.58 The latest
analysis by the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates
that, on average, 21.5 million people
have been displaced by climate- or
weather-related events each year
since 2008,59 and the UN Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR)
reports that close to 1 billion people
were affected by natural disasters
in 2015.60 Communities from Alaska
to Fiji and Kiribati have already been
relocated or are making plans to do so
because the rising sea level threatens
their lands.61 The World Bank forecasts
that water stress could cause extreme
societal stress in regions such as the
Middle East and the Sahel, where the
economic impact of water scarcity
could put at risk 6% of GDP by 2050.62
The Bank also forecasts that water
availability in cities could decline by as
much as two thirds by 2050, as a result
of climate change and competition
from energy generation and agriculture.
The Indian government advised that at
least 330 million people were affected
by drought in 2016.63 The confluence
of risks around water scarcity, climate
change, extreme weather events
and involuntary migration remains a
potent cocktail and a “risk multiplier”,
especially in the world economy’s
more fragile environmental and political
contexts.

With power and influence increasingly
distributed, however, there is a
growing recognition that the response
to environmental risks cannot be
delivered by international agencies
and governments alone. It requires
new approaches that take a wider
“systems view” of the interconnected
challenges, and that involve a larger
and more diverse set of actors.

However, the pace of change is not
yet fast enough. Global greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions are growing,
currently by about 52 billion tonnes
of CO2 equivalent per year,47 even
though the share from industrial and
energy sources may be peaking as
investment and innovation in green
technology accelerates (see Box 1.2).
The year 2016 is set to be the warmest
on the instrumental record according
to provisional analysis by the World
Meteorological Organisation.48 It
was the first time the global average
temperature was 1 degree Celsius or
more above the 1880–1999 average.
According to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, each of
the eight months from January through
August 2016 were the warmest those

months have been in the whole 137

Bloomberg New Energy Finance
reported that global investment in
renewable energy capacity in 2015
was US$266 billion, more than
double the allocations to new coal
and gas capacity;45 and
the International Energy Agency
(IEA) reported that the total
generation capacity of renewable
energy now exceeds coal-fired
power plants for the for first
time, and for the past two years
greenhouse gas emissions have
been de-coupled from economic
growth.46

come from the financial sector: the
Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce
on Climate-related Financial Disclosure
is developing recommendations for
managing the physical, liability, and
transition risks of climate change;
rating agencies S&P and Moody’s
have announced plans to assess the
climate risks facing both companies
and countries; and investor groups
have called for greater disclosure of
companies’ exposure to climate risks.
The Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 also
offers the promise of advancing new
multi-dimensional approaches to help
reduce deforestation from global supply
chains, such as the recent Africa Palm
Oil Initiative.64

Taking a systemic view also implies
accounting for new risks that could be
created by successful action to address
environmental risks. For example, the
transition to a low-carbon future will
require measures in some economies
to absorb potential labour-market
impacts. China’s announcement in
early 2016 that it will reduce its coal and
steel sector workforce by 1.8 million
(15%) over two years, resettling affected
workers in response to industrial
overcapacity, may provide a glimpse of
what is to come.65 While most research
suggests the shift to clean energy
could create a substantial increase in
net employment,66 the overall policy
equation is complex and may require
new approaches to skills training
and retraining, along with measures

to facilitate increased labour-force
mobility. Ensuring a just transition will
be important for societal stability.
Issue-specific and organizationspecific silos will need to be dismantled
across the public and private sectors
throughout the world economy. In
their place, new multi-actor alliances
and coalitions for action will need to
be built, cutting horizontally across
traditional boundaries of interest,
expertise and nationality. The rise of
such multidimensional cooperation
to manage our global environmental
commons will be challenging in the
international context described above,
but essential if we are to respond
adequately to the structural risks posed
by climate change, extreme weather,
and water crises.

Box 1.2: Climate Change and the 4IR - by Al Gore, Generation Investment Management
Every day we spew 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into our atmosphere. The accumulated amount of all
that manmade global warming pollution is trapping as much extra heat energy as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
atomic bombs exploding every single day. All that extra heat energy is disrupting the hydrological cycle, evaporating water vapor
from the oceans and leading to stronger storms, more extreme floods, and deeper and longer droughts, declining crop yields,
water stresses, the spread of tropical diseases poleward, and refugee crises and political instability, among other problems. Our
efforts to solve the climate crisis are a race against time, but the technologies embodying the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), and
the implications of these changes for business and society, contain hope for the acceleration of the necessary solutions to the
climate crisis.
We are seeing a continuing sharp, exponential decline in the costs of renewable energy, energy efficiency, batteries and storage –
and the distribution of technologies that allow for the spread of sustainable agriculture and forestry – giving nations and
communities around the world an opportunity to embrace a sustainable future based on a low carbon, hyper-efficient economy. In
fact, in many parts of the world, renewable energy is already cheaper than that of fossil fuels. In some developing regions of the
world, renewable energy is leapfrogging fossil fuels altogether, much in the same way mobile phones leapfrogged land-line
phones.
Sixteen years ago, projections said that by 2010 the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity. In 2015, we
installed 14.5 times that amount. Solar energy’s price decrease is even steeper and more exciting. Fourteen years ago, projections
said that the solar energy market would grow 1 gigawatt per year by 2010 – that goal was exceeded by 17 times over. In 2015, we
beat that mark by 58 times and 2016 was on pace to beat that mark 68 times over. In fact, the cost of solar energy has come down
10 percent per year for 30 years.
Similar developments are likely to occur across the board as new developments in electric vehicles, smart grids and micro grids,
advanced manufacturing and materials, and other areas continue to accelerate climate action. We are already seeing revolutions
unfolding in areas like car sharing, forest monitoring, and data-driven reductions in industrial energy usage.
But it is not just the technologies of the 4IR that are directly making a difference: it is also the transformative operating models
inherent within these technologies that contain the seeds for change. The Internet of Things has introduced a world of hyperconnectivity that allows us to approach decision-making in an entirely new manner. Our increased connectivity – between one
another and to the material world – enables us to transfer information and materials more efficiently to greater numbers of people.
All of this is making the tools we need to solve the greatest challenges we face more effective and more ubiquitous at a previously
unseen pace.
We are going to prevail in our collective effort to solve the climate crisis, and it will be in large part due to our increasing ability to
mitigate the burning of dirty fossil fuels through the opportunities presented to us by the 4IR.

These problems did not begin with the financial crisis. For example, Russell Dalton
(Dalton, 2004) was writing about “the erosion of political support in advanced
industrial democracies” in 2004, and one prominent argument about “the hollowing
out of Western democracy” looks to the 1990s as a pivotal decade for declining
public engagement in politics (Mair, 2013).

Building on his research into intergenerational conflicts in ageing societies (Ahlfeldt,
Maennig, and Steenbeck 2016), Gabriel Ahlfeldt notes that a “back-of-the-envelope”
calculation suggests that the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote would have swung
the other way if the electorate had been an average of three years younger, which
corresponds to going back in time to the mid-1990s (Ahlfeldt No date).

2.1: Western Democracy in Crisis?

The chapter then looks at three
challenges Western policy-makers
will have to try to resolve if they are
to tackle these issues successfully:
how to make economic growth more
inclusive; how to deliver the change
voters want while maintaining continuity
in systems of government; and how to
reconcile growing identity nationalism
with diverse societies. The chapter
concludes that restoring the health of
democracy may prove challenging, but
some potential ways forward can be
identified.

Rising Support for AntiEstablishment Parties
The recent increase in support
and influence enjoyed by antiestablishment, populist political parties
and movements in many Western
countries is the continuation of a trend

The political impact of antiestablishment sentiment has already
been dramatic. Most notably, the
cluster of anti-elitism, cultural nativism
and economic nationalism formed
important parts of the winning 2016
campaigns in the United Kingdom
(UK) referendum on European Union
(EU) membership and both the United
States (US) Republican primary and
the subsequent presidential election.
This cluster has resonated particularly
strongly in Europe, where Eurozone
and EU problems provide fertile ground
for populists calling for a return to
national sovereignty. Support for farright parties has increased in Europe’s
four largest countries – Germany, the
United Kingdom, France and Italy –
as well as others, including Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Hungary,
the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and
Switzerland.3
Anti-establishment politicians have
not yet won many elections in Europe.
Nonetheless, in many countries these
movements have already succeeded
in shifting the political centre of gravity,
forcing mainstream parties to adopt
elements of their policy platforms. In
some countries – such as Spain and
Ireland – they have contributed to a
fragmentation of parliamentary forces
that has complicated the process
of forming stable governments and
implementing effective policies. There
is even some contested evidence
that young people, in particular, are

Three Trends Undermining
Democracy
Numerous factors have been
suggested as playing a role in
weakening democratic legitimacy and
effectiveness. While all related, they
can be grouped under three main
headings.
1.

Rapid economic and
technological change
Statistics show clearly that
globalization and trade have
created growth, promoted
competitiveness and efficiency,5
cut poverty and global inequality,
and narrowed the gap between
emerging economies and the rich
world. Overall, global prosperity is
at its highest point in a decade.6
But globalization and trade feature
prominently in anti-establishment
sentiment in Western democracies
because the benefits of growth
have been unequally experienced.
Evidence compiled by economist
Branko Milanovic shows that
those people between the 75th
and 90th percentiles of the global
income distribution have been the
non-winners from globalization.7
Meanwhile, the richest have made
the biggest gains, especially since
the global financial crisis: in the
United States, between 2009 and
2012, the incomes of the top 1%
grew by more than 31%, compared
with less than 0.5% for the
remaining 99% of the population
(Figure 2.1.1).8 Middle-class income
stagnation is particularly affecting
youth: recent research shows that
540 million young people across
25 advanced economies face
the prospect of growing up to be
poorer than their parents.9
Alongside globalization,
technological change has
dramatically affected many
people’s sense of economic
security. Traditional manufacturing
hubs in advanced economies
have been hollowed out by a

Part 3

But is democracy itself in crisis?
Some point out that voters punishing
politicians who have failed to represent
them adequately is one of the essential
virtues of the democratic process.
Others argue that the current crisis
in mainstream politics goes deeper,
fundamentally threatening how politics
works. This chapter considers three
related reasons to be concerned about
the future of democracy: the impacts
of rapid economic and technological
change; the deepening of social
and cultural polarization; and the
emergence of “post-truth” political
debate.

with long roots.2 Anti-establishment
populism expresses itself differently in
different countries: there are left-wing
and right-wing strands, and domestic
factors are significant. But there are
also common themes: appeals to
national sovereignty and criticism
that elites have failed to protect
electorates from the negative impacts
of globalization are threads that run
through both left- and right-wing
strands. In many cases, there are also
appeals to the rights of native citizens,
as opposed to immigrants, and the
importance of restoring “traditional”
values and hierarchies.

Part 2

In many Western democracies,
traditional mainstream political parties
are in crisis. They are struggling
to respond to rapid changes in
the political landscape as voters’
disaffection expresses itself in
lower turnouts or rising support for
previously peripheral movements.1 The
unexpected triumphs in 2016 for the
Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom
and President-elect Donald Trump’s
campaign in the United States are the
most high profile indicators of a febrile
political environment.

that democracy itself is failing to deliver

combination of labour-saving
technology and outsourcing.10
Technology has historically been
a net creator of jobs, but new jobs
do not necessarily materialize
quickly or in the same locations
as jobs that have been displaced:
economist Diane Coyle has argued
that one of the drivers of current
political disaffection in postindustrial regions is that job losses
have eroded whole communities.11

Immigration has proven to be
an extremely successful policy
issue for anti-establishment

appeals to emotion and personal
belief”.20
Free speech and the lively contest
of ideas are a fundamental part
of the democratic process, but
they depend on all participants
accepting each other’s good faith
and a shared set of underlying
facts. Historically, relatively
small numbers of media outlets
provided a widely trusted common
foundation for national debates.
Increasingly, however, the media
landscape is characterized by
fragmentation, antagonism and
mistrust, with individuals tending to
segregate themselves according
to their values and beliefs. Online
“echo chambers” reinforce rather
than challenge people’s existing
biases, making it easier for
misinformation to spread.21
Companies that run social media
platforms face a commercial
incentive to ensure that their
users are presented with content
with which they are more likely to
engage – which, in political terms,
implies presenting content with
which they are likely to agree.22
If the resulting emergence of
self-reinforcing communities of
like-minded people undermines
the health of democracy, it raises
serious questions related to
market capitalism reform, an issue
discussed in Part 1 of this Report.

3. Post-truth political debate
The cultural polarization of
democratic societies has been
exacerbated by profound changes
in the way news and information is
produced, distributed and shared
(Box 2.1.1). The aftermath of the
US presidential election featured
a prominent debate about “fake
news”.19 The Oxford English
Dictionary chose as its word of
the year “post-truth”, defined as
“denoting circumstances in which
objective facts are less influential
in shaping public opinion than

There is no consensus on what needs
to be done to strengthen democratic
processes, but three dilemmas can be
identified as particularly significant.

Part 3

2. Deepening social and cultural
polarization
Issues related to national identity,
cultural values and ethnic origins
have been prominent in the rise
of anti-establishment populism.
Even in the Nordic countries –
affluent, post-industrial knowledge
societies, with comparatively
homogenous populations and
generous welfare models – there
is evidence of a backlash against
“progressive” changes in social
values such as acceptance of
same-sex marriage, gender
identity and secularism.12 With the
rapid spread of more cosmopolitan
and egalitarian attitudes, especially
among young people and the
educated middle class, those who
are older and less educated may
feel left behind.13

populists, providing a common
thread for their electoral advances
across different countries.14
However, the links between
immigration and populist voting
are not straightforward: in the
United Kingdom’s vote on EU
membership, for instance, areas
with more immigrants were more
likely to support remaining in the
European Union.15 One possible
explanation is that what matters to
the voters is not so much absolute
levels of immigration but rates of
change.16 Another is that voters
are focusing on immigration policy
for a complex range of reasons:
to bolster national sovereignty in
a globalized world;17 to reject the
deep cultural changes of recent
decades; or to express anger at
mainstream politicians for breaking
clear promises.18

Generating more inclusive
growth
The availability of good, well-paying
jobs is critical to persuading people
that the economic system works

there is no trade-off in principle
between promoting social inclusion
and competitiveness: growth
and equity can go together.23

Part 1

Box 2.1.1: Social Media and the Distortion of Information - by Walter Quattrociocchi, Northeastern University

Part 2

Social media can liberate, inform, engage, mobilize, and encourage innovation and democracy. However, social media has also
changed the way we get informed and form our opinions, with troubling results. According to one recent estimate,1
approximately 63% of users acquire their news from social media. But news sourced in this way is subject to the same
dynamics as other forms of online content, such as selfies and cat photos. It is the most popular content that spreads,
regardless of its factual accuracy.
As a result of disintermediated access to information and algorithms used in content promotion, communication has become
increasingly personalized, both in the way messages are framed and how they are shared across social networks. Recent
studies show that, online, we seek information that supports existing viewpoints and predominantly engage with communities of
like-minded people, leading to the problem of confirmation bias.2

Part 3

Online discussion negatively influences users’ emotions and intensifies polarization,3 creating “echo chambers” – closed, mostly
non-interacting communities with different narratives, where beliefs become amplified or reinforced. With users on social media
aiming to maximize the number of likes, information is frequently oversimplified. The combination of simplification and
segregation provides a fertile environment for the diffusion and persistence of unsubstantiated rumours.4
Misinformation has always represented a political, social and economic risk. Social media’s power to misinform, manipulate and
distort public opinion has become severe. Experimental evidence shows that confirmatory information is accepted even if it
contains deliberately false claims, while dissenting information is mainly ignored or might even increase group polarization.5
This evidence suggests a real possibility that public opinion can be intentionally distorted by exploiting information overload and
confirmation bias, with significant political, social and economic consequences. Strategies for mitigation remain uncertain.6
Google has proposed trying to correct false claims by marking information as fact-checked; but confirmation bias might simply
result in the claim of fact-checking being discounted. The problem behind misinformation is polarization – hence, we need to
create synergies among institutions, scholars and communicators to reframe and smooth contrast in the information system.

institutions to make growth more
inclusive. However, in practice,
the current environment presents
some serious challenges.
Technological change is
diminishing the contribution
of labour to GDP growth, as
machines become more able to do
a wider range of work. One study
predicts that 47% of US jobs are at
risk of automation,24 affecting over
80% of low-income workers.25 New
technology has also historically
increased labour productivity and
created new and better jobs – but
as machines become better at
cognitive as well as physical tasks,
there is significant uncertainty
about the future of job creation.

Technology is also contributing
to the changing nature of work,
with secure and predictable jobs
giving way to more sporadic,
short-term self-employment.26
Research suggests that the
number of people in “alternative
work arrangements” increased
faster than overall employment
between 2005 and 2015.27 The rise
of the “gig economy” threatens the
stability of income people need
to plan long-term investments
such as home ownership and
savings for old age. As discussed
in Chapter 2.3, it also undermines
social insurance schemes that
are commonly linked to formal
employment.
Populist movements tend to
focus blame for job losses

on globalization rather than
technology, but evidence points to
technology being much the bigger
factor. As shown by Figure 2.1.2,
manufacturing in the United States
has not decreased: the country
is producing as much as it ever
has, only with fewer workers. In
the United Kingdom, the share of
manufacturing in the economy has
decreased – but the manufacturing
that remains is higher value,28
and cross-border services have
massively expanded in parallel.
Less openness is presented as
a simple solution, but it would
likely create more problems than
it solves: trade barriers intended
to protect local workers could,
for example, cause job losses by
increasing the cost of inputs for
high value added companies.
The Global Risks Report 2017

Part 1
Part 2

Rather than seeking to
reduce globalized trade flows,
governments will ultimately need
to work out a viable political offer
for those negatively impacted.
How best to support displaced
workers is a complex problem that
requires political will to tackle.29 In
particular, an overhaul of labour
regulations and employment
contracts is likely to be needed to
prevent gig economy workers from
being left out of existing welfare
schemes, and to ensure that
governments continue to receive
the contributions they need to
maintain them.30

Part 3

Rebuilding public trust in the
political process and in leaders
will be a difficult task. This work
needs to start with the recognition
that some valid concerns underlie
the rise of anti-establishment
sentiment. For example, studies
have shown that the preferences of
constituents in the lowest third of
income groups are not reflected in
the votes of their representatives,
which are instead overwhelmingly
skewed toward the wealthy.32
Other studies demonstrate the
extent to which the “revolving door”
between government and business
drives growing
inequality. 33

2. Maintaining continuity in
government while accelerating
change
The economic policies of
historically mainstream political
parties from the left and the right
have converged in recent
decades.31 This has enabled
once-fringe movements to rise by
portraying the established parties
as part of the same technocratic
political class, focused on selfenrichment while the institutions
of government are allowed to
fail. Populist movements call
for bold, dramatic action; when
moderates point to public debt
and overstretched monetary
policy as constraining room for
manoeuvre, they can be portrayed
as patronizing.

The challenge is to deliver the
short-term change voters demand,
while also reforming institutions in
a way that maintains the continuity
of government and established
checks and balances. Arguably, the
US election result demonstrated a
paradox: voters who responded to
candidate Donald Trump’s “drain
the swamp” message often also
expressed reservations about
his personal suitability for the
presidency, implying that they
trusted the existing system to be
robust enough protect them from
potential excesses even as they
voted to shake that system up.34
Finding the right balance between
change and continuity will not be
easy.

The Global Risks Report 2017

An increasingly common response
to popular disaffection with the
political process has been for
elected representatives to defer
to referendums: the UK vote on
EU exit was one of a spate of
plebiscites in 2016. However,
these are an imperfect solution.
Representative democracies have
typically evolved mechanisms
to protect the rights of minorities
from crude majoritarianism, and
increased use of direct democracy
may upset the balance. Countries
that lack a historical tradition of
direct democracy may also be
more likely to struggle with the
question of who should be held
accountable for implementing the
results of popular votes.
Moreover, boiling down complex
issues to binary questions is an
imperfect substitute for genuinely
listening to the nuanced concerns
of the electorate. One potential
solution could be to make
better use of technology in the
process of government – not
only to deliver services in a faster,
more transparent, inclusive and
consumer-oriented way, but also to
establish a “digital public square”
with more direct communication
between leaders and people.35
3. Reconciling identity nationalism
and multiculturalism
Ongoing humanitarian challenges
will continue to create flows of
people – and in countries where
fertility rates are declining and
numbers of pensioners are
growing, immigration will be
needed to bring in new workers.
However, as with globalization,
the overall economic benefits
brought by immigration are not
felt by all sections of society.
And immigration creates cultural
tensions: there is a need to allow
space for religious tolerance
without opening the door to
extremism, and a need to
encourage the diversity that
brings innovation without fostering
resentment.
In Western democracies,
political parties are the traditional
mechanism for resolving competing
interests,36 but the rise of identity
nationalism has exposed splits in
society that cannot be mapped

Part 1

To some extent, the cultural
challenges associated with
immigration could be tackled by
getting better at communicating
change:37 data show that voters
will change their views on cultural
changes in society if politicians
highlight the assimilation already
taking place.38

Leaders will need to face up to
a debate over how to allocate
economic and residential
entitlements to economic migrants
and refugees. Some countries
may want to link these entitlements
to cultural assimilation or work,
treating native populations and
migrants unequally: the latter
have to earn the rights that
are fundamental to the native
population’s citizenship. Other
countries – this was an important
driver of the United Kingdom’s
Brexit vote – may choose to
loosen their international economic
ties in order to slow the pace of
immigration.

against existing party structures.
This raises the need to find new
ways to reconcile differences
in opinion about immigration,
encouraging assimilation while
avoiding the risk of majorities –
which represent the prevailing
culture – flexing their muscles in a
dangerously destabilising way.

Kaufmann 2016.

Conclusion
There is room for debate about
the extent to which the rise of antiestablishment sentiment in Western
democracies reflects a threat to the
democratic process itself. Nonetheless,
there are clear reasons to worry
about the health of democracy,
and challenges related to cultural
polarization and economic dislocation
have no straightforward answers. This
could be a pivotal moment in political
history, and it requires courageous new
thinking about how best to manage the
relationship between citizens and their
elected representatives.

The Global Risks Report 2017

Part 1

Analysing the Closing
Space for Civic Freedoms

The trend is accelerating and
expanding globally, to encompass
countries that have traditionally been
open and inclusive. According to the
CIVICUS Monitor, 3.2 billion people
live in countries where the freedoms of
expression, association and peaceful
assembly are repressed or closed,
with only nine countries out of the 104
analysed globally being rated as open
in terms of enjoyment of rights and
adherence to the rule of law (Figure
2.2.1).9

A new era of restricted freedoms
and increased governmental control
could undermine social, political and
economic stability and increase the
risk of geopolitical and social conflict.1
Empowered by sophisticated new
technological tools in areas such
as surveillance, governments and
decision-makers around the world
are tightening control over civil society
organizations, individuals and other
actors.
Over the past 10 years, multiple
sources from within and outside the
civil society sector have pointed to
deteriorating rule of law and declining
respect for basic civil and political rights
at the global level.2 New regulations
and restrictions are ostensibly intended
to protect against increased security
threats, but potentially threaten the
existence of an open and free society
and the stability of the environment in
which businesses invest and operate.
Civil society actors have historically
been integral to driving progress and
innovation in the political, social and
economic spheres – by advancing
human rights, the rule of law and
sustainable development – and they
are currently at the forefront of efforts
to tackle global challenges such as
the migration crisis, implementing
the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), and
promoting transparent governance.
Closing space for civil society reduces
the chances that these challenges will
be effectively addressed.
This chapter will explain the current
challenges of a closing space for civic
freedoms and solid rule of law, casting
a light on the triggers and contextual
factors that are contributing to the
phenomenon. A separate focus on the
implications for businesses and society
at large is also provided to highlight the
medium-to-long term impact of this
trend and the issues at stake in the
global context of a fraying rule of law.

“Closing civil society space” refers
to actions by governments and
others that, intentionally or otherwise,
result in the prevention, limitation or
eradication of civil society activities.
This is something that can occur
for very different reasons. In some
cases repressive laws have been
introduced in order to reduce dissent
and silence opposing voices. In
others, civil society freedoms have
been unintentionally restricted as a
consequence of other democratically
agreed policies. This is testament to
the fact that the compromise between
security and liberty is still a difficult
one to tread for many policy-makers.
In the current context of heightened
security concerns and terrorist threats,
many governments have promulgated
regulatory frameworks that entail
greater scrutiny of all economic
and societal actors – but trade-offs
between security and the protection
of civic freedoms have not always
been managed in a balanced way, and
some of these measures have had a
disproportionate impact on civil society
organizations in certain parts of the
world.3
Closing space is difficult to quantify
because restrictions are different in
each country and impact each actor
in different ways.4 In some countries,
for example, businesses and civil
society actors have different reporting
requirements – for example, civil society
actors may be prohibited from receiving
foreign donations, while businesses
are encouraged to seek foreign
investment.5 However, civil society
organizations, media and corporate
actors have all expressed growing
concern about the closing of civic
space.6 In 2015, CIVICUS found serious
threats to one or more civic freedoms
– including the freedom of association,
freedom of assembly and freedom
of expression – in 109 countries, up

Restrictions affect both organizations
and individual citizens, including
journalists and media outlets –
particularly those who challenge
economic and political elites.10
Methods of restrictions include verbal
and physical actions (vilification of
civil society groups,11 crackdowns on
protest,12 violence against individual
activists);13 regulatory measures
(burdensome reporting requirements
such as on the management of foreign
funding);14 and technological intrusions
(e.g. digital rights restrictions).15
Some organizations have closed
down or reduced their operations as
a result.16 Furthermore, in addition
to human rights and advocacy
organizations, academic, philanthropic
and humanitarian entities, as well as
journalists, have also been affected by
closing civic space.17

Triggers and contextual factors
Factors behind the closing space for
civil society vary per region, though
Table 2.2.1 summarizes some common
dynamics. In some cases, security
concerns, protectionism and the
changing global aid landscape have
been used as reasons for reducing
dissent. In other cases, restrictions
on freedom have been unintended
byproducts of well-intentioned security
packages. While it is possible to try
to distinguish between the trend in
authoritarian or semi-authoritarian and
democratic countries, worrying trends
are seen even in democratic countries.

Table 2.2.1: Contextual Factors
Security concerns
and counterterrorism measures

The sensitive geopolitical context, the rise of cyberattacks
and major data breaches and hacks, as well as the global
insurgency of violent extremism and radicalization have led
many countries to adopt security measures and counterterrorism laws that have increased scrutiny and restrictions
on the participation of societal actors, including civil society
and individual citizens, sometimes including restrictions on
dissenting voices.1

Rising nationalism

Civil society actors often challenge decision-makers on issues
tied to security and identity, such as the response to terrorism
or the refugee crisis, or the treatment of minorities. Nationalist
sentiment has fuelled the closing of civic space in an attempt
to reduce such criticism.2 The argument against foreign
funding also has nationalistic undercurrents: some nongovernmental organizations that take foreign funding have
been accused of being unpatriotic or anti-development.3

Changing scene of
development aid

Developing and emerging countries are often less dependent
on foreign aid than they have been in the past, and less
tolerant of external influence over the spending of aid money.4
Claiming ownership of development aid is an important step
towards reducing aid dependence – but some governments
have used it to exert control over civil society activities in their
country.5

“Market
fundamentalism”

At times the push for economic growth has contributed to
restricting the civic space by nurturing in certain geographical
contexts the distrust and repression of civil society actors who
have criticized business or foreign investors, and who have
consequently been labelled “anti-development” or
“anti-national interest”.6

The Global Risks Report 2017

Genuine problems among a subset of
civil society actors – such as a lack of
transparency and links to terrorism – do
exist, but responses are drafted widely
enough to affect reliable organizations
delivering benefits to society.

Technological advances have
expanded civic space by providing
citizens and organizations with new
opportunities to make their voices
heard, express their grievances and
demand their rights, and innovative
ways to hold decision-makers to
account. They offer virtual platforms
for citizens to engage and mobilize on
issues they care about. At the same
time, ICT and other technological tools
benefit individuals or groups seeking to
leverage technology for the spreading
of hate, misinformation and extremism,
and present challenges for law
enforcement and other governmental
authorities attempting to monitor
terrorist activity.
Technological tools are also being used
to increase surveillance and control over
citizens, whether for legitimate security
concerns or in an attempt to eradicate
criticism and opposition. Restricting
new opportunities for democratic
expression and mobilization,19 and by
consequence the digitally enabled
array of civil, political and economic
rights (such as the right to work and
education; freedom of expression)20 –
just as citizens have become more
connected and engaged – creates a
potentially explosive situation.

Implications for Citizens
and Society
Closing the space for civil society not
only reduces the number of actors
and operations that are protecting
and promoting the common good in
society, but it also potentially increases
the likelihood and impact of the risks,
including:
–
–

diminishing public trust in
institutions;
more resources devoted to
national interests over citizens’
well-being, in a context where
governments pursue specific
agendas without ample prior
consultation with societal actors;21

Implications for Business
Civil society actors are increasingly
looking to the private sector for support
expanding their space to operate.27 The

Societal freedom is economically
beneficial for several reasons. Data
suggest it reduces corruption,29
which imposes costs on business:
the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
puts the annual cost of bribery alone at
around US$1.5 to US$2 trillion, nearly
2% of global GDP, and this is only one
form of corruption.30 Additionally, it is
often the case that restrictions on civil
society represent just the initial sign of
more authoritarian systems impacting
all economic and societal actors.31
Civil society helps to hold economic
actors to account for respecting
basic rights, promoting competition
by creating a more equal playing
field. Indeed, in some countries with
less open societies, companies are
collaborating with civil society actors
to facilitate human rights compliance
reporting and demonstrate compliance
with international standards even if this
is not required by domestic legislation.
Companies operating in countries
where human rights are not respected

and civil society is suppressed run a
potentially high reputational risk from
being associated with environmental or
human rights violations in supply chains
or at production sites.32
Evidence shows that workforce
diversity is good for business,33
implying that busineses benefit from
being located in societies that value
diversity. Brain drain fuelled by unstable
and corrupt environments means that
business loses out on the country’s
top human potential.34 From a talent
management perspective, it can only
be good for companies to be able
to freely move their human capital
across countries, knowing their staff
will not be held back by legal and/or
cultural restrictions challenging global
corporate diversity policies.35
Finally, against the backdrop of ongoing
pressure on economic and societal
actors to deliver on the SDGs through
partnerships and cooperation, it is in
the interest of corporations to promote
an open space where civil society
actors can thrive and cross-sectoral
partnerships develop. Restrictions
to the civic space risks endanger the
ability of businesses to achieve their
SDG targets.

How Could Business Help to Keep
the Civic Space Open?
It is not always straightforward for
business leaders to understand
the nature of their contribution to
promoting open and democratic
systems. There are, however, some
interesting examples of businesses
promoting an inclusive civic space.
Business leaders can promote space
for civil society “behind the scenes”, for
example through lobbying in meetings
with governmental authorities. At the
local level, business associations –
which are also affected by closing
civic space – can help to coordinate
actions such as awareness raising and
lobbying the government.36 In some
cases, companies have assisted civil
society groups by providing in-kind
support, such as meeting space for
activists, or indirect support, including
quietly resisting discriminatory local
practices.37
There are also examples of businesses
publicly working against specific
attempts to limit civil society activities,

A world with limited freedoms and
closing civil space is additionally
deprived of the important economic
value contributed by civil society
organizations. The economic
importance of civil society organizations
is under-researched,25 but some studies
find evidence of impact that could be
lost as their space to operate shrinks.
Back in the 1990s, the Johns Hopkins
Comparative Non-profit Sector Project
quantified the non-profit sector’s
economic contribution in the 22 nations
examined as $1.1 trillion, with nearly 19
million full-time employees and average
expenditure totalling 4.6% of the gross
domestic product. These figures are
likely to be larger now.26

case for business leaders to promote
openness is not always immediately
apparent, because shrinking civil
society space may not directly impact
their core business in the short term.
But studies show a long-term link
between democratic systems and
increases in GDP per capita,28 and
most of the top performers in the World
Bank’s Doing Business ranking are free
countries (Figure 2.2.2).

corruption, as quantitative
and qualitative studies attest to
the contribution of civil society
organizations in reducing illicit
activities;22,23
polarization of views, due to
misinformation or asymmetry of
information across countries and
societal groups;24 and
socio-political and economic
instability as discontent around
governance systems that are not
participatory and accountable
manifests as protests.

as illustrated by technology companies
pulling out of countries over internet
censorship; diamond companies
speaking out against the prosecution
of activists; sportswear manufacturers
publicly supporting the work of
human rights defenders;38 and food
associations bailing out civil society
leaders who had been investigating
abuses in the food industry.39

Part 3

Considering the complex nature of
this challenge, some businesses have
preferred to come together in coalitions
to collectively raise their voice for the
promotion of rights and freedoms in
the contexts they operate. Examples
include the Open for Business
coalition,40 which supports LGBT
(lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender)
diversity across the world.
Increased international solidarity
with affected civil society and
stronger coalitions of businesses to
advance and advocate for human
rights promotion are concrete
recommendations that have been
identified by many organizations as
priorities for action.41

Conclusions
Despite the global nature of closing
civil society space, there is still not
much awareness among businesses,
decision-makers and a good part of
societal actors about this worrisome
pattern and the potential risks it can
engender: increased social and
economic instability, augmented social
polarization, more fragile governance,
and major detriment to basic civil
and political rights that have been
gainfully acquired by many countries
in the past 50 years. More investment
should be put to further study this
phenomenon and quantify it in terms of
lost economic and social opportunities.
With technological innovation creating
new opportunities for social inclusion
and civic empowerment, time is
ripe for all actors to come together
and enable an open civic space by
collectively taking measures and
engaging technology to address this
risk effectively.

Civil society actors do not deny the need for transparency, but regulations
have made it impossible for some organisations to function due to an overload of
reporting requirements. See ICNL 2016b. Restrictions on receipt of foreign funding
have also ensured that organisations have to scale down or stop their activities;

2.3: The Future of Social Protection
Systems

The Future of Work
and Other Challenges
Impacting Social
Protection
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is
fundamentally changing the ways that
people work and live in three main
ways. First, it is untethering some
types of work from a physical location,
making it easier to remotely connect
workers in one region or country to
jobs in another – but also making it less
clear which set of employment laws
and taxes apply, creating greater global
competition for workers, potentially
weakening employment protections
and draining public social protection
coffers.

Finally, the nature of the contract
between employer and employee is
changing, at the same time that the
move to a sharing and collaborative
economy increases the prevalence
of jobs that fall outside the standard
employment contract model. The shift
has some positive implications for
workers, as it potentially offers more
control over when and whether to work
and opportunities to supplement their
incomes – renting out a room through
Airbnb, for example, or driving part-time
for a service such as Uber.
But this shift also has negative
implications: it means workers
can expect more volatility in their
earnings and leaves them without the
employment protections enjoyed by
“standard” employees. The rise of zerohour contracts is one manifestation of
this change. Some governments, such
as the government of New Zealand,
have already banned their use. New
employment models also hinder the
collection of taxes from both employer
and worker, reducing the amount
governments have available to fund
social protections (see Box 2.3.1).
These three transformations are
coinciding with four seismic challenges.
First, demographic pressures are
further straining formal and informal
safety nets. The OECD expects oldage dependency ratios in member
countries to double by 2075 as
populations age and birth rates fall.4

Although there is no agreed-upon
definition of a “nonstandard worker”,
making it difficult to track and
compare numbers globally, the
International Labour Organization
reports that a vast number of
individuals participate in nonstandard
work arrangements of one kind or
another: one-fifth of China’s workforce
holds “temporary” jobs; roughly 11%
of the workforce in the OECD
countries is in temporary employment;
and a significant proportion of the
workforce in emerging economies
such as the Philippines (42%) and
Vietnam (68%) have non-agricultural
informal jobs without basic social or
legal protections or employment
benefits.1
Note
1

See George and Chattopadhyay 2015.

Although this is primarily a problem in
the developed world, China’s elderly
population is projected to almost
double by 2030, and its fertility rate has
dropped from 5.7 in 1969 to 1.6 today.5
The result will be a tripling of China’s
elderly dependency ratio by 2050.6 The
UN expects improvements in longevity
and advances in healthcare treatments
to double aggregate expenses of
the elderly by 2050.7 These factors
put intense pressure on pension and
healthcare systems, and are spurring
countries to increase retirement ages
and encourage older workers to remain
economically active for longer.
Second, persistently low interest rates
are eating into pension value and
exacerbating the funding gap. Chile’s
pension system, for example, currently
pays a replacement income of less than
42% for most retirees, while longevity
has increased by almost 15 years
since 1980. By some calculations,
Chileans may need to increase their
pension contributions to 18% of salary
for men and 14% for women just to
maintain the status quo.8 Without such
supplements, increased life expectancy
could see future generations’ pensions
reduced by almost half.

Part 3

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is
threatening to bring this evolution full
circle: severely underfunded state
social systems are at a breaking point,
employers are backing away from
traditional employment models and
social protection contributions, and
individuals once again are shouldering
a larger share of the risks. As longevity
trends continue to increase and
the threat of the automation of jobs
becomes very real, the sharing of this
risk needs careful rebalancing in order
to minimize potential human suffering.

Second, human labour is being
displaced by automation, robotics
and artificial intelligence. Opinions
differ on the extent of what is possible:
Frey and Osborne’s (2013) study
found that 47% of US employment is
at high risk of being automated over
the next two decades,1 while a 2016
study of 21 Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries, using a different
methodology, concluded that only 9%
of jobs are automatable.2 In general,
lower-skilled workers are more likely to
see their jobs disappear to automation,
increasing their vulnerability and
exacerbating societal inequality.3

Part 2

Social protection systems consist of
policies and programmes designed
to reduce poverty and vulnerability
by helping individuals manage key
economic and social risks, such as
unemployment, exclusion, sickness,
disability and old age. Although
individuals bore virtually all risk
for their own financial well-being
during the First Industrial Revolution
(beginning in 1784), the introduction
of social protections and risk-sharing
among individuals, employers and
governments became increasingly
prevalent in the developed world over
the course of the Second (beginning
in 1870) and Third (1969) Industrial
Revolutions.

Worker”: A Working Definition

Part 1
Part 2
Part 3

Third, mass migration of labour poses
challenges for social protection.
Migration is generally seen as a
net economic positive: the OECD
estimated that immigration in 17 OECD
countries from 2007 to 2009 added
0.35% to GDP on average (0.46% in
the United Kingdom).9 However, large
and sudden inflows of people can put
additional and unpredictable strain
on social systems and resources. In
Europe, for example, the influx of over
1 million migrants in 2015 was more
than four times the number in 2014.10
The United Kingdom’s recent Brexit
decision has been widely perceived

as representing a backlash to the
uncontrolled movement of labour.
China has started requiring foreign
workers to contribute to social security,
although the rules on how pension
benefits can be “cashed out” remain
unclear.
Finally, increasing levels of wealth and
income inequality in many countries
across the developed and developing
world are putting even greater
pressure on fragile or inadequate social
protections, particularly for vulnerable
lower-income groups. In China, the
wealthiest 1% of households own a

third of the country’s wealth, while in
India, the top 1% grew its share of the
country’s wealth from almost 37% in
2000 to 53% in 2016.11 The share of
income going to workers performing
low-skill jobs is decreasing: in the
United States, it declined from 38% to
23% between 1968 and 2013.12 Inability
to address these challenges adequately
through social security systems could
have explosive impacts on social
stability (Box 2.3.2).

Box 2.3.2: Advanced versus Emerging Economies: Differing Challenges and Opportunities
Advanced and emerging economies face different challenges and opportunities for developing social protections that support
economic growth and social stability in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Advanced economies have had the resources to create layered social safety nets, with costs shared across individuals,
employers and government, resulting in many more people than in the developing world enjoying some level of protection
today. For example, the US Social Security programme, funded by employers and workers, was providing benefits to 60 million
people at the end of 2015, while Medicare and Medicaid covered healthcare for 55 million. But such programmes were not
designed for the extreme demographic shifts, chronic healthcare challenges, and the effects of the Fourth Industrial Revolution
that are reshaping societies. Advanced economies face the challenge of reforming them without incurring a crippling debt
burden.
Many emerging market economies arguably have an opportunity to avoid these pitfalls, potentially leapfrogging their wealthier
neighbours by formulating sustainable social protection systems that are responsive to the risks of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution. Brazil, for example, has implemented the largest cash transfer programme in the world, the Bolsa Familia, which
today reaches 55 million of its poorest citizens, costs 30% less per person than more traditional aid programmes, and has
helped lift 36 million people out of extreme poverty.1
Nonetheless, the varying demographic profiles of growth economies pose different challenges. Asia Pacific is the world’s
fastest ageing region, with a 71% increase in the number of people aged 65 years and above projected by 2030. Singapore’s
elderly population will rise from 11% to 20% in the next 15 years; in France, the same shift took 49 years. A rapidly contracting
workforce and reallocation of resources towards elderly healthcare weakens these economies’ fiscal position and erodes the
adequacy and sustainability of pension and social security systems.2
Conversely, India has significant potential to reap a demographic dividend, but its limited capacity to create employment poses
a serious challenge: between 1991 and 2013 the size of the working-age population increased by 300 million, yet the number of
employed only increased by 140 million.3 By 2017, a staggering 93% of Indians will hold jobs without social security benefits.4
Solutions are being sought, as the government launches three mega social security schemes – accident coverage, life
insurance and pensions.
Sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than any other region, with an average birth rate of five to seven children per mother and
little effective birth control.5 This scale of growth undermines efforts to reduce poverty or to create jobs, and youth
unemployment is high – 50% in South Africa. The ability of nations in Sub-Saharan Africa to create sustainable safety nets will
require both political will and economic activity sufficient to create the necessary resources.

The Global Risks Report 2017

Part 1

New systems will need to address gaps
in social protection across typical life
events including periods of education,
raising families, work including career
gaps, retirement, and later elder care
(see Figure 2.3.1). Systems will need to
provide sufficient flexibility to support
individuals following substantially
different life and career paths while
maintaining some inter-group equity,
and bolster individual resilience.

1.

A sustainable social protection system
needs to address the changes and
challenges described above, ensuring
fair payments from employees and
employers during times of earning to
fund payments that ensure appropriate
income support when earnings are

Untethering health and income
protection from individual
employers or jobs
Intermittent, part-time and informal
employment or self-employment,
with frequent career changes, is
becoming the norm in developed
as well as developing economies,13
but most pension systems are still
built on the model of continued
employment throughout life.14
Health benefits are provided
irrespective of employment in most
European nations and Canada,
but continue to be largely tied to
employment in the United States.
Potential responses include
creating portable health and

pension plans to maintain coverage
as workers move geographically
and between employers, or
between periods of formal
employment – by an employer –
and periods of unemployment or
self-employment; and ensuring
that risk and responsibility for
social protection continue to be
shared by the state, employer
and employee. Employers’
contributions to funding social
protections could be recast to
benefit society as a whole rather
than their employees only.

Part 3

not possible. New social protection
systems could include a range of
approaches, with selected innovations
set out below.

2. Revamping pension models
in line with the new realities of
work and ageing
Typically, pension systems,
whether state or occupational,
are diminishing in value because
of worsening tax concessions, a
lower interest-rate environment,

increasing life expectancy,
and increasing regulation and
complexity. Compounding
the problem is the shortened
lifespan of companies,15 which is
undermining the sustainability of
funds from company-sponsored
pension systems.

Part 3

One potential response is to
introduce simpler and more flexible
plans linked to better advice and
guidance. Products need to be
more accessible and flexible to
accommodate unique retiree
needs, providing a secure income
and the flexibility to access capital
when needed for life events other
than retirement. They need to
incorporate affordable options
that allow individuals to manage
longevity and provide better
information about the need to
finance later life, with robo-advice
likely to become the norm.
Another response is for employers
to provide pensions on an optout only basis with default asset
allocations, so the default position
is that employees’ contribution and
investment levels should create
sufficient income in later life.
3. Implementing policies to
increase “flexicurity”
The changing needs of businesses
and individuals in the Fourth
Industrial Revolution require giving
employers access to a flexible
labour force while providing
individuals with the security of
a safety net and active help in
securing employment.
One way to do this is to increase
public spending on active labour
market policies (ALMPs) that either
reduce the cost of labour or help
people find jobs. For example,
Denmark brings together more
flexible rules for hiring and firing
workers with generous guaranteed
unemployment benefits, and
spends 1.5% of its GDP on active
labour market policies to offer
guidance, education, or access to
a job to all unemployed workers
who are looking for one.16
Equalizing rights and benefits for
employees and self-employed
would incentivize entrepreneurship
38

The Global Risks Report 2017

and provide personalized pathways
through the social protection
system rather than offering distinct
protections for different types of
labour. A battle around this issue is
already underway as, for example,
Uber drivers challenge their status
as self-employed independent
contractors in the UK courts.17
4. Implementing alternative models
of income distribution
There are an increasing number of
proposals for fundamentally new
models of income distribution,
which do not tie welfare benefits to
being out of work. These include
a negative income tax, in which
people earning below a certain
threshold receive supplemental
pay from the government;
wage supplements, in which
the government makes up the
difference between what a person
earns and a recognized minimum
income; and a universal basic
income paid to all members of
society regardless of their means.18
Such income distribution systems
would make it much easier for
people to take on part-time work or
intermittent work as desired.
Voters in Switzerland recently
rejected a proposal for a universal
basic income,19 but the idea is
attracting growing interest around
the world. The government of
Finland is considering a pilot
programme that would guarantee
citizens a partial basic income
whether or not they work.20 Other
recent experiments include a pilot
programme funded by UNICEF in
eight villages in Madhya Pradesh,
India, in which every man, woman
and child was provided a monthly
payment without conditions for 18
months. Improvements in the pilot
villages, compared with “control”
villages, were seen in the areas
of sanitation, access to drinking
water, food sufficiency, number of
hours worked, children’s nutrition,
and enrolment levels in secondary
schools, particularly for girls.21
5. Providing greater support for
working into old age
Increasing longevity combined
with reduced pensions means that
many people will need to work into
later life: retirement will become

more of a process than an event,
with part-time or self-employment
continuing possibly well into one’s
80s. Typically, women will be even
more financially disadvantaged
in retirement than men because
women live longer and have
accrued lower pensions because
of career breaks and unequal pay.
Reskilling and lifelong learning
opportunities are one policy
implication, but social protection
systems will also need to be more
flexible.
Among the possible responses
from government and employers
are providing incentives for
deferring retirement, supporting
senior job seekers, and allowing for
partial pension payments while a
worker in retirement works parttime. In Japan, the private sector
– hobbled by the country’s severe
shortage of young workers – is
leading the effort to push back
retirement, with Honda raising its
retirement age to 65, nine years
in advance of the government’s
planned countrywide increase.
Japan’s government invests in
connecting people over 60 to jobs
through specially designated job
resource centres.22 The United
Kingdom offers government
workers the option of increasing
their state pension in exchange
for deferring retirement, with an
increase of almost 6% for each
year deferred.23
As an ageing workforce brings the
challenge of higher disability levels,
another response is to make work
compatible with increasing levels
of disability: the EU Labour Force
Survey (2011) found that 48% of
those reporting a longstanding
health problem were aged 55–64,
and only 12% were aged 15–24.24
In Germany, which faces one of the
world’s most rapidly ageing and
shrinking populations, employers
such as BMW are designing
plants with the physical needs
and limitations of older workers in
mind.25 In Japan, Toyota is making
work more manageable for older
workers by reducing the hours of
retired re-hires.

Part 1

The Time to Act Is Now

Endnotes

As the Fourth Industrial Revolution
accelerates, many individuals –
including lower-skilled workers more
easily displaced by automation,26
part-time and self-employed workers
without access to employer-sponsored
protections, and older workers and
retirees without sufficient savings or
pensions – face a potential crisis.27
There is an urgent need to develop a
comprehensive and interconnected set
of options that adapt social protection
to new-style employment patterns,
reskill workers, and respond to the
opportunities and threats posed by
increasing longevity.

Part 3

Part 2

A failure to take action risks both the
deterioration of government finances
and the exacerbation of social unrest,
especially at this time of slow economic
growth and widening inequality.
The transition from current to new
models will be fragmented and slow,
given political and financial challenges,
and will require collaboration across
all sectors of society – public, private
and civil society. That makes it is all the
more imperative to begin now.

Part 3

Too often the debate about emerging
technologies takes place at the
extremes of possible responses:
among those who focus intently
on the potential gains and others
who dwell on the potential dangers.
The real challenge lies in navigating
between these two poles: building
understanding and awareness of the
trade-offs and tensions we face, and
making informed decisions about how
to proceed. This task is becoming
more pressing as technological change
deepens and accelerates, and as we

Over the years The Global Risks
Report has repeatedly highlighted
technological risks. In the second
edition of the Report, as far back as
2006, echoes of current concerns
were noted in one of the technology
scenarios we considered, in which the
“elimination of privacy reduces social
cohesion”. This was classified as a
worst-case scenario, with a likelihood
of below 1%. In 2013, the Report
discussed the risk of “the rapid spread
of misinformation”, observing that trust
was being eroded and that incentives
were insufficiently aligned to ensure
the maintenance of robust systems of

The emerging technologies of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
will inevitably transform the world in
many ways – some that are desirable
and others that are not. The extent
to which the benefits are maximized
and the risks mitigated will depend
on the quality of governance – the
rules, norms, standards, incentives,
institutions, and other mechanisms
that shape the development and
deployment of each particular
technology.

become more aware of the lagged

impact of earlier waves of innovation.

quality control or fact-checking. Four
years later, this is a growing concern; in
Chapter 2.1, the Report considers the
potential impact of similar trends on the
very fabric of democracy.

Figure 3.1.1: Perceived Benefits and Negative Consequences of 12 Emerging
Technologies

Part 2

In 2015, emerging technology was
one of the Report’s “risks in focus”,
highlighting, among other things, the
ethical dilemmas that exist in areas
such as artificial intelligence (AI) and
biotechnology.

Part 3

This year, the Global Risks Perception
Survey (GRPS) included a special
module on 12 emerging technologies
(see Table 3.1.1). The results suggest
that respondents are broadly optimistic
about the balance of technological
risks and benefits. Figure 3.1.1 shows
that the average score is much higher
for perceived benefits than it is for
negative consequences. However, as
Figure 3.1.2 makes clear, respondents
still identify clear priorities for better
governance of emerging technologies.
The remainder of this chapter highlights
the particular challenges involved
in creating governance regimes for
fast-moving technologies, and then
summarizes the key results of this
year’s GRPS special module on
emerging technology. The chapter
concludes with a discussion of
the profound changes that new
technologies will entail for businesses
and of the cascading effects these
changes may have on the global risk
landscape.

Governance Dilemmas
How to govern emerging technologies
is a complex question. Imposing overly
strict restrictions on the development
of a technology can delay or prevent
potential benefits. But so can continued
regulatory uncertainty: investors will be
reluctant to back the development of
technologies that they fear may later
be banned or shunned if the absence
of effective governance leads to
irresponsible use and a loss of public
confidence.
Ideally, governance regimes should
be stable, predictable and transparent
enough to build confidence among
investors, companies and scientists,
and should generate a sufficient

level of trust and awareness among
the general public to enable users
to evaluate the significance of early
reports of negative consequences.
For example, autonomous vehicles
will inevitably cause some accidents;
whether this leads to calls for bans will
depend on whether people trust the
mechanisms that have been set up to
govern their development.
But governance regimes also need to
be agile and adaptive enough to remain
relevant in the face of rapid changes in
technologies and how they are used.
Unexpected new capabilities can
rapidly emerge where technologies
intersect, or where one technology
provides a platform to advance
technologies in other areas.1
Currently, the governance of emerging
technologies is patchy: some are
regulated heavily, and others hardly at

all because they do not fit under the
remit of any existing regulatory body.
Mechanisms often do not exist for
those responsible for governance to
interact with people at the cutting edge
of research. Even where insights from
the relevant fields can be combined, it
can be hard to anticipate what secondor third-order effects might need to be
safeguarded against: history shows
that the eventual benefits and risks of a
new technology can differ widely from
expert opinion at the outset.2
To the extent that potential trade-offs of
a new technology can be anticipated,
there is scope for debate about how
to approach them. There may be
arguments for allowing a technology to
advance even if it is expected to create
some negative consequences at first, if
there is also a reasonable expectation
that other innovations will create new
ways to mitigate those consequences.

Part 1

Figure 3.1.1 plots respondents’
perceptions of the potential benefits
and negative consequences of the 12
technologies included in the GRPS.
As noted above, the average score for
benefits is much higher than it is for
adverse consequences,3 suggesting
that respondents are optimistic
about the net impact of emerging
technologies as a whole.4 Technologies
considered to have above-average
risks and below-average benefits, in
the upper left quadrant of the figure,
tended to be those where respondents
felt least confident of their own
assessments and also least confident
of the public’s understanding.
Three technologies occupy the
upper-right quadrant of Figure 3.1.1,
indicating an above-average score

for both potential benefits and risks:
artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics,
biotechnologies, and new computing
technologies. Analysis of media
coverage resonates with respondents’
high ranking for the risk associated
with AI: from 2013 to 2016 there was a
steady rise in reporting on whether we
should fear AI technologies.5
Respondents also cited artificial
intelligence (AI) and robotics most
frequently when asked how the 12
emerging technologies exacerbate
the five categories of global risk
covered by The Global Risks Report.
As Figure 3.1.2 illustrates, this was
seen as the most important driver of
risks in the economic, geopolitical and
technological categories.
In Figure 3.1.3, two technologies stand
out as requiring better governance in
the view of GRPS respondents: both
artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics

Part 3

The growing popular awareness of the
dilemmas associated with governing
new technologies is revealed by media
analysis: relevant mentions of such
quandaries in major news sources
doubled between 2013 and 2016.
But which technologies should we
be focusing on? In the latest GRPS,
we asked respondents to assess 12
technologies on their potential benefits
and adverse consequences, public
understanding and need for better
governance.

Technologies that Need
Better Governance

Part 2

Even if there is widespread desire to
restrict the progress of a particular
technology – such as lethal
autonomous weapons systems – there
may be practical difficulties in getting
effective governance mechanisms in
place before the genie is out of the
bottle.

and biotechnologies were cited by
more than 40% of respondents. These
two technologies differ greatly in terms
of the current state of their governance.
Biotechnologies, which involve the
modification of living organisms for
medicinal, agricultural or industrial
uses, tend to be highly regulated.6

issue in 1992 with the Convention
on Biological Diversity, now ratified
by 196 countries.7 AI and robotics,
meanwhile, are only lightly governed
in most parts of the world. As “general
purpose technologies”, in the words
of economic historian Gavin Wright,8
they have applications in many fields
that already have their own governance
regimes. For example, where machine
learning is used in areas such as
online translation, internet search and
speech recognition, it comes under
governance related to the use of
data. Industrial robots are governed
by International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) standards,9 while
domestic robots are primarily governed
by existing product certification
regulations. There is increasing debate
about the governance of AI given
the risks involved, which are further
discussed in Chapter 3.2.

The Disruptive Impact of
Emerging Technologies
The potential of emerging technologies
to disrupt established business
models is large and growing. It is
tempting to think of technological
disruption as involving dramatic
moments of transformation, but in
many areas disruption due to emerging
technologies is already quietly under
way, the result of gradual evolution
rather than radical change. Consider
autonomous vehicles: we are not yet
in a world of vehicles that require little
or no human intervention, but the
technologies that underpin autonomy
are increasingly present in our
“ordinary” cars.
As the technological changes entailed
by the 4IR deepen, so will the strain
on many business models. The
automotive sector remains a good
example. It has been clear for some
time that car manufacturers need
to plan ahead for a world in which
many of the factors that determine
current levels of car ownership may
no longer be present. Increasing
evidence of this planning is now
starting to shape commercial decisionmaking. For example, in December
2016, Volkswagen launched a new
“mobility services” venture, MOIA, in

recognition of “an ever-stronger trend
away from owning a vehicle towards
shared mobility as well as mobility on
demand”.10
The deep interconnectedness of
global risks means that technological
transitions can exert a multiplier effect
on the risk landscape. This does
not apply only to newly emerging
technologies: arguably much of the
recent social and political volatility that
is discussed in Parts 1 and 2 of this
year’s Global Risks Report reflects,
in part at least, the lagged impact of
earlier periods of technological change.
One obvious channel through which
technological change can lead to
wider disruption is the labour market,
with incomes pushed down and
unemployment pushed up in affected
sectors and geographical regions. This
in turn can lead to disruptive social
instability, in line with the GRPS finding
this year that the most important
interconnection of global risks is the
pairing of unemployment and social
instability.
Another prism through which to look
at the interaction of risks and emerging
technologies is that of liability – or, to
put it another way, the question of
who is left bearing which risks as a
result of technological change. There
are multiple potential sources of

The overall average response for benefits to emerge from emerging technologies
was 5.6, equating to a likelihood of above 55% and below 75%. This contrasts
sharply with the average of 3.8 for negative consequences, equating to an assessed
likelihood of between 25% and 45%.
4
It is noteworthy that no single technology was, on average, assessed to present
negative consequences at a higher likelihood than its benefits. The technology with
the lowest net benefits in this regard was Geoengineering, with the fourth highest
assessment of negative consequences overall and the lowest assessment of
benefits. At the other end of the scale, the technology with the greatest assessed net
benefit was Energy capture, storage and transmission.

disruption here. The insurance sector
is an obvious example when talking
about liability; just as car manufacturers
must prepare for a future of driverless
vehicles, so the reduction in accidents
this future would entail means
insurance companies must prepare
for plummeting demand for car
insurance.11 But the idea of liability can
also be understood more broadly, to
include the kind of social structures and
institutions discussed in Chapter 2.3
on social protection. Already there are
signs of strain in these institutions, such
as mounting uncertainty about the
rights and responsibilities of workers
and employers in the “gig economy”.
One of the challenges of responding
to accelerating technological change
in the 4IR will be ensuring that
the evolution of our critical social
infrastructure keeps pace.

3.2: Assessing the Risk of Artificial
Intelligence

with novel but effective tactics (Box
3.2.1). In combination with robotics,
AI applications are already affecting
employment and shaping risks related
to social inequality.8

Every step forward in artificial
intelligence (AI) challenges assumptions
about what machines can do.
Myriad opportunities for economic
benefit have created a stable flow
of investment into AI research
and development, but with the
opportunities come risks to decisionmaking, security and governance.
Increasingly intelligent systems
supplanting both blue- and white-collar
employees are exposing the fault lines
in our economic and social systems
and requiring policy-makers to look for
measures that will build resilience to the
impact of automation.

AI has great potential to augment
human decision-making by countering
cognitive biases and making rapid
sense of extremely large data sets:
at least one venture capital firm has
already appointed an AI application
to help determine its financial
decisions.9 Gradually removing human
oversight can increase efficiency and
is necessary for some applications,
such as automated vehicles. However,
there are dangers in coming to depend
entirely on the decisions of AI systems
when we do not fully understand
how the systems are making those
decisions.10

Leading entrepreneurs and scientists
are also concerned about how to
engineer intelligent systems as these
systems begin implicitly taking on
social obligations and responsibilities,
and several of them penned an Open
Letter on Research Priorities for Robust
and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence
in late 2015.1 Whether or not we are
comfortable with AI may already be
moot: more pertinent questions might
be whether we can and ought to
build trust in systems that can make
decisions beyond human oversight that
may have irreversible consequences.

Growing Investment,
Benefits and Potential Risk
By providing new information and
improving decision-making through
data-driven strategies, AI could
potentially help to solve some of the
complex global challenges of the 21st
century, from climate change and
resource utilization to the impact of
population growth and healthcare
issues. Start-ups specializing in AI
applications received US$2.4 billion
in venture capital funding globally in
2015 and more than US$1.5 billion
in the first half of 2016.2 Government
programmes and existing technology
companies add further billions (Figure
3.2.1). Leading players are not just
hiring from universities, they are hiring
the universities: Amazon, Google

48

The Global Risks Report 2017

and Microsoft have moved to funding
professorships and directly acquiring
university researchers in the search for
competitive advantage.3
Machine learning techniques are now
revealing valuable patterns in large data
sets and adding value to enterprises
by tackling problems at a scale beyond
human capability. For example,
Stanford’s computational pathologist
(C-Path) has highlighted unnoticed
indicators for breast cancer by
analysing thousands of cellular features
on hundreds of tumour images,4 while
DeepMind increased the power usage
efficiency of Alphabet Inc.’s data
centres by 15%.5 AI applications can
reduce costs and improve diagnostics
with staggering speed and surprising
creativity.
The generic term AI covers a wide
range of capabilities and potential
capabilities. Some serious thinkers
fear that AI could one day pose an
existential threat: a “superintelligence”
might pursue goals that prove not
to be aligned with the continued
existence of humankind. Such fears
relate to “strong” AI or “artificial general
intelligence” (AGI), which would be the
equivalent of human-level awareness,
but which does not yet exist.6 Current
AI applications are forms of “weak”
or “narrow” AI or “artificial specialized
intelligence” (ASI); they are directed
at solving specific problems or
taking actions within a limited set of
parameters, some of which may be
unknown and must be discovered and
learned.
Tasks such as trading stocks, writing
sports summaries, flying military planes
and keeping a car within its lane on the
highway are now all within the domain
of ASI. As ASI applications expand,
so do the risks of these applications
operating in unforeseeable ways or
outside the control of humans.7 The
2010 and 2015 stock market “flash
crashes” illustrate how ASI applications
can have unanticipated real-world
impacts, while AlphaGo shows how
ASI can surprise human experts

Risks to Decision-Making,
Security and Safety
In any complex and chaotic system,
including AI systems, potential
dangers include mismanagement,
design vulnerabilities, accidents and
unforeseen occurrences.11 These
pose serious challenges to ensuring
the security and safety of individuals,
governments and enterprises. It may
be tolerable for a bug to cause an AI
mobile phone application to freeze or
misunderstand a request, for example,
but when an AI weapons system
or autonomous navigation system
encounters a mistake in a line of code,
the results could be lethal.
Machine-learning algorithms can also
develop their own biases, depending
on the data they analyse. For example,
an experimental Twitter account
run by an AI application ended up
being taken down for making socially
unacceptable remarks;12 search engine
algorithms have also come under fire
for undesirable race-related results.13
Decision-making that is either fully
or partially dependent on AI systems
will need to consider management
protocols to avoid or remedy such
outcomes.
AI systems in the Cloud are of particular
concern because of issues of control
and governance. Some experts

Box 3.2.1: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Warfare - by Jean-Marc Rickli, Geneva Centre for Security
Policy

One sector that saw the huge disruptive potential of AI from an early stage is the military. The weaponization of AI will
represent a paradigm shift in the way wars are fought, with profound consequences for international security and stability.
Serious investment in autonomous weapon systems (AWS) began a few years ago; in July 2016 the Pentagon’s Defense
Science Board published its first study on autonomy, but there is no consensus yet on how to regulate the development of
these weapons.
The international community started to debate the emerging technology of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) in
the framework of the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapon (CCW) in 2014. Yet, so far, states have not
agreed on how to proceed. Those calling for a ban on AWS fear that human beings will be removed from the loop, leaving
decisions on the use lethal force to machines, with ramifications we do not yet understand.
There are lessons here from non-military applications of AI. Consider the example of AlphaGo, the AI Go-player created by
Google’s DeepMind division, which in March last year beat the world’s second-best human player. Some of AlphaGo’s
moves puzzled observers, because they did not fit usual human patterns of play. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis
explained the reason for this difference as follows: “unlike humans, the AlphaGo program aims to maximize the probability
of winning rather than optimizing margins”. If this binary logic – in which the only thing that matters is winning while the
margin of victory is irrelevant – were built into an autonomous weapons system, it would lead to the violation of the principle
of proportionality, because the algorithm would see no difference between victories that required it to kill one adversary or
1,000.
Autonomous weapons systems will also have an impact on strategic stability. Since 1945, the global strategic balance has
prioritized defensive systems – a priority that has been conducive to stability because it has deterred attacks. However, the
strategy of choice for AWS will be based on swarming, in which an adversary’s defence system is overwhelmed with a
concentrated barrage of coordinated simultaneous attacks. This risks upsetting the global equilibrium by neutralizing the
defence systems on which it is founded. This would lead to a very unstable international configuration, encouraging
escalation and arms races and the replacement of deterrence by pre-emption.
We may already have passed the tipping point for prohibiting the development of these weapons. An arms race in
autonomous weapons systems is very likely in the near future. The international community should tackle this issue with the
utmost urgency and seriousness because, once the first fully autonomous weapons are deployed, it will be too late to go
back.

propose that robust AI systems should
run in a “sandbox” – an experimental
space disconnected from external
systems – but some cognitive services
already depend on their connection
to the internet. The AI legal assistant
ROSS, for example, must have access
to electronically available databases.
IBM’s Watson accesses electronic
journals, delivers its services, and
even teaches a university course via
the internet.14 The data extraction
program TextRunner is successful
precisely because it is left to explore
the web and draw its own conclusions
unsupervised.15
On the other hand, AI can help solve
cybersecurity challenges. Currently
AI applications are used to spot
cyberattacks and potential fraud in
internet transactions. Whether AI
applications are better at learning
to attack or defend will determine
whether online systems become more
secure or more prone to successful
cyberattacks.16 AI systems are already
analysing vast amounts of data from
phone applications and wearables;
as sensors find their way into our
appliances and clothing, maintaining
security over our data and our
accounts will become an even more
crucial priority. In the physical world,
AI systems are also being used in
surveillance and monitoring – analysing
video and sound to spot crime, help
with anti-terrorism and report unusual
activity.17 How much they will come to
reduce overall privacy is a real concern.

Can AI Be Governed –
Now or in the Future?
So far, AI development has occurred in
the absence of almost any regulatory
environment.18 As AI systems inhabit
more technologies in daily life, calls
for regulatory guidelines will increase.
But can AI systems be sufficiently
governed? Such governance
would require multiple layers that
include ethical standards, normative
expectations of AI applications,
implementation scenarios, and
assessments of responsibility and
accountability for actions taken by or
on behalf of an autonomous AI system.

50

The Global Risks Report 2017

AI research and development presents
issues that complicate standard
approaches to governance, and
can take place outside of traditional
institutional frameworks, with both
people and machines and in various
locations. The developments in AI
may not be well understood by policymakers who do not have specialized
knowledge of the field; and they may
involve technologies that are not an
issue on their own but that collectively
present emergent properties that
require attention.19 It would be difficult
to regulate such things before they
happen, and any unforeseeable
consequences or control issues may

be beyond governance once they
occur (Box 3.2.2).
One option could be to regulate
the technologies through which
the systems work. For example,
in response to the development
of automated transportation that
will require AI systems, the U.S.
Department of Transportation has
issued a 116 page policy guide.20
Although the policy guide does not
address AI applications directly,
it does put in place guidance
frameworks for the developers of
automated vehicles in terms of safety,
control and testing.

Box 3.2.2: Aligning the Values of Humans and AI Machines - by
Stuart Russell, University of California, Berkeley
Few in the field believe that there are intrinsic limits to machine intelligence, and
even fewer argue for self-imposed limits. Thus it is prudent to anticipate the
possibility that machines will exceed human capabilities, as Alan Turing posited in
1951: “If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we do. … [T]his
new danger … is certainly something which can give us anxiety.”
So far, the most general approach to creating generally intelligent machines is to
provide them with our desired objectives and with algorithms for finding ways to
achieve those objectives. Unfortunately, we may not specify our objectives in such
a complete and well-calibrated fashion that a machine cannot find an undesirable
way to achieve them. This is known as the “value alignment” problem, or the “King
Midas” problem. Turing suggested “turning off the power at strategic moments” as
a possible solution to discovering that a machine is misaligned with our true
objectives, but a superintelligent machine is likely to have taken steps to prevent
interruptions to its power supply.
How can we define problems in such a way that any solution the machine finds will
be provably beneficial? One idea is to give a machine the objective of maximizing
the true human objective, but without initially specifying that true objective: the
machine has to gradually resolve its uncertainty by observing human actions,
which reveal information about the true objective. This uncertainty should avoid
the single-minded and potentially catastrophic pursuit of a partial or erroneous
objective. It might even persuade a machine to leave open the possibility of
allowing itself to be switched off.
There are complications: humans are irrational, inconsistent, weak-willed,
computationally limited and heterogeneous, all of which conspire to make learning
about human values from human behaviour a difficult (and perhaps not totally
desirable) enterprise. However, these ideas provide a glimmer of hope that an
engineering discipline can be developed around provably beneficial systems,
allowing a safe way forward for AI. Near-term developments such as intelligent
personal assistants and domestic robots will provide opportunities to develop
incentives for AI systems to learn value alignment: assistants that book employees
into US$20,000-a-night suites and robots that cook the cat for the family dinner
are unlikely to prove popular.

Part 1

Superintelligence could potentially also
be achieved by augmenting human
intelligence through smart systems,
biotech, and robotics rather than by
being embodied in a computational
or robotic form.23 Potential barriers to
integrating humans with intelligenceaugmenting technology include
people’s cognitive load, physical
acceptance and concepts of personal
identity.24 Should these challenges be
overcome, keeping watch over the
state of converging technologies will
become an ever more important task
as AI capabilities grow and fuse with
other technologies and organisms.
Advances in computing technologies
such as quantum computing,
parallel systems, and neurosynaptic
computing research may create new
opportunities for AI applications or
unleash new unforeseen behaviours in
computing systems.25 New computing
technologies are already having an
impact: for instance, IBM’s TrueNorth
chip – with a design inspired by the
human brain and built for “exascale”
computing – already has contracts
from Lawrence Livermore National

Conclusion
Both existing ASI systems and the
plausibility of AGI demand mature
consideration. Major firms such as
Microsoft, Google, IBM, Facebook and
Amazon have formed the Partnership
on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit
People and Society to focus on
ethical issues and helping the public
better understand AI.27 AI will become
ever more integrated into daily life as
businesses employ it in applications
to provide interactive digital interfaces
and services, increase efficiencies and
lower costs.28 Superintelligent systems
remain, for now, only a theoretical
threat, but artificial intelligence is here
to stay and it makes sense to see
whether it can help us to create a better
future. To ensure that AI stays within the
boundaries that we set for it, we must
continue to grapple with building trust
in systems that will transform our social,
political and business environments,
make decisions for us, and become an
indispensable faculty for interpreting
the world around us.

Part 3

The creation of AGI may depend on
converging technologies and hybrid
platforms. Much of human intelligence
is developed by the use of a body and
the occupation of physical space, and
robotics provides such embodiment
for experimental and exploratory AI
applications. Proof-of-concept for
muscle and brain–computer interfaces
has already been established:
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) scientists have shown that
memories can be encoded in silicon,21
and Japanese researchers have used
electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns
to predict the next syllable someone
will say with up to 90% accuracy,
which may lead to the ability to control
machines simply by thinking.22

Laboratory in California to work on
nuclear weapons security.26 While
adding great benefit to scenario
modelling today, the possibility of a
superintelligence could turn this into a
risk.

Part 2

Scholars, philosophers, futurists
and tech enthusiasts vary in their
predictions for the advent of artificial
general intelligence (AGI), with timelines
ranging from the 2030s to never.
However, given the possibility of an AGI
working out how to improve itself into a
superintelligence, it may be prudent –
or even morally obligatory – to consider
potentially feasible scenarios, and how
serious or even existential threats may
be avoided.

3.3: Physical Infrastructure Networks
and the Fourth Industrial Revolution

Because physical infrastructure
networks are often natural monopolies
as a result of barriers to entry, the
public sector typically either provides
those networks or regulates them on
behalf of their users. Regulators have
to tread the delicate line between
setting affordable tariffs and ensuring
that capital can be found to invest in
maintaining and renewing networks.
The pendulum has swung between
private and public capital funding of

Price (US$/W)

The value of a physical infrastructure
network increases with its scope. In
communications (transport, digital), the
more people a network connects, the
more useful it becomes. In resource
networks (energy, water), connecting
more people can help build resilience
and leverage economies of scale.
Costs are high relative to returns in
the early stages of building a network,
and also later when connecting
geographically remote areas with
low population density: extending
coverage to such areas usually requires
government intervention, although
4IR technologies may shake up that
economic logic by drastically cutting
the costs of connectivity.

With tight public finances, governments
and regulators are having to devise
mechanisms for leveraging private
finance while seeking to avoid the
inflexibility and questions over value for
money that have dogged public-private
infrastructure finance in the past. It
is still unclear how the enormous
investment needs for some kinds of
infrastructure are going to be met.

All of that is now changing. Collapsing
prices of photo-voltaic cells make solar
panels price-competitive with largescale generation (Figure 3.3.1). The cost
of offshore wind is also dropping fast,
with firms such as DONG Energy and
Vattenfall bidding prices down as low
as €60 per Megawatt hour. Innovation
in storage technology is helping with
intermittency challenges – from largescale storage to household battery

The Economic
Characteristics of
Infrastructure Networks

infrastructure: for example, private
financiers backed the creation of
railway networks in Europe and North
America in the 19th century, some
losing their shirts. But much of today’s
ageing physical infrastructure in
advanced economies was built with
public funding during the 20th century.
Britain led the way in utility privatization
in the 1980s and 1990s, and it has
generally improved asset management
and reduced costs for customers. On
the other hand, private finance has
typically shied away from large and
risky new assets, such as nuclear
reactors. Uncertainties related to the
4IR play a part in that reluctance.

Electricity powered the Second
and Third Industrial Revolutions, as
networks achieved economies of
scale by connecting large plants over
high-voltage transmission grids to
local distribution networks reaching
many users. This aggregation of users
helped to smooth out much of the
local variation in demand, so steadyrunning base-load plants could be
the workhorses of the network, with
extra capacity patched in to deal with
daily and seasonal peaks. Prohibitively
high barriers to entry meant there was
little competitive pressure to reduce
the significant amount of energy
lost as waste heat in the generation,
transmission and distribution of
electricity.

Part 2

Since the appearance of railways and
canals, industrial revolutions have been
characterized by the transformation
of physical infrastructure networks as
much as by production methods. Now
the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is
shaking up the interdependent set of
critical physical infrastructure networks
on which we all depend, including
transport (road, rail, waterways,
airports); energy (electricity, heat, fuel
supply: gas, liquid and solid); digital
communications (fixed, mobile);
water (supply, waste water treatment,
flood protection); and solid waste
(collection, treatment, disposal). This
process brings huge opportunities for
innovation, but also complex risks.

The Revolution

Part 1

units and plugged-in electric vehicles,
which will provide an additional buffer.
The 4IR is moving electricity networks
away from needing to be large-scale,
top-down systems.
Part 2
Part 3

Technological innovations will
increasingly offer households and
firms the possibility of going “off-grid”
entirely – but even if they increasingly
generate their own power, most are still
likely to want to remain connected to
the high-voltage networks that are the
backbone of today’s electricity supply
systems. Indeed, the rising use of
solar, wind and tide power – with their
associated intermittency issues and
their greater need to tap the energy
storage possibilities of hydropower in
mountainous regions – will increase
the appeal of high-voltage connections
over long distances. But the growing
scope for businesses and homes to
supply and store their own electricity
will make electricity networks multiscale and less “lumpy” in terms of their
capital requirements.

Beyond supply and storage,
technology is improving efficiency by
integrating supply and demand. Until
very recently, energy suppliers and
network operators have had to rely on
crude methods to forecast demand for
electricity. Big data, pervasive sensors
and the Internet of Things are making it
easier for users to monitor and control
their energy demand, and for grids to
predict and manage energy supply. In
a world of prosumers and distributed
suppliers, the challenges are how to
synchronize supply and demand and
pay for resilience.
Water could also transition from
centralized networks towards more
distributed systems. New materials and
sensor technologies allow treatment
at the household or community level,
creating opportunities to harvest
rainwater and directly reuse waste
water. For the time being, economies
of scale still favour large, centralized
plants in existing urban areas: they
also allow utilities to monitor water

quality centrally and address failures
quickly. Relying on localized water
storage would also create challenges
in prolonged periods of drought. But
centralized networks are costly to
create, and the balance of costs and
benefits is beginning to tip in favour of
distributed water systems if cities can
be planned for these systems from the
outset.
Regarding communications, the
4IR will continue to shift the balance
between mobile and fixed networks.
To improve mobile broadband, 5G
technologies are envisaged to provide
much faster data transfer (>1 Gigabyte
per second) and reduced end-to-end
latency (sub-1ms). By consolidating
existing layers of technology, such as
2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi, 5G will also
improve coverage and ‘always-on’
reliability – it is an ensemble of different
technologies, rather than a single
type of new technology. Although
the experience of those previous
technologies suggests that new uses

Ultra-reliable and low latency
communications

Part 1

While improving some infrastructure
assets, the 4IR promises to ease
pressure on others by finding
alternative ways to deliver the same
functionality. For example, meeting
in virtual reality is becoming an
increasingly acceptable substitute for
physical business travel, while drones
may substitute for delivery vans in
cities. Satellite technologies will help to
fill the gaps in digital connectivity where
fixed or terrestrial mobile technologies
are not cost-effective. Where energy
companies once defined themselves
by their physical infrastructure assets,
they increasingly see themselves as
being in the business of providing
specific services such as heating and
lighting. As the 4IR creates new ways
to deliver services, it may begin to
challenge whether infrastructure should
be seen as a special category at all.

In theory, greater connectivity
brings intrinsic resilience: electricity
networks with more supply points,
for example, should be less prone
to failure. However, as different
infrastructure networks become more
interdependent, there is also growing
scope for systemic failures to cascade
across networks and affect society in

multiple ways. In particular, electricity
networks are now assuming an
increasingly central role in many areas
of life, such as road transportation and
heating (taking over from gas and liquid
fuels).
Systemic risks can come from
many directions – whether these are
cyberattacks or software glitches,
solar storms or even just unexpectedly

Box 3.3.1: Mapping Infrastructure Vulnerability to Natural
Hazards

Part 3

Governments are facing a difficult
decision about whether to be first
movers in rolling out 5G or wait to
learn lessons from first movers, in the
expectation that costs will decrease.
For now, the bandwidth of fibre-optic
cables remains hard to beat – but it
is also expensive in towns and cities:
80% of the costs are attached not to
the technology itself but to the labourintensive process of digging trenches
and laying ducts. Uncertainty about
future technological development can
inhibit investment: is it better to dig
trenches for cables or wait for 5G? The
same dilemma applies to other types of
infrastructure – for example, in the time
it takes to roll out smart metres, new
and better metres are being developed.

The Risks

An “infrastructure criticality hotspot” is defined as a geographical location
where there is a concentration of critical infrastructure, measured according to
the number of customers directly or indirectly dependent upon it. In the map of
China below, red spots indicate where the highest numbers of people and
businesses would be affected if a natural disaster caused infrastructure failure.
According to this research, from the Environmental Change Institute at the
University of Oxford, China’s top infrastructure hotspots are Beijing, Tianjin,
Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang.
Given the scale of China’s manufacturing production and its role in the global
supply chain, the business impacts of natural disasters could be astronomical:
flooding in the more economically developed coastal provinces already
accounts for more than 60% of the country’s losses due to flooding.1 The
Oxford study finds that severe flooding events could disrupt infrastructure (rail,
aviation, shipping and water) services for an average of 103 million people,
while drought could affect an average of 6 million electricity users.

for 5G will emerge after deployment,
two key roles are already anticipated for
5G: providing gigabit connectivity for
businesses and consumers for a range
of content, applications and services
(the top of the pyramid); and enabling
ultra-reliable, low latency machineto-machine (M2M) communication
(the bottom of the pyramid), which
will help to achieve objectives in other
infrastructure systems, such as easing
congestion (Figure 3.3.2).

widespread and persistent clouds
– and the increased complexity
bring brought about by the 4IR
makes the severity of those risks
very difficult to estimate (Box 3.3.1).
Society is increasingly dependent
on information and communication
technology networks in particular, and
these have their own dependencies
and vulnerabilities. In a 20th-century
electricity network, it is possible to
analyse the consequences of any
given sub-station failing. That becomes
impossible when every household
is supplying and storing electricity
and constantly adapting how much
it uses based on price signals: we
may suspect that our networks are
acceptably resilient, but we cannot
model them accurately enough to be
sure.
Because the 4IR intensifies networks’
reliance on each other, there is a need
for information sharing – utility providers
tend to understand their own systems
well, while often being more or less
in the dark about the resilience of the
systems to which they are connected.
However, concerns about commercial
confidentiality and security increase
the challenge of developing protocols
for information sharing that would help
dependent customers to understand
their risks. Not only infrastructure
providers but also businesses need to
understand risks and resilience more
fully: analysis of supply chain risk tends
to focus more on physical sites than
the infrastructure networks that sustain
those sites and move goods and
services between them.

Governance of
Infrastructure Networks in
the 4IR
Like infrastructure networks
themselves, arrangements for their
governance have evolved incrementally
and mostly siloed by sector – not least
because ownership arrangements can
be so different, ranging from highly
competitive privatized markets (e.g.
in mobile phone provision) through
regulated monopolies, public-private
partnerships, state-owned enterprises
and direct public provision.1
Governments are increasingly
recognizing that this fragmented
approach is becoming unfit for purpose
56

The Global Risks Report 2017

in the 4IR. As networks become
interconnected – for example, as
digital technologies enable the routing
of vehicles and the management
of electricity and water demand – a
“system-of-systems” approach to
governance is needed. That requires
appropriate sharing of information
among network operators, and also
requires regulators adopting common
principles across networks.
Just as network operators and
businesses need to better understand
and manage systemic risks,
governments and regulators need to
take a wider view. Examples of new
governance structures that recognize
the need for a more integrated
approach include the National
Infrastructure Commission in the United
Kingdom, Infrastructure Australia, and
the National Infrastructure Unit in New
Zealand. These new entities are having
to navigate tensions between taking
a national-level strategic approach to
articulating needs for infrastructure to
support growth and productivity and
creating space for competition and
innovation.
While the 4IR is creating complex
new challenges for planners and
regulators, it is also providing powerful
new tools for monitoring and analysing
system performance at hitherto
unprecedented spatial and temporal
scales – and testing resilience through
simulation. Modelling exercises in
a virtual environment will never give
infallible results, but in itself the exercise
of constructing and testing models can
help to expose vulnerabilities in system
resilience. Alongside their traditional
role of minimizing the harmful effects
of natural monopolies, infrastructure
regulators in the 4IR should be paying
more attention to systemic risks,
building technical capabilities and
standards for information sharing and
stress testing.

Conclusion

The 12th edition of The Global Risks
Report is published at a time when
deep-rooted social and economic
trends are manifesting themselves
increasingly disruptively across the
world. Persistent inequality, particularly
in the context of comparative global
economic weakness, risks
undermining the legitimacy of market
capitalism. At the same time,
deepening social and cultural
polarization risks impairing national
decision-making processes and
obstructing vital global collaboration.
Technology continues to offer us the
hope of solutions to many of the
problems we face. But the pace of
technological change is also having
unsettling effects: these range from
disrupting labour markets through
automation to exacerbating political
divisions by encouraging the creation
of rigid communities of like-minded
citizens. We need to become better at
managing technological change, and
we need to do it quickly.
Above all, we must redouble our efforts
to protect and strengthen our systems
of global collaboration. Nowhere is this
more urgent than in relation to the
environment, where important strides
have been made in the past year but
where much more remains to be done.
This is a febrile time for the world. We
face important risks, but also
opportunities to take stock and to work
together to find new solutions to our
shared problems. More than ever, this
is a time for all stakeholders to
recognize the role they can play by
exercising responsible and responsive
leadership on global risks.

Appendix B: Global Risks Perception Survey and 				
Methodology 2016

Definitions and Changes
The Global Risks Report 2017 is based
on an improved methodology; however
the results are therefore largely
comparable. The Report adopts the
following definitions of global risk and
trend:
Global risk: an uncertain event or
condition that, if it occurs, can cause
significant negative impact for several
countries or industries within the next 10
years.
Trend: a “trend” is defined as a longterm pattern that is currently evolving
and that could contribute to amplifying
global risks and/or altering the
relationship between them.
The list of risks and trends assessed in
the Global Risks Perception Surveys
(GRPS) remains unchanged with the
exception of the addition of the global
risk “Failure of regional or global
governance” (defined as the inability of
regional or global institutions to resolve
issues of economic, geopolitical or
environmental importance). As a result,
the Report covers 30 global risks this
year.
Some of the names of the trends were
modified to better reflect long-term
pattern characteristic of trends (for
instance, the trend “rise of chronic
diseases” was edited to “rising chronic
diseases”). The definitions were mainly
unchanged.
This year’s GRPS included an entire
section on emerging technologies. After
consultations with experts, 12 critical
emerging technologies were identified;
selected findings are described in Part 3
of the Report.
The following section describes the
survey and methodology in greater
detail.

The Global Risks
Perceptions Survey
The Global Risks Perception Survey
(GRPS), discussed in Part 1, is the main
instrument used to assess global risks
in this Report. The survey was
conducted between early September
and mid-October 2016 (from 07
September to 15 October 2016) among
the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities of
leaders from business, government,
academia and non-governmental and
international organizations as well as
members of the Institute of Risk
Management.
This year, the GRPS is a key instrument
used as supporting data for the
elaboration of the Report. For this year’s
Report, the GRPS went through an
important review to ensure the quality of
the results. This process was performed
in collaboration with the Global Risks
Perception Survey Review Group on
The Global Risks Report 2017, a group
composed of experts in survey
methodology and risks perception (see
Acknowledgements section).
Among the most significant
improvements are the changes to the
scales of the Global Risks Landscape.
Indeed, the impact scale has changed
this year from an abstract 1–7 scale,
subject to interpretation and thus bias,
to a more substantive and meaningful
scale of impact measurement (i.e.
minimal, minor, moderate, severe,
catastrophic). On the likelihood scale,
the scale of 1–7 was kept but a
particular probability was attached to
each number in order to ensure that all
respondents had the same
understanding of the likelihood being
considered. Throughout the survey, the
questions were modified and the
phrasing was refined to reduce any
ambiguity.

Raw responses were cleaned in order to
improve overall data quality and
completeness. Surveys with a
completion rate below 50% were
dropped, reducing the number of
available responses from 989 to 745.
The respondents did not provide
sufficient information about their gender
or the sector in which they work in 92
and 119 cases, respectively. Similarly,
93 respondents did not indicate the
country in which they are based.
Figure B.1 presents the profile of the 745
survey respondents remaining in the
sample. To capture the voice of youth,
the survey also targeted the World
Economic Forum’s community of Global
Shapers.1 Respondents under 30
accounted for about one-fifth of total
respondents.

Analysis
The Global Risks Landscape 2017
(Figure 3)
Respondents were asked to assess the
likelihood and global impact of each of
the 30 risks. For each risk, they were
asked, “What is the likelihood of [the
risk] occurring globally within the next
10 years?” and “What is the negative
impact for several countries or industries
within the next 10 years?” For the first
question, the possible answers ranged
from 1 (“extremely unlikely” with an
associated probability of occurrence
lower than 5%) to 7 (“extremely likely”
with an associated probability of
occurrence greater than 95%). For the
question on impact, respondents could
select one of five choices: “minimal”,
“minor”, “moderate”, “severe”, or
“catastrophic”. These five alternatives
were turned into a 1–5 scale (1 =
minimal, 5 = catastrophic). It is worth
noting that, as a consequence of the
scale modification, the impact results
cannot be compared with those of
previous years.

Respondents could also choose “No
Opinion” if they felt unable to provide an
informed answer. Respondents could
also leave the question completely
blank. For each risk, partial responses
– those assessing only the likelihood of
occurrence or only its impact – were
dropped. A simple average for both
likelihood and impact for each of the 30
global risks was calculated on this
basis.

The Global Risks Interconnections
Map 2017 (Figure 4) and the RisksTrends Interconnections Map 2017
(Figure 1)
To draw the Global Risks
Interconnections Map (Figure 4, inside
rear cover), survey respondents were
asked to answer the following question:
“Global risks are not isolated and it is
important to assess their
interconnections. In your view, which are
the most strongly connected global
risks? Please select three to six pairs of
global risks.”
Similarly, for the Risks-Trends
Interconnections Map 2017 (Figure 1,
inside front cover), respondents had to
identify up to three trends that they
consider important in shaping the global
agenda in the next 10 years and the
three risks that are driven by each of
those trends. For completeness, the
two questions read “Which are the three
most important trends that will shape
global development in the next 10
years?” and “For each of the three
trends identified in the previous

question, select up to three global risks
that are most strongly driven by these
trends.” The information thereby
obtained was used to construct the
Risks-Trend Interconnections Map 2017.
In both cases, a tally was made of the
number of times each pair was cited.
This value was then divided by the
count of the most frequently cited pair.
As a final step, the square root of this
ratio was taken to dampen
the long-tail
