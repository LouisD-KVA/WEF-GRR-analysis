Preface
Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman
Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director

In 2006, the Global Risks Report sounded the alarm
on pandemics and other health-related risks. That
year, the report warned that a “lethal flu, its spread
facilitated by global travel patterns and uncontained
by insufficient warning mechanisms, would present
an acute threat.” Impacts would include “severe
impairment of travel, tourism and other service
industries, as well as manufacturing and retail supply
chains” while “global trade, investor risk appetites
and consumption demand” could see longer-term
harms. A year later, the report presented a pandemic
scenario that illustrated, among other effects, the
amplifying role of “infodemics” in exacerbating
the core risk. Subsequent editions have stressed
the need for global collaboration in the face of
antimicrobial resistance (8th edition, 2013), the Ebola
crisis (11th edition, 2016), biological threats (14th
edition, 2019), and overstretched health systems (15th
edition, 2020), among other topics.
In 2020, the risk of a global pandemic became reality.
As governments, businesses and societies survey
the damage inflicted over the last year, strengthening
strategic foresight is now more important than
ever. With the world more attuned to risk, there is
an opportunity to leverage attention and find more
effective ways to identify and communicate risk to
decision-makers.
It is in this context that we publish the 16th edition of
the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report.
Our analysis centres on the risks and consequences
of widening inequalities and societal fragmentation. In
some cases, disparities in health outcomes, technology,
or workforce opportunities are the direct result of the
dynamics the pandemic created. In others, alreadypresent societal divisions have widened, straining weak

safety nets and economic structures beyond capacity.
Whether the gaps can be narrowed will depend on the
actions taken in the wake of COVID-19 to rebuild with a
view towards an inclusive and accessible future. Inaction
on economic inequalities and societal divisiveness may
further stall action on climate change—still an existential
threat to humanity.
Growing societal fragmentation—manifested
through persistent and emerging risks to human
health, rising unemployment, widening digital
divides, and youth disillusionment—can have severe
consequences in an era of compounded economic,
environmental, geopolitical and technological risks.
The gap between the “haves” and “have-nots”
will widen further if technology access and ability
remain disparate. The world’s youth have faced
exceptional pressures in the past decade and are
particularly vulnerable to missing out altogether on
the opportunities of the next.
For business, the economic, technological and
reputational pressures of the present moment risk
a disorderly shakeout, threatening to create a large
cohort of workers and companies that are left behind
in the markets of the future. Governments, too,
must balance between managing the pandemic and
economic contraction, while at the same time creating
new opportunities that are fundamental to social
cohesion and the viability of their populations. Most
critically, if environmental considerations—the top
long-term risks once again—are not confronted in the
short term, environmental degradation will intersect
with societal fragmentation to bring about dramatic
consequences. If managed poorly, these disruptions
will hamper the ability of policy-makers and other
leaders to act on different areas of risk.

The foundation of the report continues to be our
annual Global Risks Perception Survey, completed by
over 650 members of the World Economic Forum’s
diverse leadership communities. In addition, the longstanding and deeply committed Global Risks Advisory
Board shapes the direction of this report from its
earliest stages, and provides insight throughout the
writing process. Over the last year, we have also
expanded our efforts around risk and resilience
for decision-makers and for the broader global
community. A new Global Future Council on Frontier
Risks capitalizes on its diverse and forward-looking
membership to inject fresh thinking into efforts to
understand and mitigate future risks and to amplify
weak signals of coming disruptions in the decades
ahead. Their ideas are featured in the postscript on
Frontier Risks. A new Chief Risk Officers community
brings together leaders in this role in the private sector
and major institutions to share methods and views to
collectively enhance capability.

Complementing the Global Risks Practice, the World
Economic Forum hosts major platforms dedicated
to action on building a new economy and society,
mobilizing for the climate, managing and disseminating
Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, shaping
industry transformations, and enhancing global
and regional cooperation. These platforms, and the
leaders, networks and organizations they host, apply
the findings of this report in their efforts to tackle the
world’s greatest challenges—managing risks, building
resilience and leveraging new opportunities. Such an
integrated approach has never been more critical than
at present, as the world moves beyond managing the
pandemic to resetting our current systems and building
back better economies and societies with people and
the planet at the centre of our efforts.

We are ever grateful to our long-standing partners in
the report’s development, Marsh McLennan and Zurich
Insurance Group. We welcomed a new partner this
year, SK Group, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude
for the valuable inputs provided. We are also grateful
to our academic partners: the National University of
Singapore, the Oxford Martin School at the University
of Oxford, and the Wharton Risk Management and
Decision Processes Center at the University of
Pennsylvania. Insights from a wide set of experts from
the public and private sectors can also be found in
these pages.

Executive Summary
The immediate human and economic cost of COVID-19
is severe. It threatens to scale back years of progress
on reducing poverty and inequality and to further
weaken social cohesion and global cooperation. Job
losses, a widening digital divide, disrupted social
interactions, and abrupt shifts in markets could lead
to dire consequences and lost opportunities for large
parts of the global population. The ramifications—in
the form of social unrest, political fragmentation and
geopolitical tensions—will shape the effectiveness of our
responses to the other key threats of the next decade:
cyberattacks, weapons of mass destruction and, most
notably, climate change.
In the Global Risks Report 2021, we share the results
of the latest Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS),
followed by analysis of growing social, economic and
industrial divisions, their interconnections, and their
implications on our ability to resolve major global risks
requiring societal cohesion and global cooperation.
We conclude the report with proposals for enhancing
resilience, drawing from the lessons of the pandemic
as well as historical risk analysis. The key findings of
the survey and the analysis are included below.

Global risks perceptions
Among the highest likelihood risks of the next ten
years are extreme weather, climate action failure
and human-led environmental damage; as well as
digital power concentration, digital inequality and
cybersecurity failure. Among the highest impact risks
of the next decade, infectious diseases are in the
top spot, followed by climate action failure and other
environmental risks; as well as weapons of mass
destruction, livelihood crises, debt crises and
IT infrastructure breakdown.
When it comes to the time-horizon within which these risks
will become a critical threat to the world, the most imminent
threats – those that are most likely in the next two years
– include employment and livelihood crises, widespread

youth disillusionment, digital inequality, economic
stagnation, human-made environmental damage,
erosion of societal cohesion, and terrorist attacks.
Economic risks feature prominently in the 3-5 year
timeframe, including asset bubbles, price instability,
commodity shocks and debt crises; followed by
geopolitical risks, including interstate relations and
conflict, and resource geopolitization. In the 5-10
year horizon, environmental risks such as biodiversity
loss, natural resource crises and climate action failure
dominate; alongside weapons of mass destruction,
adverse effects of technology and collapse of states or
multilateral institutions.

Economic fragility and societal
divisions are set to increase
Underlying disparities in healthcare, education,
financial stability and technology have led the crisis
to disproportionately impact certain groups and
countries. Not only has COVID-19 caused more than
two million deaths at the time of writing, but the
economic and long-term health impacts will continue
to have devastating consequences. The pandemic’s
economic shockwave—working hours equivalent
to 495 million jobs were lost in the second quarter
of 2020 alone—will immediately increase inequality,
but so can an uneven recovery. Only 28 economies
are expected to have grown in 2020. Nearly 60%
of respondents to the GRPS identified “infectious
diseases” and “livelihood crises” as the top short-term
threats to the world. Loss of lives and livelihoods will
increase the risk of “social cohesion erosion”, also a
critical short-term threat identified in the GRPS.

Growing digital divides and
technology adoption pose concerns
COVID-19 has accelerated the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, expanding the digitalization of human

interaction, e-commerce, online education and remote
work. These shifts will transform society long after
the pandemic and promise huge benefits—the ability
to telework and rapid vaccine development are two
examples—but they also risk exacerbating and creating
inequalities. Respondents to the GRPS rated “digital
inequality” as a critical short-term threat.
A widening digital gap can worsen societal fractures
and undermine prospects for an inclusive recovery.
Progress towards digital inclusivity is threatened by
growing digital dependency, rapidly accelerating
automation, information suppression and manipulation,
gaps in technology regulation and gaps in technology
skills and capabilities.

According to the GRPS, the risk of “youth
disillusionment” is being largely neglected by the global
community, but it will become a critical threat to the
world in the short term. Hard-fought societal wins
could be obliterated if the current generation lacks
adequate pathways to future opportunities—and loses
faith in today’s economic and political institutions.

Climate continues to be a looming
risk as global cooperation weakens

A doubly disrupted generation of
youth is emerging in an age of lost
opportunity

Climate change—to which no one is immune—continues
to be a catastrophic risk. Although lockdowns worldwide
caused global emissions to fall in the first half of 2020,
evidence from the 2008–2009 Financial Crisis warns
that emissions could bounce back. A shift towards
greener economies cannot be delayed until the shocks
of the pandemic subside. “Climate action failure” is the
most impactful and second most likely long-term risk
identified in the GRPS.

While the digital leap forward unlocked opportunities
for some youth, many are now entering the workforce
in an employment ice age. Young adults worldwide
are experiencing their second major global crisis in a
decade. Already exposed to environmental degradation,
the consequences of the financial crisis, rising inequality,
and disruption from industrial transformation, this
generation faces serious challenges to their education,
economic prospects and mental health.

Responses to the pandemic have caused new domestic
and geopolitical tensions that threaten stability. Digital
division and a future “lost generation” are likely to test
social cohesion from within borders—exacerbating
geopolitical fragmentation and global economic
fragility. With stalemates and flashpoints increasing in
frequency, GRPS respondents rated “state collapse” and
“multilateralism collapse” as critical long-term threats.

Middle powers—influential states that together
represent a greater share of the global economy
than the US and China combined—often champion
multilateral cooperation in trade, diplomacy, climate,
security and, most recently, global health. However,
if geopolitical tensions persist, middle powers will
struggle to facilitate a global recovery—at a time
when international coordination is essential—and
reinforce resilience against future crises. GRPS
respondents signal a challenging geopolitical outlook
marked by “interstate relations fracture”, “interstate
conflict” and “resource geopolitization”—all
forecasted as critical threats to the world in three
to five years.

A polarized industrial
landscape may emerge in the
post-pandemic economy
As economies emerge from the shock and stimulus
of COVID-19, businesses face a shakeout. Existing
trends have been given fresh momentum by the crisis:
nationally focused agendas to stem economic losses,
technological transformation and changes in societal
structure—including consumer behaviors, the nature
of work and the role of technology both at work and
at home. The business risks emanating from these
trends have been amplified by the crisis and include
stagnation in advanced economies and lost potential
in emerging and developing markets, the collapse
of small businesses, widening the gaps between
major and minor companies and reducing market
dynamism, and exacerbation of inequality; making it
harder to achieve long-term sustainable development.
With governments still deliberating how to pivot away
from emergency to recovery, and with companies
anticipating a changed business landscape, there are

opportunities to invest in smart, clean and inclusive
growth that will improve productivity and delivery of
sustainable agendas.

Better pathways are available to
manage risks and enhance resilience
Despite some remarkable examples of determination,
cooperation and innovation, most countries have
struggled with aspects of crisis management during
the global pandemic. While it is early to draw definitive
lessons, this edition of the Global Risks Report reflects
on global preparedness by looking at four key areas of
the response to COVID-19: institutional authority, risk
financing, information collection and sharing,
and equipment and vaccines. It then looks to nationallevel responses—acknowledging the varied starting
points for individual countries—and draws lessons
from five domains: government decision-making,
public communication, health system capabilities,
lockdown management and financial assistance to
the vulnerable.
However, if lessons from this crisis only inform
decision-makers how to better prepare for the next
pandemic—rather than enhancing risk processes,
capabilities and culture—the world will be again
planning for the last crisis rather than anticipating
the next. The response to COVID-19 offers four
governance opportunities to strengthen the overall
resilience of countries, businesses and the international
community: (1) formulating analytical frameworks
that take a holistic and systems-based view of risk
impacts; (2) investing in high-profile “risk champions”
to encourage national leadership and international
co-operation; (3) improving risk communications and
combating misinformation; and (4) exploring new forms
of public-private partnership on risk preparedness.

The immediate human and economic
costs of COVID-19 are severe. They
threaten to scale back years of progress
on reducing global poverty and inequality
and further damage social cohesion and
global cooperation, which were already
weakening before the virus struck.
New barriers to individual and collective
advancement will likely result from the
pandemic as the world faces the sudden
disruption of social interactions, a widening
digital divide, abrupt shifts in markets and
consumer behaviour, loss of education and
jobs, and challenges to democracy and
international relations. “Digital inequality”,
“youth disillusionment” and “social
cohesion erosion”—newly included in the
Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS)—
were all identified by respondents as critical
short-term threats.

Structural fissures
exacerbated by the crisis
threaten to make the
recovery deeply uneven
A digital leap forward—disrupting industry,
education, labour markets, and the
balance of power between nations—
risks widening the gap between the
technological “haves” and “have-nots”.
All generations and groups have been
affected by the crisis: older populations
are the most vulnerable to the pandemic
itself, and youth face new barriers to
social mobility, strains on mental health,
uncertain economic prospects and the
continued degradation of the planet.
Climate change—to which no one is
immune, nor can the world vaccinate
against it—continues to be catastrophic:
“climate action failure” is the most
impactful and second most likely longterm risk identified in the GRPS.
Billions of people worldwide are at
heightened risk of missing out on future
economic opportunities, and the benefits
of a resilient global community. According

to the GRPS, “livelihood crises” will be a
critical threat over the next two years, and
their impact is likely to continue throughout
the decade.
The crisis has also challenged national
policy-making and international relations
in ways that threaten lasting impacts.
Institutions and policies to support
international coordination were already in
decline, and responses to the pandemic
have caused new geopolitical tensions. With
new stalemates and flashpoints in view,
GRPS respondents rated “state collapse”
and “multilateralism collapse” as critical
threats over the next five to ten years.
Despite these challenges, there is also
space for building resilience. In this
chapter, we close with a reflection on
how governments, businesses and
societies can begin to take steps for better
preparedness in the face of perpetual
global risk (see Box 1.1).

Damage and disparity
The effects of COVID-19, along with
some aspects of the policy response,
however necessary, have left societies
and economies damaged, widened
existing disparities within communities
and between nations, disproportionately
harmed certain sectors and societal
groups, and complicated the pathway for
the world to achieve the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Economic shockwave
The global economy has now sunk to its
deepest crisis in peacetime. World output
is expected to have shrunk by 4.4% in
2020 (see Figure 1.1).1 In comparison, the
2008–2009 Financial Crisis caused the
world economy to contract by 0.1%. Data
for the third quarter of 2020 hinted that
recovery was underway, but the impact
of surging infections in the fourth quarter
remains to be measured: many countries
were registering more daily cases than they
had in the second quarter, when the G20
economies contracted at an annualized
rate (see Table 1.1 for data on the seven
largest economies).2 The economic
contraction is expected to increase
inequality in many countries;3 but an
The Global Risks Report 2021

16

uneven economic rebound can exacerbate
the inequities. At the time of writing, key
capital markets had surged above prepandemic levels,4 yielding gains that will
mostly benefit wealthy stockholders.
The impact of the pandemic on livelihoods
has been catastrophic, especially on those
who have no savings, have lost their jobs or
faced pay cuts. Working hours equivalent
to 495 million jobs were lost in the second
quarter of 20205—14% of the world’s entire
workforce.6 At the time of writing, only half
were expected to have been recovered by
the end of the year.7 Youth, unskilled workers,
working parents—especially mothers—and
already-disadvantaged minorities have been
especially hard hit: 70% of working women
across nine of the world’s largest economies
believe their careers will be slowed by the
pandemic’s disruption,8 while 51% of youth
from 112 countries believe their educational
progress has been delayed.9
The economic impact varies across regions.
The Euro area and Latin America are
expected to have contracted the most in
2020.10 Only 28 economies are expected
to have grown in 2020, with China the only
G-20 country among them.11 In low- and
lower-middle-income countries, severe

and long-lasting humanitarian impacts
could be exacerbated by lower levels of
financial support and fewer aid workers.12
Poor working conditions and lack of social
protections are likely to aggravate the impact
on the world’s 2 billion informal workers.13

Health fallout
At the time of writing, nearly 100 million
people worldwide had contracted COVID-19
and more than 2 million had died,14 making
SARS-CoV-2 one of the deadliest viruses in
history.15 Global infections were rising, with
upwards of 600,000 new cases and more
than 10,000 deaths every day.16
Long-term health impacts remain
unknown: in South Korea, a survey
found that 90% of recovered COVID-19
patients were still suffering from physical
and psychological side effects such as
ageusia (loss of taste), anosmia (loss of
smell), attention disorder and fatigue.17
Collateral health impacts—physical and
mental—will continue to have devastating
consequences worldwide: in the United
States, for example, delayed treatment
of emergencies, chronic diseases and

psychological distress have already
caused a death rate of 6% over what
would normally be expected.18
The pandemic has strained healthcare
systems, exposing their lack of capacity.
Hospitals worldwide were quickly
overwhelmed, and at the time of writing
many were again at risk—from several
countries in Europe19 to India,20 Mexico,21
South Africa22 and the United States.23
Some countries have reported new
shortages of medical supplies.24 Healthcare
professionals have struggled with anxiety,
depression, fear, isolation and even social
stigma.25 In countries such as Australia,26
Colombia,27 Ecuador,28 India,29 the United
Kingdom,30 and the United States,31
financial, physical and mental stress have
caused many to plan to stop working or
leave the profession.

Underlying disparities
The damage from COVID-19 has been
worsened by long-standing gender,
race, age and income inequalities.
Disadvantaged groups went into the
crisis with lower resilience as a result of
disparities in well-being; financial stability
and security; and access to healthcare,
education and technology. Previous
editions of the Global Risks Report
have highlighted that income inequality,
despite declining on a global scale,
had reached historical highs in many
countries (see, for example, The Fraying
Fundamentals chapter in the 2020 edition
of the report).32

million people into extreme poverty every

impact on the physical well-being of people
in low-income households,35 women,36 and
the elderly.
Sixty percent of adults lacked basic digital
knowledge and skills when workplaces
and schools across the world suddenly
closed to curb the spread of COVID-19,
forcing a rapid leap to online operations.37
Many students lacked access to a
computer for schoolwork: percentages
of students affected ranged from 25%
in China to 45% in Mexico and 65% in
Indonesia.38 Digital divides were already
worrisome before the pandemic: in 2018,
reporting that half the world’s population
were connected to the internet, the
International Telecommunication Union
called to “redouble our collective efforts
to leave no one offline”.39

inequality”, “youth disillusionment” and
“social cohesion erosion” all show up in
the GRPS as critical global threats for the
next two years.
Narrowing pathways
Across developed and developing
economies alike, the number of people
without access to quality and affordable
healthcare, education or digital tools is
at risk of increasing. Billions of people
face narrowing pathways to future
well-being.
In the short term, equitable and effective
vaccine distribution is at risk from
protectionist tendencies and geopolitical
tensions—just as these tendencies and
tensions put essential medical supplies
at risk when the pandemic started (see
Hindsight). In the longer term, inequitable
access to quality healthcare will persist as
a result of continued stress on healthcare
systems globally. Health capacity in
some European countries has already
suffered from prolonged austerity
measures.40 In Sub-Saharan Africa, 20%
of people over 60—the highest-risk age
group—are at least three hours away
from the nearest health facility.41 Such
obstacles have complicated the response
to the pandemic. Looking ahead, failing
to close public health gaps will exacerbate
existing vulnerabilities and risk further
humanitarian and economic damage.

Public health gaps, digital
inequality, educational
disparities and unemployment
may fray social cohesion
Barriers to education and technology—
long-proven channels for economic
advancement—have grown higher;
especially for youth (see Chapter
3, Pandemials). Education systems
worldwide are set to undergo a
challenging structural transformation
underpinned by widespread adoption
of online learning. This shift can

potentially reduce costs and expand
access,42 but students and workers
who lack the digital tools, online
access and knowledge to participate
are at risk of being excluded (see
Chapter 2, Error 404).43 “Digital
inequality”—ranked as the fifth most
concerning short-term threat to the
world—is increasing within and between
countries. The growing gap between
the technological “haves” and “havenots”—amid pressures on public and
private finances that could limit critical
investments in digital education—will
impede individual economic mobility.
Physical mobility—another channel for
economic advancement—is at risk too.
Domestically, the digital leap forward
can allow businesses to reduce costs by
relocating them away from city centres,
but workers in hands-on industries or
without the means or flexibility to move
to new production centres could be
stranded. Internationally, restrictions on
movement brought in during the pandemic
may be slow to ease given geopolitical
tensions, jeopardizing opportunities for the
world’s 250 million migrant workers and
their dependents.44 Global remittances are
expected to decrease by more than 14%
by 2021.45
Societal fragmentation
As public health gaps, digital
inequality, educational disparities and
unemployment—risks that result from
a complex combination of existing
inequalities and the impact of the
pandemic—affect vulnerable groups
the most, they may further fray social
cohesion. Unsurprisingly, “social
cohesion erosion” and “livelihood
crises” are among the highest-likelihood
and highest-impact long-term risks in
the GRPS (see Figure II, Global Risks
Landscape). Too many people have
little left to lose.
The global recession is now expected to
force as many as 150 million more people
into extreme poverty, increasing the total
to 9.4% of the world’s population—it
was expected to fall to 8% by the end
of 2020.46 This setback in the global
development agenda will heighten
vulnerability to future shocks and threaten

the erosion or collapse of states:
more than half of the respondents to
the GRPS believe “state collapse” is a
critical long-term threat (see Figure I,
Global Risks Horizon).

Increasing levels of public and private debt
may reduce scope for further stimulus—
which was a powerful tool in advanced
economies—requiring trade-offs between
investments in stronger social protection,
The Global Risks Report 2021

21

Citizens now know the power political
leaders can wield when the challenge
demands it
reskilling and upskilling of disadvantaged
workers, preparing youth for a drastically
changed labour market, and economic
transformation towards greener energy and
infrastructure (see Chapter 5, Imperfect
Markets). Respondents to the GRPS
believe mismanaging these trade-offs
will compound the risks of “debt crises”,
“social security collapse”, “digital inequality”
and “youth disillusionment”; triggering
“livelihood crises” globally (see Figure III,
Global Risk Network).
Developed and developing countries with
weak public finances face a harder road
to recovery: according to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), seven low-income
countries are in debt distress, with another
28 at high risk.47 Even where fiscal stimulus
has been substantial (see Figure 1.2), it
is not clear whether it will lead to a more
equitable recovery.
Divisiveness had been increasing before
the pandemic in many countries—as
analysed in the Fraying Fundamentals
chapter of last year’s Global Risks
Report48—with growing perceptions of
economic and political systems being
rigged and unrepresentative. While
social distancing measures temporarily
interrupted popular protests in 2020, they
have resumed in countries ranging from
Belarus to France, Germany, Russia, Sudan
and the United States.49
Systemic issues that sparked protests in
2020 include corruption, racial inequality
and police brutality.50 In some countries,
perceptions that COVID-19 responses
were inadequate or too stringent have
aggravated public discontent.51 Young
people have increasingly voiced discontent
over climate, economic, political and
social injustices they believe have
been caused by older generations (see
Chapter 3, Pandemials). Loss of plurality,
erosion of diverse representation in

positions of power, financial hardship
and intergenerational frictions—which will
continue worsening if profound inequalities
are unaddressed—risk exacerbating
societal divisiveness and severely
weakening communities’ resilience.
Heightened instability
Domestic political challenges, growing
fragmentation in many societies and
geopolitical tensions left the world woefully
underprepared for a crisis of the magnitude
of COVID-19 and amplified its impacts (see
Hindsight). Flashpoints that are likely to
hamper national and international stability
would deteriorate multilateral capacity to
respond to future global shocks.
Further polarization generated by the
outcome of the US elections may
create domestic obstacles for the new
administration, hindering financial, political,
technical and international cooperation
commitments on global issues such
as climate change, digital governance,
free trade and international security. The
formalization of Brexit, rising euro-scepticism
and damage from subsequent waves of
COVID-19 may weaken support among
EU members for a coordinated green
recovery and threaten the European Union’s
consolidation as a balancing third power.
Increasing tensions between China and
India—with the former expanding its
regional economic interests through the
recently signed Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP)—could
weaken regional and global trade and
growth.52 In Africa, worsening employment
and investment trends threaten the
anticipated benefits of the delayed African
Continental Free Trade Agreement
(AfCFTA),53 which could catalyse civil unrest
and aggravate humanitarian crises.54
Regional alliances are likely to form out
of economic expediency and tightening

relations with superpowers, but the
changing relationship between them is
creating uncertainty for other nations
around international rules and norms—
from cybersecurity and 5G technology
to climate action, natural resources and
trade (see Chapter 4, Middle Power
Morass). Public health is becoming
a new frontier for geopolitical rivalry.
Vaccine diplomacy and conflicts over
other critical supplies are likely to create
further tensions and require complex
negotiations, impeding international
coordination and the effectiveness of
the multilateral system to address global
concerns (see Hindsight).

No vaccine for environmental
degradation
Without societal cohesion and
stable international platforms,
future transboundary crises will have
greater impacts. The GRPS draws
attention to blind spots in collective
responses to a range of risks—such

as “debt crises”, “mental health
deterioration”, “tech governance failure”
and “youth disillusionment” (see Appendix
B, Figure B.1 Global Risk Response)—but
foremost among these blind spots
are “climate action failure” and
“biodiversity loss”.
Last year, for the first time in 15 years
of the GRPS, the five most likely longterm risks were environmental—
analysed in last year’s Global Risks
Report chapters A Decade Left and
Save the Axolotl. The World Economic
Forum’s COVID-19 Risks Outlook,
published in May 2020,55 analysed how
the crisis could stall progress on climate
action. This year, GRPS respondents
ranked environmental risks as four of
the top five by likelihood—“infectious
diseases” is fourth.
Global CO 2 emissions fell by 9% in
the first half of 2020, when COVID-19
forced most economies to shut down
for weeks.56 A similar decrease is
required every year for the next decade

to maintain progress towards limiting
global warming to 1.5°C (see Figure 1.3)
and avoid the worst effects of climate
change.57 However, emissions bounced
back after the 2008–2009 Financial
Crisis.58 Collective efforts are needed to
prevent a repeat as economies emerge
from the pandemic. Growth and emissions
must be decoupled and transition risks
managed in an urgent evolution to a lowcarbon economy. At present, only four
of the world’s largest economies have
assembled recovery packages that will
produce a net environmental benefit.59
The delayed UN Climate Change
Conference COP26 in November
2021 will be a pivotal moment for the
world’s largest emitters to commit to
more aggressive national targets and
agree on rules for carbon trading—
specifically Article 6 of the Paris
Agreement60—that can accelerate
investments in the transition to a lowcarbon global economy. The UN
Biodiversity Conference COP15 and UN
Convention to Combat Desertification
COP15 must likewise raise ambitions
for species protection and sustainable
land management. Failure to act would
inevitably lead to catastrophic physical
impacts and severe economic harm that
would require costly policy responses.

A synergetic recovery
The speed and scale of policy responses to
the pandemic have shown what is possible
(see Box 1.1): citizens now know the power
political leaders can wield when they are
convinced that the challenge demands it.
Many citizens who feel they have nothing
left to lose will demand equally swift
responses to deeply felt concerns. For
some, climate change requires immediate
action; others will prioritize jobs to ensure
the most vulnerable have food, shelter and
incomes; yet others will demand greater
effort to harness and govern technology.
As with COVID-19, climate change
impacts are likely to play out
disproportionately across countries,
exacerbated by long-existing inequalities.
There is only a short window to redress
these disparities. A shift towards
greener production and consumption
cannot be delayed until economies are
revived. Governments—individually and
in coordination—need to catalyse a
transformation that amalgamates investment
in green and inclusive economic recovery,
with short-term measures to bridge gaps in
health, education, employment prospects
and social safety nets. A fractured future
can be avoided by bridging these gaps and
enabling opportunities for everyone.

B O X 1.1

Future Preparedness for Global Risks
While global risks outlined in this report are dire, lessons
from COVID-19 offer an opportunity for mitigation (see
Hindsight). Global risks—pandemics among them—
crystallize differently, but cross-cutting capabilities
and systemic approaches to strengthen the overall
resilience of countries, businesses and the international
community are possible. The response to COVID-19 so
far offers at least four governance opportunities.
Frameworks
Formulating detailed analytical frameworks that take
a holistic and systems-based view of risk impacts will
help to surface potential dependencies at a fitting
moment, spill-over consequences, vulnerabilities
and blind spots. This is critical in environmental risk
mitigation, for example, where interventions such
as developing climate-resistant crop varieties could
impact food system resilience. Multilateral institutions,
public-private arrangements and civil society all have
a role in facilitating such systemic outlooks. Holistic
analysis provides a foundation for stress-testing
assumptions; identifying and comparing the tradeoffs required by different mitigation proposals and
examining responsive capabilities against emerging
crises and forward-looking scenarios.
Risk champions
Investing in high-profile “risk champions” who can
bring together different stakeholders to spur innovation
in risk analysis, financing and response capabilities,
and improve relationships between scientific experts
and political leaders.1 The 2nd edition of the Global
Risks Report proposed the concept of a “National
Risk Officer” with a remit to enhance resilience by
improving the decision-making culture. Risk champions
should be positioned before the frenzy of the next
crisis—whatever it proves to be—yet, even with risk
champions in place, the importance of leadership

attention to risk at the highest levels in business and
government is by no means lessened.
Communication
Improving the clarity and consistency of risk
communications and combating misinformation. Most
crises require all-of-society responses—and there
is enormous goodwill and energy to leverage—but
confusion and frustration can undermine efforts to
build trust and align responsibilities between the public
sector, private sector, communities and households.
There is huge scope to enhance self-organized
resilience at the community and national levels. For
example, more can be done to understand—and
therefore tackle—biases at the individual level regarding
spread of misinformation.2 Better coordination among
private sector technology companies and government
can help to alert users to misinformation.3
Public-private partnerships
Exploring new forms of public-private partnership
on risk preparedness in technology, logistics and
manufacturing. The pandemic has shown that
innovation can be sparked when governments
engage the private sector to respond to large-scale
challenges—if risks and rewards are shared fairly
and appropriate governance is in place. Vaccine
deployment will be a test case in resiliency: while it
will raise new challenges, partnerships could prove
effective in meeting demand for glass vials, managing
cold-chain logistics, recording doses given, and even
countering vaccine hesitancy. The COVID-19 crisis
also highlighted the need for greater coordination on
financing to improve resilience and expedite recovery,
from pre-emptive investment and contingency budgets
to insurance pools with government backstops.4 The
lesson for crisis management is that details matter and
need to be addressed collaboratively.5

Barriers
to Digital
Inclusivity
REUTERS/BLAKE

The Global Risks Report 2021

29

COVID-19 has accelerated and broadened
the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the rapid
expansion of e-commerce, online education,
digital health and remote work. These shifts
will continue to dramatically transform human
interactions and livelihoods long after the
pandemic is behind us. This change can
provide huge benefits to societies—the
response to COVID-19 is full of examples,
from the ability to telework to the rapid
development of a vaccine.1 However, these
developments also risk exacerbating and
creating inequalities. Respondents to the
Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) rated
“digital inequality” both as a critical threat to
the world over the next two years and the
seventh most likely long-term risk.

A widening digital gap
can undermine an
inclusive recovery
Individuals differ more and more in their
digital autonomy and opportunities to earn a
livelihood in the digital markets of tomorrow.2
This widening digital gap can further weaken
societal cohesion, already fraying in many
countries, and undermine prospects for an
inclusive recovery. Progress towards digital
inclusivity is threatened by growing digital
dependency and automation, information
suppression and manipulation, and gaps in
regulation and capabilities.

Digital division
Digital division comes in many guises, from
automated bias that can be manipulated to
gaps in accessibility and capacity.
Automating bias and manipulation
Decisions historically made by humans—
diagnosing health issues, choosing
investments, assessing educational
achievement and resolving legal
disputes—are increasingly being made
by sophisticated algorithms that apply
machine learning to large data sets.3
In the US criminal justice system, for
example, algorithms are being used to

predict the risk of recidivism.4 In the private
sector, more businesses are turning to
algorithmic management to track employee
productivity.5 Automating these decisions
deepens biases when they depend on
black-box algorithms developed using
skewed historical data sets.6
The risks from automating bias are
exacerbated by the amount of data now
generated—predicted to nearly quadruple
by 2025.7 The sheer volume of data
drives down the cost and ease of using
algorithms for malicious or manipulative
purposes. Individuals and non-state groups
have access to algorithms that can spread
dangerous content with unprecedented
efficiency, speed and reach. Malicious
actors are also becoming more capable
of launching misinformation campaigns
on a national and global scale—and
because individuals and small groups
are difficult to track and prosecute, it is
harder for authorities to stop the spread of
misinformation. The number of countries
experiencing organized social media
manipulation campaigns increased by
150% between 2017 and 2019.8
Accessibility and regulatory gaps
“Digital gaps”—the differential ability to
access data and digital technologies—are
widening between and within countries.
Internet usage ranges from more than 87%
of the population in high-income countries
to less than 17% in low-income countries
(see Figure 2.1).9 Within countries, access
to digital resources is stratified by socioeconomic status—even in high-income
countries. In the United Kingdom, vulnerable
households have been forced to choose
between sustenance and connectivity
during the pandemic.10
Fissures in digital equality are exacerbated
by political and geopolitical incentives.
Some governments shut down internet
access to control the flow of information
and public discourse within and outside
their borders,11 or specifically to exclude
foreign-based platforms.12 The United
Nations has called for “all governments to
immediately end any and all blanket internet
and telecommunication shutdowns.”13 Still,
23% of countries ban or censor news,14
which limits their citizens’ access to critical
digital resources.
The Global Risks Report 2021

30

In countries where stark interventions are not
a threat, government inaction has created
risks to citizens. While nearly four-fifths of
countries have implemented regulations
on e-commerce and data protection,15
government responses continue to be
outpaced by the speed of digitalization.16
Governments need to narrow the regulatory
gap widened by new digital resources and
technology’s growing influence over human
interactions—or risk digital public goods
concentrating in private actors.
Capacities trailing digitalization
Automation was already reshaping labour
markets, but the pandemic spurred an

economic crisis and a digital leap that
shrank budgets and time frames needed
to upskill and reskill workers. The World
Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report
estimates that automation may displace 85
million jobs in only five years.17
In developed and emerging economies
alike, the rapid shift to remote working is
expected to yield long-term productivity
gains,18 but it risks creating new gaps
between knowledge workers and those
in hands-on sectors who cannot work
remotely and may lack the digital skills and
tools to find other employment in areas
such as manufacturing, retail, and some

fields of healthcare. The rapid digitalization
of human interactions and the workplace
has also expanded the suite of essential
digital skills—including communication,
cyber safety and information processing19—
beyond what was previously considered
internet savvy.

4×:

increase in data
generated by 2025

Such expansion requires significant
investment in upskilling and reskilling.
However, public spending and policymaking capacity to reduce the digital
skills gap will be limited after COVID-19—
especially in low- and middle-income
countries (see Chapter 1, Global Risks
2021). Employers facing loss of revenues
or the risk of bankruptcy (see Chapter 5,
Imperfect Markets) may also have limited
capacity to offer financial support to
employees. Vulnerable workers—especially
in the informal sector, where 60% of the
world’s workforce finds employment,20

and where livelihoods were hit hard by
the COVID-19 crisis21—will likely need
to prioritize keeping their existing job or
quickly finding new employment over
dedicating time and money to training.

Disconnected societies
Societies are becoming more
disconnected. Populations find themselves
increasingly polarized and bombarded
with misinformation, and the widening gap
in digital ability risks the emergence of a
digital underclass. A regulatory backlash
to combat this outcome risks further
disconnecting societies.
Polarization and misinformation
A pervasive reliance on complex algorithms
that exacerbate inequalities can damage
individual well-being and amplify societal
fractures. Automated assessments of
criminal sentences may worsen results
for vulnerable groups.22 Within artificial
intelligence (AI)-powered organizations,
“code ceilings” (which dictate opportunities
based on a business optimization
function) may limit career opportunities for
workers managed by algorithms.23 And in
health—as analysed in depth in previous

editions of the Global Risks Report (see,
for example, Chapter 6, False Positive, in
the 15th edition of that report)24—skewed
databases could lead AI to misdiagnose
or mistreat patients. If left undetected or
unaddressed, algorithmic discrimination—
and the resulting societal divisiveness—
could worsen exponentially as stronger
computing capabilities boost the speed
and reach of algorithms.25

Reliance on algorithms that
exacerbate inequalities can
damage well-being and
amplify societal fractures
Widespread falsehoods and conspiracy
theories hinder civic debate and consensus
on critical political, public health and
environmental issues. “Infodemics”
surrounding COVID-19, for example,
have impeded efforts to stem the
physical damage from the disease—
false information that ingesting highly
concentrated alcohol kills SARS-CoV-2
caused over 700 deaths and nearly 6,000
hospitalizations in Iran.26 Misinformation
could endanger a global recovery that
hinges on the widespread vaccination.
As one European diplomat commented,
“disinformation will continue. Vaccination
seems to be the next battleground.”27 More
broadly, disinformation and misinformation
campaigns can erode community trust in
science, threaten governability and tear
the social fabric. According to the GRPS,
“backlash against science” will heighten
the risks of “climate action failure” and
“infectious diseases” over the next decade
(see Figure III, Global Risks Network).
Misinformation is increasingly threatening
civil liberties and democracy.28 “Post-truth”
politics29—from deliberate manipulation
campaigns to the unmitigated spread of
conspiracy theories and fake news—are
“amplifying hate speech; heightening
the risk of conflict, violence and human
rights violations; and threatening longterm prospects for advancing democracy”

as the World Health Organization has
warned.30 Yet blunt government attempts to
combat misinformation can exacerbate the
problem. Internet restrictions, for example,
risk excluding whole societies from the
global information economy, while more
invasive control could infringe civil liberties.
Digital underclass of workers
Widening gaps in digital literacy risk
creating a digital underclass.31 Workers
excluded from digital resources will miss the
educational and employment opportunities
constantly created by the global digital
economy: the World Economic Forum’s
Future of Jobs Report estimates that, by
2025, 97 million new jobs may emerge from
the division of labour between humans and
machines.32 The digital exclusion of billions
of workers worldwide increases the risk of
“livelihood crises” and is likely to exacerbate
“social cohesion erosion”—two of the
highest likelihood and highest impact risks
of the next 10 years, according to the GRPS
(see Figure II, Global Risks Landscape).
User disenfranchisement and
governance challenges
At a time when a growing number of human
activities are going digital, individuals and
institutions face a heightened risk of losing
their digital autonomy.
Power is becoming more concentrated
in markets such as online retail, online
payments and communication services (see
Chapter Chapter 5, Imperfect Markets).33
“Digital power concentration”—the sixth
most likely long-term risk according to
GRPS respondents—could confine political
and societal discourse to a limited number
of platforms that have the capability of
filtering information and further reducing the
already limited agency of individuals and
organizations over how their data are used.34
Stretched budgets will limit consumers’
options as they choose digital services and
providers that best suit their new needs.
Lack of competition between providers
by way of offering stricter data privacy
policies could prevent users from gaining
more control over how their data are
collected, used and monetized.35 Users
and consumers could also lose the power
to negotiate or revoke the use and storage
of data they have already shared, willingly

or unwillingly.36 As social identities become
more defined by online identities, users
will be increasingly at risk of exposure to
targeted political manipulation, invasion
of privacy, cybercrime, financial loss, and
psychological or physical harm.37
Regulatory techlash
Governments across the world are
ramping up protection for consumers and
increasing regulatory pressures on digital
markets in response to the potentially
deleterious societal impacts of digital
dependency and influence.

Regulatory “techlash”
risks internet restriction,
information censorship and
cut communications

The European Union signalled, in its
draft Digital Markets Act,38 that it would
be clamping down on anti-competitive
behaviours.39 In the United States, a
congressional report on the risk of
monopolization in digital markets also
portends growing pressures on tech
companies.40 Meanwhile, regulations are
tightening around providers’ responsibility
for illegal activities on their platforms—
such as the spread of misinformation and
malicious content. A regulatory “techlash”
could confront major tech companies with
large fines—up to 10% of global revenues
in Europe—along with more governmental
control and the possibility of breaking
them up.
Stronger government intervention in digital
markets can empower consumers and
users by fostering more competition and
regulating anti-competitive practices, but
breaking up major platforms can also
reduce services overall. Without platform

benefits, smaller companies may not be
able to reach less profitable markets,
which would widen digital inequality. In
more authoritarian contexts, a distinct
threat remains that governments will
attempt to take over major platforms and
service providers—thus consolidating their
power to restrict internet access, censor
information and cut communications.
Pathways to future economic and societal
gains under these conditions would be
severely imperilled.

Updates required
The context, fairness and governance—
not algorithms, AI or machines by
default—underpinning the digital leap
will determine whether the use and
adoption of new technologies advances
individual and societal well-being or
widens the gap between the technological
“haves” and “have-nots”. Already,

85 million:
jobs that may be automated in
five years

“collaborative intelligence” has been found
to yield lasting productivity gains for both
humans and technology, while automation
for the sake of reducing workforces yields
only temporary improvements.41 Ensuring
a smooth digital transition and mitigating
the risks to social cohesion from digital
divides will require managing innovation
without stifling it—for example, insisting
on security and privacy by design in the
development of new technologies and
digital services.42 Impact studies could
improve understanding of the implications
of new technologies for societies and
human rights.43 Such approaches would
require building public sector capabilities
to assess the benefits and risks from
an accelerated digitalization of social
interactions; and to improve the regulation

of digital technologies that safeguard user
data, entitle online information accuracy
and reward innovation.
Basic education and lifelong learning
can increase digital literacy and play
a critical role in closing digital divides.
Increasing access to digital content is
not enough. As AI, machine learning
and biotechnology evolve, new users
need to think critically about the supply
and consumption of digital content. The
World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs
Report shows that, already, the digital
leap has propelled worker appetite for
online learning and training on digital skills
such as data analysis, computer science
and information technology.44 Employers
have also risen to the challenge—during
the second quarter of 2020, employer
provision of online learning opportunities
increased fivefold.45 Similar opportunities
exist in leveraging digital services
to overcome existing and emerging
inequalities in health accessibility,
affordability and quality (see Chapter 1,
Global Risks 2021). Throughout the
pandemic, telemedicine in many countries
has allowed patients to continue their
treatment while minimizing the risk of
COVID-19 transmission.46
Digital tools will benefit workers and
employers alike—two-thirds of employers
expect to see a return on their investment
in upskilling and reskilling within one
year,47 while enhanced healthcare reduces
business risks such as safety, continuity
and reputation48—but so will more
inclusive technology. More companies are
working with civil society on the design
and governance of technology and digital
services. By integrating marginalized
and vulnerable groups into technology
development—including those of different
ethnicities and genders—companies are
reducing bias and promoting access to
emerging technologies.49 The business
case for such collaborations is that
they help to make technology more
user-centric and easier to adopt.
COVID-19 contact-tracing apps have
already shown how open-source
approaches and monitoring mechanisms
can work even with proprietary code,
helping to make technologies more
inclusive and representative.50

Pandemials:
Youth in an
Age of Lost
Opportunity
REUTERS/BLAKE

The Global Risks Report 2021

39

Young adults (ages 15–24) around the
world are experiencing their second
major global crisis within a decade:1 they
entered youth in the throes of the financial
crisis,2 and are now exiting at the outset
of a pandemic not seen in generations.
They will face serious challenges to their
education, economic prospects and
mental health.
The outlook for this generation
had already been diminished by
environmental degradation, rising
inequality (of many types - gender,
intergenerational, economic and ethnic),
varying degrees of violence, and social
disruption from the tech-enabled
industrial transformation. While the digital
leap forward (see Chapter 2, Error 404)
unlocked opportunities for some youth,
many are now entering the workforce in
an employment ice age.
In May 2020, the World Economic Forum’s
COVID-19 Risks Outlook warned of a “next
lost generation”.3 According to the Global
Risks Perception Survey (GRPS), “youth
disillusionment” is a top neglected risk
that will become a critical threat to the
world over the next two years (see Figure II,
Global Risks Landscape). For younger
respondents to the GRPS—the World
Economic Forum’s Global Shapers—
“youth disillusionment” is also a top blind
spot (see Box 3.1). Hard-fought societal

wins could be obliterated if the current
generation lacks adequate pathways to
educational and job opportunities.

A scarred generation
Today’s youth already bear the scars of
a decade-long financial crisis, an
outdated education system, and an
entrenched climate crisis, as well as
violence in many places.
Growing disparities
Global fiscal policies following the
Great Recession led to unequal prosperity
gains across societies and generations.
Large-scale financial stimulus packages
were insufficient for younger generations to
regain their footing, and austerity measures
hampered investment in education,
narrowing an important channel of mobility.
As a result, many young people have lingered
in precarious service jobs that are vulnerable
to major shocks. Pre-COVID, children and
youths accounted for two-thirds of the global
poor.4 COVID-19 has severely worsened
this situation.5 While the share of youth
is expected to increase across Africa—
where the median age currently stands at
just 19.7 years—and Oceania, Europe and
South-East Asia will see declines in their
youth populations by 2050,6 adding to the
demographic challenges of unemployment
and ageing in those regions.

B O X 3 .1

Risks Landscape 2021: The Global Shapers’ Perspective
The Global Shapers Community is the World
Economic Forum’s network of young people driving
dialogue, action and change. Their responses to
the GRPS show higher aversion to risks than the
multistakeholder sample (see Figure 3.1). There are
some similarities, however: Global Shapers also rate
climate-related risks as the most likely and most
impactful long-term risks and “youth disillusionment”
as a top global blind spot.
The Shapers’ perceptions of critical threats to the
world show a telling pattern. They see personal
risks as immediate threats, macro risks in the
medium term and fundamental geopolitical risks in
the long term.

Top risks by horizon
– Short term (0–2 years): “mental health deterioration”,
“livelihood crises” and “infectious diseases”
– Medium term (3–5 years): “IT infrastructure
breakdown”, “resource geopolitization”, “price
instability”, and “asset bubble burst”
– Long term (5–10 years): “weapons of mass
destruction”, “multilateralism collapse” and
“state collapse”
Top blind spots
– “Climate action failure”, “mental health deterioration”
and “youth disillusionment”

School closures aggravated
youth inequalities between
and within societies
Regional inequalities persist beyond
fundamental economics; these disparities
are visible in access to education, health
systems, social security and protection
from violence and conflict. Pre-pandemic,
almost 44% of girls and 34% of boys
from the poorest strata of society did not
complete primary school.7 In recent years,
gains in youth retention rates have slowed.8
Health has also deteriorated for youth:
non-communicable diseases—which carry
long-term health risks through adulthood
and older age—grew starkly among
adolescents, and more young people are
facing the effects of overburdened health
systems in their countries.9
Violence compounds these structural
challenges. Decade-long conflicts
hampered youth prospects in Central Asia,
Latin America, the Middle East and West
and Central Africa. As a result, a record
number of children and youths are now

among the world’s refugees.10 In advanced
economies, youths are beleaguered by
threats of gun violence, domestic terrorism
and deep-running societal frictions that
could escalate to more violence.
Youth disenfranchisement has been
amplified by disappointment at the slow
economic recovery from the 2008–2009
Financial Crisis, frustration at ostensibly
corrupt and ineffective elites, and socioeconomic fault lines that have exposed
deep-rooted injustices. This discontent has
been evidenced by the growing number of
youth-led movements that have erupted in
the past decade—among them the Arab
Spring, global climate strikes, and civil
rights movements seeking more social and
racial equality.
Fragile education systems
The year 2020 saw unprecedented
challenges to the global education
system. During the first wave of pandemic
lockdowns, 80% of students globally
were out of school, as traditional
classroom teaching was rendered
mute. Despite worldwide adaptation
for remote teaching via television, radio
and internet,11 there were stark regional
differences in capacity;12 at least 30%
of the global student population lacked

the technology to participate in digital
and broadcast learning.13 While adaptive
measures allowed schools to re-open
eventually, many challenges remained
throughout subsequent waves of
COVID-19 because of ineffective or slow
government responses.
School closures aggravated youth
inequalities between and within societies
because young women and those of
disadvantaged socio-economic statues
were hit hardest. Students in highincome households potentially benefited
from more targeted and individualized
learning arrangements,14 but resourcestrapped youth struggled to participate in
educational opportunities in the absence
of digital connectivity, adult support or
adequate space to study at home.15 For
others, border closings complicated
educational mobility.

30%:

youth lacking technology to participate
in digital and broadcast learning
Home schooling and home working
increased household stress and the
incidence of violence against young
adults.16 In areas where school provides
access to food and a safe space, school
closures put students at higher risk of
child labour, recruitment by organised
crime,17 human trafficking,18 and gun
violence.19 In the Sahel region in Africa—
where schools were already under threat
of violence—COVID-19 forced safe schools
to close, leading to an increase in physical
violations against children and recruitment
into fighting.20
School closings have had devastating
consequences on young women.
Gender-based violence has increased
globally during the pandemic,21 and
rapes rose in advanced and developing
countries alike.22 Teenage pregnancies are

expected to increase, from Latin America
to East Asia and Africa23—previous
health crises suggest that some of these
girls might be prevented from returning
to school.24 Globally, COVID-19 and its
“shadow pandemic” on girls and young
women risk reversing 25 years’ worth
of global gains in girls’ education,25
exposing girls to a higher chance of
underage marriage.26
Employment turmoil
Although many economies recovered
from the 2008–2009 Financial Crisis,
those hit hardest by the Great Recession
never did fully. As a result, youth
unemployment has risen globally since
2008.27 National policies still fail to lift up
youth in many cases. Weak structural
transformations have largely failed to
reduce stubbornly high, systemic youth
unemployment, particularly in the Middle
East and North Africa.28
The increase of unbound job schemes
originating from the “gig” economy,
unpaid or low-paid internships and
continued high numbers of youth in the
informal market have spurred young
workers to jump between low-paid
short-term jobs. At the same time, labour
market distortions narrowed employment
opportunities for young adults: a deficit
of employment opportunities for highly
educated youth in some sectors, and a
“skills crisis” in others.29
Policy responses to COVID-19 further
exacerbated the marginalization of
young workers. The global economy
plummeted in the second quarter of
2020 (see Chapter 1, Global Risks 2021),
disproportionately affecting the incomes
of young adults. In many economies,
they were the first to lose their jobs to
lockdowns. Many young adults work in the
sectors hardest hit by the pandemic (see
Table 3.1)—such as the service industry
and manufacturing—often on part-time
or temporary contracts with limited job
protection.30 The informal sector, where
almost 80% of the world’s young workers
are employed, was particularly impacted.31
Altogether, the number of young people

Young adults’ employment prospects
were being challenged by automation,33
as well as by disruption from the Fourth
Industrial Revolution,34 before interrupted
education opportunities and job losses set
them further behind. Youth unemployment
may increase across regions,35 given that
more sectoral restructuring and shifting
consumer habits (see Chapter 5, Imperfect
Markets) are expected to trigger mass

layoffs.36 Low-wage jobs—which could
provide a safety net for young workers
starting their careers—are also projected
to decrease.37

Turbulent paths
“Pandemials” are at risk of becoming the
double lost generation of the 21st century.
Lack of opportunities for future economic,
societal and political participation could
have long-lasting global consequences.
A narrowing pathway for youth
Lockdowns may cause an education loss
of at least one semester,38 which, like
absenteeism, could affect future academic
performance,39 increase dropout rates and
induce riskier health behaviours.40 This
could make it harder for students at the
secondary and tertiary levels to acquire the
necessary skills to pursue further education
or vocational training, or even to secure
entry-level jobs. And such further education
or training is even more important for “jobs
of the future”.41 Youth from low-income
households are at risk of missing out on
education altogether if they are sent to
work rather than back to school.42

“Pandemials” are at risk
of becoming the double
lost generation of the
21st century

Young women face the risk of being kept
out of school for household or agricultural
work,43 not being able to finish their
secondary education, or not being able
to return to work after leaving during the
pandemic for caregiving responsibilities;44
young men could face increased financial
pressure in societies where they are the
sole financial contributor of the household.
A widening of educational, socio-economic
and gender inequalities can be expected.
The 2008–2009 Financial Crisis has shown
the persistence of youth unemployment—
young adults have continuously struggled
to integrate into and align their skills with
a grim job market. This struggle can leave
long-lasting marks on their livelihoods. As
the world starts to recover from COVID-19,
young adults are likely to face such
challenges again, this time amplified by the
world’s digital leap forward (see Chapter 2,
Error 404). Entry-level jobs today require
more skills than they did a decade ago,45
and, at the same time, there are fewer
available because of automation.46
The consequences of rapidly changing
markets (see Chapter 5, Imperfect Markets)
make youth more vulnerable to unstable
contracts, career instability and limited
promotion prospects. This can lead to
a higher risk that they will miss out on
social safety benefits, job protection and

youth whose mental health
deteriorated during the pandemic
re-skilling opportunities. More importantly,
a stunted employment outlook complicates
young people’s ability to consolidate
economic capital and social mobility. Young
students are expected to face increased
debt burdens as student loans continue
to reach record levels,47 and graduates
entering the workforce in an economic
crisis are more likely to earn less than their
peers.48 For young workers, one month
being unemployed at age 18–20 can cause
a permanent income loss of 2% in the
future.49 In economies where informal work
is predominant—mostly because of high
shares of agricultural and services industry
professions—lack of social protection
increases youth’s risk of sliding into poverty
quickly. Malnutrition and poorer health are
immediate effects of such a slide, but the
consequences of youth entering into poverty
would also cascade to their children.50
Fear, anger and backlash
Young people have become more and more
vocal in the past decade, in the streets and
in cyberspace. Their concern and proactivity
with key issues such as economic hardship,
persisting intergenerational inequality, failure

in governance and rampant corruption is
inspiring;51 but they have also expressed
anger, disappointment and pessimism.52
The multitude of youth protests embody
an increased sentiment of betrayal by the
generation in power over insufficient action
on social and climate justice, political
change and corruption.53 COVID-19
has added a new criticality to youth
disillusionment with their dire economic
outlook, missed educational opportunities
and disapproval of government emergency
response.54 These confrontations and the
associated potential disruptions could
become constant if the underlying causes
are left unaddressed.
Limited economic and educational
prospects are likely to exacerbate youth
frustrations. The compounding trends
of lower intergenerational mobility and
widening socio-economic inequalities,
exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis, have
markedly deteriorated youth’s mental health.
Loneliness and anxiety among youth in
developed economies had already been
described as an “epidemic”,55 but since the
start of the coronavirus pandemic, mental
health has deteriorated for 80% of children
and young people across the globe. 56
Such discontent risks exploitation by
reactionary actors. Organised crime,57
extremist groups,58 and recruiters into
armed conflicts59 could prey on a more
vulnerable youth cohort with diminished
job opportunities in developing countries.60
Prolonged lockdown loneliness and job
loss stresses61—resulting in higher rates of
depression, anxiety,62 and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD)63—could make
youths more susceptible to alluring but
divisive ideas in developed economies.64
More radical youth movements could lead
to heightened inter-generational tensions
and deepen societal fragmentation along
new fault lines. “Social cohesion erosion”
compounded by “youth disillusionment”—
critical short-term threats to the world in
the GRPS—would challenge fragile national
institutions or even destabilize political and
economic systems altogether.
At the same time, dire prospects for
economic and social mobility will likely
force more young workers to migrate
abroad in search of better opportunities—
The Global Risks Report 2021

45

adding to the current 31 million youth
migrants across the world.65 This would
induce the real brain drain of the 21st
century. However, young migrant workers
could see such opportunities diminished
if stricter migration policies implemented
during the pandemic are slow to relax or
become permanent in receiving countries
(see Chapter 4, Middle Power Morass).

Passing the baton
The pandemic has exposed youth’s
vulnerability to widespread economic and
societal shocks. Political and economic
systems will need to adapt globally to
directly address youth’s needs and
minimize the risk of a lost generation.
Investment in improving education sectors
and in upskilling and reskilling, ensuring
adequate social protection schemes,
closing the gender gap and addressing
mental health scars should be at the centre
of the recovery process.

Dire prospects will force
young workers to search for
better opportunities abroad
New ways of learning have the potential
to be more inclusive, adaptive and
comprehensive, enabling students
to develop 21st century skills such as
creativity, innovation and advanced
inter-personal skills. However, it is more
critical than ever for the public and the
private sector to invest jointly in ensuring
connectivity for all youth. Given the fastchanging nature of the job market, more
investment is also needed in vocational
and on-the-job training. Investment
in educational technology must be
accompanied by adaptations of the
physical educational infrastructure so
schools can continue to offer in-person
services while harnessing the potential
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. To
be successful, schools must maintain
their critical role in providing nutrition and
physical and psychological health services,

and in acting as safe havens for at-risk
children and adolescents.
The current crisis has also revealed
and exacerbated gender inequalities in
education and work. Recognizing this gap
is the first step in closing it. Schools and
employers need to adopt measures to
close the gender gap, such as adopting
flexible and remote work, ensuring that
young women can return to school or
the workplace after lengthy absences
for caregiving, and implementing
support programmes for victims of
gender-based violence.
The mental and physical health situations
of youths need to be addressed from
the outset of economic and societal
recovery to minimize the yet-unknown
long-term effects of the pandemic and its
consequences. The digital leap forward
and emerging digital tools can increase
youth accessibility to support measures
and reduce the stigmatization of mental
health issues originating from these
chaotic and uncertain times.66
Beyond these short-term investments,
more needs to be done in the long run.
Young people are demanding more
egalitarian, equitable and sustainable
societies, yet they continue to face
unnecessary barriers and blocked
pathways. Channels must be strengthened
to enable youth to make their voices heard
in all levels of government, on company
boards and in multilateral organizations—
which will in turn foster an intergenerational
transfer of experience, knowledge and
skills; serve as a bridge builder against
societal frictions; and decrease youth
frustrations. Youth must be guaranteed a
say in the global recovery. Failure to ensure
youth a seat at the table risks entire societal
and economic systems being rejected by
this generation.
Those in power must steward a global
effort to open pathways for youth to acquire
the necessary tools, skills and rights for a
more sustainable post-pandemic world.

Middle powers—states that lack
superpower status but still play influential
roles in international relations1—have
the potential to forge a more stable,
sustainable and cooperative balance of
power, individually or in some collective
constellation. While each government
has individual interests and governance
structures, as well as opponents and allies
that drive its behaviour on the international
stage, middle powers are often the
champions of multilateral cooperation in
areas of trade, diplomacy, security and,
most recently, global health. Comprised of
both advanced and emerging economies,
this set of nations represents a far greater
share of global GDP than the United States
and China combined.2

Middle powers have the
potential to forge a more
stable, sustainable and
cooperative world
However, if current trends persist, middle
powers will struggle to reinforce resilience
against crises at a time when global
coordination is most needed.3 Global Risks
Perception Survey (GRPS) respondents
reflect this ominous outlook: “interstate
relations fracture”, “interstate conflict” and
“resource geopolitization” are all forecasted
to become critical threats to the world in
the medium term (see Figure I, Global Risks
Horizon). In a destructive feedback loop,
without middle power influence, geopolitical
fragmentation and economic fragility will
increase further, disruption will become
more likely and progress on shared goals
will lag.

Torn at the seams
The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the weak
nodes and tenuous ties threading through
the international system. Key trends point
to a further weakening of multilateralism
underpinned by common norms. Intensified
US-China competition, more aggressive use

of subversive tools of geopolitical influence
and growing nationalism are fuelling the
shift from a rules-based to a power-based
global order.4 While these dynamics affect
all states, their damaging impact on middle
powers is particularly harmful because of
the role these countries can—and often
do—play in bolstering global cooperation in
the face of shared challenges.
Ossifying economic and
digital bipolarity
COVID-19 has entrenched state power
and intensified rivalry between the
United States and China.5 The new US
administration may attempt to identify
areas of cooperation with China, such as
climate change and fighting the pandemic,
but in the longer term, “collective leverage”
against China from the United States
and its closest allies is likely to deepen
competition.6 China has fortified its
economic interests in the Asia-Pacific
region, recently formalizing the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership
with 15 Asia-Pacific nations.7 The United
States and China also both seek superiority
in the digital realm by restricting technology
flows and platforms, restructuring supply
chains and favouring domestic investment.8
Each power will likely continue to expand
its zones of influence, and in many
cases this will happen outside traditional
international forums.9
Subversive influences
Misinformation, cyberattacks, targeted
strikes and resource grabs are on the
rise. The pandemic has shown how
governments can wield conspiracy
theories as geopolitical weapons
by making accusations about other
states.10 The next decade is likely
to see more frequent and impactful
dissemination of disinformation on
issues of geopolitical importance such
as elections, humanitarian crises, public
health, security and cultural issues (see
Chapter 2, Error 404).11 States and nonstate actors alike will likely engage in more
dangerous cyberattacks,12 and these
attacks will become more sophisticated.
Targeted strikes—through drones or
other technologies—will become more
ubiquitous.13 A warming planet will create
new geographic realities, like shipping
lanes in the Arctic, which could stoke

resource competition. These concerns will
continue to create a difficult global trade
and business environment, adding to the
risk of anaemic global economic growth.
Although all countries must defend against
these power plays, middle powers are
targeted more aggressively than smaller
states (see Figure 4.1), yet many lack the
defensive resources of the superpowers.14
With lagging technological and military
capabilities, middle powers will need to
allocate a larger proportion of their national
budgets to defence or develop stronger
alliances to maintain a minimum level of
protection against attack.

Growing nationalism
The economic downturn is accelerating
a greater pivot inward for many
governments as they seek to maintain
fragile domestic political and social
stability. GPRS respondents rank
“livelihood crises” and “prolonged
stagnation” as top short-term risks, and
economic concerns figure in four out
of the top five medium-term risks (see
Figure I: Global Risks Horizon). These
economic pressures and concomitant
deepening nationalism could result in
middle power governments being
unwilling or unable to contribute to
global risk mitigation.
The Global Risks Report 2021

In many countries, regardless of
governance approach, nationalistic
impulses have paralleled the pandemicinduced centralization of power.15 Policy
decisions taken in 2020 may persist
beyond the pandemic, enabling some
governments to use repressive measures
to control restive populations and allowing
leaders with autocratic tendencies to
pursue broader, longer-term agendas.
“Political entrepreneurs” could seek to
leverage growing nationalism to move
governments away from globalization and
cooperation.16 Restrictions on migration
that were imposed during the pandemic
may not be quickly eased.17

India projected to become the world’s
most populated country

Stifled influence and
weakened world order
The drivers outlined above, while universal,
will reinforce specific challenges to middle
power influence. In advanced middle
power economies, widening defence
and technology gaps are hindering
leadership potential on critical transnational
issues. Large, emerging markets are
similarly hamstrung, with the ravages of
COVID-19 further increasing vulnerability
to superpower influence. The risks facing
these countries could translate to more
global conflict and a weaker system in
which to mediate it.
Caught in the middle
Middle powers are uniquely positioned to
offer alternative pathways for the world on
trade, security and technology. However,
growing capability gaps may force a
choice between two rival blocs rather than
allowing the middle powers to develop
a diverse network of mutually beneficial
agreements. For example, either the
European Union (EU) (which accounts for

nearly a third of global merchandise trade)18
or India (which is projected to become
the world’s most populated country in
2027)19 could provide a counterbalance
in the evolving geopolitical order in areas
such as manufacturing and trade, but they
will struggle to stand apart in digital and
defence realms.20
Growing competition between the United
States and China may also hinder other
regional powers that might otherwise wish
to pursue a balancing strategy. Middle
Eastern governments could be thrust into
a tug of war, with renewed US diplomacy
efforts juxtaposed against increased Chinese
economic initiatives in the region.21 In Latin
America and Africa, China’s deepening

Diplomatic relationships
will become more
unstable at points where
superpower tectonic plates
meet or withdraw

economic ties could potentially rival historic
security-based alliances and cultural
connections with the United States.22
Forced to choose sides, governments
may face economic or diplomatic
consequences, as proxy disputes play out
in control over economic or geographic
resources. The deepening of geopolitical
fault lines and the lack of viable middle
power alternatives make it harder for
countries to cultivate connective tissue with
a diverse set of partner countries based on
mutual values and maximizing efficiencies.
Instead, networks will become thick in
some directions and non-existent in others.
The COVID-19 crisis has amplified this
dynamic, as digital interactions represent
a “huge loss in efficiency for diplomacy”
compared with face-to-face discussions.23
With some alliances weakening, diplomatic
relationships will become more unstable at
points where superpower tectonic plates
meet or withdraw.
At the same time, without superpower
referees or middle power enforcement,
global norms may no longer govern
state behaviour. Some governments will
thus see the solidification of rival blocs
The Global Risks Report 2021

56

as an opportunity to engage in regional
posturing, which will have destabilizing
effects.24 Across societies, domestic
discord and economic crises will increase
the risk of autocracy, with corresponding
censorship, surveillance, restriction of
movement and abrogation of rights.25
Economic crises will also amplify the
challenges for middle powers as they
navigate geopolitical competition. ASEAN
countries, for example, had offered a
potential new manufacturing base as the
United States and China decouple, but the
pandemic has left these countries strapped
for cash to invest in the necessary
infrastructure and productive capacity.26
Economic fallout is pushing many countries
to debt distress (see Chapter 1, Global
Risks 2021). While G20 countries are
supporting debt restructure for poorer
nations,27 larger economies too may be
at risk of default in the longer term;28 this
would leave them further stranded—and
unable to exercise leadership—on the
global stage.

Multilateral meltdown
Middle power weaknesses will be
reinforced in weakened institutions,
which may translate to more uncertainty
and lagging progress on shared global
challenges such as climate change,
health, poverty reduction and technology
governance. In the absence of strong
regulating institutions, the Arctic and space
represent new realms for potential conflict
as the superpowers and middle powers
alike compete to extract resources and
secure strategic advantage.29
If the global superpowers continue to
accumulate economic, military and
technological power in a zero-sum
playing field, some middle powers could
increasingly fall behind. Without cooperation

or access to important innovations, middle
powers will struggle to define solutions
to the world’s problems. In the long term,
GRPS respondents forecasted “weapons of
mass destruction” and “state collapse” as
the two top critical threats: in the absence of
strong institutions or clear rules, clashes—
such as those in Nagorno-Karabakh or
the Galwan Valley—may more frequently
flare into full-fledged interstate conflicts,30
which is particularly worrisome where
unresolved tensions among nuclear powers
are concerned. These conflicts may lead
to state collapse, with weakened middle
powers less willing or less able to step in to
find a peaceful solution.

From alliances to
partnerships
No individual country, regardless of
governance approach, will be perfectly
equipped to address the mounting societal,
economic and environmental risks the
world faces. In this geopolitical context, it
is critical that middle powers can exercise
leadership to reinforce global resilience.
While many institutions of the post–World
War II architecture have weakened over
the last two decades, gaps remain in the
international space for leaders to fill with
innovative collaborations. At the same
time, middle powers represent the first and
best hope for reforming and repositioning
flagging international institutions.
Issue-based plurilateral arrangements
offer one opportunity. Where transnational
challenges lack successful global
governance structures, such as regulation
of cyberspace and digital information
flows, middle powers could lead inclusive
partnerships to earn back trust where
it has declined. Ad hoc and informal
arrangements around shared goals—
such as COVID-19 vaccines, digital and
cybersecurity partnerships, and climate
change mitigation and adaptation—can
contribute to resilience between states by
increasing interactions among members
of the networks. Such arrangements are
already emerging: for example, France
and Germany’s Alliance for Multilateralism
addresses issues such as disinformation,
misinformation and gender equality.31 The
Arctic Council is a forum for cooperation
The Global Risks Report 2021

Middle powers represent
the first and best hope for
reforming and repositioning
flagging international
institutions
that could potentially take on more
regulatory functions as climate crises
increasingly impact the region.32 Most
recently, the Access to COVID-19 Tools
Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator), a global
collaboration effort designed to accelerate
development, production and equitable
access to tests, treatments and vaccines,
has been called the “biggest multilateral
effort since the Paris climate agreement.”33
Such “thematic diplomacy” could also
contribute to the reform of existing
institutions.34 What UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres has called “a
surplus of multilateral challenges and a
deficit of multilateral solutions”35 could,
in fact, be an opportunity to reform

international architecture by refocusing
priorities on long-term crises, ensuring
productive use of stakeholder time and
resources, and preventing collateral
damage.36 Middle powers have a unique
role to play: championing inclusivity,
increasing predictability of funding,
channelling resources towards multilateral
initiatives, and insisting on adherence to
international norms that are increasingly
flouted will all provide critical support to a
weakening system.37
Opportunities also lie with innovative
collaborations between state and non-state
actors. For example, partnerships involving
the private sector and academia delivered
the fastest vaccine development process to
date. Canada, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom have pledged nearly
US$1 billion to a financing mechanism that
will support 92 low- and middle-income
countries to access a vaccine.38 And many
middle power governments are partnering
with sub-national entities and investors
on initiatives to tackle climate change.39
Green investment plans could offer a
resilience win-win for public and private
actors to adapt to and mitigate the impacts
of climate change, still the greatest threat
facing the world in the decades to come.

Disorderly
Industrial
Shakeout

The Global Risks Report 2021

Emerging from the shock and government
stimulus of COVID-19, a volatile shakeout
threatens the global business landscape.
Protectionism, technological transformation
and social unrest—among other trends—
have been disrupting economic activity for
some years, but the pandemic has given
them fresh momentum.
As they seek to shrug off the effects of the
pandemic, business ecosystems in many
countries are facing the risks of sclerotic,
regressive torpor or accelerated creative
destruction. Indecisive or misguided
leadership has the potential to exacerbate
these trends, causing ripples through the
global economy and locking in catastrophic
outcomes. Indeed, a disorderly shakeout
would precipitate economic stagnation in
advanced economies and lost potential in
emerging and developing markets, greater
bifurcation between major and minor
companies and the collapse of millions of
small businesses, and more inequality and
attrition of long-term global sustainable
development imperatives.
With governments still deliberating how
best to pivot away from the current
emergency footing that they have created
beneath much of the world’s economy and
workforce, and with companies anticipating
a much-changed business landscape in the
future, avoiding these potential outcomes

is critical to maintaining the long-term
sustainability and resilience of businesses.

A disruptive trilemma
New challenges to doing business are likely
to emerge from three key sources: national
agendas, technology that is running riot,
and heightened public scrutiny.
Nationally focused agendas
The pandemic has strengthened the
mandate of states to safeguard national
economic well-being. Both survival and
recovery are critical, and pressure is
mounting to ensure both aspects in a
post-pandemic world while at the same
time keeping a firm eye on national security.
How governments manage the challenge of
stemming the losses arising from COVID-19
while prioritizing future-oriented stimulus
packages will shape the risks that individual
companies face.
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs) have been hardest hit by
COVID-19. They are often collectively the
largest employers in a country: in China,
for example, they generate around 80%
of employment. An estimated 18% of
companies in China went bust between
February and May.1 In the United States,

Amplified protectionism may increase
costs and uncertainty in the business
environment
closed permanently between March and
August.2 Many that survived the initial
lockdowns remain dependent on state
support—the result of continuing restrictions
and decreased consumer confidence.
Minority- and women-owned firms
have also been disproportionately
affected, because many are in the food
services, retail and accommodation
sectors. Women-owned businesses
have been more affected regardless of
geography or market type (see Figure
5.1).3 Women and minorities were already
under-represented in entrepreneurship, and
poorly planned withdrawal of state support
risks setting back efforts to build more
inclusive local economies.4

In those countries that are starting to
emerge from the immediate emergency,
governments are experiencing a tension
between committing immediate fiscal
support for vulnerable businesses and the
livelihoods they sustain while at the same
time addressing pre-COVID structural
shortcomings, maintaining financial stability
and pressure on reserves and currency,
and ensuring growth in the long term to
enable a sustainable economic recovery.5
MSMEs should be encouraged to make
strategic investments for their efficient
future operation, such as providing
support for finding alternative markets
and conditional grants, accessing support
for training and redeployment, and for
digitalization and specific programs for

start-ups.6 Without this nudge, businesses
might suffer future paralysis or collapse
under debt obligations. Reports already
predict defaults on a significant proportion
of public and private loans in Brazil,7 India,8
and the United Kingdom.9 Global Risks
Perception Survey (GRPS) respondents
echo these concerns: “asset bubble burst”
and “debt crises” appear as critical threats
in the medium term.
Similarly, while a low-interest high-stimulus
context is allowing many businesses to
weather the global pandemic, when in
the recovery phase, sustaining large,
non-performing “zombie” firms risks
starving other businesses of potential
talent and capital and drags down longterm economic productivity.10 Managing
ballooning public debt, particularly in
advanced economies, depends on these
fragile productivity gains.

20%:

If growth is not realized, a return to austerity
may look attractive to governments.
But this would limit progress on crucial
development agendas such as investment
in the transition to net zero carbon
emissions and resilience to climate and
digital threats, as well as rebuilding social
security systems laid bare by COVID-19.
Alternatively, against a backdrop of
more dirigiste policy-making during the
pandemic, some political leaders may be
emboldened to pick winners—to decide
which businesses will survive and which
will not—for political reasons rather than
to enable a more sustainable future
economy. Propping up poorly performing
businesses leaves national accounts and
citizens with little opportunity to recapture
any benefit from bailing out private
enterprise, especially in the context of
globally inconsistent corporate tax regimes.

Under such circumstances, lessons from
the 2008–2009 Financial Crisis suggest
that large companies benefiting from this
corporate welfare while still rewarding
executives and shareholders will likely
suffer political and social backlash postcrisis, and they will also have to confront
future regulatory responses.11
Separately, the global business
environment may become costlier and
more uncertain as a result of amplified
protectionist trends, as some states
increasingly turn inwards in a bid to
strengthen self-sufficiency and protect
domestic jobs (see Chapter 4, Middle
Power Morass). In some economies,
companies operating in industries critical
to national resilience may face proposals
for expropriation, nationalization or an
increased government stake;12 in other
sectors, firms may be encouraged or
coerced to onshore supply chains and
bring back jobs.13 Smaller businesses
may suffer a wave of restructuring and
potential bankruptcies as they grapple with
increased operational and investment costs
to realign supply chains at a time when
they are already experiencing lower profit
margins and depleted reserves due to the
recent economic slump.
Workforce constraints have also emerged
as a pertinent issue in many countries.
More restrictive migration policies and
general economic hardships from a
combination of COVID-19 fallout dovetailing
with deepening protectionism are making it
harder for companies to attract and retain
foreign talent.14
Inevitably, as the national security agenda
and geopolitical tensions intensify, some
global companies also face greater
challenges in accessing foreign markets.15
Bans of communication apps and a new
wave of sanctions issued by the two
largest economies—the United States and
China—underline the consequences of
protectionism.16 As geopolitical concerns
deepen with respect to data privacy, the
5G race and under-regulated merger and
acquisition (M&A) activity, large businesses
will need to contend with continued political
interference regarding ownership, ethical
concerns, investment strategies and
intellectual property rights.17

Technology run riot
COVID-19 lockdowns have accelerated
the digital-physical hybridization enabled
by the Fourth Industrial Revolution
(see Chapter 2, Error 404).18 Almost
overnight, businesses worldwide have
faced the need to strengthen their digital
presence to survive and adapt, even in
heavily regulated industries. Years of
digital transformation plans have been
implemented within weeks.19
For the technology giants, this has been a
major opportunity. Demand grew rapidly
for services ranging from e-commerce
and remote working technologies to
online gaming and streaming. In early
January 2021, the world’s five biggest
tech companies represented 23% of the
S&P 500 by market capitalization, a 4.6%
increase from late January 2020.20
As other sectors struggle, the big
technology players will likely emerge
from the pandemic with stronger, more
diverse revenue streams and enhanced

investment power. Barriers to entry in the
digital marketplace are likely to increase
at an even faster pace—even before the
pandemic, the amount of computing
power for a leading artificial intelligence
system was doubling every two months,
an increase of 300,000 times since 2012.21
Implications also flow to smaller firms in
the form of higher costs and control of
critical data and digital infrastructure22—
and even to financial stability for emerging
and developing markets.23 The recovery
will also give fresh impetus to large
technology companies’ acquisition of
start-ups,24 as well as their expansion into
other sectors25—such as retail, healthcare,
transportation and logistics.26
It is not yet clear whether governments
and society will tolerate the growing
dominance of a small number of big
players—with revenues larger than that
of most countries—that are able to
ward off legal challenges and expand
their influence across industries and
government agendas.27 Indeed, in the
medium term, respondents to the GRPS
rank “tech governance failure” as a top
critical risk. Policy-makers also now have
more incentives for increasing scrutiny,
with growing concerns about antitrust
issues, digital harms, disinformation,
and foreign ownership implications for
national security and data privacy.28 They
could opt for tougher regulation—or even
attempt to break up these companies—in

a bid to improve oversight and strengthen
competition, aiming to benefit innovation
and consumers. Geopolitical schisms
could make for different playing fields in
different parts of the world (see Chapter
4, Middle Power Morass). Businesses
may need to prepare for panic in financial
markets and altered sales reach, as well as
identify alternative service providers—if they
exist—in the short-term disruption following
government intervention.29
Heightened public scrutiny
COVID-19 has laid bare systemic
inequalities in economies of all wealth
levels.30 Consumers and employees are
now scrutinizing corporate values more
intensely. Societies have become more
sceptical about the relationship between

business and governments, especially
regarding the probity of contracting
and outsourcing.31 Though immediate
employment challenges dominate public
attention, businesses must anticipate and
respond to these bottom-up societal risks.
That business has a positive impact on
wider society is a belief questioned by
an increasing number of people.32 In one
survey, only a third of respondents believed
that business does a good job of partnering
with non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) or government.33 Although
immediate employment challenges may
temporarily shift public attention away from
unethical business practices, bribery and
corruption are likely to continue worrying
citizens in many economies.34 Advanced
economies are seeing more litigation against
companies on topics including climate
risk.35 Many countries have seen significant
popular protests against corporations.36
Beyond its impact on employment,
COVID-19 has exposed how social fabrics
have been widely weakened by structural
inequalities. Activists are spotlighting
businesses that are perceived to have
been exploitative during the pandemic—

for example, re-contracting workers who
were essential during lockdowns as gig
workers with minimum to no benefits
or health insurance coverage.37 In the
coming years, attention will likely pass
to firms that have rapidly automated
processes and operations at the expense
of their workers.38 Acknowledging
sectoral differences, businesses will also
have to consider implications of new
workplace practices for maintaining client
relationships, fewer choices in some parts
of the business, and unequal impacts on
junior versus senior staff.

Businesses that reflect
societal values can
strengthen societal trust
and reduce inequality
A creative recovery
Companies that misjudge their actions
and investments in the face of these shifts,
and that fail to appreciate the scale of the
rethinking required, face uncertainties
amid shocks. But those emerging from the
COVID-19 crisis with their resilience tested
can embrace a huge opportunity to fasttrack progress to a better normal.
The dire economic impacts of COVID-19,
combined with historically low interest
rates and the social costs of austerity,
have spurred governments to make
unprecedented economic interventions.
As they shift emphasis from economic
stability to the goal of building back better,
there is scope to catalyse an inclusive
and green recovery that delivers broad
societal benefits, meeting the imperatives
of the Paris Agreement and the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.39
While this form of recovery may require
the next wave of fiscal support to be more
conditional than the support that has been
seen to date, it also behoves businesses
in all sectors and of all sizes to ensure
that sustainability is a core pillar of their
recovery and new positioning.

Against this backdrop, new partnerships
can be forged. Under the right governance
frameworks, especially in the realm of
data privacy, big tech can work with
governments to strengthen resilience,
enhance efficiencies and deliver new
targeted services such as accessible
finance products for disadvantaged
groups (see Chapter 1, Global Risks 2021).
Technology-based services can help to
create new business ecosystems and level
up opportunities, closing digital divides.
Large companies can help smaller ones
in their value chain to set sustainability
objectives, formulate standards and
measure progress.40
The transformation of businesses and
industries requires agile and distributed
workforces, hybrid working options, and
comprehensive reskilling and upskilling
of employees.41 Companies will need
to rethink their physical space and
organizational design as they transition
employees into new roles and navigate
the opportunities of automation and
digitalization—without reinforcing
the systemic inequalities laid bare by
COVID-19.
These opportunities can help deliver
on the promise of multistakeholder
capitalism—facilitating a shared and
sustained value creation that strengthens
a company’s long-term prosperity.
Businesses that reflect societal values,
with clarity of purpose not merely empty
rhetoric, can support a broad-based
and sustainable economic recovery and
growth, as well as the strengthening of
societal trust and reduction of inequality.
Such outcomes are critical for meeting
current and future crises.

The Global Risks Report 2021

COVID-19 has revealed key lessons about
how the global community responds to
crisis. Despite some remarkable examples
of determination, cooperation and
innovation, most countries struggled with at
least some aspects of crisis management—
and the world has not yet come together
to mitigate the fallout. While it is too early to
draw definitive lessons, this chapter distils
some early observations across different
response areas.
If the lessons drawn from this crisis inform
decision-makers only how to better
prepare for the next pandemic—rather than
enhancing the processes, capabilities, and
culture for galvanizing effort around other
major concerns—the world will have fallen
into the familiar risk management trap
of planning for the last crisis rather than
anticipating the next (see Box 6.1).

Global cooperation
In a connected world, an outbreak
anywhere is a risk everywhere—and, on
average, a new infectious disease emerges
in humans every four months, with 75%
of these new diseases coming from
animals.1 This section takes stock of global
preparedness by looking at four key areas
of the COVID-19 response: institutional

B O X 6 .1

Pandemics and Crisis Response in
the Global Risks Report Series
The Global Risks Report has frequently discussed the risk
of pandemics to health and livelihoods. The 2020 edition
flagged how health systems across the world were generally
stretched; the 2018 and 2019 editions highlighted biological
threats and antimicrobial resistance; and the 2016 edition
stressed that the Ebola crisis would “not be the last serious
epidemic” and that “public health outbreaks are likely to
become ever more complex and challenging”.
The report has also explored aspects of managing risk and
building resilience to crises: the 2018 and 2019 editions,
for example, looked at the impacts of complexity and
cognitive bias on risk assessment and response. The
experience of COVID-19 so far offers an opportunity to
update our understanding.

authority, risk financing, information
collection and sharing, and equipment
and vaccines.
Institutional authority
Response to risks like a pandemic requires
effective global cooperation, information
sharing and coordination. The H1N1 and
Ebola outbreaks in the 2010s highlighted
the need to strengthen the World Health
Organization (WHO)’s competencies,2 yet
some areas of weakness have intensified.
The WHO lacks independent investigative
powers and also lacks the ability to sanction
non-compliant member states (by design
and charter); its authority has been further
challenged in recent years by nationalist
behaviours in many countries. Throughout
the crisis, the WHO’s advice at times
competed with that of several governments.
This conflict reiterated the challenges
that, at times of urgency, the multilateral
system faces to function in a way that is
commensurate to the scale of global crises.
Beyond the WHO, other international
actors struggled to mount a coordinated
response to the global health, societal
and economic crisis. For example, the
United Nations Security Council was
slow in reaching a resolution to support
the Secretary-General’s call for a global
ceasefire.3 The G7 and the G20, hampered
by domestic and bilateral political issues,
also failed to mount a collective response
commensurate with the scale of the
impacts, although they had been able to do
this in previous crises.4 This was seen in an
initial failure to increase available resources
for international finance organizations and
to suspend debt repayments.5
Risk financing
The WHO’s annual budget—US$2.4
billion6—is far outweighed by the economic
and development costs of the pandemic
so far. In the early stages of the pandemic,
delivery of supplementary crisis funding
proved to be a slow process. It took two
months to meet an initial funding goal
of US$675 million.7 International finance
organizations were faster to mobilize to
help low- and middle-income nations
prepare healthcare services and support
households during lockdowns. However,
here too greater preparedness is needed:8
although funding was available in March or

Early response efforts were
hampered by the lack of
robust data-sharing systems
April when pre-determined triggers were in
place, in the absence of those triggers relief
took longer to disburse (see Figure 6.1).
Based on the dire economic and
development consequences of the
pandemic thus far and experience from
previous infectious diseases, the benefits
from investing more in preparedness
globally would have been a valuable
investment especially if also coupled with
the enhancement of health systems. This
will continue to be the case and is true
across different types of disasters.9
Information collection and sharing
Early response efforts were hampered by
the lack of robust data-sharing systems
that would enable large-scale and near-

real-time analysis on information such as
testing and infection rates, fatality numbers,
personal mobility, and viral genome
sequences.10 Although such systems
were rapidly developed, they were often
restricted by a lack of open data standards.
Collaboration between the private and
public sectors did work well in some
cases. For example, in March 2020, the
World Economic Forum launched the
COVID Action Platform and communicated
weekly updates from governments, the
World Health Organization, and vaccine
manufacturers with more than 1,800
executives and leaders. The platform has
helped channel the supply of essential
equipment through the Pandemic Supply
Chain Network.
Technology companies also provided
mobility data that helped authorities
understand the potential spread and
better target responses.11 Scientists
sequenced and shared more than 32,000
viral genomes, enabling researchers to
trace more quickly the origin of outbreaks

As vaccine rollouts begin,
rapid dissemination of
challenges and best
practices will be key
for success
and laying the foundation for more robust
pandemic surveillance in the future.12
Information on the relative success of
medical treatment options was rapidly
disseminated by medical professionals
and pharmaceutical companies, improving
outcomes across the world.

Equipment and vaccines
Early competition to secure personal
protective equipment (PPE) and medical
supplies made it harder to optimize their
development and distribution. Governments
requisitioned masks that had been ordered
by foreign buyers, and, in some cases,
stock was reportedly sold to higher bidders
on airport runways.13 As of October 2020,
more than 90 jurisdictions had implemented
export controls (see Figure 6.2).14 On a
more positive note, innovative public-private
partnerships emerged as supply chains
were rapidly reconfigured to meet demand.15
Vaccine development progressed rapidly
through collaboration among private
companies and universities facilitated by
government funding, although it is still
unclear how concerns about intellectual

property rights, pricing and procurement
will be handled.16 Initiatives to deploy
vaccines equitably to low- and middleincome countries, such as the G20’s
COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, have been
hampered by funding and distribution
challenges. More than 180 countries
have signed up to take part in the WHO’s
COVAX initiative to facilitate lower-cost
bulk purchases of vaccines. However,
low- and middle-income countries may
receive only a small fraction of their
doses for frontline workers until advanced
economies have achieved a vaccine
coverage of 20%.17
Other implementation challenges
for vaccine programmes still require
resolution—for example, distribution (cold
chain requirements, global glass vial
availability and supply logistics for lowdensity areas) and application (defining
priority groups, recording doses given and
countering vaccine hesitancy). As vaccine
rollouts begin, rapid dissemination of
challenges and best practices will be key
for successful iteration across economies.

National-level responses
National-level responses have varied
given different starting points: income
level, health system maturity, geographic

and demographic characteristics, culture
and type of political regime. Nonetheless,
early lessons can be drawn in five
areas: governmental decision-making,
public communication, health system
capabilities, lockdown management, and
financial assistance to the vulnerable.
These areas are interdependent: a weak
performance in one area has spill-over
effects elsewhere.
Governmental decision-making
In the early days, with imperfect and
evolving information, all governments
understandably struggled to balance
health security with economic impact
and community sentiment.18 However,
some countries subsequently proved
more able than others to formulate
clear strategies and adapt them as new
information became available.19 Countries
that already had a pandemic high on
their risk registers could appreciate the
different dimensions of the risk, the key
considerations and mitigation options,
and the evidence needed to inform
decisions. While some were able to
put the lessons from stress tests and
table-top exercises into practice, others
failed to apply previously developed
response strategies.20 Some also failed
to appreciate lessons learned in other
countries once the pandemic had
begun, losing valuable time to build

capacity, understand vulnerabilities and
develop contingencies.21 This lack of
understanding grew more complicated as
strains mutated and emerged with higher
levels of transmissibility.22
Separately, concern has also grown about
the scope and duration of new emergency
powers and the consolidation of a lessconsultative mode of leadership.23 In some
countries, the side-lining of key public
servants, soured relationships among
government actors, and the failure to heed
expert advisory body recommendations
have exacerbated challenges to a
successful response.24

Communication with populations
Governments that most successfully
sustained popular confidence in 2020
were typified by regular and consistent
public reporting, transparency about the
limits of knowledge at any given time, and
visible alignment between politicians and
experts in areas such as epidemiology and
behavioural science.25 Behaviour tended
to be more chaotic where governmental
messaging lacked clarity, measures
seemed discriminatory, national and local
leaders espoused different agendas, and
competing narratives sowed doubt26—
exacerbated by misinformation on social
media (see Chapter 2, Error 404).27

Health system capabilities
Many countries made extraordinary efforts
to expand health system capacity in the
first wave of the pandemic—for example,
by delaying elective care, reallocating
medical professionals, and building whole
new temporary hospitals. However, in
addition to PPE shortcomings discussed
above, health systems also often
overlooked the challenge of controlling
infections in high-impact facilities such
as care homes, where age and poor
health gave rise to high numbers of
deaths (see Figure 6.3). In many cases,
there was also insufficient forethought
paid to chronic exhaustion among health
system personnel, as subsequent waves
of the pandemic coincided with the need
to attend to other conditions that had
worsened during lockdowns28—e.g. for
the 41% of adults in the United States who
delayed or avoided medical care.29 Health
workers have already begun leaving
the profession (see Chapter 1, Global
Risks 2021). Mental health issues across
populations—including anxiety, depression
and post-traumatic stress—are also set
to increase (see Chapter 1, Global Risks
2021 and Chapter 3, Pandemials).

41%:

adults in the US who delayed or
avoided medical care

Many countries struggled with testing,
tracking and contact tracing,30 even
though these were seen as critical to
keeping outbreaks under control and
economies open.31 Such systems were
often slow to identify where infections
were spreading: from international travel,
meat packing facilities, large social
gatherings, or accommodation for
migrant construction workers.32
Lockdown management
National lockdowns had some successes:
for example, the shielding of vulnerable

individuals often worked well in
advanced economies, with public-private
collaboration ensuring delivery of food
supplies. However, disruption of schooling
and workplaces caused a wide range of
impacts in countries of all income levels
(see Chapter 3, Pandemials),33 including
an exacerbation of digital divides (see
Chapter 2, Error 404). Box 6.2 compares
the characteristics of lockdown responses
across regions.
After the gradual opening up of
economies caused cases to rise again,
many governments were reluctant to
revert to extended nationwide lockdowns,
instead trying short (two-to four-week)
“circuit breakers” or more nuanced local
restrictions (such as curfews, hospitality
closures, bans on inter-household mixing,
and travel constraints).34 The timing
and conditions for the deployment of
these measures, and their prospects
of success in controlling the spread
of the virus, generated fraught policy
discussions, and mixed outcomes
resulted in some governments returning
to more restrictive national approaches.35
Financial assistance for individuals
Lockdown measures caused a
sharp downturn in economic output,
endangering jobs and businesses.
Wealthier countries sought to define
and deliver relief packages (see
Chapter 1, Global Risks 2021) for the
most-affected groups and supported
employers in their efforts to retain
employees.36 However, the phasing
out of support will leave many
businesses with difficult employment
decisions (see Chapter 5, Imperfect
Markets). Rapidly rising unemployment
in the second half of 2020 began to put
additional pressure on other welfare
system provisions and exacerbated
mental health challenges. Developing
economies with limited public finances
often faced the difficult choice between
lockdowns with no or little financial
assistance for those who lost their
livelihoods and keeping their economies
open at the risk of rapid spread of the
virus and overwhelmed health systems.
In many economies, informal markets
also complicated the distribution of
financial assistance.

Responding to COVID-19 :
Regional Characteristics

Sub-Saharan Africa

Perceived effectiveness of regional and
global COVID-19 response in the GRPS
1 = COMPLETE FAILURE, 5 = COMPLETE SUCCESS

Regional: 3.07

Global: 2.51

Experience with infectious diseases meant health professionals and political leaders in Africa were
on high alert and coordinating as soon as the region’s ﬁrst cases were reported. Relatively swift
policy responses to limit spread and the beneﬁts of a younger age proﬁle compensated for health
system weaknesses and kept mortality rates lower than they might have been in the initial wave,
although infection and mortality rates were rising at the time of publication.

Central and Latin America

Regional: 2.99

Global: 2.40

Countries in Central and Latin America implemented some of the world’s most stringent travel
controls and lockdowns, with the virus arriving later than in other areas. However, cultural
resistance in some countries, a high degree of employment informality, limited social protection
mechanisms and decades of health system underfunding resulted in lower levels of compliance,
stretched health systems and high mortality rates.

East Asia and the Pacific

Regional: 3.52

Global: 2.37

Remembering the SARS epidemic, many countries in East Asia moved quickly, implementing a
combination of travel bans, lockdowns and extensive testing with contact tracing, quickly targeting
fresh outbreaks. High degrees of compliance, comfort with technology, cultural norms of collective
responsibility and familiarity with mask-wearing helped public health measures “bend the curve”.
With continuous upgrading of public health strategies, many countries are now looking to ease
measures such as travel bans.
Taking advantage of their geography, many Paciﬁc islands remain relatively unscathed as a result of
the early closure of borders. More-advanced island economies, such as Australia and New
Zealand, were able to implement and sustain strict lockdowns to contain periodic outbreaks.

Europe

Regional: 2.99

Global: 2.40

In the highly interconnected economies of Europe, a combination of sovereign priorities, regional
autonomy or devolved powers, and sensitivity to the rights of individuals complicated the national
implementation of public health measures and international collaboration. Pressure to re-establish
normalcy over the summer of 2020 precipitated a new wave of cases in autumn. Governments
proved reluctant to re-impose national lockdowns.

Middle East and North Africa

Regional: 2.68

Global: 2.46

In the Middle East and North Africa, capacities and responses varied greatly but relatively young
populations may have spared the region from higher death tolls; however, data in some locations
are uncertain. Some nations with advanced medical systems and regimes able to enforce
lockdowns and other social restrictions along with border controls have managed successive
waves of infections. Other, poorer nations, and those that are fragile and in conﬂict situations,
however, are suﬀering exacerbated economic and humanitarian challenges.

The Global Risks Report 2021

79

North America

Regional: 2.00

Global: 2.51

North America, particularly the United States, saw similar challenges to Europe regarding national
versus local priorities and individual freedoms. High levels of political divisiveness ampliﬁed
disinformation and eroded public trust. On the other hand, ﬁnancial and manufacturing capabilities
were rapidly harnessed to build medical supply capacity and begin vaccine development.

South Asia

Regional: 2.86

Global: 2.72

Some South Asian countries locked down early to try to avoid overwhelming their healthcare
systems. The health results were mixed and the impacts on livelihoods were severe, with the
underprivileged most aﬀected. A staged unlocking of social and economic activity aimed to
mitigate these eﬀects. Other countries had less restrictive policy programmes, and most were
challenged by limited governmental capacity and willingness to respond.

Accidental war

Anarchic
uprising

An inter-state skirmish escalates to war as governments fail to control action
in the absence of accurate information. Weakened multilateralism leads to
failure to contain.

Young activists, fed up with corruption, inequality and suffering,
mobilize against elites. AI-powered social media is exploited to spread
disinformation, fomenting social chaos.

Brain-machine
interface exploited

Companies, governments or individuals utilize burgeoning “mind-reading”
technology to extract data from individuals for commercial or repressive
purposes.

Collapse of an
established democracy

A democracy turns authoritarian through the progressive hollowing out of
the body of law. A legal rather than a violent coup erodes the system, with
knock-on effects on other democratic systems.

Geomagnetic
disruption

A rapid reversal of the Earth’s geomagnetic poles generates destabilizing
consequences for the biosphere and human activity.

Gene editing for
human enhancement

Neurochemical
control

Governments begin classified genetic engineering programmes. A class of
people is born with genetic capabilities better suited for space, Arctic, or
deep-sea survival, setting off a genetic arms race between geopolitical rivals
with undetermined ethical consequences.

Malicious use of pharmaceutical neurochemicals aims to control
adversaries. Governments begin to use these drugs for non-lethal
law enforcement.

Permafrost melt releases
ancient microorganisms

A warming planet leads to permafrost melt in the Arctic. An ancient virus,
unknown in modern science, is released into the air, soil, and water systems.

Deployment of small-scale
nuclear weapons

New technology allows for proliferation of low-yield warheads, blurring
deterrence frameworks and leading to global nuclear war.

Appendix B:
Global Risks Perception Survey and Methodology
The Global Risks Perception Survey (GRPS) is the
World Economic Forum’s source of original risks
data, harnessing the expertise of the Forum’s
extensive network of business, government, civil
society and thought leaders. Survey responses
were collected from 8 September to 23 October
2020 among the World Economic Forum’s
multistakeholder communities (including the Global
Shapers Community), the professional networks of
its Advisory Board, and members of the Institute of
Risk Management. The results of the GRPS are used
to create the Global Risks Horizon, the Global Risks
Landscape, and the Global Risks Network presented

at the beginning of the report, and to offer insights
used throughout.
Both the GRPS and the Global Risks Report adopt the
following definition of global risk:
– Global risk: A “global risk” is an uncertain event
or condition that, if it occurs, can cause significant
negative impact for several countries or industries
within the next 10 years.

Updates in the GRPS 2020
New list of risks
The list of 35 global risks included in the survey was
updated in 2020.
This year, 12 new risks were added as a result
of observed economic, geopolitical, societal and
technological trends, as well exacerbated or emerging
trends from the COVID-19 crisis that have the potential
to have long-term effects. These new risks are: (1)
“collapse of a multilateral institution”, (2) “collapse of a
systemically important industry”, (3) “collapse or lack
of social security systems”, (4) “digital inequality”, (5)
“digital power concentration”, (6) “failure of technology
governance”, (7) “fracture of interstate relations”, (8)
“geopolitization of strategic resources”, (9) “pervasive
backlash against science”, (10) “prolonged economic
stagnation”, (11) “severe mental health deterioration”
and (12) “widespread youth disillusionment”.
The names and definitions of the remaining 23 risks
have been revised and, where applicable, have been
modified and/or expanded to reflect new ways in
which the risks may materialize and the potential
adverse outcomes they may cause. However, to ensure
comparability over time, names and definitions were
modified insofar as the fundamental concept of the
risk remained consistent with previous versions of the
survey. In three cases, previous risks considered to be
different manifestations of the same risk were merged:
(1) cyberattacks and data fraud were merged into “failure
of cybersecurity measures”, (2) inflation and deflation into
“failure to stabilize price trajectories” and (3) food crisis
and water crisis into “natural resource crises”.

New sections
The GRPS 2020 features four new sections:
1. Global Risks Horizon: recognizes that
respondents may have varying perceptions on the
evolution of global risks within a 10-year horizon.
2. Global Risks Network: recognizes that
respondents may be subject to different degrees of
exposure to global risks, as well as to the existence
of negative feedback loops by which global risks
amplify each other.
3. Global Risk Response: aims to complement
risk identification with risk response by asking
respondents to identify blind spots and
opportunities for global response.
4. COVID-19 Response: at the specific point in
time during which the survey was conducted, this
section compares how respondents perceive the
effectiveness of the response to the COVID-19 crisis
and its fallout at a global and regional scale.

The Global Risks Report 2021

Methodology
The Global Risks Horizon
For each of the 35 global risks listed in Appendix A,
respondents were asked to identify when they believe
a risk will become a critical threat to the world, within
the following timeframes:

– 2 points each time a risk was selected as the
second most concerning risk

– Short-term threats: 0–2 years

Respondents were then asked to select up to five
risks they consider will be driving each of the risks that
were previously selected as top concerns over the
course of the next 10 years, in no particular order. Two
risks could be selected as drivers of each other. For
example, in the first step, a respondent could select
“climate action failure” as the most concerning risk and
“extreme weather events” as one of its drivers. In the
second step, the respondent could select “extreme
weather events” as the second most concerning
risk and “climate action failure” as one of its drivers.
However, a risk could not be selected as driving itself.

– Medium-term threats: 3–5 years
– Long-term threats: 5–10 years
A simple tally for each of the 35 global risks was
calculated on this basis. The results are illustrated in
the Global Risks Horizon 2021 (Figure I).
Global Risks Landscape
For each of the 35 global risks listed in Appendix A,
respondents were asked to score (1) the likelihood
of each global risk occurring over the course of the
next 10 years and (2) the severity of its impact at a
global level if it were to occur, both on a scale from
1 to 5, as follows:
– Likelihood: a value of 1 for “very unlikely” and 5 for
“very likely” to occur over the next 10 years
– Impact: a value of 1 for “minimal” impact and 5 for
“catastrophic” impact at a global level
To reduce timing bias, respondents were reminded
to score each of the 35 risks over a 10-year period.
To reduce framing bias, except for the extremes,
the values within the 1–5 scale were not assigned
specific wording. Respondents could leave the
question completely blank. Partial responses for any
risk—those scoring only the likelihood of occurrence
or only the severity of impact—were not included in
the results.
A simple average for both likelihood and impact for
each of the 35 global risks was calculated on this
basis. The results are illustrated in the Global Risks
Landscape 2021 (Figure II).
Global Risks Network
From the list of the 35 global risks listed in Appendix A,
respondents were asked to rank order the three risks
they consider to be the most concerning, second most
concerning and third most concerning for the world.
The results were aggregated according to the following
scoring scheme:
– 3 points each time a risk was selected as the most
concerning risk

– 1 point each time a risk was selected as the third
most concerning risk

A simple tally of the number of times a risk was identified
as a driver for each of the first, second and third most
concerning risks was calculated on this basis. The results
are illustrated in the Global Risks Network 2021 (Figure III).
In that figure, the size of each of the most concerning risk
nodes is scaled according to the above scoring scheme.
The thickness of each of the links between a driver and a
risk is scaled according to the above tally.
Global Risk Response
From the list of the 35 global risks listed in Appendix A,
respondents were asked to rank order the three risks
for which they consider the current global response falls
short of their potential impact (“blind spots”) and the
three risks for which they consider a coordinated global
response has the most potential to prevent or mitigate
(“opportunities”). The results for both categories were
aggregated according to the following scoring scheme
(see Figure B.2 Global Risk Response for a representation
of the GRPS respondents’ response to risks):
– 3 points each time a risk was selected as the top
blind spot or opportunity
– 2 points each time a risk was selected as the
second blind spot or opportunity
– 1 point each time a risk was selected as the third
blind spot or opportunity
COVID-19 Response
Respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of
the response to COVID-19 in terms of protecting lives
and livelihoods, globally and in their region, on a scale
from 1 to 5 with 1 meaning a “complete failure” and 5
meaning a “complete success”.
The Global Risks Report 2021

91

Considering the different trajectories that
COVID-19 has followed across countries and
regions, a quantitative test was performed to check
for timing bias in the responses to this question.
Responses were evenly distributed in two groups
according to their entry date. Average regional and

global scores were then compared between
groups. Significant differences were not found
within the survey dates: on average, the regional
score differed by 5 centesimal points (or 1.90%)
between groups and the global score by
9 centesimal points (or 3.20%).

– Part 3 - Global Risk Response: 623 respondents
identified at least one blind spot or opportunity.
Empty responses were dismissed.

Completion thresholds
We received 841 total responses to the GRPS to which we
applied an overall standard deviation check and specific
completion thresholds for each section of the survey:

Blind spots: Six responses that contain the same
risk in multiple ranks were dismissed. The remaining
617 responses were used to compute the results.

– Part 1.1 - Impact and Likelihood of Global Risks:
664 respondents scored the impact and likelihood
of at least one risk. Empty or partial responses
for any risk—those scoring only the likelihood of
occurrence or only the impact—were dismissed. 0
responses yielded a standard deviation of zero.

Opportunities: Six responses that contain the same
risk in multiple ranks were dismissed. The remaining
617 responses were used to compute the results.

– Part 1.2 - Assessment of Global Risks: Horizon:
647 respondents placed at least one risk within
a possible timeframe. Empty responses were
dismissed. Four responses that yielded a standard
deviation of zero (assigning numbers to the three
possible timeframes) were dismissed. The remaining
643 responses were used to compute the results.

– Part 4 - COVID-19 Response: 626 respondents
scored at least one level of response, either global
or regional. Empty responses were dismissed.
– Sample distribution: the 664 respondents
from Part 1.1 were used to calculate the sample
distribution by place of residence, gender, age and
area of expertise.

– Part 2 - Global Risk Drivers: 631 respondents
ranked at least one concerning risk and assigned
at least one driver. Three responses that contain
the same risk in multiple ranks were dismissed.
The remaining 628 responses were used to
compute the results.
