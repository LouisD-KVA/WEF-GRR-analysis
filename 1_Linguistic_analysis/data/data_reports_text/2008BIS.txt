78th Annual Report

submitted to the Annual General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements
held in Basel on 30 June 2008

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is my pleasure to submit to you the 78th Annual Report of the Bank for
International Settlements for the financial year which ended on 31 March 2008.
The net profit for the year amounted to SDR 544.7 million, compared with
SDR 619.2 million for the preceding year. The figure for the preceding year has
been restated to reflect a change in accounting policy made in this year’s
accounts. Details of the results for the financial year 2007/08 may be found on
pages 180–5 of this Report under “Financial results and profit distribution”.
The amended accounting policies are disclosed on pages 199–204, and their
financial impact is disclosed in note 3 on pages 206–207.
The Board of Directors proposes, in application of Article 51 of the Bank’s
Statutes, that the present General Meeting apply the sum of SDR 144.7 million
in payment of a dividend of SDR 265 per share, payable in any constituent
currency of the SDR, or in Swiss francs. This year’s proposed amount
compares to the dividend of SDR 255 per share paid out last year.
The Board further recommends that SDR 40.0 million be transferred to
the general reserve fund, SDR 6.0 million to the special dividend reserve fund
and the remainder – amounting to SDR 354.0 million – to the free reserve
fund. In addition, it is proposed to deduct SDR 71.3 million from the free
reserve fund for the prior year effect of the change in accounting policy.
If these proposals are approved, the Bank’s dividend for the financial year
2007/08 will be payable to shareholders on 3 July 2008.

I. Introduction: the unsustainable has run its course

The simmering turmoil in financial markets came to the boil on 9 August 2007.
On that day, a number of central banks felt compelled to take extraordinary
measures in an attempt to restore order in the interbank market. The disorder
was triggered by a freeze on redemptions from a small number of funds that
had invested in structured finance products backed by US subprime mortgages
of recent vintage. When or where it will end, no one can say with certainty. The
duration of the turmoil, its scope and the growing evidence of effects on the
real economy have come as a great surprise to most commentators, private
as well as public.
Yet it is essential that we understand what is going on. How could
problems with subprime mortgages, being such a small sector of global
financial markets, provoke such a dislocation? Answering this question is
crucial to assessing how severe the economic consequences of these events
might be. It is also crucial for determining how policy should respond. Current
difficulties must be overcome as a first priority. But, equally importantly, new
reforms must be introduced and implemented to reduce the likelihood of such
potentially costly events being repeated. As difficult as today’s challenges
might be, they also provide a motivation for institutional change that should
not be ignored.
To date, most analysis of the turmoil has focused on the market
segments where it all began, and the particular role played by new financial
developments. The school of “What is different?” has emphasised shortcomings
in the way the originate-to-distribute model of banking was extended to the
mortgage sector. It has also highlighted the expanded role played by highly
innovative structured products, their encouragement by rating agencies, and
the recourse to off-balance sheet vehicles by banks eager to reduce their
use of regulatory capital. All of this is important and points to useful policy
prescriptions.
Nevertheless, this approach only complements a more fundamental
analysis that helps explain not only the recent financial turmoil, but also rising
inflation as well as the sharp retrenchment in many housing markets. The
school of “What is the same?” would note the parallels between this period
of financial and economic turmoil and many earlier ones. Historians would
recall the long recession beginning in 1873, the global downturn that began in
the late 1920s, and the Japanese and Asian crises of the early and late 1990s
respectively. In each episode, a long period of strong credit growth coincided
with an increasingly euphoric upturn in both the real economy and financial
markets, followed by an unexpected crisis and extended downturn. In virtually

BIS 78th Annual Report

3

every instance, some form of new economic discovery or new financial
development provided a further “new era” justification for rapid credit
expansion, and predictably became a focus for blame in the downturn. Against
this background, even what has been identified as different, above, remains
fundamentally the same.

What has been happening: a description
Over the last two decades, much seems to have gone right in the global
economy. Inflation has been maintained at very low levels almost everywhere
and, until recently, was showing remarkable stability. At the same time, growth
has generally been high, with that in the last four years being the fastest on
record. Along with these features, economic downturns in the advanced
industrial economies have been so shallow since the early 1980s that they
gave rise to the accolade “the Great Moderation”. Moreover, the fact that the
advanced industrial countries had proven so resilient to recurrent episodes
of stress in financial markets was hailed as a further indicator of better
functioning economies. In particular, the maintenance of low inflation by
credible central banks was seen to have played a crucial stabilising role
throughout most of the industrial world.
Yet the very mention of financial shocks leads on to two less reassuring
questions. The first is why both the frequency and the magnitude of such
episodes of financial stress seem to have risen. And the second, sparked in
particular by the events surrounding the distressed hedge fund LTCM in 1998,
is whether the centre of the global financial system might eventually prove as
vulnerable as the periphery. The events of the past year have demonstrated
that these causes for concern are not misplaced.
The financial turmoil began in the market for US subprime mortgages, and
the markets for structured products based on them. Delinquency rates in the
subprime market had started to rise in early 2005, almost contemporaneously
with outright declines in house prices, but there was no significant market
response to this development until early 2007. Credit spreads on such
products then began to widen, rating downgrades increased, and the process
accelerated sharply in August. The trigger, as already mentioned, was the
decision by a small number of investment funds to freeze redemptions, citing
an inability to value their complex assets. From this small beginning, the
financial disruption then fanned out to virtually every corner of the system.
By early August, a combination of growing concerns about the valuations
of complex products, liquidity risk and counterparty risk had led to a host of
other markets being negatively affected. There was an effective collapse of the
market for structured products based on mortgages, a massive withdrawal of
investors from the asset-backed commercial paper market, and a sudden
drying-up of interbank term money markets in the major currencies. This last
development manifested itself in the form of an unprecedented gap between
expected policy interest rates (over a one- to three-month horizon) and the
rates at which the largest banks were prepared to lend to each other. While it
was almost inevitable that difficulties in the subprime market would eventually

4

BIS 78th Annual Report

have some repercussions for the financial institutions at the centre of this
market, the force and speed of the impact took virtually everyone by surprise.
Moreover, these disturbances in the short-term money markets quickly
began to be reflected elsewhere, reinforced by growing pessimism about the
macroeconomic outlook and a general rise in risk aversion. The rates on core
government bonds from advanced industrial countries initially fell sharply.
Simultaneously, high-risk corporate spreads widened, and the corporate
takeover market virtually collapsed. Equity prices did not respond at once, but
eventually fell significantly, in particular the shares of financial firms. In a
number of countries, but especially the United States, residential property
prices came under increasing downward pressure, and the commercial
property market also began to soften. Finally, volatility rose sharply in most
financial markets, as did the cost of purchasing insurance against that
volatility.
Given the central role played in the US subprime market by banks
headquartered in the United States and Europe, it was not surprising that they
had begun to announce losses. More surprising, and worrying, was the
frequency with which announced losses were revised upwards, and how
much the ratio of revealed losses to known exposures diverged across banks.
In the beginning, however, confidence was maintained that banks had adequate
capital to absorb these losses. Thus, there was initially no concern that there
would be a significant effect on credit conditions, much less a “credit crunch”.
This assumption was threatened as early as the third quarter of 2007. It
became increasingly clear that the size of banks’ balance sheets, and the
associated need for capital, were set to rise involuntarily as contracts made
earlier to provide liquidity support were activated. Not least, a number of
structured investment vehicles (SIVs) which banks had set up to hold assets
off their balance sheets had to be reabsorbed as their independent sources of
funding dried up. Confidence was further shaken, albeit later temporarily
restored, around the turn of the year when a number of global banks
announced both the need to supplement their capital levels and their success
in raising equity from sovereign wealth funds. Another severe jolt to confidence
came in March 2008, when Bear Stearns, a large US investment bank, ran into
major financial difficulties with frightening speed. However, the erosion of
confidence was more than offset when the Federal Reserve helped the bank to
merge with the still larger but healthier JPMorgan Chase. Still more recently,
concerns have also begun to mount about the capital adequacy of a number
of medium-sized banks, particularly in countries where such banks have large
exposures to the housing and construction sectors.
As for other financial institutions, they too were drawn into the drama. At
money market mutual funds, withdrawals rose early in the turmoil but inflows
later surged as investors sought safety. Correspondingly, the funds themselves
became increasingly conservative and unwilling to provide term funds to banks.
Hedge funds, dependent on prime brokers, faced calls for margin as asset
prices fell, and these calls became increasingly insistent with time. Many were
forced into asset sales, further depressing prices, and some even into default.
A number of insurance companies and pension funds, while sheltered to some

BIS 78th Annual Report

degree by differences in accounting standards, announced sizeable losses
related to subprime mortgages and associated structured products. Perhaps even
more worryingly, a number of “monoline” insurers, which have traditionally
used their high ratings to provide investment guarantees to borrowers such
as US states and municipalities, were either downgraded or threatened with
downgrades by rating agencies because of guarantees provided for structured
products. In this way, concern about counterparty risk spread ever further.
In the United States, it was initially thought that the disturbances in the
subprime sector would be contained, and that consumer spending and the
general economy would not be much affected. In the event, neither of these
assessments proved realistic. The housing sector suffered heavily under the
weight of sharply falling house prices and a massive build-up of unsold
homes. Moreover, as measured household wealth fell and job losses rose,
consumer spending receded and the economy threatened to slip into recession.
Again linked to the financial turmoil, evidence also began to mount around
the year-end that credit conditions were tightening, to the potential detriment
of both consumer and corporate spending. In other parts of the advanced
industrial world, partially but by no means entirely insulated from the financial
turmoil, growth remained rather more robust. Accordingly, the consensus
forecast for Europe and Japan in 2008 was revised down less than for the
United States. In parts of Europe, there was evidence that relatively weak
consumer spending was holding back aggregate demand. Nevertheless,
exports from both Europe and Japan remained strong, driven in both cases by
demand from emerging market countries. China and other Asian countries
were of notable importance, but so too were a large number of countries in
Latin America, the Middle East and elsewhere which were benefiting from
higher commodity prices and improved terms of trade.
These developments, together with the continued rapid growth of the
emerging market economies, led to an increased focus on the sustainability of
domestic demand in the emerging world. Towards the end of 2007 it was
being suggested not only that these economies might “decouple” from the
United States, but also that their increasingly strong fundamentals (and lack
of exposure to the subprime market) had actually transformed them into a
“safe haven” from the financial turmoil seen elsewhere. This optimism initially
led to large-scale capital inflows and support for asset prices in many emerging
market economies, even as asset prices elsewhere fell sharply.
As concerns mounted about the possible scale of the US downturn,
however, the mood began to change. Indeed, upon closer scrutiny, doubts
about the longer-term health of the emerging markets began to surface. In
China, the extraordinarily rapid pace of fixed capital investment, much of it
recently in heavy industry, fuelled worries about misallocations as well as the
broader effects on both global commodity prices and the environment. In the
Middle East, fears intensified that different countries might be pursuing similar
strategic development plans that would eventually result in problems of excess
supply. And in central and eastern Europe, large and rising current account
deficits in many countries seemed increasingly unsustainable. Reflecting
concerns of this nature, and financial developments elsewhere, capital inflows

6

BIS 78th Annual Report

have recently moderated, and by mid-May 2008 stock prices had fallen from
previous highs in a number of important countries.
Rising inflation is another factor which has dampened optimism about
sustained growth, not only in the emerging market countries, but in the
advanced industrial countries as well. Higher food and energy prices have
been at the heart of this development, but it is clear that inflationary pressures
are now being seen across a broader front. While difficult to measure, it seems
that the “gap” between global supply and demand had been very much reduced
by the end of 2007. Indeed, the prices paid by a number of advanced
industrial economies for imports from China, which had fallen for over a
decade, have recently been rising significantly, and there are good grounds
for believing this will continue. For countries whose currencies have recently
depreciated, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, underlying
inflationary pressures are highly likely to be exacerbated.
This combination of rising inflation pressures and financial disturbances
slowing demand growth is open to a spectrum of interpretations. On the one
hand, if slower growth were thought just sufficient to hold global inflation in
check, albeit with a lag, this could be viewed positively. On the other hand, the
eventual global slowdown could prove to be much greater and longer-lasting
than would be required to keep inflation under control. Over time, this could
potentially even lead to deflation, which would evidently be less welcome.
Unfortunately, when one considers the possible interactions between a
weakening real economy, high household debt levels and a severely
stressed financial system, such an outcome, even if unlikely, cannot be ruled
out entirely.

What has been happening: an explanation
Many academics have theorised about the underlying causes of the recurrent
periods of stress which have scarred the financial landscape for centuries.
Hyman Minsky’s work in the 1970s seems of particular relevance to current
circumstances. He warned that a continuous worsening of credit standards
over the years would eventually culminate in a moment of recognition and
recoil (what others have since dubbed “a Minsky moment”), when market
liquidity would dry up. For Minsky, however, the liquidity crisis was only a
symptom of the underlying credit problem, reflecting the reality that market
liquidity is always crucially dependent on the continued availability of funding
liquidity. Irving Fisher painted a similar picture of deteriorating credit standards
in his famous research into the origins of the Great Depression. Finally, a
number of other prewar theorists warned about the danger of poorly assessed
credits leading to asset bubbles, deviations in spending patterns from
sustainable trends and an inevitable economic downturn.
Consistent with such concerns, a number of unusual economic and
financial trends have indeed been very much in evidence in recent years. The
first has been very rapid rates of growth of money and credit, amidst evidence
for an underpricing of risk more generally. Such high rates of credit and
monetary growth at the global level in recent years reflect the interaction of

BIS 78th Annual Report

7

monetary policy, the choice of exchange rate regime in a number of countries
and important changes within the financial system itself.
It is perhaps best to begin by noting that policy interest rates in the
advanced industrial countries have latterly been unusually low by postwar
standards, due to the absence of any strong inflationary pressures. This
outcome reflected the building-up of central bank credibility over many years,
but was also facilitated by a combination of positive supply side shocks, largely
related to globalisation, and weak investment demand in a number of countries
(including Germany and Japan) in the aftermath of earlier periods of
excessively rapid expansion.
This policy stance might have been expected to cause a general
depreciation of the currencies of the advanced industrial countries, particularly
the US dollar, relative to emerging market currencies. However, in many
emerging economies, upward pressure on the currency was met over an
extended period by an equivalent easing of monetary policy and massive
foreign exchange intervention. The former is likely to have contributed to
higher asset prices and increased spending in the emerging markets. The
latter, via the investment of official foreign exchange reserves, is likely to have
further eased financial conditions in the advanced industrial countries. In this
way, the monetary stimulus to credit growth became increasingly global.
This is not to deny that changes in the financial system over the years
have also contributed in an important way to unfolding events. In particular, the
various innovations associated with the extension of the originate-to-distribute
model have had a major impact. Recent innovations such as structured finance
products were originally thought likely to produce a welcome spreading of
risk-bearing. Instead, the way in which they were introduced materially
reduced the quality of credit assessments in many markets and also led to a
marked increase in opacity. The result was the eventual generation of enormous
uncertainty about both the size of losses and their distribution. In effect,
through innovative repackaging and redistribution, risks were transformed
into higher-cost but, for a while at least, lower-probability events. In practice,
this meant that the risks inherent in new loans seemed effectively to disappear,
buoying ratings as well, until they suddenly reappeared in response to the
trigger of some realised loss that was wholly unexpected.
It is also a fact that, prior to the recent turbulence, the prices of many
financial assets were unusually high for an extended period. The rate of
interest on long-term US Treasuries (the inverse of the price) was so low for so
long as to be dubbed a “conundrum” by the previous Chairman of the Federal
Reserve. Moreover, the risk spreads on other sovereign debt, high-yield
corporate bonds and other risky assets also fell to record low levels. Equity
prices in the advanced industrial countries continued to be well (if not clearly
over-) valued, and those in many emerging markets rose spectacularly.
Residential property prices hit record highs in virtually all countries with the
exception of Germany, Japan and Switzerland, where property markets were
still recovering from the excesses of the 1980s and early 1990s. Even the
prices of fine wines, antiques and postage stamps soared. Similarly, the cost of
insurance against market price movements (approximated by implied volatility)

8

BIS 78th Annual Report

was sustained at unusually low levels for many years. Admittedly, arguments
about fundamentals can be adduced to support independently each of the
above trends. However, in the spirit of Occam’s razor, it is particularly notable
that all of these patterns are also consistent with credit being freely available
and having a low price.
Finally, it is also a fact that spending patterns in a number of countries
have deviated markedly from what had been longer-term trends. In the United
States and a number of other major economies, household saving rates
trended downwards to record low levels and were often associated with
mounting current account deficits. By contrast, in China there has, equally
unusually, been a massive increase in fixed investment. As with high asset
prices, these patterns are consistent with a plentiful supply of cheap credit.
Taken together, the above facts suggest that the difficulties in the
subprime market were a trigger for, rather than a cause of, all the disruptive
events that have followed. Moreover, these facts also suggest that the
magnitude of the problems yet to be faced could be much greater than many
now perceive. Finally, the dominant role played by rapid monetary and credit
expansion in this explanation of events is also consistent with the recent rise
of global inflation and, potentially, higher inflation expectations.
Given such a complex environment, it will obviously be difficult for
policymakers to maintain price stability, significant real growth and financial
stability all at the same time. Equally obviously, different policymakers might
reasonably arrive at different conclusions as to what needs to be done using
policy instruments. In turn, this might have implications for exchange rate
movements as well, posing a further complication for policymakers.

What has been happening: the policy response to date
Almost from the first day of the turmoil, central banks overseeing the major
financial centres responded to the seizing-up of money markets with more
frequent and sometimes larger than normal money market operations. While
different operating systems across countries occasionally made their efforts
look dissimilar, they all shared the same primary objective of ensuring that
overnight rates stayed effectively at levels consistent with policy goals. As
time passed, a number of central banks augmented their standard procedures,
being prepared in particular to accept a wider range of collateral from a wider
set of institutions, to engage in operations at longer maturities, and to
coordinate their efforts internationally. The Federal Reserve felt the need to be
especially flexible. It successfully introduced a new facility to auction discount
window credit, to address the stigma associated with the traditional use of the
discount window. Moreover, after the assisted takeover of Bear Stearns, the
Fed agreed to extend loans to primary dealers as part of its normal operations,
although these firms are not commercial banks and, indeed, are not even
supervised by the Federal Reserve System.
At the beginning of the turmoil, many thought that such liquidity injections
would suffice to deal with what was perceived as largely a liquidity crisis.
However, as time progressed and evidence accumulated of weakening

BIS 78th Annual Report

9

economic activity and growing counterparty risk, it became clearer that such
measures, though necessary, might well be insufficient. They would buy
welcome time, but would need to be supplemented with other policies, both
cyclical and structural.
Given its flexibility, it is not surprising that attention first turned to
monetary policy, which almost everywhere has been easier than was expected
six months ago. That said, the complexity of the circumstances has led to a
wide variety of responses.
In a number of countries, in particular Australia, Norway and Sweden,
policy rates have been increased. Evidently, it was judged that, in some
combination, the remoteness of the domestic financial sector from the crisis,
the level of observed inflation and inflationary pressures warranted such
tightening. In a number of other jurisdictions, in particular the euro area, policy
rates have been left unchanged in spite of earlier indications that they might
be raised. Here, the judgment seems to have been that high measured inflation,
strong economic momentum and concerns about upward pressures on wages
effectively counterbalanced the prospective threats to growth and disinflation
arising from any potential unwinding of previous excesses. Finally, in some
countries policy rates have been reduced, in the case of the United States
dramatically so. There, the threat of recession was seen to be most evident
and it was believed that, in the interim, inflation expectations were not likely
to move up to a persistently higher level.
The potential for fiscal policy to be used to maintain global growth was
also widely discussed. However, those few countries whose previous
disciplined behaviour had increased their room for manoeuvre were also
those whose economies were showing the most momentum. As a result, the
only countries that did act speedily were the United States and Spain. All the
same, some other measures that could ultimately affect taxpayers were also
implemented. Most prominently, some US government-supported agencies
have been attempting to support prices by buying large volumes of mortgagebacked securities, and by extending guarantees against other such
instruments. In Germany, direct state support was provided for a number of
institutions caught up in the US subprime crisis. In the United Kingdom, the
eventual need to nationalise the country’s fifth largest bank, Northern Rock,
clearly spread the government’s potential liabilities even wider.
The turmoil has also elicited a strong regulatory response. Regulators in
a number of countries encouraged their banks to seek private sector
recapitalisation. Increased transparency about valuation methodologies and
associated disclosure of losses were also recommended in a number of
analytical studies, from both the public and private sectors. And, finally,
numerous recommendations were made as to how lending criteria and the
use of structured products might be improved in the future. Implementation
will, however, face many difficulties, not least the need to avoid exacerbating
near-term market tensions in the pursuit of laudable medium-term objectives.

II. The global economy

Highlights
The turmoil in several major financial centres, triggered by a growing
awareness of the exposure of major banks to poor-quality mortgages in the
United States, has shaken consumer and investor confidence worldwide. As
the US economy slowed and financing conditions tightened, demand in a
number of other advanced industrial economies weakened (Graph II.1). At the
same time, however, global inflation has risen, led by rapid increases in prices
of energy and key food items.
Despite the turmoil, the consensus view is still that the global economy will
avoid a sharp and synchronised downturn of the kind seen in 2001, although
it will slow significantly in 2008. The baseline consensus scenario is that a US
downturn will be accompanied by weaker growth in the euro area and Japan;
growth in major emerging markets, while also slowing, will remain strong.
Not only would such a scenario provide some welcome relief from inflation
pressures, but the pattern of demand projected would imply a further decline
in the US current account deficit.
Unfolding developments at the core of the global financial system have,
however, also created great uncertainty about future economic prospects. In
particular, the ultimate size of losses facing major banks still remains difficult
to gauge. How the financial industry and its regulators respond will have
far-reaching implications for the global economy. A generalised squeeze in
the availability of credit in major advanced industrial economies remains a
distinct possibility, with potentially more severe implications for demand than
are reflected in the current consensus forecasts. In addition, the US downturn

could prove to be deeper and more protracted, given the high indebtedness of
the household sector. How emerging markets would be affected also remains
unclear: indeed, the abrupt weakening of equity prices in emerging markets in
early 2008 suggests that a shift in sentiment might already have occurred. If
inflation expectations remain well anchored, despite large oil and food price
shocks, easier monetary conditions could help. Even so, questions remain
about the effectiveness of easier monetary policy if, at the same time, banks
were to ration credit and economic agents were to curb spending in an attempt
to repair balance sheets.

Overview of developments
Last year was marked by two distinct phases of development in the global
economy. During the first half of the year, demand in the major advanced
industrial economies was sustained by easy financing conditions, steady income
growth and robust business confidence. Most economies enjoyed strong growth
during this period. In the United States, residential investment fell but other
components of demand, notably private consumption and business investment,
held up. The dynamics changed in the second half of 2007 as the US housing
and labour markets deteriorated sharply and the financial crisis deepened.

While global output still grew at a healthy pace of 41/2 % in 2007, output
growth in the G3 economies decelerated from close to 3% in 2006 to less than
21/2 % in 2007. The slowdown also spread to several other advanced industrial
economies. As a result, import volumes of the advanced industrial economies,
which had been growing at 6 –9% since 2004, slowed to a rate of just above 3%
in 2007. Yet the impact of this on emerging market economies has so far been
limited. Strong domestic demand in Brazil, China and India, among others,
raised aggregate output growth in emerging market economies to over 71/2 %
in 2007 (see Chapter III).
This pattern of growth was associated with several key changes in the
global economy. First, the contribution of emerging economies to global growth
rose in 2007, continuing the trend seen in the past few years (Table II.1).
Second, the downturn in residential investment in advanced industrial
economies contributed to a slowdown in global investment demand, even
though capital spending in emerging economies strengthened. In contrast,
global consumption growth remained fairly steady, supported by robust
household spending in both advanced industrial and emerging economies.
Third, these changes in growth and demand patterns led to a welcome reduction
in global current account imbalances. The US current account deficit fell from
$811 billion in 2006 to an annual rate of $692 billion by the fourth quarter of
2007, or from 6.2% to 4.9% of GDP. The main counterparts of this adjustment
were an increase in deficits in Australia, the United Kingdom and central and
eastern Europe as well as somewhat smaller surpluses in Russia and Latin
America. In contrast, the aggregate surplus of Asian economies rose sharply,
with China’s surplus, in particular, reaching a record high of $372 billion in 2007.
Several negative shocks have further weakened the global economy in 2008.
First, the downturn in the US housing sector has intensified, with sharply falling
house prices. By early 2008, the US economy appeared to be heading towards
very slow growth. Second, the turmoil in mortgage and related markets has led
to a marked increase in risk aversion more generally. Despite central banks’
concerted efforts to stabilise interbank markets, credit and interest rate spreads
have risen since July 2007. With banks in several advanced industrial economies
tightening lending standards, concerns about a credit crunch have become
commonplace. Third, there has been a further sharp rise in commodity prices.
Over the year to April 2008, the aggregate price index for major food products
increased by 30%, and oil prices (Brent) rose by more than 60%. The latest upsurge
in commodity prices follows several years of rising prices (see Chapter III).
Largely because of higher food and energy prices, headline inflation
has risen markedly in both advanced industrial and emerging economies
(Graph II.2). Even measures that exclude food and energy items from the
consumer price index have edged up in many countries. In addition, long-term
inflation expectations, using measures derived from bond prices, have moved
up in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in the euro area since the
second half of 2007. Survey-based consumer inflation expectations have also
risen in several countries. In part, this may be because sharp increases in the
prices of frequently purchased items, such as food and petrol, have raised
perceptions of past inflation and inflation expectations in turn.

Global demand developments
The cyclical downturn in major advanced industrial economies
The continued decline in the housing market (Graph II.3) has weighed heavily
on US growth since the second half of 2006. One major feature that
distinguishes the recent housing sector difficulties from those of the past is
that the latest upswing in construction in the United States resulted in much
greater excess supply than before, as increases in new dwellings far exceeded
population growth. Since late 2006, over 21/2% of the owner-occupied housing
stock – double the average of the past five decades – has been vacant and for
sale. In the run-up to the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, for instance,
the vacancy rate had remained well below 2%. Even though housing starts
have fallen by about 60% since 2006, to reach levels last seen in the early
1990s trough, this supply overhang is likely to weigh on both construction and
house prices for some time to come.
In particular, speculative factors have played a more significant role in the
construction of single-family homes than in the past. Many of the new houses
seem to have been bought for resale or rent, ahead of the underlying demographic
demand for them. As a result, investment in single-family residential structures
rose to a record 31/2% of GDP in 2006 from 21/2% in the early 2000s.
The US housing downturn began to affect other sectors of the economy
in early 2007. Residential investment directly subtracted 1 percentage point
from GDP growth in 2007; in addition, declines in house and equity prices
hurt household wealth (Graph II.3). Coupled with a broadly based decline
in employment and higher energy prices, these developments weakened
consumer spending. As a result, the contribution of personal consumption to
growth fell from 2 percentage points in 2007 to 0.7 percentage points in the
first quarter of 2008. Spending on durable goods, which is most sensitive to
changes in wealth and credit market conditions, contracted sharply (at an
annual rate of 6% in the first quarter of 2008).

Graph II.3

The current US downturn presents similarities as well as differences with
past cycles. In line with typical pre-recession behaviour, private consumption
grew steadily in the run-up to the recent cyclical peak, despite employment
growth being weaker than average (Graph II.4). With the household saving
ratio currently unusually low, and debt levels unusually high, consumption
might be expected to be much weaker in the current cycle than during previous
ones. Residential investment has already fallen more sharply this time than
during the run-up to previous downturns and, as noted above, could well fall
further.
A crucial factor will be the behaviour of US non-residential construction.
Having risen rapidly in previous quarters, investment in non-residential
structures slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2008. As discussed below,
the risk of further weakening remains large in the context of tighter credit
conditions and negative feedback effects from the residential sector. During
the early 1990s recession, the share of construction (both residential and
non-residential) in GDP fell from a high of 11% in 1985 to just over 8% in 1992.
In the current cycle, the construction share reached a similar high in 2006, but
so far has fallen by a little more than 11/2 percentage points.
Among other components of demand, business equipment spending has
contracted, although the extent of future correction remains uncertain. The
manufacturing sectors most exposed to construction are likely to see large
cuts in investment, and a further weakening of consumption could aggravate
this adjustment by dampening demand and profit expectations. Yet, in
contrast to the 2001 downturn, the absence of earlier overinvestment
should ensure a smoother downward adjustment in equipment spending this
time. Moreover, a brighter spot for the US economy has been strong net
exports, whose contribution to GDP growth reversed from negative to positive
in 2007 (1/2 percentage point). This could prove important in raising investment
in the tradables sector, which had suffered during the period of dollar
appreciation.

Graph II.4

Of the other major advanced industrial economies, the United Kingdom
shared some features with the United States. The UK economy appeared to
have slowed towards the end of 2007, as consumption was dampened by
tighter credit conditions and weakening confidence. Falling property prices
also raised the spectre of a downturn in the construction sector. Similarly, in
Canada, although aggregate demand continued to exceed domestic productive
potential until last year, the economy began to weaken as exports fell. In
addition, tighter credit conditions started to affect demand.
Developments in the euro area and Japan have been mixed. Despite
some deceleration, growth in the euro area proved strong up to the first
quarter of 2008. In particular, investment grew at a solid pace in 2007.
Although Ifo business confidence indicators fell in April 2008, they still
remained above the average for the past five years. However, private
consumption decelerated significantly towards the end of 2007 as confidence
slid. Moreover, exports have slowed in recent months. The Japanese
economy also continued to expand up to the first quarter of 2008, thanks
largely to strong exports. Consumption remained relatively robust, with
employment rising into early 2008. But a rapid contraction in residential
investment from the second half of 2007, led by changes in construction
regulation, reduced the tempo of domestic demand. In addition, business
sentiment indicators have deteriorated in recent months, and profit expectations
have fallen.

International linkages and economic prospects
While in past cycles a US slowdown was often associated with slower growth
elsewhere, there are grounds for believing that such effects might remain
more muted in the current cycle. Indeed, there have been some developments
consistent with this view over the past few years. While the annual growth rate
of domestic demand in the United States fell from 4.1% in 2004 to 1.5% in
2007, it declined from 2% to 1% in Japan and even strengthened slightly in the
euro area, from 1.7% to 2.2%. Moreover, in even sharper contrast to the United
States, domestic demand in the large emerging economies (particularly Brazil,

Russia, India and China) continued to grow rapidly throughout the period
(Graph II.5).
Diverging demand patterns have led some observers to believe that the
rest of the world could offset some of the negative demand shocks originating
in the United States. One argument in support of this hypothesis notes that the
imbalances in the rest of the world are arguably less severe than in the United
States. This contrasts with the early 2001 slowdown, which was caused by the
bursting of a global IT investment boom. The fact that the share of exports
destined for the United States has declined significantly in a large number of
economies has been cited as a further reason why the US slowdown may have
a limited impact on the global economy.
Leaving aside the United States, the prospects for domestic demand in
other major economies seem favourable on balance, but also show significant
variability. In the euro area, domestic demand has been sustained by a
broadly based rebound in business investment. In addition, the recent fall in
the euro area unemployment rate could help to support consumption. At 7.1%
in the first quarter of 2008, the unemployment rate reached its lowest level
since the early 1980s. This is particularly evident in Germany, where structural
reforms have led to increased labour flexibility and a higher participation rate.
Real wages have also started to pick up in Germany, although they remain
depressed and are still increasing more slowly than the rate of growth in
labour productivity.
Domestic demand cycles have already diverged within the euro area,
partly reflecting different housing market dynamics. Nominal house prices in
the euro area as a whole have risen more gradually over the past decade than,
for instance, in the United States and the United Kingdom (Graph II.6). This
has, to some extent, reflected the trend in Germany, where house prices either
remained stable or declined moderately during 2000–07. In France, Ireland

and Spain, however, they rose strongly in the early 2000s before starting to
decelerate in 2004–06. Growth in dwellings has also outpaced population
growth in some countries, particularly Spain, although not to the extent seen
in North America. During the upswing, value added in construction reached
11% and 9% of GDP in Spain and Ireland, respectively, much higher than the
euro area average of 6%. Higher house prices also appear to have supported
consumption, particularly in France and Spain. With the house price cycle
turning and credit conditions tightening, demand is likely to weaken more in
these countries than elsewhere in the euro area.
Domestic demand in Japan has been sustained by very easy financing
conditions, which have led to a large gap between the rate of return on
investment by large manufacturing firms and their borrowing costs. In contrast,
smaller firms, which traditionally have narrower profit margins and low pricing
power, have proved more vulnerable to cost pressures. Moreover, consumption
has so far been driven by employment. Although nominal wages rose in early
2008, following several quarters of negative growth, real wages remained weak.
Several structural factors may continue to limit future wage growth. These
include the retirement of baby boomers and their replacement by lower-paid
employees, and a striking increase in the share of part-time work since the early
2000s. Consumption therefore remains vulnerable to a squeeze of household
income from weak real wages, particularly in the context of higher energy prices.
As discussed in Chapter III, domestic demand in emerging market
economies seems to have become more robust than in past cycles, due to
improved macroeconomic fundamentals and stronger balance sheets. The
steady increase in capital inflows to many emerging market economies has
also boosted prospects for investment. But higher food and oil prices have hurt
consumer sentiment in recent months, particularly in commodity-importing
countries in Asia.

Yet the United
States is still a
major trading
partner

Several common
shocks could also
weaken global
demand

There are also reasons for thinking that the full global impact of the US
slowdown might be still to come. The United States remains a major trading
partner for several countries, including Canada, China, Japan and Mexico.
Imports in the US high-tech sector have remained strong, limiting the adverse
impact on Asian intraregional trade, but the situation could change if the US
downturn deepens. A prolonged US slowdown could undermine consumer
and business confidence worldwide: the sharp decline in stock markets
around the world in January 2008 underlined such a risk. In addition, many
firms in China and Japan are dependent on exports to the United States to
sustain investment and employment, implying that capital spending might not
be as autonomous in these countries as is often assumed. Similarly, exports
remain a major source of demand in Germany. This exposes the euro area to
a potential slowdown in other economies, including the United States, not only
through direct effects on the German economy but also through indirect effects
on intraregional trade and investment.
Global demand is also likely to be depressed by several other shocks that
have coincided with the US slowdown. First, the negative demand shock
could be compounded by a generalised squeeze in credit supply in advanced
industrial economies; this issue is examined below. Second, substantial
increases in commodity prices, especially oil, over the past several months
have led to large terms-of-trade losses for oil-importing countries. Analysis by
the International Energy Agency following the early 2000s oil price hike
suggested that a $10 per barrel increase in average oil import prices in OECD
countries could reduce growth by 0.4 percentage points and raise inflation
by 0.5 percentage points within one year. In fact, average oil import costs in
major OECD countries have already increased by $35 per barrel over the year
to January 2008.
The actual impact on growth has been limited so far partly because firms
have been reluctant, or unable, to pass on the full extent of the increase in oil
prices to consumers. In addition, rising wealth from increased house and equity
prices as well as the easy availability of bank credit up to mid-2007 sustained
consumption. However, a substantial deterioration in employment and wealth
prospects could reinforce the effect of higher oil and food prices on household
spending, particularly in countries where consumption has relied significantly
on debt accumulation.

Policies and other factors affecting future demand
Prompt central
bank actions and
lower policy rates
could stimulate
demand …

Policies to counter global demand weaknesses could help, provided that
inflationary pressures remain well contained. Massive liquidity operations by
major central banks might have limited the potential impact of the recent
financial turmoil on banks’ funding costs. In addition, the stance of monetary
policy has been eased in several advanced industrial economies since August
last year. Yet the impact of these measures on demand depends crucially on
several factors. One is the assessment of credit risks. In the United States, for
instance, where monetary easing has gone the furthest, less risky household
lending rates have fallen, but rates on riskier jumbo mortgages and subinvestment grade bonds have risen because of higher risk premia. A second

BIS 78th Annual Report

19

factor is that banks might cut credit supply through non-price mechanisms,
reducing the impact of lower policy rates. A third factor is the large overhang
of household debt that could lead households to save rather than spend
(discussed below). Aside from the aggregate demand impact of lower policy
rates, a key risk is that the future flexibility of monetary policy could be
constrained by the recent rise in inflation and inflation expectations.
An easier fiscal policy could also support demand in some countries.
Automatic stabilisers will help to cushion demand, especially in the euro area
(Graph II.7), in the case of a slowdown. Moreover, the structural budget deficit
in the euro area has been declining over the past few years, in accordance with
the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Reflecting this additional
room for manoeuvre, budget plans for 2008 envisage a slight increase in the
structural deficit to 0.9% of GDP. In Japan, the structural deficit is expected to
decline in 2008. In the United States, the budgetary position, on balance, has
remained supportive of demand in the short run. The recent fiscal stimulus,
involving personal and corporate tax rebates to the tune of 1% of 2007 GDP,
is expected to temporarily boost demand this year.
One major question is whether there is scope for using discretionary fiscal
policy to stimulate demand still further. In the United States, the debt/GDP ratio
is already around 60%, and would be much higher if unfunded liabilities from
long-term health care and pension costs were taken into account. In the euro
area, low deficits or continued surpluses in Austria, Germany and Spain, as
well as the projected fall in debt ratios, could imply greater scope for the
authorities in these countries to use fiscal policy to sustain demand. But in
Greece and Italy, public debt ratios were around 100% at the end of 2007 and
are projected to remain high in the future. In almost all euro area countries,
unfunded liabilities due to future health care and pension expenditures remain
large in the context of rapidly ageing populations. In Japan, gross public debt
already exceeds 180% of GDP, and implicit public sector liabilities are also
large. While the overall tax rate is low and could eventually be raised, the
reality of an already declining population is a further complication.

economies

Another question relates to the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Fiscal
multipliers appear to have become weaker in advanced industrial countries
over the past decades, with the increased openness of their economies as well
as financial liberalisation reducing the number of liquidity-constrained
individuals. Even so, adequately targeted stimulus programmes could still prove
useful, especially if they reduced spending constraints for those who have lost
their access to credit. A temporary stimulus would also limit future deficits and
consequently the impact of any perceived rise in future tax burdens. Recent
estimates in the case of the United States suggest that the marginal propensity
to consume out of temporary tax rebates could be significant (about 0.4), and
the impact could materialise rapidly. However, the phase-out of the effects of
such rebates would be likely to drag down growth in later periods.
One factor with implications for the distribution of global demand has
been the changing pattern of exchange rates. The real effective value of the
US dollar had, by April 2008, fallen 25% from its February 2002 peak. Even
when compared to the long-run average over 1980–2007, the depreciation of
the dollar has been substantial (Graph II.8). A weaker dollar will continue to
support US growth, by raising both exports and demand for goods produced
by domestic import-competing sectors. In addition, a weaker dollar enhances
the domestic currency value of US earnings on foreign assets, reinforcing
the positive trade impact. At the same time, however, an abrupt fall in
the dollar could lead to higher inflation expectations, and make it harder to
control inflation.
By contrast, the effective value of the euro has appreciated sharply over
the past two years. This has reduced the effect of higher dollar oil prices, but it
also dampens the demand for euro area tradables. Exports from the euro area
have nonetheless continued to grow around the long-run rate, thanks to strong
demand in emerging markets. Improved productivity growth in the German
manufacturing sector has offset some of the negative competitiveness effects
of a stronger currency. In other euro area countries (eg Italy and Spain),

value of the yen has depreciated substantially over the past few years, helping
to stimulate exports from Japan.

Inflation developments in advanced industrial economies
Rising inflation risks
A sharp rise in commodity prices since early 2007 has led to a major increase
in headline inflation in advanced industrial economies. The year-on-year CPI
inflation rate in April 2008 was around 4% in the United States and above 3%
in the euro area; and in Japan it finally exceeded 1% by March (Graph II.9). In
the United States, domestic energy prices increased by over 15% in the year
to April 2008 while food and beverage price inflation reached an almost twodecade high of about 5%. In the euro area, energy price inflation exceeded
101/2%, and food prices rose by 6%. Energy prices accounted for about one
third of headline inflation in the United States and the euro area. In addition,
core inflation (based on national definitions), which had been relatively subdued
until 2006, picked up in the euro area and Japan. In the United States, the core
CPI inflation rate remained relatively stable up to April 2008.
A key issue is whether food and oil prices will remain high. If the expansion
in long-run demand continues to outpace the supply of key commodities, a
sustained increase in food and energy prices remains a distinct possibility.
Consumer food price inflation in many advanced industrial economies is likely
to remain high for some time as higher producer prices feed through to the retail
level and as cost pressures squeeze firms’ margins beyond sustainable levels.
In the past, headline inflation tended to follow core inflation, largely
because food and oil price volatility reflected short-lived supply disturbances.
This encouraged central banks to focus their attention on core inflation as a
measure of underlying price pressure. But the prolonged rise in commodity

prices in recent years has weakened this relationship (Table II.2). In the euro
area, for instance, headline inflation has been a much better predictor of oneyear-ahead inflation than core inflation during the past three years. In the United
States, headline inflation has also yielded somewhat better inflation forecasts
than core inflation since mid-2003, when the prices of energy began to trend
upwards. Japan’s experience has been somewhat different: the nationally
defined core inflation measure is still a better predictor of future headline
inflation, although this could be largely because the former includes oil prices.

Factors driving core inflation
Economic slack in
major advanced
industrial
economies is
expected to rise …

… and unit labour
costs are unlikely
to pose a major
threat …

In view of the underlying forces at this juncture, does it seem more likely that
core inflation will rise towards headline inflation, or the reverse? Output in
many advanced industrial economies appears to have remained around
potential, and may even fall below that in the future (Graph II.10). Measures
of the unemployment gap suggest rising economic slack in the United States.
In other advanced industrial economies, although unemployment rates are
still low, softer demand conditions could reduce employment in the future.
On balance, demand pressures on core inflation should therefore continue to
be muted.
Likewise, recent developments in unit labour costs in the G3 economies
have been benign. In the United States, the year-on-year growth rate in unit
labour costs fell back to 0.2% in the first quarter of 2008, a break from the
upward trend which had taken it above 4% in the first half of 2007. In the euro
area, although the growth in unit labour costs has been subdued and stable
at close to 11/2% in recent years, it rose to about 2% in the fourth quarter of
2007. In Japan, unit labour costs have fallen in the past several years, partly
reflecting falling or only slowly growing nominal wages.
Future movements in unit labour costs will depend significantly on the
behaviour of wages. Several advanced industrial economies have experienced
a reduction in the share of wages in total value added since the 1980s, with a
corresponding rise in the share of profits. However, there has recently been
demand for higher wages, especially in Europe. In Germany, for instance,

following a long period of weak or falling real wages, unions have demanded
larger wage increases this year. A one-time adjustment in wages, after a period
of significant productivity growth, need not prove to be inflationary, being
potentially offset by a fall in profit margins to earlier levels. But a sustained
rise in wages could create significant inflation risks by encouraging firms to
revise their prices upwards.
Another question regarding the evolution of inflation is how far downward
inflation pressures from globalisation might be decreasing or even reversing.
One factor has been the recent sustained demand for commodities, led by
strong growth in emerging market economies. At the global level, this seems
to be heightening resource constraints, raising prices of key raw materials and
food articles.
A second factor is that real wages have been rising rapidly in some
countries with low-cost production structures such as China, partly reflecting
a shortage of skilled labour and increased minimum wages (see Chapter III).
This has tended to push up the prices of manufactured goods imported from
emerging economies. These recent developments suggest that the “catchingup” of emerging market economies is likely to involve sustained upward
pressures on import prices. A country-specific factor that may have
exacerbated some of these price effects, especially in the United States and
the United Kingdom, is the substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate
in recent months.
There is as yet no solid evidence to indicate that the substantial decline in
the pass-through of changes in commodity prices and exchange rates to import
and consumer prices observed during the 1990s and early 2000s has reversed
in more recent years (Table II.3; see also Table II.2 in the 75th Annual Report).
The degree of pass-through continues to be lower than that seen during the
1970s and 1980s. This is partly because foreign exporters have been able to
keep prices unchanged in importers’ local currencies, either by adjusting their
profit margins and those of local distributors, or by finding ways to increase

productivity commensurately. It would also seem to imply that long-term
inflation expectations have remained anchored.
Nevertheless, the degree of pass-through could increase. Outside the
United States, margins built up by exporters during the period of dollar
appreciation have now been run down significantly, and productivity gains
could prove increasingly difficult to obtain. Moreover, large and persistent rises
in commodity prices or exchange rate depreciation might eventually cause
inflation expectations to shift upwards. This could trigger larger adjustments
in core consumer prices going forward.
Inflation expectations in this context are likely to play a major role.
Following a decline over much of 2006, long-term market-based measures of
inflation expectations (starting five years hence) moved up in major advanced
industrial economies in 2007 (Graph II.11), though they fell back somewhat in
early 2008. The increase was particularly marked in the United States, where
higher inflation levels have also been associated with increased dispersion of
inflation expectations among professional forecasters. Yet the extent to which
bond prices provide an accurate picture of inflation expectations in current
circumstances remains unclear. For instance, sizeable liquidity effects seen in
government bond markets during the recent episodes of market stress might
have played a role in the volatility of measured inflation expectations. A rise
in inflation risk premia (rather than expectations of future inflation) may have
been an additional contributing factor, although this appears more probable
for the euro area than for the United States (see Chapter VI). The possibility
that inflation expectations have begun to move up is also supported by other
evidence. Although short-term inflation expectations, as measured by household
surveys, have generally remained below 1980s levels, they have trended up
over the past year in the major advanced industrial economies.
An important question for monetary policy is how well anchored inflation
expectations are likely to be in the face of adverse shocks to inflation. On the

one hand, it could be that inflation expectations are forward-looking and
have become better anchored over the past decade due to greater monetary
policy credibility. On the other hand, it could be that expectations are
primarily backward-looking, for example, based on learning by private agents.
In this case, expectations could have been contained by the earlier favourable
trend in inflation, not least as an increase in the effective labour supply
globally held down the prices of manufactured goods. The simple fact that
long-term inflation expectations have apparently remained well anchored over
the past few years does not provide a decisive indication of whether, and how
strongly, these expectations might be reversed, nor what could trigger such
a reversal.
To the extent that inflation expectations are backward-looking, the
recent trend increase in food and energy prices could well have particularly
adverse consequences for inflation expectations. There is some anecdotal
evidence that large price changes in a few “visible” items purchased more
widely and frequently (eg bread, meat, milk and petrol) are more likely to lift
public perceptions of inflation than price changes in items bought more
intermittently. In the euro area, surveys indicate that “perceived” inflation
increased in late 2007, coinciding with a rise in food prices. In the United
Kingdom, there is also evidence that consumers’ inflation perceptions tend
to be more highly correlated with the inflation rates for items bought at
least quarterly.

Balance sheet vulnerabilities, credit tightening and headwinds

firms and their associated spending decisions. The turmoil has already led to
a tightening of credit conditions through a rise in spreads on bank lending
(Graph II.12). Admittedly, in the case of the United States (and to a lesser
extent Canada and the United Kingdom), lower policy rates have, to various
degrees, offset wider credit spreads. Nevertheless, in all of these countries,
credit conditions have tightened as banks have raised non-price lending
standards for their borrowers. In the United States, the net proportion of
banks reporting tightening lending standards for most types of loans was as
high by the first quarter of 2008 as during the recessions of the early 1990s
and early 2000s. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have also seen
a tightening of credit standards in some or most sectors. In the euro area,
credit standards have been tightened sharply for business credit, nearing
the levels seen during the credit market downturn of the early 2000s, and
significantly for households.
The recent tightening of credit markets has taken place against the
backdrop of very large increases in debt, particularly of US households. If past
episodes of credit market crises are any guide, the macroeconomic impact of
this tightening is likely to be considerable. The 1989–92 US credit crunch was,
for instance, seen to have aggravated the recession in 1990. That credit crisis
occurred in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, a period
when banks greatly increased their exposure to the commercial real estate
sector. Following the pre-crisis peak, real bank credit to the US private sector
contracted for a lengthy period (Graph II.13). The credit downturn was milder
and the recovery was quicker in other countries, such as the United Kingdom,
that were experiencing difficulties in the banking sector around the same
period. There are other cases, however, such as the Nordic banking crises
of the early 1990s, where the cutback in credit was more severe. In Sweden,
for instance, the result was a sharp decline in household spending, and the

share of residential investment in GNP fell from a peak of 61/2 % in 1991 to
11/2 % in 1995.
In each of these crises, the ultimate impact was aggravated by the
interaction of an adverse economic cycle with large declines in asset prices,
and a sharp deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers. In particular, as
discussed in Chapter VII, the credit cycle was associated with a property price
cycle, which had a large impact on the value of collateral and aggregate
spending, both in the upswing and in the downswing. In the current credit
cycle, significant balance sheet exposures in several countries pose risks to
the macroeconomic outlook.

Vulnerability of households
The impact of a given change in credit standards might be expected to be
largest for the United States, where household financial problems are arguably
most severe. A rapid increase in household debt since 2002 had made it
possible for households to maintain consumption and residential investment
at higher levels than would have been feasible based on their income alone
(Table II.4). This increase in debt was enabled largely by strongly rising house
prices, which reduced collateral constraints for households that would
otherwise have been unable to borrow as much, or at all. Households in the
United States were also able to use proceeds from home sales, cash-out
refinancing and home equity loans to extract their rising home equity: some
private estimates suggest that home equity extraction financed on average
about 3% of personal consumption (including repayment of non-mortgage
debts) from 2001 to 2005.
One source of vulnerability is the combination of low savings and high
household debt. While the ratio of US household saving to disposable income
started declining from about 71/2% in 1992, it fell particularly sharply during
the early 2000s to almost zero by 2005. A significant rise in debt service
payments during this period, to over 14% of disposable income by 2007, made
households more exposed to income and interest rate shocks. Household

spending now seems likely to weaken, in response to high debt and debt service
burdens, falling employment and the general tightening of credit conditions.
A second source of vulnerability stems from large actual and expected
declines in housing prices and wealth, reducing households’ prospective net
worth and hence their capacity to borrow to sustain current spending. US
households’ equity in the overall housing stock – the difference between their
total housing assets and housing debt – has in fact already declined noticeably
of late. Indeed, some estimates indicate that the share of US households with
negative equity is already larger than the peak seen during the UK housing
downturn in the early 1990s.
A third source of vulnerability arises from the fact that subprime, statedincome and other risky non-standard mortgage products accounted for much
larger shares of US mortgage lending during the upswing than was the case in
other advanced industrial economies. As housing prices fall and credit conditions
tighten, such loans are more likely to default because the borrowers have few
alternative financial resources with which to cushion an income fall or to delay
foreclosure proceedings, leading to even tighter lending conditions and more
restraints on spending. In addition, very lax underwriting processes meant that
many borrowers were able to take on loans they could not afford even in the
short term, perhaps on the assumption that they could refinance as housing
prices rose. This might explain why delinquency rates in the United States on
this occasion started rising long before unemployment; in earlier episodes
in both the United States and the United Kingdom, delinquency and
unemployment rates moved more or less in tandem (Graph II.14).

Household indebtedness has also increased sharply in the United
Kingdom. But less of the debt accumulation has been used to finance
consumption, which has actually fallen as a percentage of GDP (Table II.4).
Housing equity relative to assets has stopped rising with slowing or
falling house prices. While current estimates suggest that very few
households have negative equity, much will depend on how far house prices
fall in the future. First-time home buyers, generally highly leveraged and with
a significantly higher debt service burden, could be more exposed than
others. Although mortgage lending standards did not become quite as relaxed
in the United Kingdom as in the United States, they still eased considerably,
with high initial loan-to-value ratios becoming more common until recently
(Graph II.6).
In the euro area, by contrast, the aggregate household balance sheet
position remains strong, thanks to a steady rise in measured wealth and only
a modest increase in debt. The absence of a generalised housing boom, a
relatively large concentration of household financial assets in fixed income
instruments and greater use of fixed rate mortgages appear to have
contained household financial vulnerability during the current market turmoil.
Moreover, at around 3%, the average interest payment burden on euro
area households remains significantly below that in other major advanced
industrial economies.
Even so, there has been considerable divergence within the euro area. In
several countries, household debt has risen well above the euro area average
of about 60% of GDP. Debt ratios stood at more than 120% of GDP in the
Netherlands and between 80 and 90% in Portugal and Spain at the end of
2006. Credit standards also appear to have been eased in several cases during
the housing market upswing, with the typical loan-to-value ratio in Spain, for
instance, exceeding that in Canada and the United Kingdom. Given the high
concentration of their wealth in housing assets, households in some countries

The impact of tighter credit standards on the business sector will depend on
how far firms rely on external financing rather than internally generated
resources. In fact, non-financial businesses across the major advanced industrial
economies have improved their balance sheet positions since the beginning
of the decade. Their ability to fund investment from internal resources remains
high. In the United States, retained earnings have in recent years been sufficient
to cover gross investment spending; in one sense, firms have only needed to
borrow to fund equity buybacks. Similarly, internal funds have broadly
covered gross investment in the United Kingdom. Whether this implies that
firms are well placed to cushion the impact of tightening credit conditions on
the economy will depend on how much profits weaken as the economy turns
down, whether firms can reduce dividend payments to sustain large internally
generated surpluses, and the nature of the external credit available.
One feature of the current episode of credit market tightening is that
leveraged loans, which had expanded sharply before the turmoil, dried up more
than on-balance sheet lending (see Chapter VII). Since leveraged loans were
primarily used to fund mergers and acquisitions, it should be expected that this
activity will be more affected than investment in physical capital. Nevertheless,
the previous boom in the leveraged loan market also boosted stock prices,
implying that firms are now less likely to have access to cheaper equity
financing as merger and acquisition activity slows.
Borrowing from intermediaries represents a relatively large share of the
funding for investment in the euro area across the whole non-financial
corporate sector. Investment is thus likely to be more sensitive to a contraction
in intermediated credit supply in these economies than in the United States.
Smaller firms would be affected most, because of their limited access to
alternative financing. How far large firms might be able to cushion the effects of
a contraction in credit supply through capital markets remains uncertain. Such
firms in the United States would be more constrained by disruptions in
corporate debt markets than in the euro area.
Within the business sector, tighter credit conditions are more likely to be
binding for commercial real estate firms than for others. Compared with other
kinds of commercial lending, leverage against collateral is generally higher for
this type of borrower, and lending conditions had eased much more than for
other firms. The tightening in credit conditions reported by US banks has
been particularly sharp in this sector, and growth in business mortgage debt
is already slowing.
In addition, the decline in land prices implied by falling house prices has
also affected the value of non-residential property in the United States (see
Chapter VII), and therefore collateral values in turn. The demand for
commercial building related to residential construction (eg shopping centres)
is likely to fall. Such dynamics are also likely to affect the commercial real
estate sector in other countries.

In sum, the current combination of sizeable shocks – the difficulties of
major banks, credit market tightening, asset price declines and the unexpected
strength of commodity prices – has created much uncertainty about the central
forecast of continued, albeit more moderate, global growth in 2008. The extent
to which households with overstretched balance sheets, in the United States
and some other advanced industrial economies, will have to retrench in the
face of such shocks is hard to predict. While a substantial rise in US household
saving could bring about a further sizeable reduction in the US current
account deficit, it would do so at the price of weakening demand in the rest of
the world. At the same time, inflation risks are greater than they have been for
many years. If inflation risks do not quickly subside as growth weakens, the
stance of monetary and fiscal policy will need to be reviewed.

III. Emerging market economies

Highlights
Uncertainties about the prospects for the emerging market economies (EMEs)
deepened during the period under review. Although growth in EMEs last year
once again significantly exceeded that in the rest of the world, the potential
knock-on effects of financial market turmoil in the major centres increased the
risk of a slowdown in EMEs. In line with this, equity prices in many emerging
markets, which rose strongly for much of 2007, weakened in the early part of
2008, suggesting lower growth expectations. At the same time, further steep
increases in oil and food prices added to inflationary pressures. As in the
advanced industrial economies, these conflicting forces have created a major
dilemma for monetary policy. A further complication is that many countries
are still resisting currency appreciation. Moreover, with the fall in US rates,
interest rate differentials over dollar rates have widened. This has attracted
additional capital inflows, making the task of monetary tightening in the face
of rising inflation more difficult.
Developments in the advanced industrial economies could also pose
major challenges. First, a pronounced slowdown in the United States would
hurt the EMEs, which, though remarkably resilient so far, still depend
significantly on external demand. Second, tighter conditions in global financial
markets could constrain EMEs with large current account deficits and those
relying on cross-border bank borrowing.

Macroeconomic developments
Robust growth …

… with downside
risks

Rising inflation in
breach of targets

Growth in the EMEs as a whole was 7.7% in 2007, above the already rapid
average pace of 7% recorded during 2003–06 (Table III.1). Current projections
envisage growth of around 6.7% in 2008, notwithstanding the sharp slowdown
in the industrial world foreseen in the consensus forecast.
Continuing the pattern of recent years, the key driver of economic growth
in all EME regions continues to be domestic demand, reflecting strong private
consumption and investment spending (Graph III.1). Net exports have also
made positive contributions to growth in China and other emerging Asia, but
negative contributions in Latin America. How far growth in the emerging
economies will be supported by robust domestic demand in the context of a US
slowdown is a key question that will be addressed later in the chapter. In brief,
risks to growth for EMEs are on the downside.
With growth strong, CPI inflation rose sharply in the course of the past
year in all major EME regions (Graph III.2). The pickup in inflation, which was
particularly apparent in the second half of 2007, was greatest in Asia (with

year-on-year inflation accelerating from less than 3% to over 6% between late
2006 and April 2008), followed by Latin America (from 4.1% to 5.7%). Recent
increases have brought inflation above formal or informal 2008 targets in 15
out of the 17 largest EMEs that announce such targets, and indeed well above
informal targets in China and India. In Korea and Mexico, inflation has recently
remained above the inflation target or hovered close to it. Large increases
in inflation have also been recorded in many other countries, including Chile,
the Czech Republic, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa and
Thailand. In Brazil, where inflation has been within the target range, sharp
rises in headline inflation (actual and forecast) raised concerns that the
midpoint of the target range would be exceeded at the end of 2008.
Inflation forecasts for 2008 rose during 2007 in Asia, Latin America and
other emerging markets (Graph III.2), ending an extended period in which
such forecasts had generally remained stable. These higher forecasts probably
reflect an interaction between rising wage inflation, expectations of further
increases in the prices of food and energy, and demand pressures.
Wage trends in EMEs are hard to assess because of the lack of
internationally comparable data. There are, however, signs of more rapid wage

been in double digits in China, averaging 14.4% in 2001–06 and rising to
17.7% in the third quarter of 2007. This reflects not only demand pressures
feeding into wage claims, but also structural changes, including rising minimum
wages and new labour legislation that has strengthened contractual rights for

workers. In India, some private sector surveys indicate double digit increases
in private sector salaries in recent years, and large adjustments to the salaries
of government employees have also been proposed.
The upward trend in headline inflation may well be expected to persist.
One reason is that increases in food and energy prices, which account for
much of the rise in headline inflation in many countries, show no consistent
signs of abating (see below). Another is that the underlying rate of inflation,
as measured by core inflation, has also accelerated (Graph III.3). Core inflation

– that is, excluding food and energy prices – rose in all EME regions starting
around the second half of 2007, with a median contribution to headline
inflation of 2.5 percentage points early in 2008, against a headline inflation
figure of 6.3%.
A number of indicators suggest that demand pressures have also played
an important role in EME inflation. While simple correlations need to be
interpreted with caution, inflation has tended to be higher in countries where
the level of real output has been above estimates of trend (Graph III.4, lefthand panel) or where GDP growth has been faster (not shown). Inflation has
also tended to be higher in countries with rapid credit growth and where the
exchange rate has appreciated by less (Graph III.4, centre and right-hand
panels). As discussed below, an easy monetary policy stance and large-scale
intervention in foreign exchange markets appear to have contributed to these
outcomes.

Commodity price developments
Rising commodity
prices …

… reflecting strong
global demand

Commodity prices have been on an upward trend since early this decade,
showing particularly strong increases in the past two years. Rebounding from
a temporary low in 2006, nominal US dollar oil prices rose 47% in 2007, and
by early May 2008 had risen by a further 29%. Prices of food commodities, such
as cereals and oilseeds (but also rice, which is not internationally traded in
large volumes), have risen sharply since mid-2006. The performance of metal
prices has been more mixed, but pronounced increases in copper and iron ore
prices have also been observed (Graph III.5).
The extended upswing in the prices of some major commodities in the
present decade reflects persistent demand growth that has not been fully
accommodated by increases in supply. On the demand side, relatively easy
global monetary conditions have supported robust global economic growth.
This effect has been reinforced by the US dollar depreciation in recent years,
which has contributed to higher commodity prices measured in dollars.

According to a recent IMF estimate, a 1% depreciation in nominal effective
terms leads to an oil price increase in US dollars of more than 1% after one
year. Another important driver of the demand for commodities has been the
very rapid industrialisation of countries outside the OECD area, notably China
and, more recently, India. On the supply side, a number of constraints,
including delays in the expansion of production capacity and higher production
costs, have also played a role.
Some of these effects may be illustrated by developments in oil and food
commodity markets. In the case of oil, global demand growth has averaged
about 1.6% per year in this decade, but China’s demand has grown at an annual
average rate of 6.7%. As a result, the share of China in global oil demand now
exceeds that of Japan and Korea combined and is approaching that of OECD
Pacific countries (Table III.2). The demand for oil in EMEs has been supported
by government subsidies, which shield the population from higher prices and
encourage the development of certain manufacturing sectors (eg automobiles).
In a number of EMEs, including China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, and
in Latin America and the Middle East, governments still subsidise energy
consumption at the retail level.
Even as demand has grown, supply constraints in some countries have
boosted oil prices, despite increases in OPEC supply. According to current
investment plans, Saudi Arabian production capacity is projected to increase
from 10.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2005 to 12.5 mb/d in 2009. By
contrast, non-OPEC oil supply has been held back by the high costs of
increasing capacity. For the four largest private sector oil companies outside
OPEC, the cost of developing new oil reserves rose by between 45 and 70%
over the period 2003–06. The costs of expanding production capacity for these
oil companies are much higher than in Saudi Arabia or the United States.
Overall spare capacity in the oil industry fell from around 5 mb/d in 2000 to a
low of 1 mb/d in 2005, before recovering to 2.2 mb/d in 2007. Research
indicates that low spare capacity contributes to higher oil prices. It limits the
scope to increase production in order to offset rising demand pressures or
disruptions to supply. It also means that larger oil stocks are required to
smooth price fluctuations. However, global oil stocks have broadly remained

stable since the early 1990s (Graph III.5, left-hand panel). The effects on
prices have been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and lower average oil
inventories in some major oil-consuming countries.
In the case of food commodities, rapid GDP growth in EMEs in recent years
has played a large role in boosting demand. This effect has been reinforced by
structural changes, as rising per capita incomes, notably in China, have
increased the demand for cereals, particularly for grain-fed livestock. According
to Food and Agriculture Organization estimates, the consumption of cereals
per person in developing countries rose by 20% between 1962 and 2003,
while that of meat increased threefold. The demand effect on grain prices is
amplified because, according to some estimates, two to five times more grain
is required to produce the same amount of calories through livestock than
through direct grain consumption. Around one third of global grain production
was used to feed livestock in 2002. Government policies have also boosted
demand for agricultural products. In particular, subsidies for biofuel production
have increased the demand for maize and soybeans, which has in turn raised
the prices of other food crops by diverting production away from them.
On the supply side, urbanisation has reduced the acreage devoted
to farming in some EMEs. Higher oil and gas prices have also raised the cost
of both fertiliser and transport. Government policies in advanced industrial
economies, including restrictions on agricultural land use to support prices,
continue to limit production responses to increased demand. Finally, lower
stocks have added to price pressures (Graph III.5, centre panel). Supply
constraints have been particularly apparent for wheat, which experienced poor
growing conditions in 2006–07, although conditions have recently improved.
Are high commodity prices likely to persist? In the short run, slower
growth in the United States will tend to reverse some of the recent spikes in
commodity prices or at least dampen any further increases. However,
commodity prices will be supported to the extent that the rapid growth in EMEs,
and in particular China, can be sustained. The recent lowering of US interest
rates also supports high commodity prices, and this effect will be reinforced if
tight credit conditions in global markets eventually ease as expected. Over the
medium term, some of the structural demand factors cited earlier, such as the
continuing economic transformation of China and India, seem likely to persist.
The above-mentioned supply factors and constraints (eg higher costs of
agricultural and oil production) also appear likely to influence commodity
price setting for some time to come.

External balances and capital flows
Current account
surpluses, except in
CEE and South
Africa

The EMEs as a whole continued to run a current account surplus and receive
net inflows of private capital in 2007. In emerging Asia, there was a further
increase in the current account surplus to about 61/2% of regional GDP, and in
Latin America a slight decline in the surplus to about 3/4% of GDP. The surplus
of oil exporters in the Middle East remained at about 20% of GDP, while that
of Russia fell to less than 6% of GDP. By contrast, in central and eastern
Europe (CEE) and South Africa the deficit widened to 61/2% and 71/4% of GDP

BIS 78th Annual Report

39

respectively. The major external surplus regions in EMEs in 2007 thus
remained emerging Asia (with a surplus of $520 billion), the Middle East
($275 billion) and Russia ($80 billion), while the major deficit regions were CEE
and South Africa, with a combined deficit of $140 billion (Table III.1).
The effect on EME current account balances of the financial turmoil in
advanced industrial economies and a slowing US economy has so far been
muted by strong demand from other regions. Buoyant import demand in Europe
and the Middle East supported growing surpluses in emerging Asia. Exports
from Latin America, Russia and the Middle East benefited from the continued
strength of commodity prices. In CEE, robust growth of consumption and
investment, partly associated with solid growth in the euro area, boosted
imports and helped build capacity for the future expansion of exports.
Global financial turbulence has not yet had any significant impact on
private capital flows to EMEs either. Net private capital inflows (ie gross
inflows minus gross outflows of private sector foreign direct investment
(FDI), portfolio and other capital) increased by over 2 percentage points in
emerging Asia for the whole of 2007 (to 31/2 % of regional GDP); by close to
23/4 percentage points in Latin America (to 2.9% of GDP); and by 3/4 percentage
point in CEE (to 9% of GDP) (Graph III.6). Thus, the overall macroeconomic
pressures potentially stemming from capital inflows remained high in CEE,
but more moderate in emerging Asia and Latin America.
Trends in net private capital flows do not capture all information relevant
for an analysis of macroeconomic and financial stability; therefore, it is also
necessary to look at the size and composition of gross private capital inflows.
These inflows continued to increase in 2007, albeit at a more moderate pace than
in previous years. In emerging Asia, gross private capital inflows averaged

nearly 15% of GDP in 2007 (Graph III.6, left-hand panel). This was close to levels
seen before the 1997–98 crisis, even though the region is now running a large
current account surplus. In Latin America, gross private inflows picked up
from about 1% of GDP in 2002 to almost 6% on average in 2007 (Graph III.6,
centre panel), close to the historical peaks of the early 1990s. In CEE,
opportunities created by accession to the European Union have boosted gross
private capital inflows to close to 20% of GDP on average (Graph III.6, righthand panel), an unprecedented level for EMEs in recent history. As a result,
this region now receives around 28% of gross private capital inflows to
emerging markets (compared with around 10% in the mid-1990s); Latin
America receives around 11% (against 25%); emerging Asia just under 50%
(against 63%); and other emerging markets around 11% (against 2%).
The composition of gross private capital inflows to EMEs has changed
over the past five years and now more closely resembles that prevailing in
the mid-1990s. The share of FDI in gross inflows dropped to about 40% on
average for all emerging market countries in 2007, from 90% in 2002, while
the share of portfolio inflows doubled to around 20%. However, the fastestrising category has been “other” investment inflows to banks and the non-bank
private sector. Their share in gross private inflows increased from close to
zero in 2002 to over 40% in 2007.
For a better insight into these “other” investment inflows, it is useful to
look at the BIS locational banking statistics. Cross-border claims of BIS
reporting banks on EMEs were estimated at $2.6 trillion in 2007 (Table III.3),
an increase of $1.6 trillion over the past five years. While emerging Asia and
CEE secured the bulk of these inflows, relative to GDP they were much more
important in the latter case, with the ratio of cross-border claims to GDP
rising to 32%. The CEE countries are thus exposed to significant risks from a
possible reversal in bank-intermediated capital flows.

At the same time as gross private inflows have risen, gross private
outflows surpassed previous historical peaks in 2007, ranging from around
41/2% of GDP on average in Latin America to over 14% of GDP in emerging
Asia (Graph III.7). This surge in gross private capital outflows has been due
mostly to purchases of foreign debt securities, particularly by emerging Asia,
and outward FDI, which rose significantly in all three regions in 2007. Private
capital outflows have also become more evenly distributed across categories.
The share of FDI in gross outflows increased to 25% on average for all
emerging market countries in 2007, from under 20% in 2002; that of portfolio
outflows increased to over 40% (from 30%); and the share of other investment
outflows decreased to 35% (from over 50%).
Gross private outflows from EMEs for the purchase of debt securities
have increased by almost 1% of GDP per year on average since 2002. Private
investors from Asia, and China in particular, accounted for about three quarters
of these outflows. One notable feature is that a large share of these “private”
investors are actually state-controlled entities. For example, in China such
investors include large commercial banks which, while classified as private
investors in official statistics, are majority state-owned.
In a number of EMEs, sovereign wealth funds are also large institutional
investors abroad, and their importance has increased in the recent past.
However, relatively little is known about some funds (especially the largest
ones), and estimates of their growth and overall size vary widely. Moreover, it
is not clear how these funds are classified in official statistics – as official or
private investors. During 2007 and early 2008, sovereign wealth funds from
China, Singapore and several Middle East countries made commitments
to invest around $80 billion to recapitalise troubled financial institutions
from Europe and the United States. If all sovereign wealth fund assets from

The increase in (notionally) private capital outflows into debt securities
has come on top of substantial official capital outflows in the form of increases
in foreign exchange reserves. In emerging Asia, official reserves have risen by
an average of 4–6% of GDP annually in recent years (Graph III.7, left-hand

Faced with the conflicting risks of a global slowdown and rising inflation, as
well as unwelcome pressure on exchange rates from large foreign currency
inflows, policymakers in EMEs have had recourse to various policy instruments
– adjusting interest rates, intervening in foreign exchange markets, changing
capital account regulations, adjusting fiscal policy and tightening prudential
regulations. Many of these choices have involved difficult trade-offs.
Reflecting these conflicting risks, the response of EME monetary
authorities to higher inflation pressures has been quite diverse. Between mid2007 and early 2008, median policy or short-term interbank rates rose in Latin
America (by 50 basis points). Rates also rose in central Europe, South Africa
and Russia, but fell in Turkey. In emerging Asia rates fell overall (Graph III.8,
left-hand panel), as a result of lower policy or short-term rates in Hong Kong
SAR, Indonesia and the Philippines. Furthermore, while the People’s Bank of
China raised one-year bank deposit and loan rates in 2007, short-term
interbank rates remained relatively low. More recently, rising inflation pressures
have led to rate increases in a number of EMEs.
There having been only limited increases in nominal policy rates, real
policy or short-term rates have declined to around zero in Asia, and have also
fallen in other emerging markets (Graph III.8, centre panel). The reluctance of
many EMEs to raise policy interest rates more aggressively has been due in
part to worries that higher policy rates would attract greater capital inflows and
so accentuate pressures for currency appreciation. However, real exchange rates
have appreciated significantly in many EMEs, countering the easing of monetary
conditions caused by low real interest rates (Graph III.8, right-hand panel).
Concerns about appreciation pressures have also led to substantial and
prolonged intervention in foreign exchange markets, as evidenced in rising
foreign reserves. Foreign reserves of EMEs grew by over $1 trillion in 2007
(compared to $620 billion in 2006) to reach over $4 trillion at the end of the
year, and they continued to rise rapidly in the early months of 2008. There were
sizeable increases in foreign reserves in many EMEs, including Brazil, China,
India and Russia among others (Graph III.9, left-hand panel; see also Chapter V).
Other things equal, foreign reserve accumulation tends to increase the
monetary base and ease monetary conditions. In order to prevent such easing,
central banks take steps to limit or “sterilise” the monetary impact of foreign

exchange intervention. Many EMEs have done this by issuing debt securities
of various maturities (and in some cases, notably in China and India, by raising
the reserve requirements on banks). Sterilisation is rarely complete, however,
and some easing in money or credit conditions usually still occurs. The balance
sheets of domestic commercial banks in some EMEs have in fact expanded
dramatically, in some cases reflecting increases in reserve money that could
be associated with the low interest rates cited earlier. In addition, the liquidity
of bank balance sheets has increased as bank holdings of government paper
have risen. These developments have contributed to the substantial growth of
bank credit to the private sector, which has matched or exceeded rapid nominal
GDP growth (Graph III.9, right-hand panel). For example, between 2005 and
2007, credit to the private sector grew at an annual rate of 29% in Latin
America, 25% in India and 17% in China.
Apart from affecting commercial bank portfolios, this massive expansion
in foreign exchange reserves has increased the exposure of central banks
(or governments) to losses associated with changes in differentials between
domestic and foreign interest rates and in exchange rates. The substantial
fall in the US federal funds rate since the second half of 2007 has widened
the differential between domestic and US rates, implying that many central
banks are facing running losses on foreign exchange reserve holdings
financed by issuing domestic securities. As of April 2008, the median interest
rate differential had risen to 1.1 percentage points in emerging Asia, 7.5
percentage points in Latin America and 6.6 percentage points in the other
EMEs. In addition, the sharp depreciation of the US dollar against many
EME currencies has led to valuation losses on foreign exchange reserves.
Even assuming some diversification in the currency composition of foreign
reserve holdings to include a strengthening euro, valuation effects since
August last year must have been considerable. Losses on foreign reserve
holdings can further complicate efforts to tighten monetary policy in response
to rising inflation.

More exchange

Controls on capital

Countercyclical
fiscal policy

Graph III.9

A number of EMEs have responded to pressures associated with large
capital inflows by allowing greater exchange rate flexibility (Graph III.10). This
approach has contributed to disinflation. In some cases, it also seems to have
discouraged short-term speculative inflows (eg in Poland, South Africa and
Turkey) by confronting market participants with two-way exchange rate risks.
In contrast, in some other countries (including the Czech Republic, Indonesia
and Slovakia), currency appreciation seems to have been associated with
additional capital inflows, presumably on the expectation that the exchange
rate would continue to appreciate.
Several countries have resorted to capital account policies to cope with
pressures associated with capital inflows. Some have eased controls on capital
outflows: for example, China, India and Russia further liberalised their rules
on residents’ investment in foreign securities in 2007. The recent surge in China’s
private sector investments in foreign debt securities appears to be partly
related to this move. In a few cases, countries have reintroduced selective
controls on capital inflows (eg Brazil and Colombia). However, most countries
have hesitated to do so because of the microeconomic distortions that such
capital controls cause. Indeed, in March 2008 Thailand lifted the controls on
capital inflows it had introduced in 2006.
Another way to counter expansionary pressures arising from large capital
inflows could be to tighten fiscal policy. However, such a move may produce
two opposing effects on the exchange rate. On the one hand, as aggregate
demand slows in response to fiscal consolidation, interest rates could fall,
which would discourage capital inflows. On the other hand, in countries where
the fundamentals are not particularly strong, fiscal tightening might reduce
country risk premia, thus strengthening the currency and attracting further
capital inflows. Possibly reflecting the relative importance of these effects,
reliance on fiscal consolidation to curb appreciation pressures has varied from
country to country. For example, in Chile public spending increases have

followed a fiscal rule which targets a structural fiscal surplus and requires that
all surplus funds (which can be substantial when copper prices are high) be
invested abroad. Similarly, several oil-exporting countries have relied on oil
stabilisation funds to cope with rising oil revenues. Beyond the commodityexporting countries, and some countries with fixed exchange rate regimes,
fiscal tightening has not commonly been used in response to increasing capital
inflows. Real government expenditure growth has actually accelerated over the
past few years in Indonesia, Thailand, Latin America and central Europe.
In contrast, prudential and supervisory measures have been widely used
to manage the impact of capital inflows on banking soundness and, more
broadly, to offset the effects of rapid credit growth and rising asset prices (in
particular house prices) on the domestic financial system. Several central
banks in emerging Asia have used prudential instruments such as lower loanto-value ratios (China, Korea), higher capital and provisioning requirements
(India) and tighter lending criteria (Korea) to counteract the effects of capital
inflows on the banking sector. CEE countries have, with some success,
deployed an array of measures to mitigate the effects of bank-intermediated
inflows, including raising risk weights on foreign currency loans, tightening
foreign exchange liquidity requirements, lowering limits on open foreign
exchange positions, and increasing reporting requirements and intensifying
supervision of banks and other financial institutions. These measures have in
some cases been combined with more traditional monetary policy tools, such
as raising the level and broadening the coverage of reserve requirements.

Vulnerabilities of EMEs
The turmoil in the global financial system and the US slowdown are likely to
hurt the economic prospects of the EMEs, but the question is how much.

Equity prices give a

In 2001, EME
growth fell below
average

As of May 2008, most forecasters were still optimistic about the near-term
growth prospects for EMEs. While consensus forecasts for growth in the
emerging markets in 2008 have declined in recent months, they still suggest
that a marked degree of resilience is expected. The forecast for US growth in
2008 has fallen about 1 percentage point since September 2007, while the
median forecast for emerging market growth has fallen only 0.2 percentage
points over the same period (Graph III.11, left-hand panel). At 6.7%, the
forecast for EME growth in 2008 is not far below the average for 2003–06.
Regionally, forecasts for growth have declined in Asia and other emerging
markets while remaining stable in Latin America.
Yet consensus forecasts tend to miss business cycle turning points, and
by a larger margin when the downturns are particularly pronounced (eg during
crises). Thus, if global developments were to cause a severe downturn in
EMEs, it is possible that consensus forecasts would not predict it.
Equity markets provide mixed signals on the prospects for EMEs. In late
2007 or early 2008, equity markets weakened, even if high commodity prices
supported individual regions, for example in Latin America (Graph III.11, righthand panel).
The historical experience of the US slowdown in 2001 suggests that
downside risks for EME growth could be substantial. During that period, US
growth declined to 2 percentage points below average as the high-tech boom
collapsed. At the same time, US import growth fell to 15 percentage points
below average. Exports of emerging markets were hard hit, especially those
of East Asian economies whose exports were concentrated on the high-tech
sector (Graph III.12, top panels). During the 2001 episode, a 1 percentage
point below average growth rate in the United States was associated with a
growth rate 0.6 percentage points below average in China, and even further

below average in other Asian economies. In Latin America, the corresponding
shortfalls ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points.
However, the experience of 2001 appears thus far to differ from
experience in the current episode. At the time of the US recession in 2001, the
business cycle of emerging market economies appeared to be closely linked
(“coupled”) to that of the United States. In contrast, the recent US slowdown
appears to date to have been associated with a much smaller decline in EME
growth. Indeed, although slowing, EME growth has remained above average
(Graph III.12, bottom left-hand panel) as US growth has faltered.
Two explanations can be offered for these differences in growth
performance across the two periods. First, in contrast to 2001, emerging market
exports continued to grow above their average rates in 2007 (Graph III.12, bottom
right-hand panel), even if US import growth was below average. However, as
discussed below, the risk of a more severe outcome nonetheless remains.
Second, EMEs have recently been able to counter the effects of any fall
in demand for their exports by boosting their domestic demand more than in
2001 (Graph III.1). Compared to 2001, private consumption spending has risen
more strongly in emerging Asia and Latin America. The contribution to growth
of investment spending switched from negative in 2001 to a strong positive
for Asia, Latin America and central Europe in 2007. Thus, there seems to be
some growth momentum for domestic demand in most emerging market

regions. This may partly explain why, in spite of increasing globalisation,
research shows that the impact on EMEs of economic activity in advanced
industrial economies has declined.
Although growth forecasts remain robust for EMEs for 2008, there are
risks that this may not continue (see below). First, emerging market exports
might weaken, possibly more than predicted by recent consensus forecasts.
Second, there may be constraints on EMEs’ ability to boost domestic demand
to compensate for any weakening in exports. Third, EMEs with high current
account deficits and high short-term debt, as well as those that rely heavily on
cross-border bank financing, may be vulnerable to reversals of capital flows.

Risks should

slow

Exports of EMEs could be significantly affected if the US economic slowdown
deepens, for at least three reasons.
First, US markets remain important for emerging market exporters. For
example, while the share of the United States in exports of Asian EMEs outside
China has fallen, it remains sufficiently large – ranging from a low of 10% in
Singapore to a high of 18% in Malaysia in 2007 – to ensure that total exports
would be materially affected by a sharp reduction in US demand. The US
share in China’s exports is around 20%. As well as lowering direct demand
for Chinese exports, a US slowdown could also reduce China’s imports of
intermediate goods and commodities from other EMEs that are used as inputs
for export production. While China could offset the contractionary impact of a
US slowdown by boosting its own domestic demand (see below), a concern
raised in last year’s Annual Report was that China has tended to import
relatively little from other EMEs (notably in emerging Asia) for its own domestic
demand. Thus, they would be little helped.
Recent developments ease but do not fully dispel such concerns. For
example, between September 2007 and February 2008, China’s total import
growth (in US dollars) accelerated from 16% to 35%, reflecting a steep rise in
the growth of ordinary trade imports, which are more closely related to China’s
domestic demand. At the same time, the growth in imports for processing
trade, which are directly linked to China’s exports, fell (Graph III.13, left-hand
panel). During this period, the growth in China’s imports from Asia did rise, but
at a much smaller rate than the growth in imports from oil-exporting countries
or Latin America (Graph III.13, right-hand panel). As these figures refer to
import values in US dollars, they should be interpreted with caution. However,
they suggest that emerging Asian exporters could benefit relatively less from
growth in China’s imports outside the processing trade category. More
generally, there is a risk that the growth in China’s imports overall could
slow down sharply should the US economy weaken further, with adverse
consequences for its trading partners. This risk is highlighted by a distinct
slowdown in China’s imports in March.
EME exports are also being supported by the greater resilience of EU
imports and growth so far, compared to 2001. Any substantial deterioration in
the growth outlook in Europe could adversely affect emerging markets (see
Chapter II).

Second, US demand could fall in those particular sectors in which EME
exports are heavily concentrated, as occurred with Asian IT exports during the
2001 US recession. While to date the slowdown has been concentrated in the
housing sector, falling US demand could yet reduce US imports of final goods
produced by EMEs. A decline in US non-residential fixed investment in the first
quarter of 2008 reinforces this concern. Admittedly, so far the overall data are
favourable: the value of US total imports and those from EMEs increased up
to the first quarter of 2008. However, US imports have fallen in some sectors
that represent the top exports of EMEs. For example, the growth in imports of
certain IT products that are important for a number of East Asian economies
(eg Korea, Malaysia and Singapore) has declined. The growth in demand for
consumer goods like toys and for certain heavy vehicles has also fallen,
affecting producers in some EMEs, such as China and Mexico. As noted earlier,
a more pronounced US slowdown, coupled with weaker growth in other
advanced industrial economies, could also lead to weaker commodity prices,
slowing growth in commodity-exporting countries in Latin America, Africa
and the Middle East.
Third, dollar depreciation could reinforce the contractionary impact of a US
slowdown on EME net exports. While US dollar appreciation against emerging
market currencies in 2001 mitigated the impact of the US slowdown on EMEs,
the dollar has depreciated considerably against many emerging market
currencies since July 2007 and this could well continue. Moreover, a number
of emerging market currencies have remained stable or depreciated on
an effective basis (see Graph V.2 in Chapter V), suggesting that future
appreciation might be warranted.

Resilience of domestic demand
Notwithstanding the increasing role of domestic demand in EME growth cited
earlier, global conditions still pose some risks, as increases in consumption or
investment spending to offset a slowdown could be constrained by a number
of factors.

One risk is that, by reducing prospective returns and incomes, lower
demand for exports could reduce consumption and investment spending. In
the case of households, the squeeze on incomes is being aggravated by higher
inflation, particularly among commodity-importing countries. Furthermore,
recent experience suggests that EMEs could find it difficult to raise investment
to counter a slowdown in GDP growth. In some countries where investment
spending has been strong, notably China, there are concerns about
overinvestment. In other EMEs, investment growth has generally not exceeded
the growth in GDP even during expansions. Since the late 1990s, investmentto-GDP ratios have risen only moderately in emerging Asia excluding China
and India (recently averaging about 24% compared to over 40% in China) and
in Latin America (averaging around 20%).
Another risk is that tighter financing conditions could constrain spending.
While public debt as a percentage of GDP has generally fallen in this decade
(Graph III.14, left-hand panel) and the fiscal balances of most EMEs have
improved, fiscal positions would worsen in the event of a downturn, while the
median public debt ratio in EMEs is still high at about 38% of GDP. Rising oil
prices are also adversely affecting fiscal positions in a number of EMEs
that subsidise energy. This could limit the scope to use countercyclical fiscal
policy in the event of a sharp slowdown. In this setting, sovereign spreads
remain well below the levels observed in past periods of financial turbulence,
but are significantly higher than they were in the first half of 2007 (Chapter VI),
highlighting the risks that financing constraints could become binding.
Household and corporate indebtedness has increased since 2001 (Graph
III.14, centre and right-hand panels). While debt positions so far appear to be
sustainable, tighter financing conditions could limit the scope for raising
consumption or investment. In some countries, low debt ratios actually reflect a

lack of financial development and of household access to credit, so the ability
to borrow to increase spending would be limited in any case. In other countries
where household access to credit has improved, the rapid growth in credit in
recent years poses risks (see below). As for the corporate sector, corporate
bond spreads have recently widened more than sovereign spreads in a number
of EMEs, indicating that some borrowers are starting to face tighter financing
conditions after many years of easy borrowing.

Vulnerability to capital flow reversals
Despite some tightening of external financing conditions, the EMEs as a whole
– with improved fundamentals, abundant reserves and large current account
surpluses – appear to be less vulnerable to reversals in capital flows today
than they were in the past. Nevertheless, two types of vulnerabilities to such
reversals can be highlighted. First, EMEs with large current account deficits
and a high proportion of short-term foreign debt could find it difficult to secure
foreign funding if global financing conditions were to tighten more severely.
Second, emerging market countries that depend heavily on cross-border bank
financing are vulnerable to a withdrawal of such financing due to problems in
banks both in advanced industrial economies and at home (see Chapter VII).
Countries that might find it particularly difficult to secure foreign funding if
global financing conditions were to tighten further can be identified in the Baltic
and southeastern European regions. These countries have very large current
account deficits, only around half of which are covered by FDI, usually
considered the most stable form of foreign financing (Table III.4). They are also
burdened with a high proportion of short-term external debt (120% of foreign

exchange reserves on average). Furthermore, cross-border loans in these
countries account on average for 76% of domestic credit. South Africa, with a
current account deficit of more than 7% of GDP and a high reliance on portfolio
inflows, is also in a relatively vulnerable position.
In view of the turmoil engulfing banks in advanced industrial economies,
the second major vulnerability in some EMEs concerns the sustainability of
bank-intermediated capital inflows. Historically, bank flows have periodically
been subject to sharp reversals, such as during the early 1980s in Latin
America and during 1997–98 in emerging Asia. While the extent of foreign
funding of domestic credit is fairly large in many emerging markets, it is
considerably lower today than in the past. This is partly because of foreignowned bank subsidiaries that increasingly fund themselves locally, rather than
relying on “pure” cross-border credit as they did earlier.
One exception, as noted above, is central and eastern Europe. This region
differs markedly from most other emerging markets in that external borrowing
is rising in line with rapid economic and financial integration with the euro
area and its banking systems are mostly foreign-owned (which is also true of
Mexico). Most western European parent banks seem to have plans to sustain
cross-border financing of their CEE subsidiaries, while gradually slowing credit
to those economies that seem to be overheating. Moreover, Swedish, Austrian
and Italian banks with a large presence in the region tend to take a long-term
view of the growth opportunities in CEE, and have consistently sought to
protect their franchises.
Nevertheless, potential problems in either parent banks’ home markets or
the emerging economy host markets pose risks of capital inflows declining or
even reversing. For instance, although the main parent banks in CEE have so
far not experienced major losses on US subprime mortgages or structured
products, they obtain a substantial part of their funding in foreign currencies
in international wholesale markets. Thus, Swedish banks borrow euros and
onlend these funds to their subsidiaries in the Baltic states, while Austrian and
Italian banks borrow in Swiss francs and onlend these funds to their
subsidiaries in central and southeastern Europe. If these wholesale markets
dried up, the main suppliers of external financing to emerging Europe would
come under funding pressure. Alternative sources of bank funding in emerging
Europe are scarce. Moreover, domestically owned banks have limited capacity
to raise funds externally, and even those that do (eg Russian banks) have seen
their funding sharply reduced since August 2007. Locally, the growth of the
deposit base has lagged behind credit growth in most countries in CEE for
several years now, which was why CEE banks started to seek external funding
in the first place.
Risks to banking flows in CEE countries are accentuated by the fact that
the exposure of a parent institution to a host country is typically a much smaller
fraction of its worldwide loan portfolio than is the exposure of the host country
to a particular parent bank. Changes in lending policies that are modest from
the perspective of the parent institution can thus have a major impact on
macroeconomic and financial stability in the host country (see Chapter VII in
last year’s Annual Report ).

BIS 78th Annual Report

Bank-intermediated capital inflows could also come under pressure via
another route in a number of emerging market regions as well as CEE. Bank
credit to the private sector has expanded tremendously over the past five years
– in Latin America by a cumulative 7 percentage points of GDP and in CEE by
30 percentage points. Such rapid credit growth could have overstretched the
capacity of institutions to assess and monitor credit effectively, for instance due
to shortages of qualified bank officers and institutional weaknesses that make
it difficult for banks reliably to estimate credit risk or risk-adjusted returns, or to
recover collateral. If so, banks will have to increase their provisioning when the
underestimation of risk is finally recognised. This could lead the management
of banks to conclude that return-on-equity targets (which are often quite
ambitious in emerging markets) cannot be met and to curtail lending growth,
possibly very suddenly.
Banks operating in emerging markets also face risks from exposure to the
property market. House prices in several Asian EMEs (including China, Hong
Kong SAR, India and Singapore), and in particular in emerging Europe, have
increased rapidly in recent years. If asset quality deteriorates significantly,
internal risk controls at banks could force a sharp reduction in credit to protect
bank capital.
A sudden drying-up of capital inflows could lead to major exchange rate
corrections. This might have substantial balance sheet and wealth effects in
countries with sizeable unhedged foreign currency liabilities. Most vulnerable in
this respect are again countries in CEE, which have borrowed heavily abroad
and where a large proportion of the recent credit growth has been denominated
in foreign currencies. This exposure is suggested by the positive correlation
between the change in the cost of insurance against a credit event in emerging
markets (as measured by the increase in credit default swap spreads for
sovereign debt since end-July 2007) and the degree of reliance on crossborder financing (as measured by the share of foreign liabilities in total
liabilities of the banking sector at end-2007) (Graph III.15).
There are still no clear signs of a change in the behaviour of banks
lending to emerging markets. Credit growth was sustained at a relatively brisk
– though slowing – pace into early 2008. Nor is there any strong evidence of
a dwindling in cross-border bank flows. In emerging Asia and Latin America,
external funding pressures remained modest through the first quarter of 2008,
partly because much of the financing for domestic credit growth has come
from an expanding domestic deposit base. The resilience of domestic banking
systems despite the global turmoil is reflected in the general stability of
domestic currency interbank markets. Although backward-looking, prudential
indicators such as capital adequacy, non-performing loan and provisioning
ratios are mostly rather solid and stable in all three major emerging market
regions, providing some buffer for their banking systems.
Developments have not been uniform, however. On the one hand, the
performance of some market indicators (eg local currency bond spreads in
Hungary, the exchange rates in Romania and South Africa) suggests that
market participants are starting to take greater account of country-specific
signs of vulnerability. The countries that have been affected most by the recent

turmoil have been those with the largest internal and external imbalances
and/or insufficient policy credibility, as well as those that had previously
experienced strong capital inflows coupled with rapidly rising asset valuations
and risks of overheating (eg Romania, Russia, South Africa and Turkey).
On the other hand, commodity prices and supply side factors continue to
favour some emerging markets. Moreover, various supply side factors could
also support further inflows. These include portfolio diversification by
institutional investors in Europe and North America, the search for higher
returns by retail investors in Japan and the recycling of oil-based surpluses by
institutional or sovereign investors in the Middle East. In the short term,
increasing concerns about asset quality in advanced industrial economies
could even stimulate portfolio flows to some EMEs, in particular those with
large external surpluses.
Nonetheless, a significant US-led economic slowdown would probably
dampen most types of capital inflows to emerging markets. Sovereign and
corporate bond issuance in global markets, and flows related to carry trades
involving emerging markets, have already declined (see Chapter V). In
addition to lower capital inflows, a slowdown in the advanced industrial
economies would also lead to a decrease in workers’ remittances. This could
have particularly large effects in countries in Central America, Mexico, India
and the Philippines, thus increasing their external financing needs relative to
the more comfortable circumstances of the past few years.

IV. Monetary policy in the advanced industrial
economies

Highlights
Monetary policy in the advanced industrial economies faced two conflicting
challenges during the period under review. On the one hand, tensions in
financial markets threatened to spill over into the real economy by way of
tighter credit conditions and a loss in confidence. Everything else equal, this
would call for lower interest rates in order to offset the drag on aggregate
demand. On the other hand, inflationary pressures that stemmed from rising
commodity prices, together with high capacity utilisation and tight labour
markets in many economies, threatened to feed into longer-term inflation
expectations, thus calling for tighter monetary policy.
The manifestation of these challenges varied across countries and
regions, which explains, at least in part, why central banks dealt with them in
different ways (Table IV.1). In the United States, weakness in the housing
sector and related financial turmoil clouded the outlook for growth substantially.
The Federal Reserve reacted forcefully and cut the target federal funds rate in
several steps from 5.25% in September 2007 to 2% in April 2008. In other
regions, where the impact of the financial turmoil was less pronounced,
monetary policy was driven to a greater extent by inflation developments. The
central banks of Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden continued to
tighten policy. A middle course was followed by another set of central banks.
The ECB held its policy rate constant at 4% throughout the period, even
though inflation rose to the highest level since the introduction of the euro in
1999. The Bank of Japan also kept its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%. The Bank
of Canada and the Bank of England increased rates in July 2007 but reduced
them later in the year and in the early part of 2008.
Changes in interest rates were only one measure through which central
banks responded to the dislocation in financial markets. Even before the
turbulence led to any changes in policy targets, central banks in several
countries adjusted their operations to keep reference rates near targets and to
provide financing in markets where liquidity had evaporated. The various
types of operations and the reasoning behind them are discussed in the last
section of this chapter. The first section provides an overview of the monetary
policy actions of the various central banks and puts them into context, and the
second turns to issues related to central bank communication.

to a posture of restraint. The timing of policy moves varied, however,
depending on respective cyclical positions.
Output growth in most countries was seen to be above its long-run
potential, although it was expected to moderate in some cases (see Chapter II).
Inflation rates had mostly declined from the peaks recorded earlier in the year
(Graph IV.1) but were expected to pick up again in the second half. Generally
high levels of capacity utilisation and tight labour markets, following a
prolonged period of above potential growth in several countries, contributed
to worries about inflationary pressures.
Possible inflation risks were also signalled by high rates of growth of both
money and credit in many economies. In the euro area, the broad monetary
aggregate M3 had expanded at an annualised rate of 12% in the first half of
2007, and growth continued to accelerate. Rising short-term interest rates had,
however, led to a decline in the growth of M1 and probably contributed to the
stabilisation of the growth of lending to the private sector, albeit at a double
digit rate. From the perspective of the ECB’s strategy, which assigns a

prominent role to monetary aggregates, the surge in M3 pointed to upside risks
to inflation over the medium term, since portfolio shifts and other special
factors could explain only part of this monetary expansion. High rates of growth
in money and credit were also recorded in other economies. In Australia, for
example, business credit grew at an annual rate of 22% in the first half of
2007, the fastest rate since the late 1980s.
In response to strong growth and inflationary pressures, policy rates were
raised in all the economies under review between June and early August 2007

(Graph IV.2), except in the United States and Japan, where the economic
environment was different. Even after these increases, monetary policy was
judged to be on the accommodative side in most economies. Indeed, several
central banks, including the Bank of Canada, Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss
National Bank, indicated that rates might have to rise further if inflationary
pressures persisted.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve had increased the target federal
funds rate from 1% to 5.25% between June 2004 and June 2006, but had kept
rates constant thereafter despite a weakening outlook for economic growth.
A decline in housing construction led to growth below the Federal Reserve’s

during most of 2006 and early 2007, but eased somewhat towards the middle
of 2007. The Federal Reserve expected core inflation to moderate further over
the coming quarters as the economy weakened and the full effect of past
interest rate increases worked its way through the system. Growth was
expected to recover to its long-term average in 2008 as the housing market
stabilised.
The Japanese economy had been growing at a pace considered to be
somewhat above potential in the first half of 2007, but this had yet to translate
into a lasting shift to positive inflation. Consumer prices remained essentially
unchanged in the first half of the year, but producer prices did increase a little.
The Bank of Japan thus left its policy rate at the still very low nominal level of
0.5%, although it indicated that rates would have to rise eventually once
economic growth fed into increasing prices.

… and Japan

Monetary policy during the turbulence
Monetary policymaking became more complicated in the second half of 2007.
Conditions in financial markets worsened substantially in the middle of August
(see Chapter VI), when problems spilled over from asset-backed securities
markets to the interbank money market. Towards the end of the year, larger
than anticipated increases in commodity prices pushed up inflation rates
sharply in most countries, with possible consequences for longer-term inflation
expectations.
Central banks thus faced a difficult trade-off. Cutting rates quickly and
substantially could support confidence in financial markets and the economy at
large and thus prevent the problems in the financial sector from spilling over
into the wider economy. However, loosening policy too much in an environment
of high inflation could lower public confidence in the strength of the central
bank’s commitment to price stability, which could result in longer-term
inflation expectations becoming unanchored. This, in turn, would require
renewed tightening further down the road, with potentially even larger costs
to the economy. Alternatively, holding rates steady or even raising them could
allow a slowing of the economy to offset the impact on inflation and inflation
expectations of rising commodity prices. Of course, this approach would run
the risk of aggravating already fragile financial conditions and provoking a
sharper slowdown of the economy than would be necessary to bring inflation
back into the preferred range. The trade-off between the two alternatives was
rendered even more complicated by the fact that the likely duration of the
financial turmoil and its potential impact on the real economy were difficult to
assess in real time.
Initially, it was not clear whether the turbulence would persist and to what
extent economic activity might be affected either by tighter financing conditions
for the non-financial sector or by a loss of confidence. Central banks therefore
chose to wait until more information became available before changing their
policy stance. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia left the cash rate
unchanged at 6.5% following its Board meeting in early September, even
though members believed that further tightening might be required to prevent
the continued strength in the economy from leading to inflation rising above

target. On balance, the Board felt that the tighter financial conditions might
control inflation independently of movements in the cash rate, thus making
any policy action unnecessary. Similarly, the Governing Council of the ECB left
policy rates unchanged at its meeting on 6 September. While noting the risks
to price stability, the ECB argued that it was necessary to gather more
information before drawing further conclusions for monetary policy. And, in
the announcement following its August meeting, the Bank of Japan pointed to
the large swings in the financial markets as a reason for delaying any further
policy tightening.
Subsequently, it became clear that the turmoil in financial markets would
not quickly abate and would have significant consequences that monetary
policymakers would have to take into account. At the same time, large
increases in food and energy prices led to considerably higher than anticipated
rates of inflation towards the end of the year. On the face of it, central banks
in the advanced industrial economies appear to have dealt with the two issues
rather differently.
Some central banks, most notably the Federal Reserve, cut policy rates
sharply in order to dampen the fallout on the economy from the turbulence.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the target federal funds
rate by 1 percentage point in the second half of 2007 and by an additional
21/4 percentage points in early 2008 after it became apparent that economic
activity was slowing by more than had been anticipated. The Bank of England
initially held rates constant but lowered them by a total of 75 basis points
starting in December 2007 as the outlook for the economy weakened. Slower
growth was also recorded in Canada, where the stimulative impact of higher
commodity prices was largely offset by the sharp appreciation of the exchange
rate. The Bank of Canada consequently reduced the target for the overnight
rate by a cumulative 11/2 percentage points between December 2007 and
April 2008.
Other central banks increased interest rates in the light of persistent
inflationary pressures. For example, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Central
Bank of Norway and the Riksbank raised policy rates by 75 basis points
between September 2007 and April 2008. A long period of growth had led to
high rates of capacity utilisation and tight labour markets in all three countries.
This resulted in domestic price pressures in addition to those arising from
higher food and energy prices.
Strong growth and rising inflation were also recorded in Switzerland. In
contrast to other central banks, the Swiss National Bank does not express its
policy stance in terms of overnight rates but instead attempts to steer threemonth Libor in a predetermined corridor. The surge in term spreads in the
money market in the middle of August and subsequent months introduced a
large wedge between the rates paid on the central bank’s weekly repurchase
operations and its policy rate. As a consequence, three-month Libor rose to
levels well above the 2.5% midpoint of the corridor in late August and early
September. At its meeting on 13 September, the Swiss National Bank’s Board
decided to lift the target corridor by 25 basis points to 2.25–3.25%, thus
bringing it in line with the rates already observed in the market. To achieve

BIS 78th Annual Report

61

this target, given higher term premia, the central bank reduced the rates on its
repo operations substantially.
In other economies, in particular the euro area and Japan, policy rates
remained unchanged. The ECB chose to put further interest rate increases on
hold despite inflationary pressures in view of the weakening in the economy
and the appreciation of the euro. However, it repeatedly stressed that secondround effects from the spike in inflation would not be tolerated. Similarly, the
Bank of Japan refrained from raising interest rates in late 2007 because of
increased downside risks to growth. At the same time, the Policy Board
confirmed its intention to lift rates once deflation was clearly overcome and
the economy was following a path of sustainable growth.

Unchanged policy
rates in the euro
area and Japan

Different economic conditions or different approaches to policy?
These differences in the path of policy rates across countries and currency areas
during the second half of 2007 and early 2008 reflect, to varying degrees,
differences in the economic situation, differences in the extent of financial
stress and differences in central banks’ strategies for dealing with highcost/low-probability scenarios.
Although the weakening in worldwide demand and the rise in commodity
prices were felt in every economy, their precise impact differed markedly
across countries. For example, rising commodity prices stimulated economic
activity in commodity-producing economies such as Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and Norway, but dampened it elsewhere. Similarly, their effect on
inflation depended on exchange rate movements and on the degree of capacity
utilisation, among other factors.
Estimates of central bank reaction functions indicate that, with some
exceptions, central banks responded to changes in economic conditions during
the second half of 2007 and early 2008 in roughly the same way as in previous
years. Dynamic forecasts based on simple equations linking policy rates to
output gaps and inflation as well as lagged policy rates (to account for interest
rate smoothing) are able to explain the path of policy rates relatively well
in Canada, the euro area, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom
(Graph IV.3). The estimates thus suggest that the behaviour of those central
banks was broadly in line with that observed in the past. By contrast, the
Reserve Bank of Australia increased and the Federal Reserve decreased
policy rates by more than predicted on the basis of their past responses to
changes in the output gap and inflation. For these central banks, it appears
that something not present in the equations, perhaps a shift in the economic
outlook not reflected in contemporaneous output gaps and rates of inflation,
must have influenced policy in a decisive way.
Changes in relative economic conditions appear to have some explanatory
power for differences across central banks (Graph IV.4). Most of the central
banks that raised policy rates or held them constant also lifted their inflation
forecasts by a greater amount than the central banks that lowered rates.
Similarly, larger downward revisions in growth forecasts were generally
associated with relatively larger degrees of policy easing. However, the fit is
not perfect. In particular, the Reserve Bank of Australia sharply reduced its

growth forecast and the Central Bank of Norway cut its inflation forecast, yet
both central banks increased policy rates. In part, this might reflect some
endogeneity, with revisions to forecasts reflecting the slowing induced by
higher policy rates.
Another reason for the different policy responses was that not all countries
were hit equally hard by the turbulence in financial markets. Taking the
average spread between three-month Libor and overnight index swaps (OIS) of
the same maturity in a particular currency as a measure of the severity of the
turmoil, there appears to be a close relationship between changes in policy
rates and the extent of dislocation in money markets. For example, the
Australian and Swedish money markets were less affected by the turbulence
than the corresponding US dollar and sterling markets. This is consistent with
the fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Riksbank increased policy
rates whereas the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England cut them. The
correlation between the extent of the dislocation and the relative easing of
policy remains even after controlling for the revisions in the forecasts for
output and inflation (not shown).

Graph IV.4

The finding that a measure for tensions in the money market has some
explanatory power for changes in interest rates, even when forecast revisions
are controlled for, could indicate that central banks also responded to the
perceived risks to these forecasts. All central banks pay attention to risks to
their outlook to some degree when taking monetary policy decisions, although
the precise nature of the risks considered during the period under review, and
the effect they had on policy, varied greatly across institutions. Some central
banks focused primarily on avoiding the risk of a serious downturn in the
immediate future, whereas others were more concerned about the implications
of easier policy for future macroeconomic outcomes.
Among the central banks of the major advanced industrial economies,
the Federal Reserve perhaps falls most clearly into the category of those putting
particular emphasis on wanting to prevent the possibility of a serious downturn.
This risk management approach to monetary policy was an important factor
behind the interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve seen over the
period, as was repeatedly pointed out in the minutes of FOMC meetings and
the statements by FOMC members.
Policymakers at the Bank of Japan have arguably been the most
explicit in emphasising the possible longer-term implications of their
monetary policy choices. The second perspective of their “two-perspective”
framework for determining policy focuses on risks to the outlook beyond the
two-year horizon. In late 2007, the Policy Board had concluded that the
second perspective, by itself, pointed to tighter policy given the potential
for overborrowing and excessive fixed investment if market participants
believed that interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time.
However, by March 2008, at least one member of the Policy Board reasoned
that the second perspective highlighted downside risks to growth and
inflation and hence the advisability of easier policy to avoid the re-emergence
of deflation.

Most other central banks seemed to place less emphasis on the risks of
possible extreme outcomes. Nevertheless, they still had to balance concerns
about a larger than expected rise in inflation, which might lead to inflation
expectations becoming unanchored, with the risk of a sharper than anticipated
slowdown in economic growth.
Current and projected economic conditions as well as the risks
surrounding forecasts are clearly important factors shaping policy decisions,
but differences in beliefs about how the economy operates and differences in
mandates also appear to play a role. For example, the dual mandate of the
Federal Reserve, with its equal emphasis on output and inflation, would seem
to call for a sharper easing in response to the turmoil than a mandate with no
explicit obligation to support output. Conversely, the ECB’s policy of holding
rates steady despite the deceleration in economic activity is in line with the
priority given in its mandate to achieving price stability.

Developments in central bank communication
Challenges for
communication

The uncertainty associated with the financial turbulence and its impact on the
world economy posed substantial challenges for central banks’ communication
strategies. In particular, they had to ensure that an easier path for monetary
policy would not be taken as implying a weakened determination to control
inflation or as a decision to “bail out” banks. In addition, central banks had to
be aware that their communication could itself affect the trajectory of the
financial turbulence, which depended critically on market participants’
confidence. The first part of this section reviews some general changes in the
communication policy of several central banks during the past year; the second
part focuses on communication concerning the provision of liquidity during
the turbulence.

Changes in monetary policy communication

Revised
communication
policy at the
Riksbank …

Several central banks modified their communication strategies during the year
under review in order to increase the public’s understanding of the reasoning
behind their monetary policy decisions. This continued the decade-long trend
towards greater central bank transparency.
In May 2007, well before tensions emerged in the money market, Sveriges
Riksbank announced that it would provide more information about the
reasoning behind its policy decisions. It would hold a press conference after
every monetary policy meeting – not only after changes in interest rates or the
publication of a Monetary Policy Report, as in the past – and in the minutes
would attribute remarks made during the meeting to individual members of the
Executive Board. Only a few months before, in February, the Riksbank had
decided to publish the Board’s projections on the future path of policy rates
(see the 77th Annual Report ). As part of its new communication strategy, the
Riksbank also decided to cease giving guidance on future interest rate moves
in speeches and press releases between meetings, as the newly provided
information was seen as making such communications unnecessary. However,
this last change was partly revised in May 2008 in the light of feedback from

BIS 78th Annual Report

65

market participants. While stopping short of preannouncing future policy moves,
the Riksbank decided that it would be useful to comment on new economic
developments and data releases in terms of how they affect its outlook.
Two other major modifications to communication frameworks – at the
Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia – were also in train well
before the financial tensions flared up. Central to the new communication
strategy of the Federal Reserve, announced in mid-November 2007, was the
release of the economic projections prepared independently by each FOMC
participant four times a year, rather than just twice. As in the past, the
projections would be prepared under the assumption of “appropriate” monetary
policy. The Federal Reserve would publish the range and central tendency of
these forecasts as well as some explanation of the underlying reasoning. The
forecast horizon of the projections was also extended to three calendar years
in order to convey to the public the FOMC participants’ evaluation of the longterm behaviour of the US economy. Notably, this extension could give a
clearer idea of the level of inflation that FOMC participants thought consistent
with the dual objective of maximum employment and price stability. In the
event, the range of 1.6–1.9% for PCE inflation in 2010, indicated by the central
tendency of the October forecasts, was largely in line with market participants’
prior beliefs about the FOMC’s inflation objective.
The new communication strategy of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
unveiled in December 2007, involved the publication of an explanation of
interest rate decisions, even when rates remained unchanged, as well as the
release of minutes of the Board meetings on monetary policy. Until then, the
Reserve Bank had refrained from explaining no-change decisions since such
decisions often (but not always) meant that the Bank had no new information to
impart. In the light of the experiences in other countries, however, it decided
that the benefits of publishing no-change statements would outweigh the
associated risks.
The increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and economic
growth during the period under review also led to some changes in
communication tactics at some major central banks. As uncertainty about the
outlook increased, central banks found it more difficult or less desirable to
provide guidance on likely future interest rate decisions. For example, the ECB
Governing Council left rates unchanged at its September 2007 meeting even
though the President had used the term “strong vigilance” in his press
conference after the meeting the previous month. The use of this term had
infallibly foreshadowed each of the increases in policy rates since 2005. In the
United States, the Federal Reserve ceased giving an explicit assessment of the
balance of risks in the statement released after the December 2007 meeting
of the FOMC in view of the high degree of uncertainty associated with
the economic outlook and also provided no such assessment in statements
following subsequent meetings.

the situation closely and would take appropriate steps. Statements along these
lines were issued by the ECB and the Bank of Canada on 9 August, for
example. Such communications can be more beneficial than actually providing
funds if they serve to increase market participants’ confidence that the situation
is under control.
The joint communiqués issued by a number of central banks in
December 2007 and in March and May 2008 elicited positive, albeit shortlived, market responses. As well as specifying the measures that individual
central banks would take, they demonstrated the central banks’ willingness
and ability to take coordinated action in response to the turmoil. One
challenge for central bank communication in response to a financial crisis is
the possibility that extraordinary actions will be interpreted by the public as
an indication that the situation in a particular country is worse than had been
feared. By issuing joint communiqués, central banks may have reduced this
“negative signalling” risk, since joint actions do not highlight conditions in
any specific currency area.
Central bank communication was also motivated, in part, by a need to
explain central bank operating procedures, in particular when innovative
facilities were put in place. Another challenge was to convince the public that,
taken by themselves, extraordinary liquidity operations did not represent a
change in the stance of monetary policy. On the contrary, all central banks
involved were very careful to distinguish between setting interest rates on the
one hand, and policies designed to redistribute reserves and improve market
liquidity – the subject of the next section – on the other.

Central bank operations in response to the financial turmoil
The turmoil
necessitated
adjustments to
operations

Central banks adjusted their monetary policy operations in a number of
extraordinary and unprecedented ways in response to the financial turmoil that
flared up in August 2007 (Table IV.2). When the tensions spilled over into the
interbank money market in the middle of the month, the demand for central
bank reserves in the economies affected became more volatile and less
predictable. This made it appreciably harder for central banks to implement a
given monetary policy stance through standard open market operations and
standing facilities, the main instruments for day-to-day policy implementation.
Moreover, term interbank markets, which play a key role in the financial system
and the monetary transmission mechanism, came under pressure as investors
became hesitant to place funds in unsecured money markets at anything other
than the shortest horizons. Finally, liquidity deteriorated in many secured
funding markets, including, in March 2008, dollar-denominated short-term
repurchase agreements. This made it difficult for institutions to finance their
holdings of what had become highly illiquid assets. All of these developments
called for, and were to some extent amenable to, central bank intervention.
This section discusses, in turn, how central banks adjusted their reserve
management operations in order to maintain control of overnight interest
rates, the steps they took to replace impaired sources of funding, and some
issues raised by central banks’ responses to the turmoil.

Table IV.2

Reserve management
As discussed in Chapter VII, the financial turmoil made banks both highly
uncertain of their future funding needs and far less confident of their ability to
meet potential needs quickly because of illiquidity in money markets. Banks
thus became much more cautious in their liquidity management. As a result,
the demand for central bank reserves became more volatile and less
predictable.
Central banks implement monetary policy through regular short-term
market transactions designed to keep the supply of reserves (deposits of
banks at the central bank) near the level demanded by banks, thereby keeping
reference market rates near policy targets. As the unstable demand for
reserves made it more difficult to accurately project the necessary supply,
central banks made compensating adjustments to their reserve-providing
operations. The Reserve Bank of Australia, the Bank of Canada, the ECB, the
Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, the Federal Reserve and, from
September, the Bank of England conducted market operations that were either
outside their regular schedule or in larger than usual amounts, and took other
steps to equilibrate demand and supply for central bank reserves at the policy
rate. For example, as the turmoil began, the ECB and the Federal Reserve
modified their operations in response to sharp upward pressure on overnight
rates amidst profound uncertainty about the demand for reserves. In its first
operation in response to the turmoil, on 9 August, the ECB took the unusual
step of meeting all demand at its policy rate of 4%. On 10 August, the Federal
Reserve held three separate auctions of overnight repurchase agreements,

with the final auction occurring in the early afternoon, well after its usual
operating time.
In most cases, central banks did not inject more reserves than were
needed to maintain reference rates near policy rates. In all regions significantly
affected by the turmoil, banks’ demand for overall precautionary holdings of
liquid instruments went up, but the extent to which that resulted in increased
demand for central bank balances specifically depended on the opportunity
cost of such balances. In the United States, where no interest is paid on
reserve balances, and in the euro area, where deposits beyond minimum
requirements are remunerated at 100 basis points below the policy rate, the
demand for central bank reserves did not rise appreciably and net injections
were in nearly every case fairly quickly reversed. The main exception was the
early August maintenance period in the United States, where for a few days
reserves were not drained and the federal funds rate averaged well below the
target rate. By contrast, at the Bank of England, where target reserve balances
are set by the individual banks in advance and are remunerated at the policy
rate, balances went up substantially starting with the September maintenance
period. At the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada, where
deposit rates are only 25 basis points below the policy rate, deposits rose, but
only by modest amounts.
Almost all central banks have standing loan facilities that extend
collateralised loans to banks at a rate above the policy rate. These facilities
can serve multiple purposes. One is to act as a backstop to open market
operations in the implementation of monetary policy. Borrowing at the facility
injects additional reserves on demand and so the lending rate tends to be a
cap on the overnight interbank rate. Another role is to provide funds to
institutions that are experiencing idiosyncratic account management problems.
Yet another is to supply liquidity to institutions temporarily unable to raise funds
but otherwise sound. A final role, typically fulfilled by a separate facility, is to
provide funds necessary to work out the resolution of a troubled institution.
In the event, only the Federal Reserve eased the terms on its standing
loan facility (the primary credit facility) in response to the turmoil. It narrowed
the spread between the interest rate on the facility – the “discount rate” – and
its policy rate from 100 to 50 basis points in August, and then to 25 basis
points in March 2008. It also extended the allowable maturity on the loans from
overnight to 30 and then to 90 days. The changes were designed to give banks
greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding. The narrower
spread was intended to reduce the degree to which any transitory tightness in
the interbank market would drive up the federal funds rate, while the longer
allowable maturity made these loans a closer substitute for term money market
credit, which had become increasingly scarce.
However, the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s standing loan facility,
both for putting a cap on overnight rates and for relieving term money market
pressures, was greatly reduced by banks’ unwillingness to borrow from it. Even
though information on individual discount window borrowing is not released
to the public, banks appear to have been concerned that their borrowing could
have become known and then taken as an indication of financial difficulties.

at rates many percentage points above the discount rate (Graph IV.5). In the
United Kingdom, too, there were anecdotal reports that bilateral trades took
place at elevated rates, particularly after the provision of emergency liquidity
assistance to a distressed mortgage lender, Northern Rock, in September (see
Chapter VII). In contrast, “stigma” was less of an issue in the euro area,
perhaps because borrowing under the ECB’s marginal lending facility has
historically been seen as unexceptional. Thus, in the euro area there were no
reported interbank trades at higher rates.

Replacing impaired sources of funding
In part, the steps taken to keep overnight rates near policy targets were
intended not only to implement the monetary policy stance, but also to address
the relative supply shortfall in term money markets. Specifically, financial
institutions might be more inclined to lend term funds if they were confident of
financing the term loans at reasonable rates in the overnight market. Moreover,
they would bid less aggressively for term funds if they considered overnight
funds to be a reliable substitute.
As the turmoil unfolded, however, the focus of central banks’ efforts to
alleviate the pressures in term money markets shifted towards providing term
funding directly. For instance, the ECB and the Swiss National Bank conducted
supplementary three-month financing operations beginning in August and
September, respectively, and the ECB added six-month tenders beginning in
April. Starting in December, the Bank of England offered three-month tenders
in larger amounts than normal and the Federal Reserve extended one-month
loans to sound institutions under its new Term Auction Facility (TAF). These
operations significantly increased longer-term reverse (loan or repo) operations
as a proportion of all reverse operations at these central banks (Graph IV.6).

Graph IV.6

Central bank operations re-established control over reference rates and
helped ease pressures in term money markets in large part by addressing the
poor distribution of reserves resulting from the reduced functioning of the
interbank market. In several cases, central banks widened the range of eligible
collateral, and in some cases extended the list of counterparties with whom
they transact, making it possible for market participants to finance instruments
whose markets faced severe dislocation. The Bank of Canada decided in
August to accept temporarily as collateral for its market operations all
securities that were already eligible for its standing liquidity facility. In
September and October, the Reserve Bank of Australia extended the list of
collateral eligible for its regular operations and its overnight repo facility to
include a broader range of bank paper, as well as residential mortgage-backed
securities and asset-backed commercial paper. Starting in September, the
Bank of England offered the first of four special three-month tenders against a
wider range of collateral than normal and to a broader set of counterparties.
In December, it also expanded the range of collateral it accepted in its regular
three-month operations. Also in December, the Federal Reserve’s TAF
provided market-priced funding to depository institutions against discount
window collateral, thus effecting a significant widening of the eligible
counterparties and collateral relative to the Federal Reserve’s other open
market operations.
The TAF was one of many central bank actions undertaken by the central
banks from five currency areas (the Bank of Canada, ECB, Swiss National
Bank, Federal Reserve and Bank of England) following a joint announcement
on 12 December. Another was the establishment of currency swap lines
between the Federal Reserve, on the one hand, and the ECB and the Swiss
National Bank, on the other. The latter two central banks used the lines to
finance regular auctions of term dollar funding in their own jurisdictions. The
proceeds helped banks in the euro area and Switzerland meet their dollar
funding needs, which they had found more difficult because of a dislocation
in the forex swap market (see Chapter V). European banks’ desire to secure

BIS 78th Annual Report

71

dollar funding early in the US trading session had resulted in considerable
upward pressure on overnight rates in the morning, complicating the Federal
Reserve’s efforts to implement its policy stance. After the initiation of the dollar
auctions, those pressures dissipated for a while. The auctions by the European
central banks of term dollar funds continued through January, but were
suspended in February when market conditions seemed to improve.
The respite was short-lived, however. In mid-March, financial market
conditions deteriorated further, and central banks took a number of
additional steps to fund illiquid assets held by financial institutions. The
Federal Reserve raised the amount of TAF financing substantially and
extended the maximum maturity of its repos from two weeks to one month.
Furthermore, the same central banks that had taken coordinated measures
in December made a joint announcement of additional initiatives. The
transatlantic swap lines were increased in size, and the ECB and Swiss
National Bank renewed their auctions of dollar loans. Moreover, the Federal
Reserve initiated a new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), which allowed
primary dealers (the 20 or so large securities dealers that participate in open
market operations) to borrow Treasury securities from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York in exchange for certain less liquid securities, including some
highly rated private mortgage-backed securities that were not eligible for open
market operations.
Over the following days, the Federal Reserve used its authority to lend to
non-depository institutions for the first time since the 1930s. First, on 14 March,
it provided financing to facilitate the acquisition of investment bank Bear
Stearns, which was on the brink of bankruptcy, by JPMorgan Chase. Then, on
Sunday 16 March, it established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF),
which provides overnight loans at the discount rate to primary dealers against
a list of highly rated private and public securities. The facility was designed
to make it easier for primary dealers to supply financing (via repos) to
participants in markets for securitised products. While the TAF had extended a
type of open market operation to the institutions with access to the discount
window, the PDCF extended a standing loan facility to those institutions that
participate in open market operations. In consequence, the two new facilities
moved the Federal Reserve’s operational framework in the direction of
offering both market operations and standing facilities to the same, broad set
of institutions and against a more uniform set of collateral.
In mid-April, the Bank of England also introduced a securities swap
arrangement in an effort to help improve the liquidity position of banks
burdened with an overhang of now illiquid assets. Specifically, the Bank
introduced a Special Liquidity Scheme – a facility through which banks could
swap high-quality but temporarily illiquid assets for UK Treasury bills. The
swaps were made available for any period within a six-month window and with
maturities extending up to three years. And in early May, there was another
joint announcement by the major central banks. The transatlantic swap lines
and associated dollar auctions were again increased in size, and the Federal
Reserve widened the list of securities it accepts in the TSLF to include other
types of highly rated asset-backed securities.

At present, it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of central bank
operations in response to the financial turmoil. Central banks were able to
contain the pickup in volatility in targeted market interest rates despite the
less predictable demand for reserves and the reduced effectiveness of some
standing loan facilities for putting a cap on rates. But term money market
spreads remain very high by historical standards, even after allowing for some
upward adjustment from what may have been unjustifiably low levels prior to
the turmoil. Some of the elevation in spreads no doubt reflects counterparty
credit concerns, which cannot be allayed on a broad scale by central bank
interventions. However, term spreads have stayed elevated even while credit
spreads for financial institutions have narrowed. This suggests that concerns
about liquidity have not been wholly overcome, even by the unprecedented
central bank actions to date.

Issues raised by central banks’ response to the financial market turmoil
There are costs to
intervention …

… and also
benefits …

When deciding whether or not to intervene to address a financial crisis, central
banks must confront a trade-off, since interventions carry costs as well as
benefits. Some of these costs may be direct financial costs, such as those
incurred when providing an ex post guarantee to institutions or investors.
Others, which are arguably more important in the longer term, are related to
the moral hazard associated with intervention: the possibility that market
participants will take on more risk, increasing the likelihood and possible costs
of future interventions, once they know that central banks will intervene to
support them.
Different types of central bank actions entail different degrees of moral
hazard and financial costs. Among the steps taken during the recent turmoil,
more active reserve management within existing frameworks, designed to keep
reference market rates near policy targets, most likely entailed the least
moral hazard. Expanding collateral and counterparty lists probably involved a
relatively greater degree of moral hazard and some financial risks, although the
former should in principle have been contained to some extent by conducting
the related operations for the most part as market transactions with prices
determined in auctions. With respect to financial risk, the pool of collateral
pledged to central banks did become somewhat riskier and less liquid, but any
increase in risk to the central banks is likely to have been modest, in part
because of the larger haircuts applied to riskier or less liquid assets when
determining the amount of credit the central bank is willing to provide against
them. The moral hazard consequences were probably the greatest in the case
of the loans provided to help resolve troubled institutions. Typically, in such
circumstances, central banks seek to impose costs on shareholders, creditors
and management that are as high as possible while allowing the institution to
stay open. Inevitably, though, the costs to shareholders and creditors are lower
than they would have been if there had been a disorderly failure.
The principal benefit of intervening is that it can prevent or mitigate
a developing financial crisis. Financial crises can result in a significant
curtailment of credit availability and deterioration in business and household
confidence. The ensuing declines in economic activity, employment and

BIS 78th Annual Report

73

wealth substantially reduce social welfare. Calculating this benefit requires an
assessment not only of the possible costs avoided, but also of the odds that
potential intervention strategies will be effective.
Another benefit of certain types of central bank action to stem a financial
crisis is that it may help reduce the eventual need for other kinds of actions
that entail even greater moral hazard or financial costs. For example, early and
aggressive steps to inject liquidity using market transactions may make
emergency assistance in the form of loans later on unnecessary.
It may not be possible to calculate very precisely in real time the likely
costs and benefits of particular actions in response to what is often a rapidly
evolving situation. In the end, decisions will call for a substantial amount of
judgment. Even so, defining objectives in advance and delineating the
prospective costs and benefits of acting are important preparatory steps that
can help to structure and facilitate even the most expeditious decision-making.
Recent interventions to promote the smooth functioning of term money
markets and repo markets could also engender the view that central banks will
intervene to support other markets or institutions in similar situations of
financial distress in the future. This view could further increase moral hazard.
Public clarity from central banks about their objectives and principles for
dealing with financial market disruptions could help limit such “mission
creep”. Preplanning exit strategies from extraordinary operations might also be
helpful.
It is certain that the next financial crisis will have characteristics that are
unexpected and will require some central bank responses that cannot be
prepared in advance. Hence, it will probably not be possible to design
operational frameworks that include a complete set of contingency
arrangements. To some extent, successful management of financial crises will
depend on central banks preserving their capacity to innovate. In this regard,
maintaining strong contacts with market participants, good channels of
communication with other financial agencies and central banks and a well
informed staff will be important in ensuring that information on new situations
can be rapidly collected, shared and understood.

V. Foreign exchange markets

Highlights
Foreign exchange markets experienced a substantial increase in volatility in
August 2007 as a consequence of significant dislocations in other financial
markets. This marked an important change in the factors driving market
developments. Prior to August, historically low volatility and large interest rate
differentials had underpinned cross-border capital flows that put downward
pressure on funding currencies, such as the yen and the Swiss franc, and
supported high-yielding currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars. Subsequently, as a result of the heightened volatility, leveraged crosscurrency carry trades were unwound, which led to some reversal of the
previous exchange rate trends for the currencies involved.
In addition, there was a substantial reassessment of expected monetary
policy actions as the dimensions of the problems in financial markets became
more apparent. In this environment, factors such as expected growth
differentials, which have an important bearing on the future path of monetary
policy, became more of a focal point for market sentiment than the prevailing
level of interest rates. Heightened expectations of a recession and worsening
credit market conditions in the United States intensified the depreciating trend
in the US dollar in the early part of 2008, with the dollar reaching a 12-year low
against the yen as well as all-time lows against the euro and the Swiss franc.
Deteriorating growth prospects for the United Kingdom towards the end of 2007
also led to a significant depreciation of sterling. In contrast, a number of other
currencies were buoyed by expectations of continued strong economic
growth. For some emerging market economies, such as China and Singapore,
appreciation pressures stemmed from strong domestic demand and limited
direct exposure to the turmoil in global financial markets. In other cases, such
as Australia and Brazil, currency strength was underpinned by robust
commodity exports and improvements in the terms of trade.
Notwithstanding some significant exchange rate movements, foreign
exchange spot markets generally continued to function smoothly throughout
the period of higher volatility. At the same time, there were signs of strain in
some foreign exchange swap and cross-currency swap markets, which are
more closely related to credit markets and cross-border funding. This suggests
that while certain longer-term developments, such as the broadening of the
investor base and improved risk management, are likely to have made foreign
exchange markets more robust, the close relationship between certain
segments of foreign exchange markets and other financial markets can leave
the former susceptible to shocks emanating from the latter.

Developments in foreign exchange markets
The dislocations in credit and money markets that unfolded over the course of
July and August 2007 led to significant changes in the exchange rate trends
that had prevailed in much of 2006 and in the first half of 2007. These changes
were accompanied by a sharp pickup in volatility in many currency pairs.
After June 2007, the steady depreciation of the US dollar quickened.
During 2006 and the first six months of 2007, the US dollar had depreciated
against the euro at an annualised rate of 9% and appreciated marginally
against the yen (Graph V.1). Between the beginning of July 2007 and the end
of April 2008, the annualised rate of depreciation increased to around 20%
against both currencies. In nominal effective terms, the rate of depreciation
more than doubled (Graph V.2). Similarly, sterling depreciated by almost 15% in
effective terms between July 2007 and April 2008. Other currencies, such as the
Russian rouble, depreciated steadily in nominal effective terms over this period.
In contrast, a number of other currencies appreciated in effective terms in
the second half of 2007 and into 2008. Most notably, the annualised rate of
appreciation of the euro more than doubled after August 2007 (Graph V.2).
Mid-2007 also marked a turning point for the yen and the Swiss franc. Having
depreciated in 2006 and the first half of 2007, these currencies appreciated
over the 10 months to April 2008 by 15% and 9%, respectively. Several Asian
currencies, including the renminbi, Singapore dollar, New Taiwan dollar and
Thai baht, also rose markedly in the first four months of 2008.
Some currencies experienced sizeable fluctuations between mid-2007
and April 2008. A few, such as the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real,
depreciated sharply in mid-August 2007 in the wake of the problems in
international money markets, only to recover lost ground over the following
couple of months (Graph V.2). Others, such as the New Zealand dollar, made
only modest gains following sharp falls in August. Finally, some currencies
that had proved to be relatively resilient in August, including the Canadian
dollar, Indian rupee, Korean won and South African rand, depreciated more
substantially between November 2007 and April 2008.

Graph V.2

From a longer-term perspective, many currencies are currently at levels
that are significantly different from their long-term averages in real effective
terms (Graph V.3). In April 2008, the euro and New Zealand dollar were over
10% higher than their long-term averages, while the yen, Hong Kong dollar,
Swedish krona and US dollar were more than 10% below theirs. In general,
more structural estimates from the IMF of where real exchange rates stand
relative to medium-term equilibrium levels provide a broadly similar picture.
Notable exceptions are currencies such as the Australian and Canadian
dollars, which are likely to be less overvalued than suggested by Graph V.3
due to the positive effects of strong terms of trade on equilibrium exchange
rates, and the US dollar, whose depreciation is qualitatively consistent with
the large and persistent US current account deficit.

Conditions in foreign exchange markets
Volatility increased
sharply …

Volatility in foreign exchange markets started to pick up in July 2007, having
trended down to historical lows in the first half of the year. Implied volatility
rose sharply on three occasions – in mid-August and late November 2007 and
in mid-March 2008 – and also experienced a more muted increase at the end
of January 2008 (Graph V.4). These peaks coincided with, but were less
pronounced than, the peaks in volatility in other financial markets. In contrast
to previous experience, the implied volatility of major advanced industrial

Graph V.3

country exchange rates consistently exceeded that of emerging market
exchange rates from the beginning of August 2007 onwards.
Implied volatility peaked in March 2008 for a number of currency pairs. For
the US dollar/euro exchange rate, implied volatility reached a level comparable
to the episode of heightened foreign exchange market volatility in September
2001, while volatilities for the dollar/yen and euro/yen were higher than at any
point since 1999 (Graph V.1). Other currencies that experienced particularly
sharp increases in implied volatility against the US dollar include the Brazilian
real, the South African rand and the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand
dollars. The peaks for these last three currency pairs are comparable to those
seen in October 1998, during the period of volatility associated with the
collapse of LTCM and the Russian default.
The pickup in volatility was accompanied by higher turnover in the
foreign exchange spot market. Turnover of spot transactions executed on the
electronic broking platform EBS, which accounts for over 60% of the spot
interbank market, peaked at $456 billion on 16 August 2007. This compares
with an average daily turnover of $182 billion in 2007. Data on foreign
exchange settlement values from CLS Bank (CLS), through which final
settlement of a large share of all foreign exchange transactions is executed,
also show a distinct peak in August 2007, particularly for the yen and the
Australian and New Zealand dollars – currencies prominent in carry trades. The
increase in turnover does not appear to have been evenly distributed across
currency pairs, however. Data from EBS, for example, are dominated by a
disproportionately large increase in turnover in the dollar/yen and euro/yen
during the week beginning 13 August.
Sustained high levels of turnover and the absence of any significant
widening of bid-ask spreads suggest that liquidity in the spot market for major
currency pairs was not impaired by the dislocations in other financial markets.
There were, however, more apparent distortions in the foreign exchange swap
markets. Bid-ask spreads in these markets widened noticeably at times of
heightened volatility, and US interest rates derived from foreign exchange

Graph V.4

swap prices deviated significantly from actual US dollar Libor (Graph V.4; see
Chapter VI). Settlement data from CLS suggest that foreign exchange swap
activity in some currency pairs, such as sterling and the New Zealand dollar
against the US dollar, fell steadily over the second half of 2007. For most
other currency pairs, foreign exchange swap activity was roughly stable in
the period under review. These developments are consistent with available
turnover data for the United Kingdom and the United States.
Similarly, tensions also became apparent in the market for cross-currency
swaps. These instruments are similar to foreign exchange swaps but are more
liquid at maturities longer than one year and involve the swapping of interest
payments as well as principal in different currencies. They are important for
institutions that want to hedge longer-term offshore funding. Cross-currency
swap prices for a number of currency pairs moved sharply during certain
periods of heightened volatility. Prices for the euro/dollar and sterling/dollar
pairs at the one-year tenor and above, for example, swung abruptly into
negative territory from the end of August 2007 onwards, indicating a sharp
increase in demand for longer-term US dollar funding.
The fact that foreign exchange swap and cross-currency swap markets
experienced some spillover from the financial market turmoil is not entirely
surprising given that transactions in these instruments are closely linked to
the money market and are subject to counterparty risk. Indeed, the tensions
observed in these two markets were consistent with a pickup in demand for
US dollar funding. This may have been attributable in part to efforts by
non-US financial institutions to obtain US dollar liquidity by swapping into
US dollars from other currencies. Thus, the tensions largely reflected the rapid

79

deterioration in money market conditions associated with the global credit
market turmoil.

Determinants of exchange rate movements
Against the backdrop of increased financial market volatility and heightened
uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook, the main forces driving
exchange rate dynamics shifted. In particular, the role of prevailing interest
rate differentials diminished as uncertainty regarding exchange rate trends
undermined the attractiveness of carry trades, and attention moved towards
expected growth differentials as well as more structural factors, such as current
account positions. While exchange rate policies continued to shape the
behaviour of some emerging market currencies, developments in commodity
prices and specific trends in capital flows also exerted a considerable influence
on exchange rates.

Interest rate and growth differentials
In the early part of 2007, the persistence of historically low volatility sustained
the focus on prevailing interest rate differentials and carry trades as a major
driver of exchange rate developments. In this environment, funding currencies
such as the yen and the Swiss franc experienced downward pressure, while
high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars
appreciated. Because the term “carry trade” has been used very loosely in
popular discussion, it is important to stress that it refers strictly to leveraged
trades that exploit large interest rate differentials across currencies and low
exchange rate volatility by betting on the failure of uncovered interest parity.
In practice, carry trades are typically implemented through a combination of
foreign exchange spot and swap transactions to obtain a “synthetic” forward
position that is long the high-yielding currency and short the low-yielding
currency. This is done synthetically, rather than through an outright forward
position, largely for liquidity reasons. Importantly, such trades are leveraged
because they do not involve any cash outlay up front.
The abrupt dislocations in major financial markets that started in August,
and intensified in November, severely curtailed the viability of carry trades. As
the broad-based repricing of risk and precipitous drop in risk appetite led to
dramatic price falls across a large spectrum of financial assets, exchange rate
volatility increased and several currencies involved in carry trades experienced
a sharp reversal of previous trends. These developments are consistent with
changes in simple indicators of the attractiveness of carry trades such as the
carry-to-risk ratio, which measures interest rate differentials adjusted for the
expected risk implied by currency options. These indicators fell substantially
from July onwards for the currency pairs most associated with carry trades,
largely reflecting the upward spike in implied volatilities documented in the
previous section (Graph V.5).
While there are no direct data on the size of carry trades, because for the
most part they involve off-balance sheet exposures, indirect evidence suggests
that substantial unwinding of these strategies took place in the second half of

in mid-August, the unwinding of carry trades did not lead to major dislocations
in foreign exchange spot markets as some had feared. Indeed, while the yen
did appreciate substantially starting in the latter half of 2007, the Australian
dollar, which had been a prime target currency, continued to appreciate
despite an initial sharp depreciation (Graph V.2).
As carry trades became less attractive, prevailing interest rate differentials
became less of a focal point for market participants. Indeed, the best
performing major currencies in the first three months of 2008 in nominal
effective terms were the two lowest-yielding currencies, namely the yen and
Swiss franc (Graph V.6). Attention shifted instead to other factors, such as
growth differentials, that provide information about the future path of monetary
policy, which became increasingly uncertain. Notably, despite the extraordinary
monetary easing that took place in the United States in January 2008, the US
dollar initially displayed surprising resilience and only came under renewed
downward pressure as market sentiment regarding prospects for economic
growth dimmed markedly in February. The rapid depreciation of sterling
towards the end of 2007, and again in March 2008, was also associated with
downward reassessments of economic growth.

Current account positions

Greater risk aversion also prompted a renewed focus on current account
balances. Among the major economies, the United States and the United
Kingdom, both of which have sizeable current account deficits, experienced a
substantial weakening of their currencies in the early part of 2008. In addition,
several small, high-deficit countries such as Hungary, Iceland, South Africa and

Turkey faced significant downward pressure on their currencies as the financial
market turmoil intensified at the end of 2007 (Graph V.6). This suggests that
investors may have been more reluctant to fund the external borrowing of
countries deemed to be vulnerable to capital flow reversals in an environment
of higher volatility and lower risk appetite. Given that many of these countries
also had high interest rates, the downward pressure on their currencies may,
to some extent, have reflected an unwinding of carry trade positions. From a
broader perspective, developments in the major currencies during the period
under review – particularly the depreciation of the US dollar and appreciation of
the yen – are consistent with a narrowing, or at least a stabilisation, of global
imbalances (Graph V.6).

Exchange rate policy
Exchange rate intervention by central banks continued to exert an important
influence over a number of currencies. Official foreign exchange reserves
expanded by over $1.3 trillion in 2007, a markedly faster pace than in the
previous year (Table V.1). The bulk of the increase continued to be
concentrated in Asia, in particular China, but the rate of accumulation more
than doubled in Latin America, driven primarily by a very sharp rise in Brazilian
reserves. Russia, along with several other oil-exporting countries, also
continued to register large increases in reserves. Current account surpluses
and sustained capital inflows were again the key forces driving reserve
accumulation in emerging market economies, with countries in Latin America,
in particular, experiencing a substantial influx of capital in the second half of
2007 (see Chapter III). Despite this growth in reserves, the exchange rates of
those countries that undertook some of the most sizeable intervention, namely
China and Brazil, still appreciated notably (Graph V.2).

… but at more
apparent financial
and economic costs

Table V.1

With the US dollar depreciating considerably, the costs associated with an
exchange rate regime tied closely to that currency became more apparent. This
fuelled speculation about a possible change in the exchange rate policies
pursued by a number of countries. Particular attention was focused on the
Gulf states, where the persistent decline in the US dollar, and the associated
loosening of monetary conditions that this entailed, reinforced the effects of
large gains in these countries’ terms of trade and contributed to rising inflation.
In May 2007, Kuwait abandoned its US dollar peg, which had been in place
since 2003, and moved to tracking a basket of currencies. By the end of April
2008, the Kuwaiti dinar had appreciated by 8% against the US dollar but
remained relatively stable in nominal effective terms. Subsequent speculation

BIS 78th Annual Report

83

focused on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar as the most
likely candidates to follow suit (Graph V.7). There were strong price pressures
in these economies, and high-ranking officials in the latter two countries made
statements indicating that a possible adjustment to the exchange rate regime
was under study. At the same time, China recorded its highest rate of inflation
in over 11 years and the renminbi posted fresh highs against the US dollar,
encouraging speculation that China might be sanctioning a faster rate of
appreciation of its currency (Graph V.7). Sharp reductions in US interest rates
and the accelerated depreciation of the US dollar also increased the financial
costs of reserve accumulation. This contributed further to the perception that
central banks might face pressure to curtail intervention activity.
Against this backdrop, market analysts also highlighted the possibility of
major reallocations of official foreign reserves away from the US dollar. While
net official inflows into the United States are small relative to net private
inflows, they can be significant because of their potential to act as an anchor
for private sector expectations (Graph V.7). Thus, news about prospective
shifts in official flows and stocks can sometimes move markets. That said, the
currency composition of foreign reserves tends to move gradually. IMF data on
the composition of foreign reserves show that in the fourth quarter of 2007 the
US dollar remained the dominant currency choice, accounting for roughly 64%
of total allocated reserves, a share essentially unchanged from that recorded
a year earlier.
Other notable developments in exchange rate policy were not directly
related to US dollar weakness. In Hungary, the central bank abandoned the
forint’s trading band against the euro in favour of a free float in February 2008.
After an initial spike reflecting the surprise nature of the move, the exchange
rate fell back somewhat before a subsequent rally left it roughly unchanged
against the euro at end-April 2008 compared to the start of the year. In
Thailand, the central bank in March 2008 lifted capital controls that had been

Trends in capital flows
The trend towards
international
diversification has
been strong …

… particularly in
Japan and the
United States

The trend towards increased international diversification of assets has
underpinned sizeable shifts in the pattern of capital flows across countries
over the past five years or so. Easier access to international investment
opportunities and greater emphasis on returns by investors in many countries
have contributed to a reduction in the extent to which domestic investors
overweight domestic assets in their portfolios, also known as “home bias”.
These forces continued to exert a significant influence on exchange rates in
the period under review.
While a precise estimate of the degree of home bias across countries is
hampered by a lack of data, proximate indications can be obtained by
examining trends in investor behaviour. The IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS) provides useful information about the evolution of
the international allocation of portfolio investments for a large number of
countries. It indicates that, for major market economies, the shares of foreign
equities and bonds relative to total equity and bond portfolios have been on
an upward trend since 2001 (Graph V.8). With respect to equity investments,
the shift towards greater allocation to foreign assets by residents of Japan and
the United States appears to have accelerated in recent years. More timely
data indicate that this trend continued into 2007, with the proportion of mutual
funds in Japan and the United States that invest in foreign assets remaining
on a firm upward path until mid-2007 (Graph V.9). Since the beginning of the
disruptions to financial markets, these shares appear to have stabilised rather
than reversed.

Graph V.9

In Japan, the purchase of foreign currency bonds by retail investors is
another striking example of this diversification trend. Issuance of these
securities, also known as uridashi bonds, has been driven by strong demand
among Japanese retail investors, especially for bonds denominated in highyielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars
(Graph V.9). Such investments continued to generate sustained capital
outflows from Japan in 2007, with a notable pickup in South African randdenominated uridashi bonds in the latter half of the year and into the early
part of 2008.
The pronounced expansion in the share of foreign asset holdings in Japan
and the United States may be partly a reflection of the fact that, historically,
the degree of home bias in these two countries has been relatively large. In the
case of the United States, the disproportionate focus on domestic assets in the
past may have been related to the exceptional depth and breadth of local
financial markets, which allowed significant diversification opportunities
without recourse to foreign assets. With respect to Japan, the fact that the
decline in home bias has taken place in conjunction with regulatory changes
such as the privatisation of the postal savings system, greater availability of
alternative investment vehicles and changes in demographic trends suggests
that foreign asset diversification was inhibited in part by structural factors.
More cyclical forces, such as the sustained appreciating trend of the yen in the
1980s and 1990s, which made overseas investment less profitable, are also
likely to have played a role. Indeed, the pickup in international diversification
has coincided with a period of prolonged yen weakness since 2004, as well as
exceptionally low domestic interest rates.
The trend towards increased international diversification has had a
significant effect on exchange rate movements. At the margin, the pickup in
outward investment by domestic residents is likely to have put downward
pressure on the respective national currencies. With respect to the US dollar,

however, the outsize weight of the United States in global financial markets
makes it likely that a reduction in home bias in other countries has been
associated with a disproportionately large increase in foreign investment in
US assets that counterbalanced increased outward investment by US residents,
leaving the net effect on the US dollar ambiguous.

Commodity prices
Strong commodity
prices supported
some currencies

The sharp run-up in commodity prices was a major driver of currency
movements for a number of countries in the period under review. Large
improvements in the terms of trade helped to support the currencies of
diversified commodity exporters such as Australia and Brazil. This was
particularly evident in the case of the Australian dollar, which remained strong
despite the substantial unwinding of carry trades that took place in the second
half of 2007. High oil prices also generally supported the currencies of energyexporting nations such as Canada and Norway, although the former
experienced some weakness towards the end of 2007 as its economic outlook
dimmed. While the Russian rouble reached its highest level in over nine years
against the US dollar in March 2008, it fell steadily in nominal effective terms
throughout 2007.

Resilience of the foreign exchange market – a longer-term perspective
As noted above, the impact of the extraordinary global financial market
turbulence during the period under review was not uniform across different
segments of the foreign exchange market. From a longer-term perspective,
there have been a number of notable developments that potentially have a
bearing on the resilience of foreign exchange markets. They include higher
turnover, greater diversity in foreign exchange market activity and
improvements in the risk management infrastructure.

Higher turnover and greater diversity of participants
Turnover has
grown considerably

Currency
composition has
become more
diverse

Turnover in the foreign exchange market has continued to expand rapidly in
recent years. Between 2001 and 2007, foreign exchange turnover across all
instruments increased on average by 18% per annum, to an average daily level
of $3.5 trillion (Table V.2). Spot transactions increased steadily at an annual
rate of 17% over the same period, while the market for foreign exchange
swaps saw tremendous growth, with turnover almost doubling between 2004
and 2007.
At the same time, the currency composition of foreign exchange turnover
has become more diversified. The most recent Triennial Central Bank Survey
of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity shows that the US dollar
continues to be the dominant currency in foreign exchange markets, being on
one side of around 86% of all foreign exchange transactions in April 2007.
However, the share of the three most traded currencies – the US dollar, euro
and yen – fell between 2001 and 2007. Currencies that experienced significant
increases in their share of turnover over this period include the Australian,
Hong Kong and New Zealand dollars and the Norwegian krone. More broadly,

the share of emerging market currencies, notably the renminbi and the Indian
rupee, also rose over the same period.
There have also been notable changes in the composition of participants
in foreign exchange markets. Data from the triennial survey show a marked
increase in the presence of non-reporting financial institutions, a category
which includes such entities as hedge funds, insurance companies and pension
funds (Table V.3). Between 2004 and 2007, the growth in this segment of the
market accounted for more than half of the rise in aggregate foreign exchange
turnover and almost half of that in spot transactions.
There are cyclical and structural explanations for this relatively rapid
growth in turnover with non-reporting financial institutions. On the cyclical side,
investor activity was encouraged up to 2007 by low volatility and exchange rate
trends, which generated attractive risk-adjusted returns in foreign exchange
markets over much of the past six-year period. The international diversification
of household portfolios discussed above is also likely to have been a
contributing factor, not just in terms of the initial diversifying purchase but
possibly also with regard to the hedging of foreign exchange risk on an
ongoing basis. In addition, there have been at least three significant structural
changes resulting not only in higher turnover, but also in greater diversity of
the participants that make up this segment.
First, there has been substantial growth in the prime brokerage business.
A prime broker, typically a large bank, provides its customers with a range of
services, including the ability to trade with counterparties – subject to credit
limits and collateralisation – in the prime broker’s name. This has enabled
customers, typically small financial institutions such as hedge funds, to use
the prime broker’s credit rating and thereby access liquidity at lower cost than
would otherwise have been possible. In return for accepting the customer’s
credit risk, prime brokers receive fee-based income and have more
opportunities to sell other products. Prime brokerage grew rapidly in the late
1990s and early 2000s and the industry has become more competitive, with

fees falling substantially. From the perspective of market depth, the growth in
this business has enabled hedge funds to participate more actively in foreign
exchange markets, although the recent financial market turbulence may have
curtailed the extent to which prime brokers make credit available to these
institutions.
Second, there has been a rapid expansion in the use of automated
trading, also known as algorithmic trading. Spurred by the emergence of
electronic trading systems, this has allowed some financial institutions, notably
hedge funds, to take advantage of new trading strategies, such as highfrequency trades. At the same time, many financial institutions have also been
able to use algorithmic trading strategies to increase efficiency. For example,
small spot trades can be diverted to “auto-trading engines”, freeing up human
traders to spend more time on complex trades, while hedging trades can be
automated to improve risk management. Estimates of the significance of
algorithmic trading range from over 20% for spot transactions, which are
relatively straightforward, to negligible for foreign exchange options, which
are less homogeneous. Most market commentary indicates that algorithmic
trading has been growing rapidly since 2005.
Third, the presence of retail investors has increased markedly, particularly
in the past five years or so. Some estimates suggest that retail foreign
exchange turnover has been growing by around 30% per annum, and now
accounts for about 2% of aggregate turnover and about 10% of spot
transactions outside the interbank market. Although there is significant retail
foreign exchange trading in the United States, much of the growth in this
segment in recent years has come from Asia, particularly Japan. The main
related innovation stems from retail aggregators, which provide sophisticated
web-based interfaces that enable their customers to trade foreign exchange
on a margin basis. Retail aggregators typically quote prices with relatively tight
spreads over wholesale rates: in the case of the US dollar/euro rate, spreads
can be as low as 2 pips. Many retail aggregators outsource liquidity provision

BIS 78th Annual Report

89

to a large wholesale foreign exchange bank in an arrangement known as “white
labelling”. As with algorithmic trading, advances in technology have played a
central role in enabling the development of this new market segment.

Improved risk management
Another key development in recent years has resulted from efforts to improve
the management of settlement risk in foreign exchange markets. In 1996, a
survey of settlement risk in foreign exchange transactions carried out by the
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) hosted by the BIS
had confirmed that some financial institutions faced foreign exchange
settlement exposures that were extremely large relative to capital. Given the
extent of the exposures and the size of the foreign exchange markets, this
situation was deemed to pose a significant risk to the global financial system.
In response, the G10 central banks set out a strategy to reduce foreign
exchange settlement risk calling for actions by individual banks, industry
groups and central banks.
An important outcome of this strategy was the creation of CLS in 2002 by
major private sector participants in foreign exchange markets. CLS provides
its members with a payment-versus-payment settlement service which, by
ensuring that the two currencies associated with a given foreign exchange
transaction achieve final settlement at the same time, eliminates the principal
risk that arises when one leg of the trade settles prior to the second leg,
as often occurs in traditional correspondent banking settlement. The value of
foreign exchange transactions settled through CLS has risen steadily over
time. A further survey conducted by the CPSS in April 2006 indicated that CLS
was being used to settle roughly 55% of foreign exchange obligations, and that
550 institutions had used CLS to settle trades in 15 currencies, either directly
as members of CLS or indirectly as third parties. The CPSS estimates that
settlement exposures would have been up to three times higher than reported
if other methods such as traditional correspondent banking had been used.
While this represents a major reduction in risk, substantial exposures
remain. Roughly 32% of foreign exchange related obligations settle through
traditional correspondent banking arrangements, with half of this value being
at risk overnight, not just intraday. Moreover, there is a potential risk of
backsliding, particularly in the face of changing trading patterns and cost
pressures, such as those arising from lower-value tickets resulting from
algorithmic trading. In the light of this assessment, the CPSS has
recommended a number of steps – direct action by individual institutions,
new services and education efforts from industry groups, and overall support
from central banks – to enable institutions to reduce and/or better control their
foreign exchange settlement exposures.

Implications for market resilience
The trends highlighted above have arguably contributed to the resilience
observed in the foreign exchange market to date, particularly in the spot
market. The continued expansion in turnover, to the extent that it is structural,
is likely to have added further to market liquidity, strengthening the market’s

ability to absorb large individual trades smoothly without a significant impact
on prices. At the same time, the increased diversity of participants, and the
associated heterogeneity of opinion that this might be expected to engender,
may have contributed to greater market depth. Finally, the reduction of credit
exposures generated in the course of the clearing and settlement of interbank
foreign exchange contracts is likely to have helped preserve market
participants’ willingness to enter into transactions, and thus to have provided
further depth to the market.
These developments notwithstanding, there are reasons to maintain
vigilance in monitoring developments in foreign exchange markets and to
sustain the impetus for better risk management practices. First, the fact that
the epicentre of the present turmoil was not the foreign exchange market, and
that those market segments most closely related to the turmoil have
experienced some disruptions, obviously calls for a degree of caution. Second,
the increased market depth arising from the entrance of new players, such as
highly leveraged institutions, as well as from the expansion of certain trading
techniques, particularly algorithmic trading, may not be without attendant
risks. It is possible, for instance, that a spike in risk aversion could lead a
majority of market participants to pull back at the same time, thus reducing
market liquidity and depth, especially in the context of leveraged trades. As
such, part of the observed increase in turnover may constitute “fair weather
liquidity” that contributes to market depth in good times but disappears under
stress. Finally, while the migration towards CLS has been smooth so far, the
system has yet to be fully tested by settlement problems emanating from a
major institution in the foreign exchange market.

VI. Financial markets

Highlights
During the period from June 2007 to mid-May 2008, concerns over losses on
US subprime mortgage loans escalated into widespread financial stress,
raising fears about the stability of banks and other financial institutions. What
initially appeared to be a contained problem quickly spread across other
credit segments and broader financial markets to the point where sizeable
parts of the financial system became largely dysfunctional. Surging demand
for liquidity, coupled with growing concerns about counterparty risk, led to
unprecedented pressures in major interbank markets, while bond yields in
advanced industrial economies tumbled as investors sought safe havens amid
fears that economic growth would weaken. Equity markets in advanced
industrial countries were also weak, with financial shares selling off particularly
sharply. A bright spot was emerging financial markets, which in contrast to
previous episodes of broad-based asset market weakness proved to be more
resilient than those in the advanced industrial economies.
The financial market turmoil unfolded in six stages, starting in mid-June
2007: (i) a dramatic widening of spreads on mortgage products following largescale rating downgrades on subprime mortgage-backed securities and the
closure of a number of hedge funds with subprime exposure; (ii) the extension
of the sell-off to a wide variety of credit and other markets from mid-July,
including structured products more generally; (iii) the expansion of the turmoil
into short-term credit and, particularly, interbank money markets from end-July;
(iv) broader problems for the financial sector from mid-October, including for
companies such as financial guarantors; (v) increasingly dysfunctional markets
against the backdrop of a marked worsening of the US macroeconomic
outlook from early 2008, accompanied by rising fears about systemic risks,
when spreads of even the highest-quality assets moved out to unusually wide
levels; (vi) recovery in the wake of the Federal Reserve-facilitated takeover of
a troubled US investment bank in March 2008.

Anatomy of the credit market turmoil of 2007–08
Global credit markets experienced a large-scale sell-off during the period under
review, as broad-based deleveraging combined with uncertainty about the
size and valuation of credit exposures. The chain of events started with what
appeared at first to be a relatively contained problem in the US subprime
mortgage sector, but quickly spread to other markets. In an environment of
rather accommodative financial conditions and elevated risk appetite, use of
credit derivatives and securitisation technology had aided the build-up of
substantial leverage in the financial system as a whole. When this leverage
started to be unwound in the face of subprime losses, price deterioration led to
margin calls and further deleveraging. With liquidity evaporating, valuations

The resulting retrenchment of positions across markets triggered a sharp and
disorderly repricing of risky assets that continued through much of the period.
In the process, credit spreads across markets widened markedly from the
unusually tight levels observed in early 2007 (Graph VI.1). Rising spreads
coincided with a substantial increase in volatilities implied by credit default
swap (CDS) index options (Graph VI.2, right-hand panel). After a spike early

observed since index inception in 2002–03, indicating heightened uncertainty
about shorter-run developments. Plummeting investor risk tolerance, in turn,
resulted in sharply rising risk premia for credit products (Graph VI.2, left-hand
and centre panels). The price of credit risk, as extracted from credit spreadimplied and empirical default probabilities of lower-quality borrowers, increased
markedly in June and July, and further into 2008.
Even though markets recovered somewhat late in the period under review,
credit spreads had risen by mid-May 2008 to levels comparable to the higher
range of those seen in earlier cycles, consistent with market perceptions of a
pronounced increase in default risk. In recent years, corporate default rates
had invariably come in below rating agencies’ forecasts, reaching low levels in
both relative and volume terms (Graph VI.3). However, in contrast to previous
years, the default correlations implied by tranched index products were
elevated, suggesting markets placed greater weight on the risks of a sudden
rise in default rates. The relative stability of implied forward spreads for the
medium and longer term, in turn, indicated that much of this added risk was
anticipated for the near term (Graph VI.1, centre and right-hand panels). At the
same time, at their widest levels in March 2008, high-yield CDS spreads had
remained some 250 basis points below the highest comparable cash market
spreads observed in September 2002. This, in combination with easy financing
conditions and known slippages in underwriting standards over recent years,
suggested room for renewed spread increases should the macroeconomic and
financial environment continue to deteriorate (Graph VI.3, right-hand panel).

2007
14–22 June

Rumours surface that two Bear Stearns-managed hedge funds invested in securities
backed by subprime mortgage loans have incurred heavy losses and that $3.8 billion
worth of bonds are up for sale to finance margin calls. News reports eventually confirm
that one of the funds is kept open through a loan injection, while the other is to be
liquidated.

10 –12 July

S&P places $7.3 billion worth of 2006 vintage ABS backed by residential mortgage loans
on negative ratings watch and announces a review of CDO deals exposed to such
collateral; Moody’s downgrades $5 billion worth of subprime mortgage bonds and
places 184 mortgage-backed CDO tranches on downgrade review. Fitch places 33
classes from 19 structured finance CDOs on credit watch negative.

30 July–
1 August

Germany’s IKB warns of subprime-related losses and reveals that its main shareholder,
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), has assumed its financial obligations from
liquidity facilities provided to an ABCP conduit exposed to subprime loans. A €3.5 billion
rescue fund is put together by KfW and a group of public and private sector banks.

31 July–
9 August

American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation announces its inability to fund
lending obligations and, one week later, files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Union
Investment, a German fund manager, stops withdrawals from one of its funds. Three
ABCP programmes, including one linked to American Home, extend the maturity of
their liabilities, the first ever such extensions. BNP Paribas freezes redemptions for
three investment funds, citing an inability to value them in the current environment.

9 –10 August

The ECB injects €95 billion of overnight liquidity into the interbank market, marking the
beginning of a set of extraordinary moves by the central bank community. The Federal
Reserve conducts three extraordinary auctions of overnight funds, injecting a total of
$38 billion, and issues a statement similar to that of the ECB.

13–17 September

Northern Rock, a UK mortgage lender, runs into liquidity problems, which eventually
trigger a bank run and the announcement of a deposit guarantee by the UK Treasury.

18 September–
4 November

Repeated writedowns and quarterly losses are reported by major financial
institutions. A number of high-profile CEOs leave their positions amid top management
reorganisations.

11– 23 October

Moody’s downgrades some 2,500 subprime bonds issued in 2006, followed by a
series of S&P subprime downgrades in the following days. S&P also puts 590 CDOs
on ratings watch negative and downgrades 145 tranches of CDOs worth $3.7 billion;
Moody’s downgrades 117 CDO tranches later in the same week, and Fitch places some
$37 billion worth of CDOs under review.

24 October–
5 November

Various financial guarantors announce third quarter losses; Fitch announces that it is
considering cutting the AAA rating of certain monoline insurers.

12 December

Central banks from five currency areas announce coordinated measures designed to
make turn-of-the year funding available to a larger number of institutions.

19 December

ACA, a financial guarantor rated A, is downgraded by S&P to CCC, triggering collateral
calls from its counterparties for which repeated waiver periods are negotiated during
the following months. S&P’s rating outlooks for other monolines are lowered from
stable to negative.

Weak purchasing managers’ data and labour market reports point to a marked
weakening in the US economy and trigger fears about global growth.

14 –31 January

The ECB, Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank carry out additional long-term
funding operations in US dollars.

15 January

Citigroup announces a fourth quarter loss, partly due to $18 billion of additional
writedowns on mortgage-related exposures, starting another string of similar news
from other financial institutions.

18– 31 January

Fitch downgrades Ambac, a monoline insurer, by two notches from AAA and later also
downgrades monolines SCA and FGIC to A and AA respectively. Some 290,000 insured
issues, mostly municipal bonds, are downgraded as a result. Later, S&P downgrades
FGIC to AA, and further rating actions by all three major rating agencies are taken on
the monolines in the following weeks.

21– 30 January

The Federal Reserve delivers a 75 basis point inter-meeting rate cut, following
broad-based global equity and credit market weakness. The policy rate is lowered by
another 50 basis points in the following week.

28 February –
7 March

Peloton Partners announces the closure of a $2 billion ABS fund and temporarily halts
redemptions from another fund, following margin calls by lenders. Thornburg
Mortgage admits delays in meeting margin calls on repo borrowings and eventually
defaults on such payments. Carlyle Group’s mortgage bond fund also fails to meet
margin calls, leading to a suspension of trading as investors force the sale of some of
the fund’s holdings. Pressures spread to European government bond markets, with
pronounced liquidity tiering across issuers and market segments.

7–16 March

The Federal Reserve announces an increase of $40 billion in the size of its new Term
Auction Facility and, a few days later, expands its securities lending activities through a
$200 billion Term Securities Lending Facility that lends Treasury securities against a
range of eligible assets. Later the same week, it announces a new Primary Dealer
Credit Facility that extends discount window-type borrowing to the primary dealer
community. Additional initiatives are announced by other central banks, including
renewed auctions of US dollar funds.

14 –17 March

Failure to roll over repo funds causes an acute liquidity shortage at Bear Stearns,
emergency discount window borrowing and a subsequent takeover by JPMorgan.

2006. However, this early sell-off of instruments exposed to mortgage credit
was partly reversed during subsequent months. By contrast, in June, with
evidence of a severe erosion in mortgage quality accumulating since 2006,
large-scale rating actions on subprime residential mortgage-backed securities
(RMBS) coincided with news about the imminent shutdown of two hedge
funds with large subprime exposures (Table VI.1). As the two funds were
forced to delever, concerns about distressed asset sales caused credit spreads
for subprime mortgage products to widen beyond their previous peaks
(Graph VI.4, left-hand panel).

Stage two: spillovers into other credit markets (mid- to end-July 2007)
… but quickly
spread across
markets …

… reflecting
uncertainties about
the size and
distribution of
losses …

While valuation losses on higher-rated exposures and instruments other than
residential mortgage products were initially quite limited, the sell-off spread
quickly during the second stage of the turmoil (Graph VI.4, left- and right-hand
panels). Increasingly, lenders felt inadequately protected in an environment of
rising volatility, leading to larger haircuts on RMBS, margin calls and more
broad-based deleveraging. Amid concerns about forced sales of better-quality
assets, mark to market losses mounted. As a result, the turmoil deepened
from mid-July and into August, affecting such sectors as leveraged loans
and commercial mortgages. As demand for loans and similar assets
from collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) dried up, numerous leveraged
buyout (LBO) deals had to be delayed or pulled from the market.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities faced similar strains, as evidenced by
indicators such as the CMBX index, possibly reflecting concerns about the
extent to which weakening underwriting standards in the residential sector
might have spread to the commercial mortgage business (Graph VI.4, righthand panel).
Uncertainties about the size and distribution of mortgage-related losses,
as well as the lags until their realisation, were among the key drivers of
market developments. With these uncertainties also came increased doubts
about the reliability of ratings for structured finance products and the impact
of the deterioration in mortgage quality on rating transitions. As mortgage
delinquencies accumulated, so did projected losses, implying loss rates on
recent-vintage subprime mortgage pools of 20% or higher, even under fairly
optimistic assumptions (Graph VI.5, left-hand panel). On this basis, investors
grew increasingly concerned about losses spreading along the securitisation
chain, for example on instruments such as CDOs that themselves resecuritise
mezzanine tranches of subprime mortgage deals. Projected losses on such

CDOs are quite sensitive to adverse changes in credit quality within the
underlying mortgage pools as well as in assumed loss severities, both of which
made it progressively likelier that the tranches included in the CDO pool might
be wiped out completely. Mortgage market deterioration and revised rating
agency assumptions thus translated into unprecedented rating transitions, in
terms of both scale and magnitude, for instruments backed by subprime
collateral (Graph VI.5, centre and right-hand panels).

Against this background, large parts of the investor community essentially
withdrew from structured assets altogether. Investors, particularly those
that had historically relied chiefly on ratings in their risk management and
investment decisions, started to question that reliance in the face of the
unexpected and growing wave of downgrades. Loss of confidence in structured
finance ratings, in turn, meant that demand for tranched credit products
collapsed from the high levels observed in recent years, aggravating the
decline in issuance volumes that had started early in the credit crisis
(Graph VI.6). Activity in single- and multi-name CDS, in contrast, held up
throughout the turmoil, with notional amounts growing by more than 35%
during the second half of 2007.

The third stage saw the credit market turmoil expand into short-term credit and
interbank money markets. The initial mortgage market correction had been
accommodated by the dealer community, which absorbed the affected assets
in the face of shrinking demand. As originators continued to feed new loans
into the securitisation pipeline, dealers withdrew, forcing the originators to
draw down bank lines for financing. Investors, in turn, began to focus more
closely on credit quality and valuation challenges in illiquid markets, and a
number of asset managers halted redemptions on investment funds.
As the crisis turned increasingly into one of asset valuation, investors
pulled out of the market and caused an unprecedented wave of involuntary
reintermediation. The first signs of the impending liquidity squeeze came in
the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, when issuers began to
encounter difficulties rolling over outstanding volumes. Pressures were
particularly intense for structures with less than complete liquidity support from
their sponsoring financial institutions, such as ABCP financing the asset pools
of structured investment vehicles (SIVs), or paper backed by assets linked to

many migrated back onto the balance sheets of their sponsors, adding to
banks’ securities holdings (Graph VI.7, left-hand and centre panels). As a
result, when nervousness about funding needs and banks’ conditional liabilities
intensified, liquidity demand surged, causing an outsize and protracted
disruption in interbank money markets that signalled the advent of a broader
financial market crisis.

Stage four: broad-based financial sector strains (September–November 2007)
Credit markets recovered temporarily in September, but experienced a new
bout of large-scale spread widening in October and November. The respite was
afforded in part by repeated central bank liquidity injections aimed at easing
the squeeze in money markets. Late September, in particular, saw a broad
upturn in credit markets, with the US Federal Open Market Committee’s
decision to cut the federal funds target by 50 basis points on 18 September
triggering a strong price reaction across all market segments. Adding to the
positive sentiment, sizeable write-offs announced by major commercial and
investment banks were seen as providing much needed transparency about
mortgage-related losses. Recovering demand for such exposures, in turn,
allowed banks to place some of their accumulated leveraged loan and bond
deals that were awaiting financing (Graph VI.6, left-hand panel; see Chapter
VII for more detail). However, sentiment worsened again from mid-October,
following another wave of downgrades of RMBS and CDO ratings and negative
financial sector news.
During this fourth stage of the turmoil, credit-related losses in the financial
sector turned out to be larger than expected, adding to uncertainties about
asset valuations and fears of broader economic weakness (see Chapter VII).
Large upward revisions of earlier writedown announcements, in particular,
triggered investor doubts about banks’ ability to appropriately value and
manage their exposures. Combined with renewed credit market weakness,
this suggested that even more losses could be about to materialise. One sign
of concern about related financial sector strains was the pricing of credit
protection against the default risk of banks and other financial institutions,
with spreads rising above the peaks they had reached during the summer
(Graph VI.8, left-hand panel).
Continued uncertainty about valuations was prompted in part by fears
about asset sales by structured vehicles and further mortgage market
deterioration. One factor was ratings-based and market value-related structural
provisions in CDOs and SIVs that seemed likely to force liquidations of
underlying collateral pools once deal-specific threshold levels were crossed.
Another factor was that losses on subprime exposures were increasingly
expected to eventually push through existing subordination layers (Graph VI.5,
left-hand panel), leading the more senior tranches of recent mortgage
securitisations to underperform lower-rated ones. Prices on the latter tranches,
in turn, started to reflect expectations of full writedown of tranche principal

by early 2010. While a further deterioration in mortgage fundamentals
subsequently accelerated these implied times-to-writedown, loss accumulation
was still expected to continue well into 2009 (Graph VI.4, centre panel).
In the process of these price adjustments, mortgage-related losses also
started to emerge outside the banking sector, particularly among monoline
financial guarantors, entities that specialise in writing insurance on a variety of
highly rated bonds and structured products. Widening credit spreads on senior
tranches of structured instruments had translated into mark to market losses
on the value of insurance the monolines had written on mortgage-backed
products. Anticipated increases in future claims thus caused CDS spreads of
the monolines to widen sharply in the fourth quarter and into the new year,
foreshadowing a string of negative rating actions on key monolines (Graph VI.8,
left-hand panel). Looming monoline downgrades, in turn, meant further
pressures on bank balance sheets arising from expected valuation changes for
credit insurance that had been provided on banks’ retained exposures to
senior CDO tranches, as well as from liquidity backstops for monolineenhanced money market instruments. As a result, the widening of financial
sector spreads was more pronounced than that of other market segments,
contributing to an overall underperformance of investment grade benchmarks
vis-à-vis lower-quality assets (Graph VI.8, centre panel).

Stage five: growth fears and dysfunctional markets (January–mid-March 2008)
Amid rising fears
about growth …

After a short lull in credit market conditions in December, disappointing
macroeconomic indicators caused yet another widespread repricing of risk in
early 2008. This fifth period of very negative credit market sentiment followed
the release of data in early January indicating weak growth in the US
manufacturing sector along with disappointing labour market developments.

BIS 78th Annual Report

101

Concerns about risks to growth were further fuelled by rising fears of a credit
crunch (see Chapters II and VII). Related nervousness about feedback effects
between macroeconomic and financial developments reached a climax on
21 and 22 January. Following the downgrade of a large monoline insurer the
previous Friday, risky assets sold off across markets and countries, and
markets remained volatile into February and March, despite extraordinary
policy rate cuts by the Federal Reserve on 22 and 30 January.
By that point, investor withdrawal from various financial markets had
intensified to such an extent that parts of the financial system became
dysfunctional, causing further financial retrenchment. Reflecting these difficult
conditions, spreads on even the most highly rated and otherwise liquid assets
reached unusually wide levels in early 2008. This included markets, such as
those for certain US student loan securitisations, whose underlying exposures
are almost entirely protected by federal guarantees (Graph VI.4, right-hand
panel). While, at these elevated spread levels, primary issuance continued,
arranging banks were finding it difficult to place anything but the most senior
tranches. With the remainder of the issued structures being retained, this
added to existing constraints on bank capital.
In late February and early March, with balance sheet pressures continuing
to intensify, banks sought to further cut their exposures across various
business lines, contributing to another fall in investor risk appetite. One such
move was the withdrawal of banks’ implicit liquidity support for an estimated
$330 billion worth of auction rate securities, which provide long-term financing
to municipal and other borrowers in the United States at variable short-term
interest rates tied to an auction process. Failed auctions and the resulting rate
resets thus raised the cost of financing for these borrowers (Graph VI.8, righthand panel). Pressures were also evident elsewhere, such as in the markets
for highly rated US agency and private label mortgage-backed securities,
which experienced a rapid increase in price uncertainty. The deterioration
in confidence regarding asset values culminated in early March, when the
tightening of repo haircuts caused a number of hedge funds and other
leveraged investors to unwind existing exposures, threatening a cascade of
further margin calls and widening spreads.
Events came to a head in the week beginning 10 March. This started with
the Federal Reserve’s announcement of an expansion of its securities lending
activities targeting the large US dealer banks, later supplemented by a
temporary facility providing overnight loans against a broad range of collateral
(see Chapter IV). While the initial announcement seemed to provide temporary
relief, the US investment bank Bear Stearns suffered a severe liquidity
shortage later in the week. This led to its takeover by JPMorgan the following
Monday, a measure facilitated by the Federal Reserve.

Stage six: the crest of the credit crisis to date (mid-March–May 2008)
These developments appeared to herald a turning point, with markets moving
into the sixth and, to date, final stage of the financial turmoil. Consistent with
perceptions of a considerable reduction in systemic risk, spreads, particularly
those for financial sector and other investment grade firms, retreated

102

… seemed to mark
a turning point in
market sentiment

substantially following the takeover of Bear Stearns from the peaks reached
during previous weeks. Amid signs of short covering, the tightening continued
through April, with spreads rallying back to where they had been in midJanuary, and seeming to stabilise around these levels from early May.
Even so, interbank money markets failed to recover. Given continued
capital and funding constraints for some investors as well as the disappearance
of demand from structures such as SIVs and CDOs, large overhangs of credit
exposure continued to weigh on markets. By mid-May, with the credit cycle
continuing to deteriorate and higher default rates looming, it remained
unclear whether liquidity supply and risk appetite had recovered sufficiently to
help maintain this improved credit market environment on a sustained basis.

Money markets hit by liquidity squeeze
Severe disruptions
in interbank
markets …

… led to sharply
higher interbank
rates …

One of the key distinguishing features of the financial turmoil was the onset of
unprecedented dislocations in interbank markets, and in money markets more
broadly, resulting from a surge in liquidity demand and a loss of confidence
in the creditworthiness of counterparties. The initial trigger for these severe
tensions was serious liquidity disruptions in the $1.2 trillion ABCP market
during the third stage of the unfolding financial turmoil, as described above.
These disruptions quickly led to deep concern about the adverse effects of
potentially large-scale reintermediation linked to banks providing backup credit
lines for vehicles active in the ABCP market and, subsequently, in other markets.
Worries about the liquidity and capital implications for banks engendered
growing distrust towards counterparties, while uncertainty about the stability
of the banking system as a whole grew, as indicated by widening swap spreads
(see below). In this environment, banks became less willing to lend money to
other banks, while, at the same time, concerns about their own liquidity
requirements led to rapidly increasing demand for borrowed funds. Adding to
this, money market mutual funds, which traditionally have been providers of
funding for banks, shifted a large portion of their investments away from banks
and into safe government debt, as their appetite for risk fell sharply (see below).
Central bank liquidity injections alleviated some of the pressures in
interbank markets (see Chapter IV), but uncertainty about future liquidity needs
and counterparty risk persisted. As a result, interest rates in the interbank
market remained elevated and volatile relative to comparable rates throughout
much of the period under review. Moreover, with most central banks initially
focusing on alleviating strains in the very shortest maturity segment, tensions
further out in the maturity spectrum soon became particularly pronounced,
inducing central banks to shift their attention increasingly to liquidity shortages
at longer maturities.
Such liquidity strains were evident from the unprecedented, persistent
widening of spreads between interbank rates for term lending and overnight
index swap (OIS) rates at corresponding maturities. For example, prior to the
outbreak of the financial turmoil, three-month Libor rates had exceeded OIS
rates by only a few basis points on average, but from late July 2007 the
difference surged to levels sometimes exceeding 100 basis points (Graph VI.9).

Graph VI.9

Interbank and OIS rates both reflect investors’ expectations about future
interest rates, but because interbank lending involves payment of the entire
principal up front whereas OIS contracts are settled on a net basis at maturity,
they differ substantially with respect to their liquidity and credit risk
implications. The sharp widening in Libor-OIS spreads therefore clearly
signalled some combination of greater preference for liquidity and rising
counterparty risk premia. Moreover, implied forward spreads at the end of the
period under review suggested that investors expected this to be a persistent
phenomenon (Graph VI.9).
The relative contributions of liquidity and credit risk to the rise in interbank
rates have proved very hard to disentangle, not least because the two
components are highly interrelated. The behaviour of Libor banks’ CDS
spreads vis-à-vis Libor-OIS spreads suggests that, while credit concerns have
indeed played a role in driving interbank rates during the turmoil, liquidity
factors have accounted for much of the dynamics (Graph VI.9). In addition, the
cyclical pattern in Libor-OIS spreads to some extent also indicated seasonal
liquidity shortages related to end-quarter and end-year funding concerns, which
were more severe than normal after the first half of 2007. Further complicating
matters, worries about the reliability of the Libor fixing mechanism began to
surface as the gridlock in interbank markets persisted, in particular for US
dollar loans. Specifically, market participants voiced suspicions that some
banks in the Libor panel may have been reporting rates lower than their actual
borrowing costs in order to appear stronger from a liquidity/credit risk
perspective. Following reports in April that the British Bankers’ Association
was investigating this issue, US dollar Libor rates suddenly jumped to levels
that seemed more in line with actual borrowing rates.
One characteristic of the strains in interbank markets during the financial
turbulence seems to have been difficulties for European banks, in particular,
in obtaining US dollar funding, as the demand for dollar liquidity surged. BIS
data on banks’ total cross-border positions by nationality suggest that

Graph VI.10

significant differences in the global funding patterns of European and
US banks may have been behind these difficulties. Over the past few years,
US banks have increasingly borrowed US dollars from non-banks, and have
channelled these funds to unaffiliated banks through the interbank market
(Graph VI.10, left-hand panel). At the same time, European banks have
increasingly transformed interbank funds, and those from official monetary
authorities, into US dollar-denominated claims on non-banks (Graph VI.10,
centre panel). Overall, by the fourth quarter of 2007, US banks’ total net
dollar claims on other banks had reached $421 billion, while European banks’
net dollar liabilities to banks stood at almost $900 billion. Frequent rollovers
by European banks of short-term dollar borrowing in the interbank market, in
order to finance longer-term investments in non-banks, had been practised
without problems for many years. However, as market tensions rose in the
second half of 2007, with European banks sharing in the $380 billion decline
in outstanding ABCP volumes that had to be taken back on balance sheet, this
need for constant refinancing contributed to the liquidity squeeze witnessed in
the interbank market. Some foreign exchange swap and cross-currency swap
markets displayed notable signs of strain consistent with this: US interest rates
derived from foreign exchange swap prices at times deviated significantly from
actual US dollar Libor during the turmoil (Graph VI.10, right-hand panel).

worsening of the US macroeconomic outlook triggered worries about future
profits and depressed investors’ risk tolerance. From mid-March 2008, however,
share prices recovered sharply across the board, following the takeover of Bear
Stearns by JPMorgan. Between end-March 2007 and mid-May 2008, the S&P
index was almost unchanged, while the Nikkei 225 and DJ EURO STOXX
indices fell by 18% and 9%, respectively.

Weakness concentrated in the financial sector and Japanese shares
Equity market weakness was initially concentrated in the financial sector, with
bank stocks being hit particularly hard. From end-March 2007 to mid-May
2008, global financial shares fell by almost 20%, the fastest pace of decline since
the end of 1994, when the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) financial
index became available. By contrast, performance of non-financials was mixed.
While the slump in the US housing was reflected in the underperformance
and steep decline in share prices in such sectors as housing construction,
gains were recorded in the materials and energy sectors, due to the strong
performance of commodity markets over the period (Graph VI.11, centre panel).
Japanese equities overall showed the largest decline among advanced
economy markets (Graph VI.11, left-hand panel). Despite the fact that
Japanese financial institutions were reported to be less exposed to subprime
loans than their US and European counterparts, Japanese financial shares
recorded a large loss. The outsize decline was also due in part to concerns
about the negative impact of the US economic slowdown on Japanese
exporters, as well as the further appreciation of the yen. Periods of rapid yen
appreciation against the dollar have often coincided with weak Japanese
share prices in the past. In line with this, the main Japanese share index fell
by more than 20% as the yen appreciated by a relatively large 14% against the
dollar between end-2007 and mid-March 2008.

Volatility increased
and risk tolerance

A key drag on share prices was the sharp reversal in expectations for earnings
of listed firms in advanced economy markets. This largely reflected growing
concerns that the US slowdown might be more severe and prolonged than
previously thought. From mid-2007, diffusion indices of revisions in 12-month
forward earnings per share in major markets plunged to levels not seen since
2002 (Graph VI.11, right-hand panel). These downbeat forecasts were
subsequently validated by reported earnings. Cumulative earnings per share in
the United States fell by more than 20% (year over year, share-weighted basis)
in the fourth quarter of 2007, considerably more than the 3% decline in the
previous quarter. In January 2008, accumulating evidence of weaker real
economic activity prompted further downward revisions to expected earnings.
From March 2008, however, earnings expectations started to recover in the
United States and key European countries.
At the same time, heightened uncertainties about the outlook resulted in
much higher volatility and declining risk tolerance. Option-implied market
volatility in the United States, on an uptrend since early 2007, reached 30% in
August 2007 and early 2008, close to levels last seen in April 2003. This is
more than twice the 2004–06 average of 14%, and substantially higher than
the historical (1986–2006) average of around 20% (Graph VI.12, left-hand panel).
Volatilities in other equity markets followed a similar pattern, with the surge
being particularly pronounced in Japan, where volatility approached the peak
seen in 2001. Indicators of investors’ tolerance for risk in equity markets,
measured by differences between the statistical distribution of actual equity
returns and the distribution implied by option prices, also deteriorated markedly
up to March 2008, reaching the lowest levels since 2005 (Graph VI.12, centre
panel). Following the news of the takeover of Bear Stearns in mid-March,

however, equity prices in advanced industrial economies rebounded, in line
with a decline in volatilities and recovering risk appetite.
Declining risk appetite up to March 2008 was also evidenced by lower
valuations, based on price/earnings ratios. Forward-looking valuation measures
fell over the period, as downward revisions in earnings did not keep pace with
the sharper decline in equity prices, despite analysts’ increasing pessimism.
For example, the S&P 500 fell from around 14 times one-year-ahead forecast
earnings in 2006 to 13 in March 2008, its lowest level since 1995. The level in
March 2008 was well below the average since 1988, but in line with averages
during 1988–97, which excludes the valuation peaks of the late 1990s, a period
marked by extreme optimism among equity investors (Graph VI.12, right-hand
panel). Valuation measures based on the DAX and TOPIX declined as well; by
March 2008 they stood well below long-term averages.

Bond yields fell sharply as the financial turmoil deepened
After seeing mostly rising long-term yields in the first half of 2007, developed
country government bond markets experienced rapidly falling yields as the
turmoil broke out. This strong downward pressure on yields was the result of
a combination of flight to safety and expectations of lower interest rates as the
outlook for economic growth deteriorated. The impact of both factors was
especially evident in the United States, where the economy appeared
particularly fragile. Between the local pre-turmoil peak in mid-June 2007 –
which was still low by historical standards – and the Bear Stearns collapse
around mid-March 2008, 10-year US government bond yields fell by almost
200 basis points to around 3.35%, a level not seen since 2003 (Graph VI.13,
left-hand panel). Yields also dropped in the euro area and Japan, although to
a lesser extent, reflecting perceptions that downside risks for these economies
were less acute than for the United States: 10-year euro area bond yields fell
nearly 100 basis points to below 3.70%, while corresponding Japanese yields
declined by some 70 basis points to just below 1.30% (Graph VI.13, centre and
right-hand panels). As the situation in global financial markets seemed to

yields recovered somewhat: between mid-March and mid-May, 10-year US and
euro area yields rose by around 50 basis points, while in Japan they increased
by more than 40 basis points.

Flight to safety led to scramble for government securities
… as investors
sought safe
havens …

When credit markets first started to sell off in summer 2007, investors quickly
began scaling back their holdings of risky assets, leading to much higher
demand for relatively safe government securities. Apart from tumbling yields,
the result was a shortage of available government bills and bonds for repo
transactions, particularly towards the end of 2007 and in early 2008. This
shortage manifested itself in a sharp increase in the number of Treasury
“fails” in the United States, ie situations in which a trade involving Treasury
securities fails to settle on schedule (including both fails to receive and fails to
deliver). Whereas such fails had averaged around $90 billion per week in the
first three quarters of 2007, they more than doubled in the fourth quarter to
over $200 billion per week, and surged further to a weekly average in excess
of $700 billion in the first one and a half quarters of 2008.
The flight to safety, in combination with the rush for liquidity, resulted in
a significant rise in inflows into money market funds. In the United States, for
example, while total net assets in money market funds had fluctuated
between $1.8 trillion and $2.4 trillion during 2000–06, they soared to more than
$3.1 trillion by end-2007 and increased further to over $3.5 trillion three months
later, before stabilising. With a large part of these inflows being invested in
short-dated government securities, this added to the severe downward
pressure on such securities, in particular US Treasury bills (Graph VI.14, lefthand panel). On occasion, the three-month T-bill traded more than 180 basis
points below the corresponding expected average federal funds rate, as
reflected by the three-month OIS rate. At the same time, a number of mutual
funds that had invested in short-term securities related to subprime mortgages

were hit by the turmoil. Indeed, in some cases these funds required parent
institutions to inject capital in order to prevent their net asset value from falling
below par.
As the market turmoil unfolded, swap spreads widened substantially, with
10-year US, euro area and UK spreads reaching levels not seen since 2001
(Graph VI.14, centre panel). This seemed to reflect in part heightened concerns
among investors about systemic risks, as fears of instability in the banking
system accumulated. In addition, the rise in swap rates vis-à-vis government
bond yields reflected investors’ flight from risky assets into government
securities, as well as increased use of swaps in an effort to hedge creditrelated exposures in an environment where liquidity in traditional hedging
markets was becoming increasingly scarce.
In yet another sign of heightened liquidity preference and lower appetite
for risk, spreads between German and other individual euro area government
bond yields widened to unusually high levels after mid-2007 (Graph VI.14,
right-hand panel). The spread between Spanish and German 10-year bond
yields, for example, rose from around 5 basis points in June 2007 to over
40 basis points in March 2008, and corresponding Italian spreads increased
from about 20 to 60 basis points, before recovering somewhat by mid-May.
Although some commentators attributed this widening of spreads in part to
concerns about growing stresses within the monetary union linked to
differences in fundamentals, it appeared more likely that the lion’s share was
due to investors’ extreme unwillingness to hold anything but the most liquid
securities available.

… amid falling
appetite for risk …

Recession fears drove yields further down
Perceptions of a weakening economic outlook gradually reinforced the
downward pressure on yields exerted by the flight to safety. In line with this,
around three quarters of the decline in long-term yields seen in the US and
euro area markets for nominal bonds since mid-2007 was attributable to falling
long-term real yields. Short- to medium-term real yields declined even more
sharply: for example, estimated US three-year real zero coupon yields plunged
by almost 300 basis points between end-May 2007 and mid-March 2008, to
trade at negative yield levels (Graph VI.16, left-hand panel). This largely reflected
expectations that short-term nominal interest rates would on average be lower
than inflation in the United States for a number of years to come, implying a
protracted period of low policy rates, presumably as a result of weak growth,
coupled with lingering inflation. Short-term real yields also fell in the euro area,
but substantially less than in the United States: between end-May 2007 and
mid-March 2008, three-year real euro area yields fell by 130 basis points to
around 0.90%. As tensions in financial markets appeared to ease to some
extent, real yields also recovered somewhat between mid-March and mid-May.
Despite persistent inflation pressures, market expectations of policy rate
cuts intensified as the growth outlook deteriorated, in particular in the United
States. While prices of federal funds futures contracts in early summer 2007
had indicated expectations of a broadly stable monetary stance for some time
– consistent with Federal Reserve signalling at the time – this picture changed

rapidly as conditions in financial markets worsened (Graph VI.15, left-hand
panel). By the fourth stage of the turmoil, in November 2007, the target federal
funds rate had already been cut by 75 basis points, yet markets expected still
more easing in the months ahead. With the situation deteriorating further at the
beginning of 2008, the total additional 200 basis point target rate reduction
announced by the Federal Reserve in the first quarter was even larger than
had been anticipated by investors in late 2007. This, together with new
measures announced by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity to market
participants, and the rescue of Bear Stearns in March, seemed to help rebuild
some confidence among investors. By mid-May, following a further 25 basis
point easing on 30 April, prices of federal funds futures contracts indicated
expectations of a period of interest rates on hold.
In the euro area and Japan, expected policy rates also shifted downwards
as the turmoil unfolded, although, compared to US rates, investors’ revisions
were much more measured, as were subsequent actual policy moves. Prior to
the crisis, markets had seen rates continuing to rise gradually in both the euro
area and Japan (Graph VI.15, centre and right-hand panels). Perceptions that
these economies were less vulnerable than the United States, in combination
with central bank signalling, led market participants in the second half of 2007
to only gradually reassess their expectations for policy rates in both economies.

Break-even inflation rates rose despite a softening economic outlook
While the outlook for economic activity weakened as the financial turmoil
unfolded, this seemed to have little dampening effect on inflation expectations,
as measured by surveys of analysts’ inflation forecasts. Part of the reason was
doubtless an accelerating rise in oil prices as well as a sharp pickup in food
prices, which pushed up headline inflation figures. This probably also
contributed to stable and, at times, rising spot break-even inflation rates in the
United States and in the euro area.

More significantly, five-year forward break-even rates five years ahead, a
common measure of inflation compensation that is less likely to be influenced
by increasing oil prices and other transient shocks, rose in the United States
and the euro area in the second half of 2007 and early 2008 (Graph VI.16,
centre and right-hand panels). The increase was particularly pronounced for
US forward break-even rates, and coincided with the Federal Reserve’s
300 basis point total cut in the target federal funds rate between September
2007 and March 2008. Investors may therefore have taken the view that the
Federal Reserve, and perhaps other central banks, might have to maintain a
more accommodative policy stance than normal in order to contain risks to
economic growth in an environment of severely strained financial markets, ie
a “risk management” approach to monetary policy (see Chapter IV). As the
situation in markets improved after mid-March, and expectations of further
sharp rate cuts receded, break-even rates fell back from their highs.
At the same time, break-even inflation rates must be interpreted with
caution. They reflect not only inflation expectations, but also various risk
premia – notably for inflation and illiquidity risk – and possibly also effects
stemming from institutional factors. Moreover, during times of severe market
stress, technical factors such as flight to safety and rapid unwinding of trades
may affect break-even rates and complicate their interpretation. Abstracting
from liquidity effects and influences due to institutional and technical factors,
break-even inflation rates reflect two components: expected inflation over the
horizon of the break-even rate, and a risk premium related to inflation
uncertainty. One can therefore try to adjust observed break-even rates for
estimates of such inflation risk premia in an effort to obtain a somewhat more

112

… seemed to

accurate picture of investors’ inflation expectations. Estimates of inflation
premia can be obtained, for example, by jointly modelling the dynamics of
nominal and index-linked bond yields together with macro variables. According
to estimates from such a model, the rise in the US forward break-even rate
until around mid-March seemed to be largely due to rising long-horizon
inflation expectations (Graph VI.16, centre panel). By contrast, while some of
the short-term fluctuations in euro area forward break-even inflation rates also
appeared to reflect changing inflation expectations, the model estimates
suggest that much of the increase that took place in the second half of 2007
and early 2008 was attributable to rising inflation risk premia (Graph VI.16,
right-hand panel).

Emerging market assets showed signs of resilience
Emerging market asset values, which experienced significant growth in the
first half of 2007, generally proved to be more resilient during the turmoil than
those of comparable asset classes elsewhere and, indeed, than in previous
episodes of market turbulence in advanced economies.
During the first half of 2007, emerging market asset prices soared,
underpinned by yet another year of strong economic performance. Emerging
economies continued to experience rapid growth, with surging commodity
prices supporting further improvements in fiscal and balance of payments
positions in many countries (see Chapter III). Despite a brief period of market
turbulence in late February 2007, the JPMorgan EMBIG index of spreads on
US dollar-denominated sovereign debt continued to drift lower up to mid-year,
reaching an all-time low of 151 basis points in early June (Graph VI.17, centre
panel). Emerging equity markets also saw strong gains, with the MSCI index
up 16% by mid-year (Graph VI.17, left-hand panel).

In line with the general repricing of risk, emerging market asset values
experienced considerable swings in the second half of the year, although not as
large as those observed in some mature economies. Between end-June and
26 November 2007, spreads on emerging market sovereign debt widened by
107 basis points, much less than the widening in US high-yield credit markets
over the same period. Moreover, while the cost of insuring emerging market
sovereign debt against default, tracked by the CDX EM index, rose during the
turmoil, spreads on CDS contracts of similar maturity on some US investment
grade paper rose even more. By November 2007, the CDX EM had fallen well
below the high-volatility subindex of the North American investment grade
CDX index (Graph VI.17, centre panel).
Emerging equity markets were hit particularly hard during the initial stages
of the turmoil, although they proved to be more resilient relative to markets in
some mature economies during later stages. From their peak on 23 July, they
gave back a large part of their gains from the first half of the year over the next
month, with the broad MSCI emerging market index down 18% by 17 August,
compared to a 10% decline in the global index over the same period. However,
emerging market equities rebounded in September and October, boosted by
particularly strong performance in Asia (24%) and Latin America (25%) during
these months. By year-end, the broad indices for each of the three emerging
regions were still above their 23 July levels, while the major indices for the
United States, Japan and Europe had all registered declines of 4% or more.
As in advanced industrial economies, concerns over a more widespread
slowdown in growth clearly began to weigh on many emerging markets in
early 2008. The string of weak real side data for the United States released in
January sparked a global equity market sell-off, leaving the broad emerging
market index down more than 10% for the month. Spreads on emerging market
sovereign debt also widened in the wake of the sell-off, with the EMBIG

ultimately reaching 339 basis points on 17 March, as news of the worsening
financial distress of Bear Stearns reached the market.
The sharp declines in emerging equity markets in early 2008 differed
significantly across countries. Rising commodity prices provided support for
markets in Russia, Latin America and the Middle East but at the same time
fuelled concerns about domestic inflation in all emerging regions (see
Chapter III). Latin American equity markets quickly rebounded after the
January sell-off, with indices in Brazil, Chile and Peru trading near their all-time
highs in late March. In contrast, Asian equity markets had fallen more than 20%
by mid-March, with markets in China, India and the Philippines down the most.
In China, in particular, efforts by the domestic authorities to slow the economy,
combined with an appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar and rising
food and oil prices, caused equity investors to question the valuations of
Chinese corporates, which by late 2007 had exhibited price/earnings ratios
near 50. By 18 April 2008, the Shanghai equity index had fallen by almost 50%
from its 16 October 2007 peak, eliminating much of the gains achieved earlier
in 2007.
Throughout the period of market turbulence, asset values in many
emerging economies were supported by perceptions that the downside risks
to growth were more limited than for the United States and other advanced
industrial economies (see Chapter III). In both emerging equity and credit
markets, asset prices thus exhibited a somewhat muted sensitivity to
movements in US equity and credit markets relative to earlier periods. For
example, in three distinct episodes of sudden and sustained increases in
volatility in US equity markets since July 2007, emerging market equity prices
held up relatively well, outperforming the S&P 500 during the first 15 trading

days in each period (Graph VI.17, right-hand panel). This stands in contrast to
previous periods of turbulence in US markets, when emerging markets tended
to underperform.
In part, the resilience of emerging market assets has reflected both robust
domestic growth in many countries and support from surging commodity
prices. Some statistical evidence drawn from rolling panel regressions seems
to confirm this observation (Graph VI.18). The sensitivity to US equity markets,
which had been rising in most regions since 2003, started to wane in mid-2006,
and then fell significantly after July 2007 as the financial turmoil erupted.
Over this same period, the daily changes in commodity prices seemed to
emerge as more important drivers of emerging equity returns, particularly in
Latin America.
Estimates based on credit spread data provide some evidence of a
similar disconnect between emerging market sovereign debt markets and
those for US high-yield credit. A simple estimate of the time-varying correlation
between spreads in these markets stayed at a relatively high level by historical
standards, following a generally upward trend since at least 2004 (green line
in Graph VI.19). However, once other US and global factors (commodity prices,
global equity prices and US investment grade credit spreads) are taken into
account (red line), the correlations showed a more significant drop from 2007,
particularly during the recent period of credit market turmoil.

VII. The financial sector in the advanced industrial
economies

Highlights
The period under review was characterised by generalised stress in the
financial sector of the advanced industrial economies.
Several years of growth and enhanced profitability for financial firms came
to an abrupt halt in 2007 as strains stemming primarily from exposures to
residential real estate spread throughout the financial system. Mounting
defaults in the US subprime mortgage market led to outsize writedowns in the
securitised mortgage portfolios of many institutions. The situation deteriorated
in waves after the summer months, with many firms facing funding constraints
in the interbank market. It was punctuated by the near failure of sizeable
financial firms, prompting intervention by the public sector to avert potential
systemic disruptions from a disorderly collapse.
The severity and speed of spreading strains represented a major stress
test for the robustness of many innovative structures introduced in the
financial sector over the past few years and also highlighted the degree of
interconnectedness between markets and institutions. What had started as a
problem specific to a segment of the US mortgage market became a source
of losses for financial firms worldwide that were holding related securities.
Uncertainty about the size and distribution of losses was exacerbated by
the complexity of the new structures used in the securitisation process.
Retrenchment from risk-taking led to illiquidity, exposing weaknesses in the
funding arrangements of many financial firms.
With many financial institutions nursing weakened balance sheets, even
as the macroeconomic environment continues to worsen, a turn in the credit
cycle seems likely to imply persistent headwinds for economic activity. How
the situation will evolve depends critically on the dynamic interactions
between the financial sector and the macroeconomy. Reduced credit
availability, due to efforts by the financial sector to preserve its capital base,
could prolong the period of weak profitability by affecting aggregate
spending, economic activity and asset quality. These effects can also be
transmitted across borders as weakened banking systems tend to cut back on
their international exposures. Beyond the cyclical implications, this period of
intense stress also heralds some structural shifts. Financial firms are
revisiting assumptions that supported a move towards a business model
focused on origination and distribution of loans through securitisation. At the
same time, policymakers are reviewing aspects of the prudential framework
that failed to perform as intended.

BIS 78th Annual Report

117

The financial sector under stress
To varying degrees, the turmoil affected firms in practically all segments of
the financial sector of advanced industrial economies. Compared to other
episodes of stress in recent memory, it has proved to be both more persistent
and more complex. Market participants and policymakers alike have been
surprised by how far stresses spread across firms and markets, and by the
limited effectiveness of standard policy instruments. The price of insurance
against sizeable declines in the asset value of the largest financial firms is a
measure of both the degree to which market participants reassessed the
likelihood of systemic risk and their waning appetite to bear it. Proxies of
this price based on credit derivative prices jumped to unprecedented heights
in summer 2007 and remained high throughout the rest of the period
under review in all segments of the industry (Graph VII.1). The jump can be
attributed to market participants’ keener perception of failure risk as well as
their view that common drivers of this risk were at play across the different
segments of the industry.
This period of intense stress was characterised by three interconnected
elements. The first was rates of default on residential real estate loans that
were well in excess of the expectations incorporated into loan prices. The
second was the failure of many market participants to fully appreciate the
inherent complexity and opacity of highly structured financing arrangements,
which made exposures difficult to value. As firms scrambled to reprice risks
on their balance sheets, they became aware of the sensitivity of valuations to
changes in the assumptions underlying their pricing models. Finally, market
participants’ uncertainty about the size of the underlying losses and their
distribution across the system led to a generalised drain on market liquidity,
which in turn exacerbated the pricing uncertainties and made for increasingly
difficult funding conditions.

Banks, whether classified as commercial or universal, were among the
institutions hit the hardest during this episode of stress. The writedowns related
to US mortgage exposures reported over the period under review made a large
dent in the profitability of the industry. Banks’ earnings for the calendar year
2007, in which the first wave of writedowns occurred, were at best flat, but in
most countries declined compared to previous years (Table VII.1).
The pronounced deterioration in bank profits in the United States reflected
a general worsening of individual components of income. Net interest margins
declined and operating costs rose, reversing a number of years of cost
containment. All indicators of credit-related costs moved higher. Loan loss
provisions saw their largest increase in 20 years, reflecting the problems in
the mortgage markets and, potentially, the gradual slowdown in economic
activity and higher delinquency rates. Even so, reserves failed to keep pace
with non-current loans, with the result that the cover ratio fell below unity for
the first time since 1993.
The picture in Europe was more mixed. While profits generally dipped,
operating costs in a number of countries continued on the downward trend of
recent years. Loan loss provisions were stable in most countries, and lower
profitability seemed to be more closely associated with a decline in net interest
margins. The increasing reliance of European banks on market and wholesale
sources of funding, the price of which tends to be more sensitive to yield
curve movements and risk than the retail deposit base, is a likely factor behind
declining interest margins. In some contrast to the overall picture, Spanish
banks recorded improved profits, including from interest margins, despite an
appreciable increase in loan provisions. The profits of Swiss and German

banks declined very significantly even as loan loss provisions remained fairly
flat, arguably because the sources of strain were concentrated primarily in their
securities portfolios rather than their loan book. The discovery of the biggest
ever incidence of trader fraud in a leading French bank exposed weaknesses
in internal controls, but the €4.9 billion loss did not lead to an implosion of
the institution.
Banks in the United Kingdom announced significant writedowns
from exposures to US real estate, but did not report major overall losses for
the year. However, the retail depositor run on Northern Rock, after news
surfaced about the bank’s difficulties in financing its mortgage portfolio in the
wholesale money market, provided an enduring image of a banking
system under stress. The rapid deterioration of the bank’s liquidity
triggered intervention by the national prudential authorities. This initially
took the form of an injection of liquidity backed by illiquid collateral.
Eventually, however, the lender had to be nationalised in an effort to preserve
its value until market conditions improved. To stem any further spread of
depositor panic, the government announced a blanket guarantee of deposits
with all UK banks. The turn of events also prompted an extensive review by
UK policymakers of the institutional arrangements for dealing with distressed
banks.
While Japanese banks saw profits decline in the period under review,
they were less affected by the turmoil than their European and North American
peers. The ratio of non-performing loans to assets continued to shrink. The
decline in provisions was limited primarily because of exposures to consumer
finance companies. Overall, Japanese banks’ capital adequacy was not
affected too severely and their access to funding was not impaired, partly
thanks to their large deposit base.

Investment banking
Acute problems
of investment
banks …

… driven by large
exposures to
counterparty and
liquidity risk …

Investment banking operations have arguably been the segment of the
financial sector most affected by the turmoil. Profits declined dramatically, and
a number of institutions found themselves needing to raise substantial amounts
of new capital. The near failure of one of the largest Wall Street firms marked
a low point in the unfolding of events. At the same time, the response of the
US authorities in terms of providing liquidity support to the sector signalled a
change of attitude that could have long-standing implications for the design
of prudential policy.
Investment banks experienced a sharp decline in profitability after August
2007. The return on equity for the largest US and European firms in the
calendar year 2007 fell to around 7.4% and 4.6% respectively, less than a third
of the record highs reached in 2006. A few firms actually recorded outright
negative earnings for the year. Losses on exposures to securities backed by
mortgages, consumer loans and related derivatives accounted for the major
part of this slump in performance. Trading revenues were cut by half due to
the effects of the turmoil on many securities markets. By contrast, earnings
were generally supported by income from asset and wealth management as
well as by fees from the underwriting of initial public offerings (IPOs) and
merger and acquisition advice, at least until the turn of the year (Graph VII.2).
However, both these lines of business showed clear signs of weakening in the
first quarter of 2008 as the deal flow subsided and many IPOs were withdrawn.
By the nature of their activities, investment banking firms are more
exposed to adverse market conditions than commercial banks. They operate
on a thinner capital cushion and tend to be more active risk-takers. Without a
retail deposit base, investment banks are more reliant on capital markets for
fund-raising and on well functioning money markets for their short-term liquidity

management. During the financial turmoil, counterparties’ uncertainty about the
size and distribution of investment banks’ exposures to underperforming asset
classes resulted in an acute shortage of liquidity. Standalone investment banks
that are not part of a larger organisation with commercial banking activities
were affected the most. The severity of the financing problems prompted
an exceptional extension of access to central bank financing facilities for
those securities houses that are also primary dealers in the Federal Reserve’s
operations (see Chapter IV). Investment banks made extensive use of these
facilities in substituting their holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
for government paper as collateral in repo funding operations (Graph VII.2,
right-hand panel).
The near collapse of Bear Stearns represented a defining moment in this
period of prolonged financial sector distress. This major Wall Street institution
found itself at the centre of events in the very early stages of the turmoil
because of its leading role in mortgage securitisation. In the summer of 2007,
the firm felt obliged to provide support to affiliated hedge funds that had
registered large losses on subprime mortgage exposures. In March 2008, the
firm’s liquidity position deteriorated rapidly, leading the Federal Reserve to
intervene. Taking a form of action not seen since the Great Depression, the
central bank first extended a loan to the firm using a commercial bank as an
intermediary, and then provided financing and guarantees to facilitate a full
takeover by that bank a few days later. The extraordinary intervention was
aimed at avoiding a disorderly unwinding of Bear Stearns’s extensive positions
in the cash and derivatives markets that would have compounded market
uncertainties and illiquidity. Of particular concern were exposures related to the
firm’s role as a market-maker in the CDS market and an intermediary in the
market for tripartite repurchase agreements. The demonstrated resolve of the
authorities to act decisively to stabilise the situation helped reverse the decline
in market participants’ sentiment and led to a narrowing of spreads and
risk premia (Graph VII.1; see also Chapter VI). At the same time, the
unconventional nature of the intervention raised issues about its longer-term
impact on incentives. A manifest willingness to extend the central bank
safety net to investment banks, even under the most extreme circumstances,
is likely to have implications for the design of the prudential oversight of such
firms, which are not subject to supervision by the central bank.

Insurance companies
Overall, the effect of the financial turmoil on insurance companies was less
severe than on banking institutions. Most insurance firms registered positive
results, and premium income remained strong. With the exception of
monoline insurers, exposures to the asset classes most affected by the turmoil
were not widespread. Sizeable writedowns of mortgage-related holdings
among some of the larger insurance companies were, with few exceptions,
manageable and did not translate into funding liquidity problems as they did
for banks.
In the property and casualty segment of the industry, the absence of
major natural disasters kept down the costs from claims and helped support

122

Despite the general

… highly leveraged

experienced strain

companies’ earnings and prudential ratios. Looking forward, however, the
continuing upward trend in the frequency of smaller-scale natural disasters
may suggest that future cost estimates will need to be revised upwards.
The segment of the insurance sector most affected by the turmoil was the
one specialised in offering credit guarantees to bond issuers. The so-called
monoline insurance companies, which had traditionally provided guarantees
primarily to local government bond issuers, had gradually expanded their
business to offer credit enhancements for structured finance products. The
collapse in the performance of these products entailed larger than expected
payouts on the guarantees, thereby testing the limits of the highly leveraged
balance sheets of the monoline insurers. As a result, their credit rating was
questioned and the price of their debt plunged (Graph VI.8, left-hand panel). A
few smaller companies were downgraded and others were obliged to seek
capital infusions in order to maintain the AAA rating that is crucial to their
business model. The problems they faced in raising fresh capital prompted
the intervention of the supervisory authorities to avoid knock-on effects on
other segments of the bond market and other financial firms.

Leveraged investors
As funding markets
tightened …

The leveraged investor sector was also affected negatively by the stresses in
the financial system, albeit mostly indirectly. Market-makers and lenders
reacted to weakened balance sheets and reduced profits by tightening funding
conditions. As a result, hedge funds and private equity funds had to adapt
their risk-taking to the higher cost of borrowed capital.
Even though the first signs of strain to emerge were problems in hedge
funds associated with large investment houses, the performance of the industry
as a whole initially proved relatively robust. During 2007, returns on most

hedge fund strategies compared favourably to those recorded in 2006
(Graph VII.3). The main exception was the performance of fixed income funds,
which slipped during 2007. Over the calendar year, net investor inflows to all
fund sectors remained at levels comparable to those of the recent past.
During the first months of 2008, a challenging market environment led to
disappointing performance for many hedge funds, triggering withdrawals of
funds by investors. This was compounded by prime brokers’ desire to reduce
their exposures by intensifying margin calls and tightening funding terms.
Many funds, especially those below the top tier, found it hard to keep their
positions open and were forced to liquidate part of their portfolio.
Private equity funds experienced significant pressure during the period
under review as funding conditions tightened and investment opportunities
narrowed. Successful fund-raising over the past few years created an overhang
of investor money that has not been placed in the traditional way for this type
of fund. Portfolio investments in structured finance securities resulted in large
losses for a few private equity funds and in the high-profile failure of a recently
listed entity associated with a top-tier private equity partnership.
Loan activity linked to leveraged buyouts (LBOs) declined substantially
during the second half of 2007 and came to a near standstill in the first quarter
of 2008 (Graph VII.4). Originators found it increasingly difficult to securitise
these loans as other lenders shied away from risk. Concerns about heightened
credit and concentration risk arising from the involuntary accumulation of
such exposures dried up the flow of financing for such transactions.

Real estate markets and financial firms’ writedowns
Developments in the property market played a central role in the genesis and
dynamics of the financial turmoil. Exposures to US residential mortgages,
especially to the riskier segments of the market, were the primary source of
losses both on direct holdings of mortgages and on holdings of securities

related to mortgage debt. From a forward-looking perspective, developments in
the property market are also likely to be a key determinant of how the overall
situation evolves.
Most of the writedowns reported by financial firms during the period
under review were related to declines in the value of their mortgage-linked
holdings. Losses booked since August 2007 were quite severe (Table VII.3).
The writedowns reflected the combined effect of an increase in the delinquency
rate of mortgage debt and the massive repricing of portfolios of securitised
mortgages. The size of the losses prompted a large number of institutions to
actively seek to repair their balance sheet by raising new capital.
Losses related to mortgages jumped in the United States as delinquency
rates increased. By September 2007, delinquency rates for prime-quality loans
had risen to 3.1%, and for subprime loans to 16%. More recent subprime
loan vintages exhibited much higher delinquency rates, an indication of the
progressive loosening of underwriting standards over the course of the housing
boom (Graph VII.5).
The rise in mortgage delinquencies triggered a re-evaluation of the
assumptions underpinning the pricing of mortgage-related securities. Low
spreads for pools of securitised mortgages reflected in part the expectation

that highly indebted borrowers would be able to refinance or sell the property
easily in a booming housing market, avoiding costly foreclosure proceedings.
Moreover, valuations of structured finance products related to mortgages were
also based on optimistic assumptions about the closeness of the link between
delinquencies and “systematic” risk drivers. As a result, manifestations of
higher risk led to large-scale downgrades in the credit ratings of securitised
mortgages and a sharp drop in the marked to market value of related
structured finance securities.
Two features of structured finance products amplified the price declines.
The first was the complexity of the structure governing the distribution of cash
flows to different investors. By construction, securitisation redistributed risk
by concentrating it in junior tranches. The low expected loss characteristics of
senior tranches, however, came at the expense of higher sensitivity to
underlying valuation assumptions. Second, since the secondary markets for
these securities were fairly illiquid, valuations had been increasingly based on
primary market placing of newer vintages of similar structures, or on risk
models, rather than on new information about the performance of the
underlying pool of assets. As the demand for new securities dried up and
initial pricing assumptions had to be revised, the non-linear nature of the
structures meant that recorded valuations required very substantial
adjustments. This explains why the writedowns reported by financial firms are
significantly larger than the actual realised losses from non-performing
mortgages.

A significant
decline in house
price inflation …

… spilled over to
the commercial real
estate market

Property market trends have been key in determining the course of the
current cycle. Residential real estate prices halted their upward trend during
the period under review (Graph VII.6). In most countries, house prices
stabilised or their growth moderated substantially. In the United States, house
prices fell. The decline in the national average price index masks considerable
diversity in the performance of local markets. The areas where prices grew
the fastest in the past few years were also those where prices have recently
dropped most. Also, house price indices that are more sensitive to properties in
large metropolitan areas and those financed by large or not fully documented
mortgages show annual price declines in the order of 12%. More generally,
the global flattening of the rate of increase in house prices can be attributed
primarily to a decline in housing demand, which in certain countries came on
the heels of a recent construction boom. Higher interest rates for mortgages, an
incipient economic slowdown and elevated levels of household indebtedness
have to varying degrees played a role in the slackening demand for housing
in different countries.
The slowdown in property prices also affected the commercial real estate
sector. Commercial property prices had accelerated in a number of countries
over the past few years, albeit starting from a lower level than residential
markets and showing more diversity across countries (Table VII.4). Bank
exposures to the sector have also increased. Direct exposures to commercial
real estate account for almost 14% of the assets held by US banks, with the
share having jumped from 19% to 33% in the case of medium-sized banks
over the past six years (Graph VII.7).
There were, however, accumulating signs of investors’ heightened
sensitivity to commercial property risk during the period under review. The
trend increase in the issuance of securities backed by commercial property
investments was reversed during the past year. At the same time, spreads on
such securities widened very substantially (Graph VII.7, right-hand panel). This

during the past few years, similar to that observed in residential mortgage
markets.

The turmoil in perspective
The episode of stress that dominated the financial landscape starting in
mid-2007 arguably ranks among the most serious in recent experience. It
affected a large number of financial institutions and proved to be more
persistent than many other instances of generalised financial sector
instability. From the perspective of policymakers, some of the most important
questions raised by the turmoil relate to the interactions between the
financial and real sectors of the economy. A key question is whether the
credit cycle may be leading the business cycle as financial institutions
respond to weakened balance sheets by tightening the supply of credit.
Moreover, the transmission of stress through the international banking
market indicates that economic spillovers may be broader than suggested by
the original stress points. A final set of questions relates to systemic risk and
to the role of the originate-to-distribute model of financial intermediation in
shaping its nature.

The credit cycle
Large losses forced
banks to …

… raise fresh
capital …

… and tighten
credit

The intense strains over the period under review have forced financial firms to
overhaul their business plans. In many cases, firms that saw their capital base
shrink had to resort to emergency recapitalisation to maintain their franchise
value in their respective areas of activity. A key question looking forward,
however, is the extent to which the repercussions of the turmoil will affect the
supply of credit to the non-financial sector.
Writedowns of mortgage-related assets and the prospect of further
deterioration in asset quality prompted many banks to take action to repair
their balance sheets. Most explicitly, many large institutions have done so by
raising fresh equity capital through private or public rights issues to the tune
of $200 billion (Table VII.3). This has been particularly costly in an adverse
market environment where investors’ concern about the fragility of financial
institutions’ performance has weighed on their share prices (Graph VII.8).
Nevertheless, for a number of institutions, the financial and reputational costs
of immediate action have been outweighed by the benefits of avoiding a
further tightening in the availability of capital and being able to maintain
capital buffers sufficient to support the value of their business franchise.
These efforts have also received the endorsement of supervisors, who have
encouraged banks to review their capitalisation levels with a critical eye and
address weaknesses in a timely way.
Another, more widespread reaction among financial firms has been a
more defensive positioning in terms of asset growth. Asset deterioration led
lenders to retrench from the hardest hit market segments, such as mortgage
loans and consumer credit. Survey evidence points consistently towards a
tightening of credit standards in these areas. This is true not only in the United
States, where the performance of these credits demonstrably worsened, but
also in Europe, where problems with such loans have been much less
pronounced (see the discussion in Chapter II and evidence in Graph II.12,
right-hand panel). There are indications that credit availability to the corporate

sector is also under pressure, with banks being more demanding in their
lending terms. Of particular note has been the disappearance of loan contracts
with looser covenants, which had become increasingly prevalent during the
recent boom in leveraged financing. Credit spreads have also generally
widened, although this increase has been more pronounced in the bond than
in the loan market (Graph VII.9).
Aggregate credit growth rates have declined moderately from their recent
peaks in many countries (Graph VII.10). For a number of reasons, however,
these statistics may in some cases understate the contraction in the supply of
credit. One reason is that, as a result of the underperformance of securitised

instruments, sponsoring banks brought back onto their balance sheets
portfolios that had been housed in separate legal entities as part of the
securitisation structure. These decisions were dictated partly by existing
funding commitments to these separate entities and partly by a desire to
minimise the reputational costs to the franchise name of the firm from eventual
failures of such vehicles. A second reason is that many large banks that had
used loans to fund LBOs in the late stages of the leveraged financing boom
found themselves holding large portions of these exposures when the
secondary market for such loans dried up in summer 2007. The overhang of
these loans, estimated by market observers to have neared $250 billion at its
peak, weighed on the banks’ balance sheets. The gradual market reopening
towards the end of the period under review was in part stimulated by interest
from private equity funds. A final reason why the overall numbers may overstate
the supply of new credit is that, once credit has started contracting, borrowers
in need typically draw down from existing credit lines with their banks.
The evolution of credit availability in the near and medium term will
depend on a number of factors. Two key factors, closely interlinked, are how
far banks succeed in replenishing their capital reserves and how the quality of
their assets develops. The latter is in turn intimately tied to developments in the
macroeconomy.
Previous episodes of financial sector stress can offer some guidance as
to what can be expected, albeit far from an exact prediction. The similarities

between the current turn in the credit cycle and others that have occurred over
the past 20 years are evident when one examines the patterns of credit
expansion, asset prices and economic activity (Graph VII.11). Regardless of
the specific features of past episodes of distress, they were typically preceded
by periods of faster than average credit growth and by asset price booms,
driven very often by property prices. These periods of credit growth
were associated with looser credit standards and a lower price of risk
(Graph VII.9, left-hand panel), and typically mirrored a strong upswing in
economic activity.
The reversal of the process in the downswing of the cycle was often fairly
abrupt. Financial sector indicators typically led real economic activity as credit
growth contracted and asset prices declined in advance of GDP and spending.
The health of financial institutions deteriorated during the downswing, as
suggested by the declining values of performance indicators. While it is difficult
to derive general causal linkages from this evidence, the dynamics of financial
sector strength, credit and asset price growth and real sector activity do
highlight their close interdependencies.
Looking beyond the near-term horizon, the main risks appear to be linked
to the response of aggregate demand to the weakened position of banks and
tighter lending standards. Debt levels of households in many countries remain
high and tighter credit supply is likely to have an impact on spending patterns
(see Chapter II). The level at which house prices will eventually converge and
the length of this stabilisation period would be a very important factor in the
economies where housing booms have been the most pronounced.

… the performance
of the real economy

The international banking market and the transmission of stress
The growing internationalisation of finance implies that the health of a country’s
banking system can be important beyond the borders of the domestic economy.
A number of large institutions lie at the centre of the international banking
market. Their continued difficulties can affect financial conditions across
national boundaries.
The 1990s offer examples of banking crises in advanced industrial
countries with direct international consequences. Japanese banks scaled back
their international operations in response to the non-performing loans problem
caused by the bursting of the asset price bubble (Graph VII.12, top panel). As
a result of a prolonged period of generally negative growth, Japanese banks’
share in international claims fell from 38% in 1990 to less than 8% in 2007. The
Nordic banking crisis had a similar effect in curtailing locally headquartered
banks’ international claims, albeit from a much smaller base. Instances where
US banks’ international operations contracted are also associated with periods
of domestic financial strain, notably in the late 1980s, the early 1990s and
autumn 1998.
In each of these cases, the banks affected reduced credit channelled
through their international offices in multiple locations. These cuts therefore
represented negative shocks to credit supply in the host country, induced by
conditions at the banks’ headquarters in the home country. By contrast,
throughout most of this period, international credit extended by their

international peers exhibited a more muted cycle, and posted negative growth
only briefly in 1992.
The international banking market has grown significantly since then and
with it the potential international impact of a similar retrenchment today.
International claims of BIS reporting banks rose from $6 trillion in 1990 to
$37 trillion in 2007 (equivalent to over 70% of world GDP), with total claims on
emerging markets topping $4 trillion, including cross-border credit and claims
extended locally by foreign banks. The withdrawal of institutions from a major
national banking system from international lending could affect advanced
industrial economies as well as constrain the financing of emerging markets
(see Chapter III). Several emerging markets in Europe and Latin America have
become more reliant on foreign bank credit, either through cross-border
transactions or via local branches. That said, data available up to end-2007
show bank lending to emerging markets continuing to accelerate, in contrast
to banking activity between advanced industrial economies.
Even if the condition of internationally active banks might be considered
less problematic now than in the early 1990s, their common market exposures
(including to US mortgage-related assets) have increased and the institutions

BIS 78th Annual Report

133

are now more highly interconnected through interbank linkages, credit
commitments and guarantees. Tentative signs of a credit contraction have
started to emerge. Internationally active banks have started to reduce their
direct exposures to various national banking systems. Interbank exposures to
UK, French and US banks declined the most, followed by those to German and
Swiss banks (Graph VII.12, bottom left-hand panel). In turn, several major
banking systems including those from Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States are showing signs of curbing their total international exposure
(bottom right-hand panel). The presence of such extensive international
bank linkages generally underscores the point that continued strains at
internationally active banks have the potential to produce a retreat from
international lending that could be felt well beyond the main financial centres.

The originate-to-distribute business model
Many elements of the recent credit market turmoil mirror features of past
financial cycles and, as such, form part of the mechanisms that bring about the
alternation of periods of financial booms and sharp contractions. A relatively
novel element specific to the latest episode is the central role of the so-called
originate-to-distribute (OTD) business model for financial intermediation. This
model relies on the dispersion of originated exposures through markets for
risk transfer, and a layered structure of players is involved in different stages
of the process, from origination and repackaging to the ultimate bearing of the
risk. While securitisation is not a recent innovation, its growth in recent years
had accelerated substantially, supported to a large extent by the introduction
of more complex structures.
The growth in securitisation markets was an integral part of the expansion
phase of the current credit cycle. Financial innovation, in the form of new
structures that govern the distribution of cash flow generated by the securitised
assets to the ultimate investors, was an important factor behind the abundant
supply of credit to households and firms. The repackaging of mortgages into
tranched securities with different risk characteristics energised funding from
various types of investors with varying degrees of risk tolerance. Moreover, the
wider distribution of the risk across the financial system arguably contributed
to the compression of risk premia, as investors felt better able to match their
risk appetite to the composition of their portfolios.
Conversely, the market turmoil that ushered in the contraction phase of
the cycle exposed some of the weaknesses in this business model of financial
intermediation, and especially in some of the practices introduced in the most
recent period. These weaknesses relate primarily to the interactions between
the incentives of individual participants in the securitisation chain and the
quality of the information flow. A successful securitisation process relies on
complementarities between the roles of different participants to ensure that
decisions at every stage are based on adequate information and are conducive
to better allocation of risk and economic resources.
Originators play a key role in the success of a securitisation structure.
Information generated by other parties at subsequent stages is at best only an
imperfect substitute for the asset quality assessment made by originators.

… securitisation …

assessments

Information deficiencies stemming from the lack of due diligence or lax
underwriting standards at this initial stage are very difficult to overcome. These
weaknesses were evident in the securitisation market for subprime mortgages.
Competition between originators who never intended to bear the risk and were
motivated solely by income tied to the origination volumes contributed to a
decline in standards of verification and documentation of mortgages. In the
most extreme cases loans were granted to borrowers who would clearly not
be able to repay them except under very optimistic scenarios of future house
price appreciation.
Financial intermediaries specialising in the creation and management of
securitisation vehicles face similar incentives as originators. Their income is
primarily linked to the volume of business rather than to the underlying riskreturn profile of the securitised assets. They typically bear only a small portion
of the risk, and in the prevailing euphoria of the market boom they were able to
substantially reduce this exposure. Further, the creation of complex structures
that insert several layers of securitisation between the original asset base and
the cash flows to the ultimate risk bearers often obscured the risk borne by the
structures’ managers.
A key role for the ultimate investor and bearer of risk is to inject discipline
into the securitisation process by demanding and receiving pertinent
information about the underlying risks before taking positions. The incentive
to do this was weakened, however, by the fact that new and complex
securitisation transactions resulted in very large portions of these holdings
being structured as senior claims and receiving the highest creditworthiness
assessments by rating agencies. The compensation of investors in this class
of claims, while generous compared to other similarly rated instruments, is
not substantial enough to justify the effort of performing a full review of the
underlying risks in highly structured transactions. Hence, their decisions rely
on external risk assessments and due diligence performed by the so-called
“mezzanine” investors, who hold less senior and higher-yielding claims.
However, their capacity to screen and instil financial discipline was undermined
by the very substantial volume of securitisation issues that came to the
market in the past few years, overstretching their resources. In addition, the
practice of layered securitisation, which created new structures and more
senior claims from the packaging of mezzanine tranches of securitised assets,
further lessened the ability of this class of investors to reliably assess and
monitor the risks.
The growth of more complex forms of securitisation may have weakened
the incentives of originators and managers to do due diligence and elevated
the importance of credit ratings for the functioning of the market. Investors in
the more senior tranches placed increased weight on the credit rating agencies’
assessment, often without regard to the fact that credit ratings focus mainly
on average (or expected) credit losses and do not fully describe the potential
range of those losses. In fact, the complexity of the more layered securitisation
structures meant that this range of potential losses was much wider than for
similarly rated loan or bond exposures. Ratings also abstract from the possible
losses stemming from the interaction between market and credit risk drivers,

BIS 78th Annual Report

135

which are also more pronounced in the context of some of these structures.
Indeed, as a result of the lessons learned from the turmoil, investors seem to
have shunned complexity, and rating agencies have started looking for ways
in which to better communicate the important nuances in their assessments.
In spite of its identified shortcomings, amply illustrated during this period
of stress, the potential benefits of the OTD model for individual institutions
and for the efficiency of the financial system as a whole remain. The main
challenge facing market participants and policymakers is to address these
shortcomings while enhancing its positive features. Several efforts are in train.
Private sector initiatives include moves towards more complete documentation
at origination and better dissemination of information throughout the
securitisation chain, a heightened recognition that discipline is stronger when
participants in every step of the process retain sufficient exposure to the overall
risk, and efforts to refine the assessments by rating agencies. Policymakers
are also seeking to incorporate the lessons learned about the risks inherent in
more complex securitisation structures in designing and implementing
prudential standards and to address the weaknesses exposed by the links
between market and funding liquidity and overall risk in financial institutions.
A general lesson derived from the financial turmoil is the close
interdependence of markets and institutions in the functioning and resilience
of the financial system. The OTD model of financial intermediation is based on
the premise that risk is ultimately shifted to the investors through market
transactions. However, as the events during the period under review
demonstrated, it is the capital of financial institutions that in the end underpins
the stability of all these transactions. As mentioned above, originators and
managers of securitised assets found themselves under pressure to provide
support to the securitisation structures and investment vehicles with which they
were associated. Uncertainty about the ability of institutions to sustain losses
from related exposures engendered a general distrust of securitised assets and
brought activity to a halt not only in the market for seasoned securities but also
in the primary market for new transactions. Finally, as money market liquidity
evaporated, the funding of off-balance sheet vehicles became entirely
dependent on the ability of the sponsoring financial institutions to meet their
backup liquidity commitments.
From a policy point of view, this interdependence between financial
institutions and markets argues in favour of strengthening the macroprudential
elements in the design of the framework and the calibration of its instruments.
The shortcomings of the originate-to-distribute model can be attributed mainly
to the failure of individual players to develop a holistic view on the risks due to
excessive focus on their narrow, individual perspective, losing sight of systemwide drivers of risk and interdependencies. Policy that has a similarly narrow
focus can also fail to take ex ante preventive action as the risks of disruptive
interactions build up. At the same time, the management of the period of
stress has already shown that, to be effective, policy responses may entail
interventions aimed at easing the strain in the markets while at the same time
helping institutions to cope with distress.

shortcomings

VIII. Conclusion: the difficult task of damage control

The current market turmoil in the world’s main financial centres is without
precedent in the postwar period. With a significant risk of recession in the
United States, compounded by sharply rising inflation in many countries, fears
are building that the global economy might be at some kind of tipping point.
These fears are not groundless. A powerful interaction between financial
market innovation, lax internal and external governance and easy global
monetary conditions over many years has led us to today’s predicament.
Rather than seeking to apportion blame, however, thoughtful reactions must
be the first priority.
Looking forward, it is crucial to put emphasis on all these elements, and
their interaction, and not just on the recent innovations in financial markets that
have received so much attention to date. Too narrow a focus has two dangers.
First, it points to remedial policies of limited scope that could prove inadequate
to manage a crisis with deep roots in the real economy as much as in the
financial sector. In particular, we need to address directly the problem of bad
debts and high debt service burdens built up over many years in some major
economies. The temptation rather to use still more credit expansion and higher
inflation to paper over these problems must be firmly resisted. Second, a focus
on shortcomings in recent financial innovations tempts policymakers to address
symptoms, not underlying causes, in taking measures to avoid similar problems
in the future. It is unquestionably important to identify “what is different”
about our current problems, but we must also recognise “what is the same”.
It cannot be denied that new developments in financial markets, in
particular inadequacies in the implementation of the originate-to-distribute
model, have had calamitous side effects. Loans of increasingly poor quality
have been made and then sold to the gullible and the greedy, the latter often
relying on leverage and short-term funding to further increase their profits. This
alone is a serious source of vulnerability. Worse, the opacity of the process
implies that the ultimate location of the exposures is not always evident. How
then to clear up the debris if it is not even clear where it lies?
These financial innovations have heightened what seems to be an
inherent tendency to “procyclicality” in liberalised financial systems. That is,
as credit expansion fuels cyclical economic growth, asset prices and optimism
rise while perceptions of risk recede. This further supports credit expansion,
not least through the provision of more collateral to allow more borrowing,
leading to spending patterns that could eventually prove unsustainable. Initial
rational exuberance might in this way become irrational, setting the stage for
a possible subsequent collapse.
Nor can it be denied, again as seen many times in the past, that there
were also deficiencies in both the internal governance and external oversight
of financial institutions. Individual firms have suffered huge losses, and forced

BIS 78th Annual Report

137

recapitalisations will dilute future returns for current shareholders. Small
wonder, then, that shareholders are outraged at the behaviour of both
managements and supervisory boards. Moreover, as evidence has
accumulated that the financial system as a whole is no longer functioning
effectively, those charged with prudential oversight must also ask themselves
what went wrong. How, for example, could a huge shadow banking system
emerge without provoking clear statements of official concern? Perhaps, as
with processes for internal governance, it is simply that no one saw any
pressing need to ask hard questions about the sources of profits when things
were going so well. One consolation is that those elements of Basel I that
contributed to the excesses, in particular the effective absence of capital
charges on off-balance sheet entities related to banks, will no longer play such
a role under Basel II. The sooner the new framework is fully implemented the
better.
Finally, it cannot be denied that a still more traditional factor was also at
work. Real interest rates – globally, and not just in a few advanced industrial
economies – have been at unusually low levels for much of this decade. With
inflation initially low and stable, policy rates, long-term rates and risk spreads
failed to increase commensurately as global growth rose to record levels. The
expansion of monetary and credit aggregates surged, while foreign exchange
reserves rose by unprecedented amounts as emerging market economies
intervened massively to keep their exchange rates from appreciating.
Moreover, as with low interest rates, the global trend towards faster monetary
and credit growth was seen in almost every major region of the world.
One plausible explanation for this extended period of easy monetary and
credit conditions is that central banks have not yet fully adjusted their domestic
policies to reflect increasingly important global influences. For many years,
global inflation was maintained at low levels, aided by the tailwinds of
numerous positive and overlapping supply shocks arising from deregulation
and technical progress, but perhaps due even more to the entry of major
emerging economies into the global trading system. However, instead of
temporarily allowing inflation to drift lower, analogously to the past treatment of
negative supply shocks, policymakers interpreted this quiescence of inflation
differently. They took it to mean that there was no good reason to raise interest
rates when growth accelerated, and no impediment to lowering them when
growth faltered. It is not fanciful, surely, to suggest that these low levels of
interest rates might inadvertently have encouraged imprudent borrowing, as
well as the eventual resurgence of inflation. Similarly, there are dangers in
saying that food and energy prices can be ignored in setting domestic policy
because they are externally driven. For the world as a whole, these are not
external supply shocks, but rather seem to have been primarily demand-driven.
These examples indicate that our domestic frameworks for policymaking need
to be better adapted to the realities of globalisation.
Given the variety of the influences underlying current economic and
financial difficulties, their interactions and their long-standing nature, we should
not expect a quick and spontaneous return to normalcy. Nor should we expect
quick and easy policy solutions. The likelihood that cleaning up after past

138

BIS 78th Annual Report

excesses will prove difficult has an important implication: it adds weight to the
argument that we need to use policy measures to lean against such creditdriven excesses in the first place. While introducing a new framework for
policymaking clearly presents difficulties, surely the massive economic costs
incurred in past crises of this sort warrant a serious investigation of the
possibilities for change.

How great are the risks to the outlook?
Against this background, while most commentators expect some slowing of
global economic growth, there is an exceptional degree of uncertainty as to
how severe the slowdown might be. One need only consider the widening
dispersion of views in the consensus forecast, as well as the unusual
differences between the forecasts of some national authorities and those of the
IMF. Divergences in the stance of monetary policy across the major regions,
while reflecting many influences, are also consistent with different assessments
about how severe the effects of the current turmoil might become for national
economies. Nor is there a great deal more certainty with respect to the
prospects for inflation, with incoming news increasingly suggesting that it is
more likely to rise further than to suddenly fall. As a result, some see parallels
today with the early 1970s, when inflationary pressures rose sharply, and
others with the early 1990s, when banking systems and the economy were
weakened by an overhang of private sector debt. In the end, both might well
prove right.
Looking back in time provides some clues as to why such a high level of
uncertainty currently prevails. How we got to where we are now was itself
highly unusual. On the real side, the impact of globalisation in recent years
has already been noted. But consider as well the unprecedented reliance on
household spending and debt accumulation in many countries during the
last upturn. On the financial side, there has been unprecedented growth in
volumes in many markets, a whole host of new instruments and many new
players. And on the policy side, the degree of sustained fiscal and monetary
stimulus needed to ensure recovery after the slowdown of 2001 was also
unprecedented. Against this background, and that of the continuing turmoil in
financial markets, it is simply implausible that traditional forecasting models
would continue to work well, if indeed they ever did.
Looking forward in time, there is significant uncertainty as to the extent
of the damaging effects on growth of a number of interactive processes. There
are interactions within the financial sector, within the real economy and
between the real and financial sectors, and potential contagion across
geographical regions. To these vulnerabilities must be added the inhibiting
effects on the real economy of rising inflation, and potential disruptions arising
from global trade imbalances. Lurking behind many of these processes is the
spectre of deleveraging, after many years of debt accumulation, and the
problem of the fallacy of composition. That is, as individual economic actors
try to deal sensibly with their own problems, they may only make everyone
else’s problems worse. Such processes can be highly non-linear, potentially

BIS 78th Annual Report

139

leading to much slower global growth than is generally expected and, for a
time at least, also to higher inflation.
Within the financial sector, the most important interaction is that between
institutions and markets. Finding it hard to estimate their own future capital
and liquidity requirements, as losses have mounted and balance sheets have
swollen involuntarily, banks in the main financial centres have already cut back
on credit to financial sector borrowers and have tightened margin requirements.
This could well intensify. In turn, those borrowers who cannot meet more
onerous credit conditions could be forced to sell assets into markets which
remain illiquid in spite of extraordinary efforts by central banks to resolve this
problem. The impact of such “fire sales” on prices, and on the capital of
financial institutions, could be substantial. Potentially, such developments
could also do further damage to market liquidity if previous market-makers,
starved of funding liquidity, were forced to reduce their activities further.
Within the real sector, the principal concern is that households facing
heavy debt burdens, and sometimes falling house prices, will seek to raise
secularly low saving rates by cutting consumption quite sharply. The fact that
in the United States and some other advanced industrial countries the stocks
of houses, cars and other durables already seem rather high could encourage
such behaviour. Unfortunately, everyone cannot save more simultaneously,
since one person’s spending is another person’s income. The end result of
such a process would be lower economic activity and employment, not only
in these countries, but also in those reliant on exporting to them. Nor would
higher US investment be likely to fill the gap. In such circumstances,
corporations might well judge that the demand for their products was unlikely
to recover for some time and would simply hold back spending while cutting
costs. Evidently, a related fall in the effective value of the US dollar would
create domestic jobs and reduce the US trade deficit, but this would only add
to the discomfort of exporters in other countries.
Between the financial and real sectors, there could also be worrying
interactions. Of greatest concern at the moment is that still tighter credit
conditions will be imposed on non-financial borrowers. While the corporate
sector globally is hardly cash constrained, this cannot be said of many large
firms that have recently been involved in leveraged buyouts. Moreover, the
financial position of the household sector in many countries is not good.
Simply losing the ability to withdraw equity from houses has, in the United
States at least, already had a significant effect on spending. But even tighter
credit conditions could exacerbate such trends, leading to more job losses and
bankruptcies, which would again feed back on the financial system.
Given the possibility of such a worsening economic and financial
environment, it would not be surprising if asset valuations also came under
further pressure, with house prices still of prime concern in many countries.
In the United States, the inventory of unsold houses remains particularly high,
and could well increase further if homeowners are tempted to walk away when
the value of their house falls below their mortgage obligations. This would
be another direct charge on the capital of the lenders, and would further
increase the downward pressure on US house prices, as well as the prices of

140

BIS 78th Annual Report

all financial instruments backed by such mortgages. In a number of countries,
commercial property prices are also beginning to soften, a development
which traditionally has been bad news for lenders. Clearly, these real-financial
interactions are potentially both complex and dangerous.
Globalisation increases the possibility of contagion across geographical
regions. There can be little doubt at this point that the US economy is facing
serious difficulties, and has the greatest potential to be hurt by interactions of
the sort just described. Moreover, there are suspicions that a number of other
countries with low household saving rates might be similarly, if perhaps less
significantly, exposed. Nevertheless, there continues to be hope that the
slowdown will spread to other countries only in a much attenuated form. In
Europe, the centre seems fundamentally strong, though the periphery is
another story. Problems in the construction sector in Spain and Ireland are
already quite evident, while some countries in eastern Europe have been
running remarkably large current account deficits. As well, their dependence
on western European banks implies another significant vulnerability, should
circumstances force those banks to retrench. Japan still has strong trade links
with the United States, and is exposed to that extent, but it seems to have
avoided the build-up of private sector debt in recent years that now threatens
many other countries.
It is also not clear whether, and if so to what extent, the emerging market
economies might “decouple” from setbacks in the advanced industrial
countries. On the one hand, their domestic demand does seem to be on an
upward trend, and exports are increasingly directed to other emerging market
countries. On the other hand, it is notable that much domestic investment, as
well as the export of goods for final assembly in other emerging market
countries, remains ultimately driven by spending in the advanced industrial
countries. Moreover, financial market influences and general confidence
effects would seem likely in an increasingly “globalised” environment. Such
arguments imply that the linkages and vulnerabilities seen in earlier cyclical
downturns have by no means been eliminated.
Rising global inflation provides a further serious and conflicting source of
concern. How high could it go, and for how long? Commodity prices have been
at the heart of the recent global acceleration, in part because neither demand
nor supply react quickly to price changes, but the underlying pressure of strong
global demand on near-term supply capacity is becoming increasingly evident
over a much broader range of markets. Further, while the quiescence of wages
and inflation expectations to date gives solace to some, others see a clear
potential for both to rise significantly. Higher prices have already cut real
consumer wages almost everywhere, even to the point of triggering social and
political unrest in a number of emerging market economies. In turn, this has
prompted many governments to resort to administrative measures to hold down
prices and restrict exports, measures which imply that underlying inflationary
forces are actually stronger than they appear. Evidently, a global economic
slowdown would help reduce overall inflationary pressures. Given the inertia in
the inflation process, however, this might still imply an uncomfortably long
period of high inflation along with slower growth. Moreover, slower growth

BIS 78th Annual Report

141

would also provide an environment in which more generalised and dangerous
protectionist pressures might well emerge.
Beyond these global risks to the inflation outlook, the prospects for both
growth and inflation in individual regions will also be affected by exchange
rate movements. One source of concern is what might happen in the markets
themselves. Against the background of a still wide US current account deficit
and rising external debt levels, the decline in the effective value of the US
dollar has to date been remarkably orderly. However, this need not be a guide
to the future. Foreign investors in US dollar assets have seen big losses
measured in dollars, and still bigger ones measured in their own currency.
While unlikely, indeed highly improbable for public sector investors, a sudden
rush for the exits cannot be ruled out completely.
Finally, whatever exchange rate changes might occur, they could have
significant costs as well as benefits. Countries like the United States, whose
currencies are depreciating, should see growth benefit from trade substitution
effects. The United States will further benefit from valuation effects, since most
of its debts are denominated in dollars while its assets are measured in
appreciating foreign currencies. Conversely, those with appreciating currencies
are likely to see growth suffer on both counts.
When it comes to the impact on inflation of exchange rate changes, the
calculation of costs and benefits is both more complex and, for some countries,
more worrisome. For example, should the dollar and sterling continue to
depreciate on an effective basis, inflationary pressures in the United States and
the United Kingdom would be expected to increase. While “pass-through” from
exchange rate changes has been relatively weak in these countries in recent
years, this has been associated with shrinking margins in exporting countries,
and enhanced efforts to keep margins up by increasing productivity relative to
wage growth. However, with time, both processes become increasingly
painful and the likelihood of an inflationary outcome correspondingly greater.
Conversely, in most of the countries whose currencies might appreciate,
particularly in Asia and western Europe, inflation is higher than desired and
the disinflationary implications of an appreciation against the dollar would be
clearly welcome.
In this last respect, Japan remains a significant and worrisome outlier.
With the effective value of the yen close to a 30-year low, a large current
account surplus and massive exchange rate reserves, the yen could eventually
rise further. In this case, against a backdrop of sagging trade and continuing
sluggish growth, a return to deflation could by no means be ruled out. While
the Japanese economy today seems to be less exposed than many others to
the various damaging interactions described above, its room for manoeuvre
on the policy front has become almost non-existent. The country has a huge
government debt, and policy rates are almost zero. In fact, this is the lingering
heritage of Japan’s long having relied almost exclusively on macroeconomic
instruments to deal with the aftermath of the bubble that burst in the early
1990s.
Together with a decade or more of sub-par growth, this continuing
downside exposure in Japan suggests two policy conclusions that might be

142

BIS 78th Annual Report

pertinent to other countries today. First, if the Japanese authorities had leaned
against the bubble earlier and more vigorously than was actually done, the
worst of the excesses of the “boom” might have been avoided. Second, their
failure to restructure corporate and financial sector debts in a timely and
orderly way made the ultimate costs of the subsequent “bust” much greater
than they would otherwise have been.

How to cope with conflicting risks?
The fundamental cause of today’s emerging problems was excessive and
imprudent credit growth over a long period. This always threatened two
unwelcome outcomes, although it was never clear which would emerge first.
One possibility was a rise in inflation as the world economy gradually
approached its near-term production potential; the second was an
accumulation of debt-related imbalances in the financial and real economy
which would at some point prove unsustainable and lead to a significant
economic slowdown. In the event, the global economy now seems to be
experiencing both unwelcome phenomena at the same time, albeit with
different countries often having significantly different degrees of exposure to
these common threats.
This presents a considerable complication for policymakers. Not leaning
vigorously against inflation pressures, which are currently rising almost
everywhere, threatens an increase in inflation expectations that might prove
very costly to rein in. But not leaning vigorously against the interacting
processes described above threatens a cumulative downward momentum in
the economy that could all too easily get out of hand. Yet these threats also
differ in their immediacy, in that inflation is actually rising, while significantly
slower growth remains only a possibility in many parts of the world. In
general, this should imply a bias of global policy towards being much less
accommodating.
This global bias agreed, the need to evaluate conflicting risks means that
monetary and fiscal policies in individual countries cannot be recommended
on the basis of “one size fits all”. Each central bank must carefully assess a
number of issues whose relative weight varies from country to country. First
in importance is the strength of existing inflationary pressures and the risk of
inflation expectations ratcheting upwards. Second, policymakers must assess
the likelihood of other potential shocks to inflation going forward. Here
considerations pertaining to commodity prices, exchange rates and terms of
trade would loom large. Third, they must evaluate the extent to which
potentially large changes in asset prices and perceptions of wealth might
affect the outlook, particularly against a backdrop of elevated debt levels.
And fourth, they must make a related judgment on the health of the financial
system and the likelihood of a credit crunch emerging.
Given the need to make difficult judgments about all these considerations,
the path of interest rates seems bound to differ across countries. While rising
inflation is a clear danger everywhere, it is already a reality in most emerging
market economies. There, food counts for more in the consumption basket,

BIS 78th Annual Report

143

the track record of price stability in some regions is less well established, and
the threats to growth from balance sheet excesses and a tightening of credit
standards seem generally less in evidence than in some key advanced
industrial countries. Of course, if monetary policy were to be tightened
relatively more in the emerging market economies, this would also imply a
greater willingness to allow their exchange rates to rise in consequence. The
latter is in any case to be recommended, both as an inflation-fighting tool and
as an instrument for reducing global trade imbalances. Since, within the
advanced industrial economies, similar considerations seem to warrant a
tighter set of policies in continental Europe (relative to the United States, where
the threat of recession seems greater), higher emerging market exchange
rates would also help alleviate upward pressure on the euro.
Of course, policy should in principle be conducted not only with a view to
resolving current problems, but also with an eye to the longer term. Again,
conflicts present themselves that offer further scope for policy divergences.
On the one hand, it is not impossible that the unwinding of the credit bubble
could, after a temporary period of higher inflation, culminate in a deflation
that might be hard to manage, all the more so given high initial nominal
debt levels. Such considerations have led some, not least in the United States,
to argue for a particularly vigorous use of monetary easing as “insurance”
against this low-probability but high-cost outcome.
However, others, notably in continental Europe, have voiced different
concerns about the future. In addition to near-term worries about higher
inflation, many suspect that significantly easier monetary policies will only
stimulate another unsustainable credit and asset price bubble – perhaps a
partial explanation for developments in commodity markets today – and that
current spending and trade imbalances will only tend to be exacerbated. Those
espousing this view would note the historical experience of serial bubbles,
particularly in the United States, and what seems to have been the need for
an ever more vigorous monetary response to successive downturns. Another,
closely related concern is that, in the end, monetary easing might even cease
to stimulate real growth at all and would only produce higher prices. Indeed,
many prewar theorists warned of just such a possibility. In failing to recognise
this possible limitation of monetary easing, the great danger is that
policymakers could delay too long in turning to other policy actions that could
prove more effective in mitigating a cumulative economic downturn.
Perhaps the most obvious policy alternative would be stimulative fiscal
policy. In most advanced industrial countries, slowdowns activate some degree
of automatic stabilisation, though this is less common in emerging market
economies. It also seems a political reality that, given the prospect of a serious
downturn, discretionary fiscal policy would be used more actively. Indeed, an
element of this has already been seen in the United States, where concerns
about a serious downturn were used to justify a fiscal stimulus package in
early 2008 that was “timely, targeted and temporary”.
At the same time, however, certain downsides must be recognised. One
is that pre-emptive fiscal stimulus, like monetary easing, might encourage an
upward shift in inflation expectations given an initial absence of excess

144

BIS 78th Annual Report

capacity. Another is that, in many countries, the explicit and implicit debts of
governments are already so high as to raise doubts about whether all noncontractual commitments will be fully honoured. Further fiscal stimulus could
then lead to a rise in risk premia, which might cause interest rates to back up.
Moreover, for countries with large external deficits or debts, the exchange rate
might also be severely affected. And, of course, the fiscal room for manoeuvre
would be further restricted given fears that taxpayers’ money might eventually
have to be used to help resolve problems of overindebtedness in the financial
or household sectors.
Principally in the United States today, but also prospectively in a number
of other countries, there has been a build-up of debts that cannot be serviced
on the originally agreed terms; US subprime mortgages are a good example
of this. In such circumstances, creditors and debtors should in principle
restructure the debt in an orderly way so as to maintain residual value to their
mutual benefit, while limiting moral hazard going forward. However, one
reason why governments might have to get involved in this process is that
existing private sector workout and liquidation procedures, and their supporting
infrastructure, could prove incapable of ensuring speedy and effective
resolutions on the scale required. Moreover, new financial instruments and
players in the world’s major financial markets constitute a further significant
impediment to private sector solutions. It is not clear where the losses are,
how they should currently be valued, or how large they might grow given
ongoing declines in the prices of underlying assets. Similarly, it is often not
clear who retains the legal authority to initiate procedures to seize what value
is presumed to remain.
Yet another complication, in sharp contrast to recurrent sovereign debt
crises, is that there are now millions of troubled borrowers, particularly US
households, as well as a myriad of lenders. And equally troubling, given the
widespread use of credit risk transfer instruments, is that the interests of
investors are no longer aligned in seeking to minimise losses by avoiding
bankruptcies. In sum, orderly private sector workouts are not going to be so
easy. Perhaps the most useful role of governments might be to see how this
state of affairs could be quickly improved.
Should governments feel it necessary to take direct actions to alleviate
debt burdens, it is crucial that they understand one thing beforehand. If asset
prices are unrealistically high, they must eventually fall. If saving rates are
unrealistically low, they must rise. And if debts cannot be serviced, they must
be written off. Trying to deny this through the use of gimmicks and palliatives
will only make things worse in the end. Against this background, it seems
worthwhile to lay out some principles, based on the handling of previous
crises in Japan, Sweden and elsewhere, while recognising at the same time
that turning principles into practice raises its own set of difficult problems.
First, in principle, the government’s actions should be quick and decisive,
with the clear objective of removing all uncertainty about future private sector
losses. This happened in the Swedish banking crisis of the early 1990s,
whereas in Japan the government took too long to act decisively. In practice,
however, it will always take some time to determine the severity of the problem

BIS 78th Annual Report

145

to be faced and to decide what to do about it. Second, in principle, losses
should fall heavily on those who incurred them in the beginning: first the
borrowers and then those who lent unwisely to them. In practice, however, the
possible implications of widespread household bankruptcies (including resulting
litigation) would also have to be seriously considered. Third, if the public sector
chooses to socialise the losses, it should be done explicitly and transparently,
without shifting potential losses onto the balance sheets of central banks. In
practice, however, as was seen in Japan in the early 1990s, inadequate
legislation pertaining to deposit insurance gave the central bank very little
alternative to providing emergency assistance to insolvent institutions. And
fourth, the moral hazard associated with the use of government money should
be counterbalanced by the introduction of forward-looking measures to prevent
similar problems arising in the future. The practical problems this raises are
discussed in the next section.
Most of the more specific suggestions for government involvement have
been directed to alleviating the likelihood of a full-blown credit crunch in global
financial markets. What is sought are ways to mute the potentially powerful
interaction between uncertainty about the solvency of borrowers, primarily
households, and the solvency of lenders. In fact, steps have already been
taken in the United States to use government and quasi-government agencies
to support mortgage markets, and thus indirectly house prices, homeowners
and lenders as well. In a number of countries, there have been calls for direct
government purchases to put a floor under the prices of a variety of financial
instruments. Of course, this conflicts directly with the need for the market to
find its own level if it is eventually to function normally again, and exposes the
government to future losses should prices continue to fall regardless. Another
approach to the problem focuses not on households’ assets but on their
liabilities, and suggests that there should be a form of blanket reduction based
on certain principles established by governments. The downsides of course are
evident: the potential direct cost to the government, the moral hazard involved,
and the political outrage as “prudent” borrowers and taxpayers are forced to
subsidise the “imprudent”.
How might governments help in reducing uncertainties about the solvency
of banks and, in turn, the threat of a credit crunch? Evidently, the first step
would be to encourage self-help. Both dividends and bonuses should be cut in
order to increase capital cushions. The private sector, whether through rights
issues or appeals to outside investors, should also be turned to for further
capital injections. This process would clearly be facilitated by greater clarity as
to the need for capital, in the light of prospective losses and also possible
involuntary increases in balance sheets. The problem, however, is that the
valuation of many structured products is difficult, because there is effectively
no market for them, and valuing them using models has many drawbacks. The
suggestion that banks might agree on a common “template” for valuations,
recognising these shortcomings, nevertheless has significant merit.
Of course, such an evaluation might also reveal that the losses are
uncomfortably large, a possibility for which the authorities should make
preparations in advance. One response, if the regulatory authorities were able

146

BIS 78th Annual Report

to determine that the estimated “fair value” losses were much greater than
seemed likely to be realised in the end, might be a temporary degree of
regulatory forbearance. Conversely, and perhaps more likely, if the regulators
felt unable to do this, then the government should not hesitate to intervene
directly subject to the principles laid out above. Mergers, takeovers, the
establishment of a “bad bank” to house bad assets, recapitalisation using
public funds and even nationalisation are all procedures that should be
contemplated depending on the circumstances.
When direct public sector intervention seems required, the domestic
legal framework and the potential need to involve foreign authorities will be
important factors constraining what might in practical terms be done. In such
circumstances, it is likely to become evident quite quickly that not enough
effort has been put into preparing for the possibility of a financial crisis of
some sort. If the authorities must muddle through regardless, the experience
will at least provide some indications of what preparations might have been
better made in advance.

Improving crisis prevention and crisis management
To be realistic, there have been financial crises with significant economic costs
since time immemorial, and we should not think they can ever be eliminated.
Nevertheless, steps can be taken in advance both to mitigate the excesses in
the expansionary phase of the credit cycle and to further reduce the costs in
the downturn through better crisis management. With the costs of the current
turn in the credit cycle becoming increasingly apparent, there should be a
corresponding political will to proceed with such improvements. Moreover, a
commitment to do so would help reduce the moral hazard likely to arise from
direct government involvement, both actual and potential, in response to the
current difficulties.
As noted in the Introduction to this Annual Report, the roots of the present
turmoil are both different from and similar to earlier such occurrences. A
number of study groups have already identified “what is different” in financial
markets today and have made many sensible suggestions for changes that
would reduce the dangers these factors now evidently pose. At the same time,
and again sensibly, these suggestions also seek to maintain wherever possible
the benefits these new developments offer. Not least, ways must be found to
turn the theoretical benefits offered by the originate-to-distribute model into a
practical reality.
What has received less attention are potential cures for “what is the same”
in the current turmoil: the inherent procyclicality of the financial system and
excessive credit growth. This lack of attention is surprising for two reasons.
First, recognising excessive credit growth as the underlying problem helps
explain not only the current financial turbulence, but imbalances in the real
economy and rising inflation as well. This is truly parsimonious. Second, it
could well be that the tendency for rapid credit expansion to have dangerous
side effects is actually growing. The trends towards globalisation and
consolidation, as well as securitisation, increase not only the likelihood of

BIS 78th Annual Report

147

excessive behaviour in the upturn but, arguably, the costs of downturns as
well.
In the light of all this, what seems needed is a new macrofinancial stability
framework to resist actively the inherent procyclicality of the financial system.
By using macroprudential regulatory instruments as well as monetary
tightening to lean against the upturn, the worst excesses could be avoided.
Indeed, faced with the anticipation of resistance from the official sector, private
sector behaviour might itself be tempered. Note, for example, how the new
focus of central banks on inflation is said to have affected the inflation
expectations process. And fewer excesses on the way up would probably
imply less damage to clean up afterwards, as well as more room to ease
policy since this would have been tightened more systematically beforehand.
The first salient feature of such a framework would be a primary focus on
systemic issues. Attention would be placed on the dangers associated with
many institutions having similar exposures to common shocks, for example a
turn in the property cycle. This would be complemented by the recognition of
endogenous interactions among and between institutions and markets that
could lead to highly non-linear outcomes. While such an approach would not
imply paying less attention to the good health of individual institutions, it
would certainly imply significantly enhanced oversight of firms that were very
large or had complex relations with other parts of the system.
The second feature would be a much more “symmetrical” or
countercyclical use of policy instruments. They would be tightened in the
expansionary phase of the credit cycle and eased in the downturn. In this
regard, the new framework would simply mirror what is now the accepted
wisdom for fiscal policy: namely, that the good times should be used to
prepare for the bad. Currently, in an upturn, neither monetary nor regulatory
instruments tend to respond systematically to emerging imbalances of the sort
described above. Moreover, regulatory instruments are commonly tightened
only when things turn bad, potentially making the downturn worse.
To be more specific, monetary policy might be tightened even with
projected inflation under control, given a sufficiently worrisome combination
of rapid credit growth, rising asset prices and distorted spending or production
patterns. In focusing on a combination of systemic indicators, this proposal is
quite different from simply targeting asset prices. Macroprudential instruments
would be used with a similar bias, either on a discretionary basis or following
some rule-based criteria, to ensure that risk spreads, loan loss provisions and
capital provisions all moved so as to reduce the amplitude of the credit cycle.
A technical challenge would be ensuring that the regulatory requirements for
individual institutions reflected their own behaviour, while at the same time
responding to system-wide developments. Fortunately, the flexibility provided
by the various pillars of Basel II eases the task of finding a solution.
A third feature would be still closer cooperation between the central
banking and regulatory communities in trying to identify the build-up of
systemic risks and in deciding what to do to mitigate them. What is needed is
a means of better integrating the particular insights of each community and
their respective analytical strengths. Increased clarity about the individual

148

BIS 78th Annual Report

responsibilities of cooperating agencies, and formal agreements to ensure that
timely decisions are taken when needed to foster systemic stability, would
also be of great practical usefulness.
There are many practical impediments to making a macrofinancial
framework operational. The first is that not everyone accepts the hypothesis
that excessive credit growth is the root of the problem. Nor is everyone agreed
that it might prove difficult to clean up the mess after such periods of excess.
While hopefully it will not come to that, if the costs of the current turmoil
continue to mount and policy measures prove largely ineffective, such beliefs
are more likely to be re-evaluated. A second problem is the practical one of
recognising when resistance to the upswing becomes necessary. And a third
problem is mustering the will to act, to take away the punch bowl at the
party, when the time is right. These problems are real but they should not be
insurmountable, and they pale against the difficulties likely to be encountered
when an unresisted boom turns to bust.
A framework designed to reduce the amplitude of credit-driven cycles will
not eliminate them. Periods of turmoil and outright crisis will then still have to
be faced and managed, and such events should also be prepared for through
the introduction of a coherent set of “safety net” measures. The adequacy of
deposit insurance schemes should be evaluated and shortcomings dealt with.
“Off-the-shelf banks” should be set up to allow crucial functions of bankrupt
banks to be maintained. Legislation should be enacted to give the authorities
the powers they need to cope with unfolding difficulties. Memoranda of
understanding, both domestic and international, need to be agreed. And war
games need to be played by those who would actually manage problems in
real time. Admittedly, there is an element of moral hazard in all efforts of this
sort. But if history is any guide, failing to make such efforts will eventually entail
recourse to still more expensive and dangerous measures during the crisis
itself. Businesses and banks are expected to undertake business continuity
planning in advance of trouble. Surely we should expect as much from
policymakers.

BIS 78th Annual Report

Organisation, governance and activities

This chapter provides an overview of the internal organisation and governance
of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). It also reviews the activities of
the Bank, and of the international groups it hosts, over the past financial year.
These activities focus on promoting cooperation among central banks and
other financial authorities, and on providing financial services to central bank
customers.

Organisation and governance of the Bank

The Bank, its management and shareholders
The BIS fosters international monetary and financial cooperation and serves as
a bank for central banks. Its head office is in Basel, Switzerland, and it has two
representative offices, one in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
the People’s Republic of China and one in Mexico City. The Bank currently
employs 578 staff from 48 countries.
The BIS fulfils its mandate by acting as:
•
a forum to promote discussion and facilitate decision-making among
central banks and to support dialogue with other authorities that have
responsibility for promoting financial stability;
•
a centre for research on policy issues confronting central banks and
financial system supervisory authorities;
•
a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; and
•
an agent or trustee in connection with international financial operations.
The Bank also hosts the secretariats of a number of committees and
organisations that seek to promote financial stability:
•
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on the
Global Financial System, the Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems and the Markets Committee were established by the Governors
of the G10 central banks during the past 40 years. They enjoy a
significant degree of autonomy in setting their agendas and structuring
their activities.
•
The Financial Stability Forum, the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors and the International Association of Deposit Insurers are
independent organisations whose secretariats are also hosted by the BIS,
but which do not report directly to the BIS or its member central banks.
•
The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics is governed by the
international central banking community and operates under the auspices
of the BIS.
Details of the role and recent activities of these committees and
organisations are provided below.

BIS 78th Annual Report

153

The Bank has three main departments: the Monetary and Economic
Department, the Banking Department and the General Secretariat. These are
supplemented by: the Legal Service; the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit,
Internal Audit and Risk Control; and the Financial Stability Institute, which
fosters the dissemination of standards and best practices to financial system
supervisors worldwide.
There are three main decision-making levels in the governance and
management of the Bank:
•
The General Meeting of member central banks. Fifty-five central banks or
monetary authorities currently have rights of voting and representation
at General Meetings. The Annual General Meeting is held within four
months of the end of the Bank’s financial year, 31 March. In 2007, 110
central banks took part, including 78 at Governor level. Delegates from
17 international institutions also attended.
•
The Board of Directors, currently comprising 20 members. Its main
responsibilities include determining the strategic and policy direction of
the Bank and supervising the Bank’s Management. The Board is assisted
by the Administrative Committee, the Audit Committee, the Banking and
Risk Management Committee and the Nomination Committee. These
committees are composed of selected Directors.
•
The General Manager, who is responsible to the Board of Directors for the
conduct of all important matters affecting the BIS as a whole. In taking
decisions on these matters, the General Manager is advised by the
Executive Committee of the Bank. The Executive Committee is chaired by
the General Manager and comprises in addition the Deputy General
Manager, the Heads of Department and other officers of similar rank
appointed by the Board.
Member central banks, Directors and senior officials, and recent changes
in the composition of the Board and Management are listed at the end of
this chapter.

Changes in the governance of the Bank
Advisory committees to the Board
With a view to further improving its governance practices, the Board
completed in 2007 a review of the structure, mandate and composition of
existing BIS Board committees. It decided to establish additional Board
committees to ensure a broader participation of Board members in the
preparation of Board decisions.
The new structure for BIS Board committees, which came into effect in
July 2007, comprises, in addition to the Administrative Committee (formerly
the Consultative Committee) and the Audit Committee, two new committees:
•
a Banking and Risk Management Committee, the purpose of which is to
provide a forum for the preparation of banking and risk management
matters to be considered and/or decided upon by the Board; and

BIS 78th Annual Report

155

•

a Nomination Committee, which assists the Board in carrying out its
responsibilities as the appointing authority for positions on the Executive
Committee of the BIS.
Furthermore, in November 2007, the Board decided to establish a
Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA) as an advisory committee to the
Board, comprising the Governors of BIS member central banks in the Americas.
Reflecting the key role that is being played by the BIS Asian Consultative
Council in guiding the activities of the BIS in Asia and the Pacific, the CCA’s
purpose will be to provide a vehicle for direct communication between the BIS
member central banks in the Americas and the BIS Board and Management
on matters of interest to the central bank community in the region.

Promotion of international financial and monetary cooperation:
direct contributions of the BIS

Regular consultations on monetary and financial matters
Every two months, the Governors and other senior officials of the BIS member
central banks convene for a series of meetings to discuss current economic
and financial developments and the outlook for the world economy and
financial markets. They also exchange views and experiences on issues of
special and topical interest to central banks. These bimonthly meetings,
normally held in Basel, are one of the most important ways in which the Bank
promotes cooperation within the central banking community. The November
2007 BIS bimonthly meetings took place in Cape Town and were hosted by
the South African Reserve Bank. On that occasion, a special roundtable
meeting of African Governors was organised to discuss the macroeconomic
performance of African countries and the challenges they face in developing
their financial markets.
The bimonthly meetings comprise, in particular, the Global Economy
Meeting and the All Governors’ Meeting. The Global Economy Meeting brings
to the discussion table more than 30 Governors of key industrial and emerging
market economies. This group monitors economic and financial developments
and assesses the risks and opportunities in the world economy and financial
markets.
The All Governors’ Meeting, in which all shareholding member central
bank Governors participate, discusses selected topics that are of general
interest to all BIS member central banks. In 2007/08, the topics discussed were:
•
the underlying causes and potential economic consequences of the
current financial turmoil;
•
the role of monetary and credit aggregates in monetary policy;
•
the purpose and design of sovereign wealth funds and the related role of
central banks; and
•
the role of central banks in financial system development. On the occasion
of this discussion, Professor Amartya Sen, the laureate of the 1998 Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economics, was invited to the BIS to present his views
on the role of central banks in democratic societies.

156

BIS 78th Annual Report

Because not all BIS member central banks are directly involved in the
work of the Basel-based committees and other organisations hosted by the
Bank, the All Governors’ Meeting also represents an opportunity to review the
activities of these specialised groupings. In 2007/08, for example, Governors
discussed the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the
light of recent financial market developments.
Other regular meetings that take place during the bimonthly gatherings
are the meetings of Governors of the G10 countries and those of Governors
of major emerging market economies, which explore themes that are of
special relevance to the respective groups of economies. Governors who are
members of the Central Bank Governance Group also meet on a regular basis.
In analysing issues related to financial stability, Governors attach
importance to their dialogue with the heads of supervisory agencies, other
financial authorities and senior executives from the private financial sector.
The Bank regularly organises informal discussions among public and private
sector representatives that focus on their shared interests in promoting and
maintaining a sound and well functioning international financial system. In
addition, the Bank organises various other meetings, on a regular or an ad hoc
basis, for senior central bank officials. In a number of these meetings,
representatives of other financial authorities, the private financial sector and
the academic community are invited to contribute to the dialogue.
Other meetings organised for senior central bankers on a less frequent
basis include:
•
the meetings of the working parties on domestic monetary policy, held in
Basel but also hosted on a regional basis by a number of central banks
in Asia, central and eastern Europe, and Latin America; and
•
the meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies,
for which this year’s theme was “Capital flows and financial assets in
emerging markets: determinants, consequences and challenges for
central banks”.

Representative Offices
The Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific (Asian Office) and that for
the Americas (Americas Office) aim to strengthen relations between the BIS
and central banks and financial supervisory authorities in the respective
regions, and to promote cooperation within each region. The Offices organise
meetings, foster the exchange of information and data, and contribute to the
Bank’s financial and economic research. The Offices also help to deliver BIS
banking services through regular visits to reserve managers in central banks
and meetings at both technical and managerial levels.

Asia-Pacific
During the past year, the BIS deepened its relationship with Asian regional
shareholders by organising joint high-level meetings with four member
central banks and collaborating in research, drawing on the resources of the
Asian research programme.

BIS 78th Annual Report

157

Meetings were held with:
•
the Central Bank of Malaysia, on the implications of financial market
development for monetary policy;
•
the Reserve Bank of India, on money market development;
•
the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, on transparency and communication in
monetary policy; and
•
the Bank of Korea, on the policy challenge posed by household debt
developments.
The Asian Office also convened meetings of reserve managers, monetary
policy operators, central bank auditors and legal experts from within and
outside the region. Asian Office economists provided secretariat services to
twice-yearly meetings of the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central
Banks (EMEAP) Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets.
In parallel, the representative of the Financial Stability Institute in the
Asian Office provided secretariat services to the EMEAP Working Group on
Banking Supervision meeting on financial stability and regulatory capital.
Asian Office economists also wrote a background note for the first meeting
of the deputy governor-level Monetary and Financial Stability Committee
of EMEAP.

Banking activity and the Asian Bond Funds
The dealing room of the Asian Office further extended the range of banking
services it offers to regional customers. An increasing number of Asian
central banks are now dealing in a diverse range of products with the BIS
Regional Treasury. In addition, the dealing room stepped up investment in the
region through increased placements with existing counterparties and some
new outlets, while maintaining a conservative risk profile.
As fund administrator, the BIS continued to provide support for public
offerings of the bond funds under EMEAP’s second Asian Bond Fund (ABF2)
initiative. Eleven central banks have provided seed money from their
international reserves for funds invested in sovereign and quasi-sovereign
bonds from eight EMEAP economies. The overall size of the funds that the
ABF2 invests in reached $3.3 billion at the end of March 2008, with $765 million
of private investment in the funds, in addition to central bank holdings, which
have grown from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. After its public launch as an
open-ended fund in Indonesia in March 2007, the ABF Indonesia Bond Index
Fund was successfully listed in December as the first Exchange Traded Fund on
the Jakarta Stock Exchange. The Pan Asia Bond Index Fund returned almost
29% in its first 33 months of operation, to the end of March 2008. This return
clearly outpaced that of US Treasury or agency debt of similar duration.

Asian Consultative Council and the BIS Special Governors’ Meeting in Asia
The Asian Consultative Council (ACC), currently chaired by Y V Reddy,
Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, offers Governors of shareholding
central banks in Asia and the Pacific a means of communication with the BIS
Board and Management. At its two meetings this year, Governors focused
their discussions on meetings to be organised and research to be carried out

158

BIS 78th Annual Report

under the three-year Asian research programme (see below). In giving the
BIS Board and Management the benefit of their views on these matters,
Governors helped to attach priority where needed and to avoid duplication
of efforts.
In February, the BIS once again organised a Special Governors’ Meeting,
this time hosted by the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai, bringing together
Governors from Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. Governors discussed supervisory
lessons of the recent financial turmoil, the economic outlook and the
development of robust money markets.

Asian research programme
The three-year Asian research programme passed its midpoint in
early 2008. Progress is being made on a series of research projects that are
intended to help regional authorities to improve monetary policy and
operations, to develop financial markets, to maintain financial stability and
to strengthen prudential policy. Research fellows from five shareholder central
banks visited the Asian Office to participate in collaborative research.
By the end of the programme, collaborative research on topics of interest
to central banks and supervisors in the region will have been organised
with almost every shareholding central bank in Asia and the Pacific, as
well as with a number of universities and research institutes in the region.
This research has not only fed into the numerous meetings organised with
regional central banks, but has also led to several publications in refereed
journals as well as the Bank’s Quarterly Review. Economists in the Asian
research programme also wrote notes on special policy issues at the request
of the ACC Governors, including one on policy responses to capital flows
in the region and another on new instruments and structured vehicles in
regional credit markets. Two Asian research networks organised under the
research programme held their first annual workshops in January.

The Americas
BIS initiatives in the Americas focused not only on shareholder central banks,
but also on additional contacts with and events that included non-shareholding
central banks, regulatory authorities and the academic community. These
resulted in several articles in various journals, as well as in the Bank’s
Quarterly Review and the BIS Papers series.
Noteworthy Americas Office activities included:
• a first conference on new financing trends in Latin America, organised
together with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and held in Mexico
City; and
• a meeting for regional central banks on capital flows, held in Uruguay.
Furthermore, the Office hosted the first meeting of the Central Bank
Governance Network to be held in the Americas and a meeting of the
Management Committee of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group;
convened meetings for reserve managers from within and outside the region,
and for central bank risk managers; and supported regional Financial Stability
Institute events.

The Americas Office also provided support for and contributed to
outreach meetings hosted by regional central banks, such as the Working
Party on Markets in Latin America with the Markets Committee, held in
Brazil; a meeting on housing finance with the Committee on the Global
Financial System in Chile; and the BIS Working Party on Monetary Policy in
Latin America held in Mexico.
As mentioned above, the Board decided in November 2007 to establish a
Consultative Council for the Americas. The CCA will be formally constituted in
2008. The Americas Office will provide secretariat services for CCA meetings,
which will be held at least once a year.

Financial Stability Institute
The mandate of the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) is to assist financial
sector supervisory authorities worldwide in strengthening oversight of
their financial systems, thereby fostering financial stability globally.
The FSI conducts a two-pronged programme designed to disseminate
standards and sound practices primarily to the banking and insurance
supervision sectors.

Meetings, seminars and conferences
The first prong of the FSI programme is the long-standing series of high-level
meetings, seminars and conferences both in Basel and at venues around the
world. In 2007, the FSI organised a total of 55 events on a broad range
of financial sector topics. More than 1,900 representatives of central banks
and banking and insurance supervisory authorities participated. The FSI
continued its series of high-level meetings for Deputy Governors and heads of
supervisory authorities, with such meetings taking place in Africa, Asia, Europe
and the Middle East. These meetings focused on Basel II implementation and
other key supervisory issues.

FSI Connect
The second prong of the FSI programme is FSI Connect, an online information
resource and learning tool for financial sector supervisors. FSI Connect
includes more than 140 tutorials covering a wide range of topics for supervisors
at all levels of experience and expertise. In the past year, a number of
tutorials were added in two new subject areas: accounting, and payment and
settlement systems. More than 150 central banks and supervisory authorities
subscribe to FSI Connect, representing approximately 8,000 users.

Other major initiatives
In 2007, the FSI published the results of a survey on institutional arrangements
for financial sector supervision in an Occasional Paper. The paper highlighted
recent trends in supervision and set out the key players involved in financial
sector supervision and the monitoring of overall financial stability. The paper
also addressed issues related to cross-sectoral and cross-border supervisory
cooperation.

BIS 78th Annual Report

Promotion of financial stability through the permanent committees
hosted by the BIS

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, chaired by Nout Wellink,
President of the Netherlands Bank, seeks to improve supervisory understanding
and the quality of banking supervision worldwide. It provides a forum for
dialogue among supervisors by exchanging information on national
supervisory arrangements; by improving the effectiveness of techniques
for supervising international banking business; and by setting minimum
supervisory standards in areas where they are considered desirable.

Responses to the market turmoil
Prior to the financial market turmoil that began in mid-2007, the Basel
Committee had initiated work streams on a variety of risk management and
supervisory topics, including liquidity risk and bank valuation practices. Given
the weaknesses revealed by the turmoil, the Basel Committee accelerated and
in some cases modified its work plans. The turmoil also taught important
lessons that have helped guide the Committee in further strengthening the
Basel II Framework. These initiatives are a core element of global efforts to
strengthen the resilience of the banking system.

Liquidity risk management and supervision
The Basel Committee’s work on liquidity risk that began in late 2006 focused
initially on supervision practices in member countries. In response to market
events, the original mandate was expanded to focus on the strengths
and weaknesses of liquidity risk management in times of difficulty and,
in February 2008, the Committee published Liquidity risk: management
and supervisory challenges. The document highlighted financial market
developments that affect liquidity risk management, discussed national
supervisory regimes, and outlined observations from the current period of
stress and potential future work related to liquidity risk management and
supervision. The Committee is now completing a fundamental review of its
Sound practices for managing liquidity in banking organisations, the global
standards for liquidity risk management and supervision, which were issued
in 2000. It plans to issue the new standards in mid-2008.

Bank valuation practices
In early 2007, the Basel Committee began a review of bank valuation practices.
The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of approaches used to
determine model-based valuations of financial instruments used for risk
management and financial reporting purposes. This initiative also reviewed the
related control, audit and governance practices surrounding these valuations. In
response to the market turmoil, the scope of the work was expanded to
include coverage of how banks responded to the market stress and initial
lessons learned. While current valuation practices and processes were not the

BIS 78th Annual Report

161

underlying cause of the market turmoil, the Basel Committee concluded that
challenges in this area had contributed to and amplified its effects. The
Committee will develop guidance for supervisors to assess the rigour of banks’
valuation processes and thereby promote improvements in risk management.

The Basel II Framework
The financial market turmoil has reaffirmed the importance of prompt
implementation of Basel II as a means to improve risk management and bank
supervision. In response to market events, the Basel Committee undertook a
review of the Basel II Framework to identify areas that could be strengthened in
each of the Framework’s three pillars: minimum capital requirements (Pillar 1),
the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) and market discipline (Pillar 3). One
such area is the strengthening of the capital requirements for the trading
book. In October 2007, the Basel Committee published a consultative
document covering Guidelines for computing capital for incremental default
risk in the trading book. The Committee now wants to extend the scope of the
proposed guidelines to include other potential event risks in the trading book.
It expects to issue its event risk proposal for public consultation in 2008.
The market turmoil has also highlighted the importance of effective
and consistent cross-border implementation of Basel II. In this context, in
November 2007 the Committee published Principles for home-host
supervisory cooperation and allocation mechanisms in the context of
advanced measurement approaches (AMA) for operational risk. In addition,
the Committee’s Accord Implementation Group continues to address practical
implementation challenges faced by the global supervisory community and
to promote consistency in the implementation of Basel II.

Other risk management and supervisory initiatives
The Basel Committee has continued to play an active role in the work to
develop international accounting and auditing standards. In this regard, it has
worked closely with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). As the use
of fair value estimates in financial statements has increased, the Committee
has been keen to ensure that these estimates are reliable, relevant and
auditable. In addition to its work on accounting standards related to financial
instruments, the Committee is also focusing on issues related to the
development of a common conceptual framework and the review of key audit
issues from a banking supervision perspective.
In 2007, the Basel Committee formed a working group to review issues
relating to the resolution of large banks with cross-border operations.
This reflects the increasing significance of cross-border banking activities
in recent years. The group will analyse existing resolution policies, allocation
of responsibilities and legal frameworks as a foundation to a better
understanding of the potential impediments and possible improvements to
cooperation in the resolution of cross-border banks.
The Basel Committee also continues to play an important role in efforts
to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In its October

162

BIS 78th Annual Report

2007 newsletter, the Committee encouraged participants from the private
and official sector to enhance transparency in international payments to aid
anti-crime efforts worldwide. It continues to review the supervisory issues
related to “cover payments” in order to reach a consensus on principles
informing supervisory policies and priorities for the implementation of the
transparency rules for international payments.

Outreach
The Basel Committee continues to expand the scope of its work to include
supervisors from non-member jurisdictions and to further enhance its
dialogue with supervisors around the world. In addition to the 13 countries
represented on the Committee, more than 20 other countries participate
directly in a variety of subgroups. This has served to increase the information
exchange among a large number of countries. It has also proven to be an
efficient way for the Committee to gain input from regions such as Asia and
Latin America, as well as to disseminate information to members of regional
groups of bank supervisors. The Committee’s International Liaison Group
(ILG) provides an additional platform for non-member countries to contribute
to new Basel Committee initiatives and to develop proposals. The Committee
will continue to explore ways to expand its dialogue with non-member
countries through the work of the ILG, meetings with regional groups of
banking supervisors and the biennial International Conference of Banking
Supervisors, as well as other mechanisms.

Committee on the Global Financial System
The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), chaired by
Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, monitors financial market developments and analyses their
implications for financial stability. The Committee, whose members are
the G10 central banks and the Central Bank of Luxembourg, regularly invites
representatives from the central banks or monetary authorities of Australia,
Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Spain
to join its discussions.
During the past year, the Committee’s agenda increasingly reflected the
unfolding financial market turmoil. In the context of its regular monitoring of
the global financial system, the CGFS discussed:
•
the causes of the broad-based credit deterioration in structured finance
and the spillovers to other segments of the financial system;
•
the effects of the recent turmoil on banks’ balance sheets, their exposures
to the credit market turmoil, including through warehouse risk, and
exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles such as structured investment
vehicles and conduits;
•
the capacity of banks to raise short-term funding and capital against the
background of continued disruptions in money and capital markets; and
•
the consequences of the rapid deterioration in credit markets and the
possible broader economic impact of tighter credit conditions.

BIS 78th Annual Report

163

In addition, the Committee established study groups to review specific
aspects of the recent market turmoil. One group was asked to investigate
how investors used rating information on structured finance products. This
topic was also discussed at a CGFS workshop with credit rating agencies
and investors in London. A second study group was asked to examine, in
coordination with the Markets Committee, the effectiveness of central banks’
responses to the tensions in money markets. The CGFS working group on
private equity and leveraged finance, which was established before the turmoil
began, also shifted its focus to the potential financial stability implications
of the rapid growth of leveraged finance markets in the light of the recent
turmoil.
As part of its efforts to improve the understanding of structural
developments in global financial markets, the Committee established a
working group to examine the financial implications of the significant rise in
capital flows to emerging market economies in recent years.
Furthermore, the Committee organised several special meetings, including
a series of regional meetings on housing finance following the publication in
2006 of its working group report on housing finance in the global financial
system, and a roundtable on the development of local currency bond markets
in Africa.

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), chaired by
Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, contributes to the strengthening of financial
market infrastructure by promoting safe and efficient payment and settlement
systems.
In July 2007, the Committee issued a consultative report entitled
Progress in reducing foreign exchange settlement risk. The report is based
on a major survey of how banks and other financial institutions manage
the risks they can incur when settling foreign exchange trades. It
concludes that although much progress has been made in tackling the
problem, evidenced most visibly by the establishment and growth of CLS
Bank, a notable share of trades is still settled in ways that generate significant
potential risk in the financial system. The report therefore recommends
specific actions by individual institutions, industry groups and central
banks to reduce and control remaining large and long-lasting exposures.
As a follow-up to the report, the Committee will be discussing with
the Basel Committee possible ways to ensure that banks apply
appropriate risk management procedures to their foreign exchange
settlement exposures.
The Committee continued to enhance cooperation among central
banks, including those of emerging market economies. It also provided
support and expertise to workshops and seminars on payment system
issues organised by the BIS in cooperation with regional central banking
organisations.

164

BIS 78th Annual Report

Markets Committee
The Markets Committee, chaired by Hiroshi Nakaso, Director General of
the Financial Markets Department of the Bank of Japan, serves as a forum
for central banks to discuss the specifics of their market operations. The
Committee brings together senior officials responsible for market operations
at G10 central banks. Representatives from the central banks or monetary
authorities of Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Korea, Mexico,
Singapore and Spain also participate regularly.
At their bimonthly meetings, and whenever it is deemed useful,
participating central banks (or a subset of them) jointly review recent
developments in financial markets and their short-run implications for the
functioning of these markets and their own operations.
Issues covered in this year’s regular meetings included:
•
the impact of monetary policy decisions on markets and possible
communication challenges;
•
the factors behind market tensions, in particular in money markets, and
the nature and effects of central bank actions to address them;
•
the consequences for currencies of sudden shifts in carry trade strategies;
and
•
the short-term patterns in global capital flows.
In addition, the Committee held special meetings, sometimes with the
private sector, to address topics of a more structural nature, such as central
bank understanding and monitoring of hedge fund strategies, changes in
commodity markets, and the growing role of sovereign funds in global capital
markets. The Committee organised, in cooperation with the Americas Office,
a working party on markets in Latin America that was hosted by the Central
Bank of Brazil.
As a result of the tensions observed in money markets, the Committee
felt the need for more frequent and detailed discussions about market
developments and the technical aspects of central bank market operations. To
enhance market transparency and the understanding of central bank actions,
the Committee also publicly released, for the first time, information on the
monetary policy frameworks and market operations of its members in the
form of a compendium. Finally, the Committee was involved in a study group
with the CGFS to examine the effectiveness of central banks’ responses to the
tensions in money markets.

Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group
The Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) is mandated by the
Governors of the G10 central banks to investigate threats to the security of
banknotes and to propose solutions for implementation by note-issuing
authorities. The CBCDG has developed anti-counterfeiting features to prevent
banknote images from being replicated by colour copiers and digital
technology (personal computers, printers and scanners). The BIS supports the
work of the CBCDG by hosting its Secretariat and by acting as its agent in
contractual arrangements.

BIS contributions to broader international financial cooperation

Group of Ten
The BIS continued to contribute to the work of the G10 Finance Ministers
and central bank Governors by participating as an observer institution and
providing secretariat support. At their annual meeting, the G10 Ministers and
Governors reviewed progress made in implementing the recommendations of
the FSF’s Report on highly leveraged institutions. They welcomed the
progress made both in the joint supervisory review of the counterparty risk
management practices of the core intermediaries and in the work by private
sector working groups in the United Kingdom and the United States to
develop best practices for hedge funds in order to strengthen market
discipline. The G10 Ministers and Governors also endorsed the renewal of the
General Arrangements to Borrow for a further five-year period.

Financial Stability Forum
The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) was established at the BIS in 1999 by G7
Finance Ministers and central bank Governors to promote international
financial stability through enhanced information exchange and cooperation in
financial supervision and surveillance. Its remit is to assess risks and
vulnerabilities affecting the international financial system and to encourage
and coordinate action to address them. The FSF comprises senior officials
from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators in key financial
centres, as well as representatives of international financial institutions (the
BIS, IMF, OECD and World Bank), international supervisory and regulatory
standard-setting bodies (the Basel Committee, the IAIS, the IASB and the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)) and central
bank expert groupings (CGFS and CPSS). The FSF is chaired by Mario Draghi,
Governor of the Bank of Italy.
The FSF normally meets twice yearly in plenary form, most recently in
September 2007 in New York and March 2008 in Rome. At these meetings,
members discussed the current challenges and vulnerabilities in financial
markets, the steps that are being taken to address them and policy options
going forward. The Forum also holds occasional regional meetings to foster
wider exchanges of views on financial vulnerabilities and relevant policy work
under way.
In May 2007, the FSF issued an update of its report on highly leveraged
institutions. While the hedge fund sector has not been the primary source of
the recent market turmoil, the severity of market problems has highlighted the
importance of ensuring sound counterparty risk management at regulated
institutions and fostering the exchange of relevant information between
hedge funds and their counterparties. The updated report examined important
issues in these areas and made a series of recommendations. The FSF
subsequently welcomed private sector initiatives to enhance guidance on
sound practices for hedge fund managers and investors. At its Rome meeting,

166

BIS 78th Annual Report

the FSF said that it would welcome regular reports on the adoption of
the standards by the hedge fund industry and on how well these standards
are meeting the objectives of increasing transparency and improving risk
management practices.
At its September 2007 meeting, the FSF reviewed its offshore financial
centres (OFC) initiative, based on a report from its OFC Review Group. The
Forum acknowledged the significant progress made by OFCs, although some
concerns remain. The FSF restated its commitment to foster compliance with
international standards, including better cooperation and information exchange.
At the request of the G7 Finance Ministers and central bank Governors,
the FSF prepared a report identifying the key weaknesses underlying
the market turmoil that started in the summer of 2007 and recommending
actions to address these weaknesses. The Report of the Financial Stability
Forum on enhancing market and institutional resilience, published in
April 2008, was prepared by a working group comprising senior officials from
major financial centres and international financial institutions and the chairs of
international supervisory and regulatory bodies. It sets out specific policy
recommendations in the following areas: prudential oversight of capital,
liquidity and risk management; transparency, disclosure and valuation
practices; the role and uses of credit ratings; and the authorities’
responsiveness to risks and their arrangements to deal with stress in the
financial system. These recommendations are concrete and operational and
the FSF will oversee their timely implementation.
The FSF has continued its support of efforts to strengthen international
accounting and auditing standards and practices. In its report to the G7, the
FSF called on accounting standard setters to enhance the financial reporting
standards for off-balance sheet vehicles, valuations and risk disclosures, while
auditing standard setters and oversight authorities were encouraged to improve
their guidance about auditing valuations of complex or illiquid financial products.
At their April 2008 meeting in Washington, the G7 Ministers and
Governors strongly endorsed the report and identified a number of
recommendations among the priorities for prompt implementation. These
include initiatives on disclosure and accounting standards, as well as work to
strengthen risk management practices and capital positions, issue liquidity risk
management guidelines, and revise codes of conduct for credit rating agencies.

International Association of Insurance Supervisors
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), hosted by the
BIS since 1998, aims to contribute to global financial stability through
improved supervision of the insurance industry, the development of standards
for supervision, international cooperation based on exchange of information,
and mutual assistance. In collaboration with other international regulatory
bodies, such as its Joint Forum partners, the Basel Committee and IOSCO,
the IAIS has helped develop principles for the supervision of financial
conglomerates. Over recent years, the IAIS has grown significantly.

BIS 78th Annual Report

167

The IAIS actively participates in the FSF and has contributed to the
activities of the FSF Working Group on Market and Institutional Resilience.
During the year, the IAIS conducted three surveys to assess the potential
impact of global financial market developments on the insurance sector. The
findings will assist in identifying and prioritising its activities and will provide
input to the FSF’s work from an insurance regulatory perspective.
During the past year, the IAIS took major steps in the following areas.

Accounting
The IAIS has a strong interest in ensuring high-quality financial reporting
that offers a meaningful, economically sound portrayal of insurers’
financial health. It closely monitors the international financial reporting
developments which will most influence the overall accounting model for
regulated insurance enterprises. In 2007, the IAIS provided substantial
input to the IASB’s work on insurance contracts, and on other projects of
relevance to insurers, such as fair value measurements. The IAIS also
comments on the International Federation of Accountants’ consultative draft
papers on the international auditing standards of most relevance to the
insurance sector.

Capital adequacy and solvency
In October 2007, the IAIS adopted three guidance papers on solvency
assessment. Aimed at facilitating greater comparability and convergence in
the international assessment of insurer solvency, these papers focus on:
•
principles-based requirements for a solvency regime in relation to
regulatory capital requirements;
•
the establishment and ongoing operation of an enterprise risk
management framework; and
•
the use of internal models as a method to assess risk, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, and manage capital.

Group supervision
Recognising the growing internationalisation of the insurance market, and the
reality that much insurance business is undertaken within a group structure,
the IAIS has made substantial progress in developing a set of principles to
facilitate more streamlined and efficient supervision of insurance groups.
Supplementary standards and guidance papers will support this work.

Reinsurance
In November 2007, the IAIS published the fourth edition of its Global
reinsurance market report, based on global reinsurance statistics submitted by
the world’s largest reinsurers. It shows that 2006 was significantly more
profitable for reinsurers than 2005, which had seen record losses.

Information sharing
Following the adoption of a Multilateral memorandum of understanding
(MMOU) in February 2007, which defines a set of principles and procedures

168

BIS 78th Annual Report

for sharing information, views and assessments, the IAIS commenced
validation of applications from interested jurisdictions.

Training
Each year, the IAIS organises some 15 regional seminars and workshops to
assist insurance supervisors in implementing its principles and standards,
in collaboration with the FSI, national insurance supervisory authorities and
other bodies. In January 2008, the IAIS rolled out IAIS DISCOVER, a series of
online tutorials complemented by workshops and distance learning events.
Launched in Beijing, three tutorials were piloted with Asian insurance
supervisors. The IAIS will develop additional tutorials based on the Core
Curriculum for Insurance Supervisors developed in cooperation with the
World Bank.
IAIS website: www.iaisweb.org.

International Association of Deposit Insurers
The International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI), hosted by the BIS
since 2002, contributes to the stability of financial systems by promoting
international cooperation and encouraging wide international contact among
deposit insurers and other interested parties. In particular, IADI:
•
enhances the understanding of common interests and issues related to
deposit insurance;
•
sets out guidance to enhance the effectiveness of deposit insurance
systems;
•
facilitates the sharing of expertise on deposit insurance issues through
training, development and educational programmes; and
•
provides advice on the establishment or enhancement of effective
deposit insurance systems.
Currently, 73 organisations (of which 51 are members) from around the
world are involved in IADI’s activities, including a number of central banks that
have an interest in promoting the adoption or operation of effective deposit
insurance systems.
One of the Association’s main objectives is to improve the effectiveness
of deposit insurance systems through the development of principles and
practices. In March 2008, IADI released Core Principles for effective deposit
insurance systems for the benefit of countries considering the adoption or
reform of a deposit insurance system. The 21 Core Principles are based on
IADI research and guidance papers and the endorsement by IADI of guidance
developed by its founding members and international organisations. In
developing them, IADI drew heavily on the experience of its members. The
Core Principles are designed to be adaptable to a broad range of country
circumstances, settings and structures.
During its sixth year of operation, IADI continued to provide many forums
for deposit insurers and other safety net participants. Highlights were:
•
the Sixth Annual Conference, themed “Deposit insurance and consumer
protection”, attended by 250 deposit insurers and policymakers from

BIS 78th Annual Report

169

52 countries with an exposition on key characteristics of depositor
protection arrangements from systems around the world, held in Kuala
Lumpur in October 2007;
•
an IADI Executive Training Program, held in Washington in July 2007,
featuring case studies on the establishment of deposit insurance
systems, and the management of depositor claims against a failed bank;
•
a symposium on cross-border issues, held in Basel in May 2007; and
•
an interregional conference on “The role of deposit insurance systems in
enhancing financial stability” in Istanbul in June 2007.
Recent regional activities have included conferences, seminars and
committee meetings in Istanbul, Prague, Washington DC, Kuala Lumpur,
San Salvador, Basel and Bali.
IADI’s interactive web portal facilitates research and provides information
on deposit insurance topics and activities to members and participants.
IADI website: www.iadi.org.

Other areas of central bank cooperation promoted by the BIS

Research activities
In addition to providing background material for meetings of senior central
bankers, as well as secretariat and analytical services to committees, the BIS
contributes to international monetary and financial cooperation by carrying
out its own research and analysis on issues of interest to central banks and,
increasingly, financial supervisory authorities. This work finds its way into the
Bank’s regular publications, such as the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review
and the BIS Papers and Working Papers series, as well as specialised
professional and academic publications. Most of the Bank’s research is
published on its website (www.bis.org).
In line with the Bank’s mission, the long-term focus of the research is on
monetary and financial stability issues. Themes receiving special attention
during the past year included:
•
the financial market turmoil: its causes and policy implications;
•
the behaviour of the interbank market;
•
the macroprudential approach to financial stability and the coordination
between monetary and prudential policies;
•
changes in the financial system and the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy;
•
transparency and communication in monetary policy;
•
the use of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models in the
policy process;
•
the measurement and pricing of credit risk;
•
the term structure of interest rates, with particular reference to term premia;
•
trends in international banking; and
•
foreign exchange reserve management practices.
As part of its research activities, the BIS also organises conferences
and workshops, typically bringing together senior policymakers, leading

170

BIS 78th Annual Report

academics and market participants. In June 2007, the Sixth BIS Annual
Conference addressed the nexus between financial system and macroeconomic
resilience.
In the second half of 2007, the BIS also organised two meetings
for central bank researchers designed to illuminate the policymaking process.
The first, which was held in September with the participation of academics,
explored the usefulness of DSGE models as policy tools. The second, held
in November, and partly based on an ad hoc survey, was devoted to a
systematic analysis of the preparation of the statistical and analytical inputs
for monetary policy decisions and the communication of the outputs.

Central bank governance
The BIS’s support for actions to improve the governance of central banks as
public policy institutions is coordinated through the Central Bank Governance
Forum. The Governance Forum consists of the Central Bank Governance
Group (comprising Governors from a broadly based and representative group
of central banks), the Central Bank Governance Network (now spanning
almost 50 central banks and monetary authorities) and a Secretariat.
The work is carried out by compiling, analysing and disseminating
information on different approaches to the operation and governance of
central banks. Interest from central banks in specific matters determines
the issues that are addressed. Last year, interest extended to issues as diverse
as central bank communications, the operation of central bank policymaking
and oversight boards, staff input into monetary policy decisions, the
organisation of the lender of last resort function, and central bank
remuneration principles and practices. In addition, a comprehensive report on
the organisation of risk management in central banks was released to central
banks. At present, work is under way on distilling key elements in the design
of a modern central bank from the information that has been amassed over
the years. A new information system is also being developed that will provide
much improved access to comparative data on central banks’ governance and
organisation to central banks.

Cooperation in the statistical area
Timely, reliable and internationally comparable economic, monetary and
financial statistics are of key importance to policymakers and market
participants. The BIS closely monitors, and actively contributes to, ongoing
efforts to improve statistics at the international, regional and national level,
particularly as regards statistics on financial developments.

Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics
By the end of 2007, all BIS shareholding central banks had become institutional
members of the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics (IFC). The
Committee is a forum for users and compilers of statistics, both within and
outside central banks, to discuss statistical issues relating to economic,

BIS 78th Annual Report

171

monetary and financial stability. It is chaired by Jan Smets, Director at the
National Bank of Belgium.
In August 2007, the IFC organised various meetings at the 56th Session of
the International Statistical Institute in Lisbon. Topics included the recording of
pension liabilities in national accounts, measures of stocks and flows in financial
accounts, measures of output and prices of financial services, and portfolio
investment statistics. The IFC also organised a series of regional workshops,
in India, Argentina and Austria, on the use of surveys by central banks, cosponsored by the respective host countries’ central banks and respective
regional central bank organisations. In March 2008 the IFC organised a workshop
on “Challenges to improve global comparison of securities statistics” at the IMF.
Proceedings of IFC meetings are published in the IFC Bulletin and posted
on the BIS website. The Committee has also launched a Working Paper series
which contains analysis by experts of the Committee’s institutional members
as well as those outside the central banking community.

International financial statistics
Last year, 54 central banks contributed to the BIS’s seventh Triennial
Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity,
covering daily turnover in foreign exchange and derivatives markets in April
2007 and amounts outstanding and gross market values at the end of June.
Thanks to improved compilation procedures, the final findings were published
in December, three months earlier than in 2004.
The movements revealed by the BIS quarterly statistics on cross-border
banking and securities issuance as well as its semiannual statistics on
over-the-counter derivatives were of particular significance during the recent
period of financial market turmoil. The banking and securities statistics
produced by the BIS are also an important data source for the Joint External
Debt Hub (JEDH), established in cooperation with the IMF, OECD and World
Bank. Cooperation between the BIS and the International Union of Credit and
Investment Insurers (the Berne Union) has resulted in new trade credit data
for the JEDH as from early 2008.
In January 2008, 35 central banks were represented at the BIS’s biennial
meeting of Experts on International Financial Statistics. Discussions focused
on methodological and organisational aspects of the various BIS-sponsored
data collection exercises. Last year, the Bank also sought the cooperation of
the central banks of the countries covered by the BIS domestic securities
statistics to improve these in line with proposals made in the CGFS report on
Financial stability and local currency bond markets.

BIS Data Bank
Forty-one BIS shareholding central banks participate in the BIS Data Bank,
through which they regularly share national data with one another. Last year,
the online facility for accessing the Data Bank was significantly improved. The
coverage of the Data Bank was expanded by the inclusion of data on payment
systems (in particular, data published by the CPSS), housing prices and daily
central bank money market operations.

Statistical information technology
Collecting, compiling, analysing and disseminating statistical data is resourceintensive, also in terms of information technology (IT). As part of a multi-year
upgrade of its own IT applications, the BIS has put into production a new
application for processing its international banking statistics. It is also
studying how it can upgrade its application supporting the BIS Data Bank and
promote the integration of its various databases and end user applications.
Furthermore, a project is under way to improve the dissemination of statistics
on the BIS website.
The BIS works closely with central banks to improve IT solutions for
exchanging and processing statistical data and metadata. In particular, it
contributes actively to the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX)
initiative, a joint effort with the ECB, Eurostat, IMF, OECD, United Nations and
World Bank. In February 2008, the UN Statistical Commission, attended by
delegations from about 130 countries and 40 international organisations,
recognised SDMX as the preferred standard for the exchange and sharing of
data and metadata, and encouraged national and international statistical
organisations to implement SDMX.
SDMX products are available via the SDMX website (www.sdmx.org) and
include:
•
technical standards, approved by the International Organization for
Standardization;
•
content-oriented guidelines for exchange of data and metadata; and
•
implementation tools that are made available by sponsoring organisations
or private sector vendors.
In addition, the website provides information about SDMX-related
developments in a growing number of statistical subject areas.

Group of Computer Experts of the G10 central banks
The Group of Computer Experts (GCE) provides a twice-yearly forum for
a number of key central banks to share technical and organisational
experiences in the area of IT. Additionally, the Working Party on Security
Issues (WPSI) meets twice a year on issues related to IT security.
In June 2007, the GCE held the Central Bank Information Technology
Exchange (CBITX), its triennial workshop, hosted this time by the Monetary
Authority of Singapore. This was preceded by a regional workshop, hosted by
the BIS, with members of the GCE and IT representatives from selected
regional central banks. Presentation and discussion sessions covered and
openly shared views on knowledge management, chargeback for IT services,
applications deployment across very large-scale organisations, IT risk
management, “build or buy” for applications, and support requirements for
high-availability systems.
At their November meeting, GCE members approved the formation of a
working group to enhance the planning of content and format for future
meetings. Special interest groups will be formed to cover topics of long-term
interest that can be cooperatively developed and presented over a series of

BIS 78th Annual Report

173

meetings. In March 2008, recognising the growing relationship between
cyber- and physical security, a joint workshop was organised by the WPSI and
the Heads of Security (HOS) from the G10 central banks plus security experts
from major non-G10 central banks. Topics discussed included business
continuity management, risk management, and organisation and strategy.
Following the success of this workshop, the WPSI and HOS groups will look
at possible future cooperation.

Cooperation with regional central bank groupings
The BIS cooperates with regional central bank groupings primarily to
disseminate its research, policy analysis and statistics to those central banks
which do not normally participate in its regular activities. During the past year
the cooperation included:
•
two seminars on “Financial stability analysis and reports”, one
organised for central banks from central and eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States at the Joint Vienna Institute, and
the other for central banks and monetary agencies of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) in Riyadh, hosted by the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency (the BIS also supported the South East Asian Central
Banks (SEACEN) in organising a seminar on this topic); and
•
lectures conducted as part of the Masters in Banking and Finance
programme of the Centre Africain d’Études Supérieures en Gestion
(CESAG), located in Dakar.
In spring 2007, the annual meeting of the Group of Coordinators of
Technical Cooperation and Training was held in Yerevan. Some 50
representatives from 36 institutions were invited to discuss recent
developments in technical cooperation among participating central banks and
international financial institutions. The Group also sponsored the organisation
of a meeting of global training providers which took place at the BIS
in autumn 2007. This was attended by representatives of 30 international
and national institutions that provide significant international training
programmes for central banks. Discussions focused on training activities,
organisational and operational aspects, and current and possible future areas
of cooperation.

Internal Audit
G10 central bank internal auditors meet regularly to share experience and
knowledge in their area of expertise, and to address new issues and
challenges. The main topics for discussion usually derive from international
auditing standards and the continuous need to improve control over the risks
faced by central banks. Twice a year, the BIS’s Internal Audit unit organises
and hosts the meetings of the G10 Working Party on IT Audit Methodologies.
In June 2007, the BIS participated in the 21st Annual Plenary Conference
of G10 Heads of Internal Audit, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. It covered topics such as: reporting to the board on internal controls;

174

BIS 78th Annual Report

cultural issues and the role of internal audit; business continuity management;
key performance indicators; and use of risk models.
BIS Internal Audit has established information sharing networks for
internal audit heads from central banks and monetary authorities in the
Asia-Pacific region, and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In October 2007,
Internal Audit and the Asian Office organised in Hong Kong SAR the fifth BIS
meeting of heads of internal audit from central banks in that region.

Financial services of the Bank

The scope of financial services
The BIS offers a wide range of financial services designed specifically to assist
central banks and other official monetary authorities in the management of
their foreign reserves. Some 130 such authorities, as well as a number of
international institutions, make active use of these services.
Safety and liquidity are the key features of these credit intermediation
services, which are supported by a rigorous internal risk management
framework. In accordance with best practice, a separate risk control unit reporting
directly to the Deputy General Manager – and ultimately to the General
Manager – monitors the Bank’s credit exposure, liquidity and market risks.
Similarly, a compliance and operational risk unit monitors the Bank’s
operational risks.
In response to the diverse – and constantly evolving – needs of central
banks, the BIS offers an extensive array of investment possibilities in terms of
currency denomination, liquidity and maturity. In addition to traditional money
market placements such as sight/notice accounts and fixed-term deposits, the
Bank offers two instruments that can be traded (bought and sold back) directly
with it: the Fixed-Rate Investment at the BIS (FIXBIS), available in maturities
from one week to one year; and the BIS Medium-Term Instrument (MTI), with
maturities from one to 10 years. A series of callable MTI structures, as well as
other instruments with embedded optionality, are also part of the standard
product range.
The Bank transacts foreign exchange and gold on behalf of its customers.
From time to time, it extends short-term credits to central banks, usually
on a collateralised basis. The BIS also acts as trustee and collateral agent
(see below).
The BIS provides asset management services in sovereign securities
or high-grade assets. These may take the form of either a specific portfolio
mandate negotiated between the BIS and a central bank or an open-end fund
structure – the BIS Investment Pool (BISIP) – allowing customers to invest in
a common pool of assets. The two Asian Bond Funds (ABF1 and ABF2) are
administered by the BIS under the BISIP umbrella: ABF1 is managed by the
BIS and ABF2 by a group of external fund managers.
BIS financial services are provided out of two linked trading rooms:
one at the Bank’s Basel head office and one at its Asian Office in
Hong Kong SAR.

Financial operations in 2007/08
In the conditions of financial turmoil that began during the summer of
2007, the Bank was confronted with increased inflows of deposits at a time
when the highly disturbed market conditions made it difficult to place them
profitably in the private financial markets at acceptable risk. Accordingly, the
BIS took a number of active measures in its banking and risk management to
address these challenges.
One set of measures was designed to slow down the inflow of deposits by
making their yields somewhat less attractive to customers. As a result of these
and other actions, growth in the Bank’s currency deposit base decelerated to
SDR 14.3 billion in 2007/08, from an average annual growth of SDR 35.6 billion
in the preceding two years. The proportion of total official foreign exchange
reserves held at the BIS declined modestly in 2007/08, to 5.8% from 6.2% a
year earlier.
The growth of the total balance sheet moderated to SDR 40.2 billion in
2007/08, from SDR 50.8 billion in 2006/07. As a result, the balance sheet total
amounted to SDR 311.1 billion at 31 March 2008.

Liabilities
The size of the BIS balance sheet is mainly driven by placements from
customers, which constitute the lion’s share of total liabilities (see graph). On
31 March 2008, customer placements (excluding repurchase agreements)
amounted to SDR 265.2 billion, compared with SDR 234.9 billion at the end of
the previous financial year.
Around 89% of customer placements are denominated in currencies,
with the remainder in gold. Currency deposits rose from SDR 221.8 billion
a year ago to SDR 236.1 billion at end-March 2008 – representing
some 5.8% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves of nearly
SDR 4.1 trillion, up from SDR 3.6 trillion at end-March 2007. The share of

currency placements denominated in US dollars was 66%, whereas eurodenominated funds accounted for 20%. Gold deposits amounted to
SDR 29.1 billion at end-March 2008, an increase of SDR 16.0 billion over the
financial year.
The expansion of customer currency placements was mainly attributable
to a 64% and 28% increase in investments in sight and notice accounts
and MTIs, respectively. This expansion more than offset a 33% decrease in
investments in fixed-term deposits.
A breakdown by geographical regions of placements with the BIS shows a
relatively stable pattern, with African and European customers accounting for
the highest share.

Assets
Most of the assets held by the BIS consist of investments with highly
rated commercial banks of international standing as well as government and
quasi-government securities, including reverse repurchase agreements. In
addition, the Bank owned 125 tonnes of fine gold at 31 March 2008, having
disposed of 25 tonnes during the financial year. The credit exposure is
managed in a very conservative manner, with almost all of the Bank’s credit
exposure rated A– or higher as at 31 March 2008 (see note 3F of the “Risk
management” section of the financial statements).
The Bank’s holdings of currency deposits and securities, including
reverse repurchase agreements, totalled SDR 266.6 billion on 31 March 2008,
up from SDR 247.9 billion at the end of the previous financial year. These
additional funds were mainly invested in reverse repurchase agreements
against government collateral, treasury bills and government and other
securities. Time deposits and advances to banks were reduced.
The Bank uses various derivative instruments in order to manage its
assets and liabilities efficiently (see note 8 to the financial statements).

Agent and trustee functions
Trustee for international government loans
The Bank continued during the year to perform its functions as trustee for
the funding bonds 1990–2010 of the Dawes and Young Loans (for details, see
the 63rd Annual Report of June 1993). The Deutsche Bundesbank, as paying
agent, notified the Bank that in 2007 the Bundesamt für zentrale Dienste und
offene Vermögensfragen (BADV – Federal Office for Central Services and
Unresolved Property Issues) had arranged for payment of approximately
€4.7 million for redemption of funding bonds and interest. Redemption
values and other details were published by the BADV in the Bundesanzeiger
(Federal Gazette).
The Bank maintained its reservations regarding the application by the
BADV of the exchange guarantee clause for the Young Loan (stated in detail
in its 50th Annual Report of June 1980), which also extend to the funding
bonds 1990–2010.

BIS 78th Annual Report

177

Collateral agent functions
Under a number of agreements, the BIS acts as collateral agent to hold and
invest collateral for the benefit of the holders of certain foreign currency
denominated bonds issued by countries under external debt restructuring
arrangements. During 2007/08, collateral pledge agreements included those
for Peruvian bonds (see the 67th Annual Report of June 1997) and Côte
d’Ivoire bonds (see the 68th Annual Report of June 1998).

Institutional and administrative matters

The Bank’s administration
Three-Year Strategic Plan
During 2007, the Management of the Bank elaborated its first Three-Year
Strategic Plan, covering the financial years to March 2011. Approved by the
Board in November 2007, it seeks to deepen and broaden key activities under
the Bank’s established mandate by:
•
strengthening the work of the BIS in fostering central bank cooperation;
•
deepening the dialogue among central banks and financial supervisors
on issues of financial stability; and
•
enhancing the banking services that the BIS provides to central banks.

Budget policy
The process of formulating the Bank’s expenditure budget for the next financial
year starts about six months in advance with the setting by Management of a
broad business orientation and financial framework.
Within this context, business areas specify their plans and the
corresponding resource requirements. The process of reconciling detailed
business plans, objectives and overall resource availability culminates in the
determination of a draft financial budget. This must be approved by the Board
before the start of the financial year.
In drawing up the budget, a distinction is made between administrative
and capital expenditures. In common with other organisations of a similar
nature to the BIS, management and staff expenses, including remuneration,
pensions and health and accident insurance, amount to around 70% of
administrative costs. Capital spending mainly relates to building and IT
investment expenditure, and can vary significantly from year to year. Most of
the Bank’s administrative and capital expenditure is incurred in Swiss francs.
Administrative expenses before depreciation during the financial year
2007/08 amounted to 233.1 million Swiss francs, 2.4% below the budget of
238.8 million Swiss francs, 1 while capital expenditure, at 24.0 million Swiss
francs, was 0.7 million below budget.
The Bank’s budgetary accounting excludes certain financial accounting adjustments, principally
relating to retirement benefit obligations, which take into account financial market and actuarial
developments. These additional factors are included under “Operating expense” disclosed in the profit
and loss account (see “Financial results and profit distribution”).

1

178

BIS 78th Annual Report

Administrative and capital expenditure reflected the priorities set in the
2007/08 budget, in which the main emphasis was on further strengthening the
resilience of the Bank’s operations and enhancing its financial controls, in
particular:
•
to strengthen financial reporting and control in the General Secretariat
and back office and support functions in the Banking Department. This
initiative complemented the enhancements made in recent years to the
Bank’s risk management, internal audit and compliance functions; and
•
to plan for enhanced business continuity arrangements to take effect in
2008/09 at a site in Europe remote from Basel.
In addition to these objectives, work continued on the following initiatives
to meet the needs of the Bank’s shareholders:
•
expanding BIS services to deepen relations with shareholders in the AsiaPacific region through continuation of the three-year policy-oriented
research programme on monetary and financial sector issues in Asia
which began in September 2006;
•
implementing the results of the activity review undertaken during
2005/06, which identified a number of areas where efficiency gains can
be realised. The implementation of the activity review has already led,
and will continue to lead over the next few years, to a reduction of
administrative costs in Basel, thereby providing the room for additional
resources for enhancing services to central banks; and
•
reinforcing building safety, renewing meeting facilities in the Tower
building and renovating the Sports Club buildings.

Remuneration policy
The jobs performed by BIS staff members are assessed on the basis of
a number of objective criteria, including qualifications, experience and
responsibilities, and are classified into distinct job grades. The job grades
are associated with a structure of salary ranges. Every three years, a
comprehensive salary survey is conducted in which BIS salaries are
benchmarked against compensation in comparable institutions and market
segments. When benchmarking BIS salaries against comparators, the Bank
focuses on the upper half of market compensation in order to attract highly
qualified staff. The analysis takes into account differences in the taxation of
compensation for the staff of the surveyed institutions. The most recent such
survey took place in the second half of 2007. As of 1 July 2008, it will result in
an alignment of the midpoints of the Bank’s salary ranges with the observed
market benchmarks.
In years between comprehensive salary surveys, the salary structure is
adjusted for the rate of inflation in Switzerland and the weighted average real
wage increase in the G10 countries. In July 2007, the salary structure was
accordingly increased by 2.9% in nominal terms. Movements of salaries of
individual staff members within the ranges of the salary structure are based
on performance.
BIS staff members have access through the Bank to a contributory health
insurance plan and a contributory defined benefit pension plan. Non-Swiss

and non-locally hired staff members recruited for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters, including senior officials, are entitled to an expatriation
allowance. In proportion to annual salary, it currently amounts to 14% for
unmarried staff members or 18% for married staff members, subject to a
ceiling. Expatriate staff members are also entitled to receive an education
allowance for their children subject to certain conditions. 2 With regard to
employment in the Representative Offices, a distinction is made between staff
members transferred from the headquarters and staff members recruited
directly for a position in a Representative Office. The employment conditions
of the former are determined in accordance with the Bank’s international
assignment policy. For staff directly recruited for a position in a Representative
Office, employment conditions are aligned with those in the market in which
the Office is located. Those staff members have access to the same health
insurance and pension plans as staff engaged for a position at the Bank’s
headquarters.
The salaries of senior officials are regularly benchmarked against
compensation in comparable institutions and market segments. In line
with the survey for other staff, the most recent executive compensation
survey took place in the second half of 2007. The results confirmed the
appropriateness of the current practice of annually adjusting the salaries of
senior officials for the rate of Swiss inflation.
As of 1 July 2007, the annual remuneration of senior officials, before
expatriation allowances, is based on the following salary structure:
734,990 Swiss francs
•
General Manager 3
•
Deputy General Manager
621,910 Swiss francs
•
Heads of Department
565,380 Swiss francs
The Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration of members
of the Board of Directors, with adjustments taking place every three years.
The overall fixed annual remuneration paid to the Board of Directors
amounts to a total of 992,760 Swiss francs as at 1 April 2008. In addition,
Board members receive an attendance fee for each Board meeting in which
they participate. Assuming the full Board is represented in all Board meetings,
the annual total of these attendance fees amounts to 921,120 Swiss francs.

which the BIS operates. The main developments were a marked increase in
uncertainties about the creditworthiness of counterparties, a rise in credit
spreads, and substantial volatility in market prices. In these conditions, there
was a “flight to quality”, as a result of which the market values of government
securities and the price of gold both rose markedly.
In the face of volatile market pricing and increased deposit inflows
arising from this flight to quality, the Bank was confronted with the combined
challenge of moderating deposit inflows and continuing to invest its borrowed
resources profitably, while maintaining a conservative risk profile. Accordingly,
Management widened the spreads below Libor for the interest rates the Bank
pays on the key classes of liabilities that it offers to central bank customers.
This was done in several steps, each time carefully gauging market
developments. In parallel, measures were also taken to reduce credit risk
exposure to commercial bank counterparties, while increasing investments in
government securities and collateralised lending to the banking sector in the
form of reverse repurchase agreements. These actions restrained the growth
in deposits during the remainder of the financial year and preserved the
underlying profitability of the Bank.

Highlights
As a result of these developments:
•
Interest margins on an accruals basis in the Bank’s borrowed funds book
widened.
•
Unrealised valuation losses were incurred on the bonds in the Bank’s
credit portfolios in the borrowed funds book as credit spreads widened
against Libor.
•
Unrealised valuation losses also resulted from the rise in the fair value of the
Bank’s liabilities as spreads on interest payable below Libor were increased.
•
Substantial realised and unrealised gains on the Bank’s own funds
investments arose as the price of gold and market values of government
securities both appreciated.
These factors led to:
•
Declines in the Bank’s net profit (–12.0%) and operating profit (–49.9%)
compared with 2006/07.4 If the change in accounting policy to introduce
bid-offer pricing had not been made, the decline in net profit would have
been 3.1%, and that in operating profit 37.7%.
•
An increase in the Bank’s equity of SDR 1,011 million during 2007/08,
compared to an increase in equity of SDR 552 million in 2006/07.
•
A significant increase in the return on equity to 9.1% in 2007/08,
compared to 5.8% in 2006/07.

Detailed review (see profit and loss account)
Net interest income accrued was SDR 973.4 million in the financial year
2007/08, 57.8% higher than the equivalent figure of SDR 616.8 million in

Part of the reduction in operating profit for 2007/08 resulted from the move to the bid-offer valuation

2006/07. This increase was primarily attributable to the higher interest
accruals margin arising from wider spreads above Libor received on the Bank’s
risk-weighted assets, as well as to the wider spreads below Libor paid on the
Bank’s liabilities, resulting from the Management decisions described above.
Net valuation movements resulted in a loss of SDR 478.7 million in
2007/08, compared to a profit of SDR 63.3 million in 2006/07.5 Within this loss,
SDR 362.4 million was attributable to the unrealised valuation loss from the
widening of credit spreads compared to Libor, which reduced the fair values
of the bonds in the Bank’s credit portfolios. This unrealised loss amounts to
around 1 per cent of the value of these portfolios (SDR 36 billion), which are
invested in top-quality financial instruments. Since the Bank normally holds
these investments until they mature, most of this unrealised valuation loss
will be recovered over the period to maturity in the next two to three years. The
remaining unrealised valuation loss (SDR 116.3 million) was attributable to the
impact of the widening of the spreads below Libor on the fair values of the
Bank’s deposit liabilities, which increased their fair value. Most of this valuation
loss will also be recovered over the next two financial years. Together, these
two types of unrealised losses incurred in 2007/08 will build in a strong positive
dynamic for the Bank’s operating profit over the next two and a half years.
In 2007/08, a net exchange loss of SDR 9.5 million was incurred, which
was attributable to the impact of the appreciation of the Swiss franc against
the SDR on the Bank’s net liabilities in that currency. In 2006/07, there was a
small exchange gain (SDR 0.9 million).
Operating expense (see note 26 to the financial statements) amounted to
SDR 154.5 million, 3.1% above the preceding year’s figure (SDR 149.8 million).
Administrative expenses before depreciation amounted to SDR 141.9 million,
3.4% above the previous year’s figure (SDR 137.8 million). The depreciation
charge of SDR 12.6 million was slightly higher than the equivalent figure for
2006/07.
As a result of the above factors, the operating profit before the
change of accounting policy for the introduction of bid-offer valuation of
financial instruments, which reflects the profits of the Bank’s ongoing
business on the same basis as in previous financial years, amounted to
SDR 331.5 million, 37.7% lower than the equivalent figure of SDR 532.5 million
for 2006/07.
The change in accounting policy to introduce bid-offer accounting
for all financial instruments resulted in a charge against profits of
SDR 75.0 million, which was primarily due to the widening of offer spreads
on the Bank’s MTI liabilities. The equivalent figure for the previous financial

5
Under the Bank’s accounting policies, which have been in force since 2003, all financial instruments in
its borrowed funds book are valued at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are taken
to the profit and loss account. The Bank acts as market-maker in certain of its currency deposit liabilities,
and as a result incurs realised profits and losses on these liabilities. The market risk inherent in these
activities is managed on an overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets, liabilities and
derivatives in the borrowed funds banking portfolios. In normal market conditions, where credit spreads
are relatively stable, the realised and unrealised profits or losses on currency deposit liabilities are offset
by realised and unrealised losses or profits on the related assets or derivatives, or on other currency
deposit liabilities.

182

BIS 78th Annual Report

year was a charge of SDR 20.2 million. As a result of this change, the Bank’s
financial liabilities are valued at their offer prices and financial assets are
valued at their bid prices.
After taking into account the change in accounting policy, the Bank’s
operating profit amounted to SDR 256.5 million, 49.9% lower than the
equivalent figure of SDR 512.3 million recorded in 2006/07.
A net loss of SDR 5.1 million was incurred on the sale of investment
securities during the financial year. This resulted from the realignment of the
Bank’s investment portfolio to its underlying benchmark position and reflected
the sale of securities acquired when interest rates were lower. In 2006/07, a net
loss of SDR 27.0 million was recorded for the sale of investment securities.
The realised gain of SDR 293.3 million on sales of gold investment assets
during 2007/08 arose from the sale of 25 tonnes from the Bank’s total holdings
of 150 tonnes at 31 March 2007. In 2006/07, a lower gain (SDR 133.9 million)
was recorded on the sale of 15 tonnes of the Bank’s own gold at the lower
gold prices then prevailing.
As a result of these factors, the net profit for the 78th financial year,
2007/08, amounted to SDR 544.7 million, 12.0% lower than the equivalent
figure of SDR 619.2 million in the preceding year, which has been restated to
reflect the change of accounting policy described above. If the change in
accounting policy to introduce bid-offer pricing had not been made, net
profit for 2007/08 would have been SDR 619.7 million, 3.1% lower than the
equivalent figure of SDR 639.4 million in 2006/07.
In addition to the items reflected in the Bank’s profit and loss account,
unrealised gains and losses on the Bank’s own gold investments and
investment securities are recorded in the gold revaluation account and
securities revaluation account, respectively, which are accounts which form
part of the Bank’s equity.
The securities revaluation account increased by SDR 352.5 million as a
result of unrealised gains on investment securities (+SDR 347.4 million) and a
transfer of realised losses (+SDR 5.1 million) from the profit and loss account.
The gold revaluation account also increased, by SDR 252.8 million, as a
result of unrealised gains of SDR 546.1 million resulting from the impact of the
appreciating gold price in 2007/08 on the Bank’s own gold holdings. Of this
amount, SDR 293.3 million was transferred to the profit and loss account,
being realised gains on the sales of gold investment assets.
After taking these gains into account, the Bank’s total return 6 was
SDR 1,150.0 million. This represented a return of 9.1% on average equity
(SDR 12,586 million). In 2006/07, the total return was SDR 684.8 million, and
the return on average equity (SDR 11,860 million) was 5.8%. Taking into
account the payment of the dividend for 2006/07 and the move to bid-offer

Proposed dividend
During the financial year 2005/06, the Board reviewed the dividend policy of
the BIS, taking into consideration the Bank’s capital needs and the interests
of BIS shareholders in obtaining a fair and sustainable return on their
investments in BIS shares. The Board concluded that the approach of
increasing the dividend by SDR 10 each year continued to be broadly
consistent with these considerations. This approach resulted in an increase in
the dividend from SDR 235 per share in 2004/05 to SDR 255 in 2006/07. The
Board also decided to review the dividend policy every two to three years,
taking into account changing circumstances where necessary. The Board
review of the level of the dividend, originally scheduled for 2007/08, will take
place in the financial year 2008/09. Taking into account the developments in
2007/08 described above, the Board proposes that the dividend for 2007/08 be
increased again by SDR 10 to SDR 265 per share.

Proposed distribution of the net profit for the year
On the basis of Article 51 of the Statutes, the Board of Directors
recommends to the Annual General Meeting that the net profit of SDR 544.7
million for the financial year 2007/08 be applied by the General Meeting in the
following manner:
1. SDR 144.7 million in payment of a dividend of SDR 265 per share;
2. SDR 40.0 million to be transferred to the general reserve fund; 7
3. SDR 6.0 million to be transferred to the special dividend reserve fund;
and
4. SDR 354.0 million, representing the remainder of the available net profit,
to be transferred to the free reserve fund. This fund can be used by the
Board of Directors for any purpose that is in conformity with the Statutes.
If approved, the dividend will be paid on 3 July 2008 according to each
shareholder’s instructions in any constituent currency of the SDR, or in Swiss
francs, to the shareholders named in the Bank’s share register on 31 March
2008. The proposed dividend of SDR 265 per share for the financial year
2007/08 represents a 3.9% increase over the dividend for 2006/07.
The full dividend will be paid on 546,125 shares. The number of issued
and paid-up shares is 547,125. Of these shares, 1,000 were held in treasury
at 31 March 2008, namely the suspended shares of the Albanian issue. No
dividend will be paid on these treasury shares.

Allocation of reduction of the Bank’s statutory reserves
at 31 March 2007
The introduction of the new accounting policy for bid-offer valuations of the
Bank’s financial instruments has decreased the Bank’s statutory reserves at

7
Since the general reserve fund exceeded four times the Bank’s paid-up capital at 31 March 2007,
Article 51 of the Bank’s Statutes requires that 10% of the profit after payment of the dividend shall be paid
into this fund, until its balance equals five times the paid-up capital.

31 March 2007 by SDR 71.3 million, of which SDR 20.2 million relates to the
financial year 2006/07 and SDR 51.1 million to financial years before 2006/07.
The Board of Directors recommends that this decrease be reflected in
reductions in the Bank’s free reserve fund of SDR 20.2 million for 2006/07 and
SDR 51.1 million for the financial years before 2006/07.

Report of the auditors
The Bank’s financial statements have been duly audited by Deloitte AG,

In accordance with Article 15 of its Statutes, the Bank’s capital is held by central banks only. The legal
status of the Yugoslav issue of the capital of the BIS is currently under review following the constitutional
changes in February 2003 which transformed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the State Union of
Serbia and Montenegro, with two separate central banks, and the Republic of Montenegro’s subsequent

Accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied to
both of the financial years presented unless otherwise
stated.

1. Scope of the financial statements
These financial statements contain all assets and liabilities
that are controlled by the Bank and in respect of which the
economic benefits as well as the rights and obligations lie
with the Bank.
Assets and liabilities in the name of but not controlled by
the Bank and in respect of which the economic benefits as
well as the rights and obligations do not lie with the Bank
are not included in these financial statements. Information
on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is disclosed in
note 33.

4. Designation of financial instruments
Upon initial recognition the Bank allocates each financial
instrument to one of the following categories:

•
•

Loans and receivables

•
•

Available for sale financial assets

Financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

The allocation to these categories is dependent on the
nature of the financial instrument and the purpose for
which it was entered into, as described in Section 5 below.
The resulting designation of each financial instrument
determines the accounting methodology that is applied, as
described in the accounting policies below. Where the
financial instrument is designated as held at fair value
through profit and loss, the Bank does not subsequently
change this designation.

5. Asset and liability structure
2. Functional and presentation currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Bank is
the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The SDR is calculated from a basket of major trading
currencies according to Rule O–1 as adopted by the
Executive Board of the IMF on 30 December 2005 and
effective 1 January 2006. As currently calculated, one SDR
is equivalent to the sum of USD 0.632, EUR 0.410, JPY 18.4
and GBP 0.0903. The composition of this currency basket is
subject to review every five years by the IMF; the next
review is due to be undertaken in December 2010.
All figures in these financial statements are presented in
SDR millions unless otherwise stated.

3. Currency translation

Assets and liabilities are organised into two sets of
portfolios:

A. Banking portfolios
These comprise currency and gold deposit liabilities and
related banking assets and derivatives.
The Bank operates a banking business in currency and gold
on behalf of its customers. In this business the Bank takes
limited gold price, interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The Bank designates all currency financial instruments in
its banking portfolios (other than cash and sight accounts
with banks, call and notice accounts and sight and notice
deposit account liabilities) as held at fair value through
profit and loss. The use of fair values in the currency
banking portfolios is described in Section 9 below.
All gold financial assets in these portfolios are designated
as loans and receivables and all gold financial liabilities are
designated as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost.

Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into SDR at
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Other
assets and liabilities are recorded in SDR at the exchange
rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Profits and losses
are translated into SDR at an average rate. Exchange
differences arising from the retranslation of monetary
assets and liabilities and from the settlement of
transactions are included as net foreign exchange gains
or losses in the profit and loss account.

BIS 78th Annual Report

199

B. Investment portfolios

8. Sight and notice deposit account liabilities

These comprise assets, liabilities and derivatives relating
principally to the investment of the Bank’s equity.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are short-term monetary
liabilities. They typically have notice periods of three days
or less and are included under the balance sheet heading
“Currency deposits”.

The Bank holds most of its equity in financial instruments
denominated in the constituent currencies of the SDR,
which are managed using a fixed duration benchmark of
bonds.
The relevant currency assets (other than cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts) are
designated as available for sale. Related securities sold
under repurchase agreements are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.
In addition, the Bank maintains some of its equity in more
actively managed portfolios. The currency assets in these
portfolios are trading assets and as such are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss.
The remainder of the Bank’s equity is held in gold. The
Bank’s own gold holdings are designated as available for
sale.

6. Cash and sight accounts with banks
Cash and sight accounts with banks are included in the
balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued interest
where applicable.

7. Call and notice accounts

Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as financial liabilities measured at
amortised cost. They are included in the balance sheet at
their principal value plus accrued interest. Interest is
included in interest expense on an accruals basis.

9. Use of fair values in the currency banking
portfolios
In operating its currency banking business, the Bank acts
as a market-maker in certain of its currency deposit
liabilities. As a result of this activity the Bank incurs
realised profits and losses on these liabilities.
In accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies
the market risk inherent in this activity is managed on an
overall fair value basis, combining all the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking
portfolios. The realised and unrealised profits or losses on
currency deposit liabilities are thus largely offset by
realised and unrealised losses or profits on the related
currency assets and derivatives, or on other currency
deposit liabilities.
To reduce the accounting inconsistency that would arise
from recognising realised and unrealised gains and losses
on different bases, the Bank designates the relevant assets,
liabilities and derivatives in its currency banking portfolios
as held at fair value through profit and loss.

Call and notice accounts are short-term monetary assets.
They typically have notice periods of three days or less and
are included under the balance sheet heading “Time
deposits and advances to banks”.
Due to their short-term nature, these financial instruments
are designated as loans and receivables. They are included
in the balance sheet at their principal value plus accrued
interest. Interest is included in interest income on an
accruals basis.

10. Currency deposit liabilities held at fair
value through profit and loss
As described above, all currency deposit liabilities, with
the exception of sight and notice deposit account
liabilities, are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.
These currency deposit liabilities are initially included in
the balance sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The
subsequent accrual of interest to be paid and amortisation
of premiums received and discounts paid are included in
“Interest expense”.
After trade date, the currency deposit liabilities are
revalued to fair value, with all realised and unrealised
movements in fair value included under the profit and loss
account heading “Net valuation movement”.

200

BIS 78th Annual Report

11. Currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, time deposits and
advances to banks and government and other securities.
As described above, the Bank designates all of the relevant
assets in its currency banking portfolios as held at fair
value through profit and loss. In addition, the Bank
maintains certain actively managed investment portfolios.
The currency assets in these portfolios are trading assets
and as such are designated as held at fair value through
profit and loss.

14. Gold
Gold comprises gold bars held in custody and sight
accounts. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a financial
instrument.
Gold is included in the balance sheet at its weight in gold
(translated at the gold market price and USD exchange rate
into SDR). Purchases and sales of gold are accounted for on
a settlement date basis. Forward purchases or sales of gold
are treated as derivatives prior to the settlement date.
The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold is described in Section 17 below.

These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with all realised and unrealised movements in fair
value included under the profit and loss account heading
“Net valuation movement”.

15. Gold deposit assets
Gold deposit assets comprise fixed-term gold loans to
commercial banks. Gold is considered by the Bank to be a
financial instrument.
Gold deposit assets are included in the balance sheet on a
trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the
gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.

12. Currency assets available for sale
Currency assets include treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, time deposits and
advances to banks, and government and other securities.

Interest on gold deposit assets is included in interest
income on an accruals basis. The treatment of realised
and unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in
Section 17 below.

As described above, the Bank designates as available for
sale all of the relevant assets in its currency investment
portfolios, except for those assets in the Bank’s more
actively managed investment portfolios.
These currency assets are initially included in the balance
sheet on a trade date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual
of interest and amortisation of premiums paid and
discounts received are included in “Interest income”.
After trade date, the currency assets are revalued to fair
value, with unrealised gains or losses included in the
securities revaluation account, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”. Realised
profits on disposal are included under the profit and loss
heading “Net loss on sales of securities available for sale”.

16. Gold deposit liabilities
Gold deposit liabilities comprise sight and fixed-term
deposits of gold from central banks. Gold is considered by
the Bank to be a financial instrument.
Gold deposit liabilities are included in the balance sheet on
a trade date basis at their weight in gold (translated at the
gold market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest.
Interest on gold deposit liabilities is included in interest
expense on an accruals basis. The treatment of realised
and unrealised gains or losses on gold is described in
Section 17 below.

13. Short positions in currency assets
Short positions in currency assets are included in the
balance sheet under the heading “Other liabilities” at
market value on a trade date basis.

17. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest is
included in “Interest expense”.

The treatment of realised and unrealised gains or losses on
gold depends on the designation as described below:

After trade date, those liabilities that are designated as
held at fair value through profit and loss are revalued to
fair value, with unrealised gains or losses included under
the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.

A. Banking portfolios, comprising gold deposit
liabilities and related gold banking assets
The Bank designates gold deposit assets in its banking
portfolios as loans and receivables and gold deposit
liabilities as financial liabilities measured at amortised
cost. The gold derivatives included in the portfolios are
designated as held at fair value through profit and loss.

19. Derivatives

Gains or losses on these transactions in gold are
included under the profit and loss account heading “Net
foreign exchange gain / (loss)” as net transaction gains or
losses.

Derivatives are used either to manage the Bank’s market
risk or for trading purposes. They are designated as
financial instruments held at fair value through profit and
loss.

Gains or losses on the retranslation of the net position in
gold in the banking portfolios are included under the profit
and loss account heading “Net foreign exchange gain /
(loss)” as net translation gains or losses.

They are initially included in the balance sheet on a trade
date basis at cost. The subsequent accrual of interest and
amortisation of premiums paid and discounts received are
included in “Interest income”.

B. Investment portfolios, comprising gold
investment assets
The Bank’s own holdings of gold are designated and
accounted for as available for sale assets.
Unrealised gains or losses on the Bank’s gold investment
assets over their deemed cost are taken to the gold
revaluation account in equity, which is reported under the
balance sheet heading “Other equity accounts”.
For gold investment assets held on 31 March 2003 (when
the Bank changed its functional and presentation currency
from the gold franc to the SDR) the deemed cost is
approximately SDR 151 per ounce, based on the value of
USD 208 that was applied from 1979 to 2003 following a
decision by the Bank’s Board of Directors, translated at the
31 March 2003 exchange rate.
Realised gains or losses on disposal of gold investment
assets are included in the profit and loss account as “Net
gain on sales of gold investment assets”.

18. Securities sold under repurchase
agreements
Where these liabilities are associated with the
management of currency assets held at fair value through
profit and loss, they are designated as financial
instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.
Where these liabilities are associated with currency assets
available for sale, they are designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

202

After trade date, derivatives are revalued to fair value, with
all realised and unrealised movements in value included
under the profit and loss account heading “Net valuation
movement”.
Derivatives are included as either assets or liabilities,
depending on whether the contract has a positive or a
negative fair value for the Bank.
Where a derivative contract is embedded within a host
contract which is not accounted for as held at fair value
through profit and loss, it is separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though it
were a standalone derivative as described above.

20. Valuation policy
The Bank’s valuation policy has been approved by the
Board of Directors. In this policy the Bank defines how
financial instruments are designated, which determines
their valuation basis and accounting treatment. This policy
is supplemented with detailed valuation procedures.
The majority of the financial instruments on the balance
sheet are included at fair value. The Bank defines the fair
value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable,
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
The use of fair values ensures that the financial reporting
to the Board and shareholders reflects the way in which
the banking business is managed and is consistent with
the risk management economic performance figures
reported to Management.
The Bank considers published price quotations in active
markets as the best evidence of fair value. Where no
published price quotations exist, the Bank determines fair

BIS 78th Annual Report

values using a valuation technique appropriate to the
particular financial instrument. Such valuation techniques
may involve using market prices of recent arm’s length
market transactions in similar instruments or may make
use of financial models. Where financial models are used,
the Bank aims at making maximum use of observable
market inputs (eg interest rates and volatilities) as
appropriate, and relies as little as possible on own
estimates. Such valuation models comprise discounted
cash flow analyses and option pricing models.

23. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of events arising
before the balance sheet date and it is probable that
economic resources will be required to settle the
obligation, provided that a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Best estimates and
assumptions are used when determining the amount to be
recognised as a provision.

Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair
values, the valuation models and key inputs are periodically
reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the
Banking Department.
The Bank has an independent price verification unit
which periodically reviews instrument valuations. Other
valuation controls include the review and analysis of daily
profit and loss.
The Bank values its assets at the bid price and its liabilities
at the offer price. Financial assets and liabilities that are
not valued at fair value are included in the balance sheet
at amortised cost.

24. Post-employment benefit obligations
The Bank operates three post-employment benefit
arrangements for staff pensions, Directors’ pensions and
health and accident insurance for current and former
staff members. An independent actuarial valuation is
performed annually for each arrangement.

A. Staff pensions

21. Accounts receivable and accounts payable
Accounts receivable and accounts payable are principally
very short-term amounts relating to the settlement of
financial transactions. They are initially recognised at fair
value and subsequently included in the balance sheet at
amortised cost.

22. Land, buildings and equipment
The cost of the Bank’s buildings and equipment is
capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets concerned, as follows:
Buildings – 50 years
Building installations and machinery – 15 years
Information technology equipment – up to 4 years
Other equipment – 4 to 10 years
The Bank’s land is not depreciated. The Bank undertakes an
annual review of impairment of land, buildings and
equipment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is
greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written
down to that amount.

BIS 78th Annual Report

The Bank provides a final salary defined benefit pension
arrangement for its staff, based on a fund without separate
legal personality, out of which benefits are paid. The fund
assets are administered by the Bank for the sole benefit of
current and former members of staff who participate in the
arrangement. The Bank remains ultimately liable for all
benefits due under the arrangement.
The liability in respect of the staff pension fund is based on
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date, less the fair value of the fund assets at
the balance sheet date, together with adjustments for
unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service
costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated using
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined from the
estimated future cash outflows. The rate used to discount
the cash flows is determined by the Bank based on the
market yield of highly rated corporate debt securities in
Swiss francs which have terms to maturity approximating
the terms of the related liability.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the sum of the current service cost of the
benefits accruing for the year under the scheme, and
interest at the discount rate on the defined benefit
obligation. In addition, actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments (where the actual outcome is
different from the actuarial assumptions previously
made), changes in actuarial assumptions and
amendments to the pension fund regulations are charged
to the profit and loss account over the service period of
staff concerned in accordance with the “Corridor
accounting” methodology described below. The resulting
liabilities are included under the heading “Other
liabilities” in the balance sheet.

203

B. Directors’ pensions
The Bank provides an unfunded defined benefit
arrangement for Directors’ pensions. The liability, defined
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit
and loss account in respect of the Directors’ pension
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

C. Post-employment health and accident benefits
The Bank provides an unfunded post-employment health
and accident benefit arrangement for its staff. The liability,
benefit obligation and amount charged to the profit and
loss account in respect of the health and accident benefit
arrangement are calculated on a similar basis to that used
for the staff pension fund.

D. Corridor accounting
Actuarial gains or losses arise from experience
adjustments (where the actual outcome is different from
the actuarial assumptions previously made), changes in
actuarial assumptions and amendments to the pension
fund regulations. Where the cumulative unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses exceed the higher of the benefit
obligation or any assets used to fund the obligation by
more than a corridor of 10%, the resulting excess outside
the corridor is amortised over the expected remaining
service period of the staff concerned.

25. Cash flow statement
The Bank’s cash flow statement is prepared using an
indirect method. It is based on the movements in the
Bank’s balance sheet, adjusted for changes in financial
transactions awaiting settlement.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and sight
accounts with banks, and call and notice accounts, which
are very short-term financial assets that typically have
notice periods of three days or less.

204

BIS 78th Annual Report

Notes to the financial statements

1. Introduction
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS, “the Bank”) is
an international financial institution which was established
pursuant to the Hague Agreements of 20 January 1930, the
Bank’s Constituent Charter and its Statutes. The
headquarters of the Bank are at Centralbahnplatz 2, 4002
Basel, Switzerland. The Bank maintains representative
offices in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China (for Asia and the Pacific) and in
Mexico City, Mexico (for the Americas).
The objectives of the BIS, as laid down in Article 3 of its
Statutes, are to promote cooperation among central banks,
to provide additional facilities for international financial
operations and to act as trustee or agent for international
financial settlements. Fifty-five central banks are currently
members of the Bank. Rights of representation and voting
at General Meetings are exercised in proportion to the
number of BIS shares issued in the respective countries.
The Board of Directors of the Bank is composed of the
Governors and appointed Directors from the Bank’s
founder central banks, being those of Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States
of America, as well as the Governors of the central banks of
Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland, and the President of the European Central
Bank.

Assumptions include forward-looking estimates, for
example relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities,
the assessment of post-employment benefit obligations
and the assessment of provisions and contingent
liabilities.
Judgment is exercised when selecting and applying the
Bank’s accounting policies. The judgments relating to the
designation and valuation of financial instruments are
another key element in the preparation of these financial
statements.
Subsequent actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

Significant judgments relating to the valuation of
financial assets and liabilities
There is no active secondary market for certain of the
Bank’s financial assets and financial liabilities. Such assets
and liabilities are valued using valuation techniques which
require judgment to determine appropriate valuation
parameters. Changes in assumptions about these
parameters could materially affect the reported fair values.
The valuation impact of a 1 basis point change in spread
assumptions is shown in the table below:

For the financial year ended 31 March

SDR millions
Securities purchased under resale
agreements

2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the
Bank’s Management to make some estimates in arriving at
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the financial year. To arrive at
these estimates, the Management uses available
information, exercises judgment and makes assumptions.

3. Impact of change of accounting policy
During the financial year 2007/08 the Bank changed its valuation policy for financial instruments. All financial assets are now
valued using bid prices, and all financial liabilities are now valued using offer prices. The Bank believes that this change in
valuation policy better reflects the fair value of its financial instruments and brings its valuation policy into line with recent
developments in global accounting frameworks. The following table shows the previous and new valuation conventions:

6. Currency assets
A. Total holdings

B. Gold investment assets

Currency assets comprise treasury bills, securities
purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans, and
government and other securities.

The Bank’s gold investment assets are included in the
balance sheet at their weight in gold (translated at the gold
market price and USD exchange rate into SDR) plus
accrued interest. The excess of this value over the deemed
cost value is included in the gold revaluation account
(reported under the balance sheet heading “Other equity
accounts”), and realised gains or losses on the disposal of
gold investment assets are recognised in the profit and
loss account.

Currency assets held at fair value through profit and loss
comprise those currency banking assets that represent the
reinvestment of customer deposits and those currency
investment assets that are part of more actively managed
portfolios. Currency assets available for sale comprise the
remainder of the Bank’s currency investment assets and
represent, for most part, the investment of the Bank’s
equity.

Note 19 provides further analysis of the gold revaluation
account. Note 28 provides further analysis of the net gain
on sales of gold investment assets.
The table below analyses the movements in the Bank’s
gold investment assets:

208

Securities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse
repurchase agreements”) are transactions under which
the Bank makes a fixed-term loan to a counterparty which
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
loan is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and there
is an irrevocable commitment to return the equivalent
securities subject to the repayment of the loan. During the
term of the agreement the fair value of collateral is
monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where
appropriate to protect against credit exposure.

BIS 78th Annual Report

Fixed-term loans are primarily investments made with commercial banks. Also included in this category are investments made
with central banks and international institutions, including advances made as part of committed and uncommitted standby
facilities. The balance sheet total “Time deposits and advances to banks” also includes call and notice accounts (see note 7).
Government and other securities are debt securities issued by governments, international institutions, other public institutions,
commercial banks and corporates. They include fixed and floating rate bonds and asset-backed securities.

Total currency assets

There is no active secondary market for the Bank’s securities purchased under resale agreements, fixed-term loans and for certain
government and other securities. These assets are valued using valuation techniques which require judgment to determine
appropriate valuation parameters. A 1 basis point change in spread assumptions for the three categories of financial instruments
would have had an impact on the valuation of SDR 16.6 million (2007: SDR 14.5 million).

8. Derivative financial instruments

of interest rates and currencies (cross-currency interest
rate swaps). Except for certain currency and gold swaps
and cross-currency interest rate swaps, no exchange of
principal takes place.

The Bank uses the following types of derivative
instruments for economic hedging and trading purposes.

Currency and gold forwards represent commitments to
purchase foreign currencies or gold at a future date. This
includes undelivered spot transactions.

Interest rate and bond futures are contractual obligations
to receive or pay a net amount based on changes in interest
rates or bond prices on a future date at a specified price
established in an organised market. Futures contracts are
settled daily with the exchange. Associated margin
payments are settled by cash or marketable securities.

Forward rate agreements are individually negotiated
interest rate forward contracts that result in cash
settlement at a future date for the difference between a
contracted rate of interest and the prevailing market rate.

Currency and gold options are contractual agreements
under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but
not the obligation, to either buy (call option) or sell (put
option), by or on a set date, a specific amount of a currency
or gold at a predetermined price. In consideration, the
seller receives a premium from the purchaser.

Swaptions are options under which the seller grants the
purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a
currency or interest rate swap at a predetermined price by
or on a set date. In consideration, the seller receives a
premium from the purchaser.

Options on futures are contractual agreements that confer
the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures
contract at a predetermined price during a specified period
of time. In consideration, the seller receives a premium
from the purchaser.

In addition, the Bank sells products to its customers which
contain embedded derivatives (see notes 11 and 12).
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host
contract for accounting purposes and treated as though
they are regular derivatives where the host contract is not
accounted for as held at fair value. As such, the gold
currency options embedded in gold dual currency deposits
are included within derivatives as currency and gold
options.

Currency and gold swaps, cross-currency interest rate
swaps and interest rate swaps are commitments to
exchange one set of cash flows for another. Swaps result in
an economic exchange of currencies, gold or interest rates
(for example, fixed rate for floating rate) or a combination

Currency deposits are book entry claims on the Bank. The
currency deposit instruments are analysed in the table
below:

The Bank acts as a sole market-maker in certain of its
currency deposit liabilities and has undertaken to repay at

Medium-Term Instruments (MTIs) are fixed rate
investments at the BIS for quarterly maturities of up to 10
years.
Callable MTIs are MTIs that are callable at the option of the
Bank at an exercise price of par, with call dates between
June 2008 and December 2009 (2007: April 2007 and May
2008).
FIXBIS are fixed rate investments at the BIS for any
maturities between one week and one year.
FRIBIS are floating rate investments at the BIS with
maturities of one year or longer for which the interest rate
is reset in line with prevailing market conditions.
Fixed-term deposits are fixed rate investments at the BIS,
typically with a maturity of less than one year. The Bank
also takes fixed-term deposits that are repayable on the
maturity date either in the original currency or at a fixed
amount in a different currency at the option of the Bank
(dual currency deposits). The amount of dual currency
deposits included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2008
was SDR 161.4 million (2007: SDR 6,654.9 million). These
deposits all matured in April 2008 (2007: between April and
June 2007).

Currency deposits (other than sight and notice deposit
accounts) are included in the balance sheet at fair value.
This value differs from the amount that the Bank is
contractually required to pay at maturity to the holder of
the deposit. For total currency deposits the amount that the
Bank is contractually required to pay at maturity to the
holder of the deposit, plus accrued interest to 31 March
2008, is SDR 234,822.0 million (2007: SDR 224,059.0
million).
The Bank uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair
value of its currency deposits. These valuation techniques
comprise discounted cash flow models and option pricing
models. The discounted cash flow models value the
expected cash flows of financial instruments using
discount factors that are partly derived from quoted
interest rates (eg Libor and swap rates) and partly based
on assumptions about spreads at which each product is
offered to and repurchased from customers.
The spread assumptions are based on recent market
transactions in each product. Where the product series has
been closed to new investors (and thus there are no recent
market transactions) the Bank uses the latest quoted
spread for the series as the basis for determining the
appropriate model inputs.
The option pricing models include assumptions about
volatilities that are derived from market quotes.
A change of 1 basis point in spread assumptions used
for valuing currency deposits at the balance sheet date
would have had an impact on the Bank’s valuation of
SDR 30.0 million (2007: SDR 23.3 million)

B. Impact of changes in the Bank’s creditworthiness
The fair value of the Bank’s liabilities would be affected by
any change in its creditworthiness. If the Bank’s creditworthiness deteriorated, the value of its liabilities would
decrease, and the change in value would be reflected as a
valuation movement in the profit and loss account. The
Bank regularly assesses its creditworthiness as part of its
risk management processes. The Bank’s assessment of its
creditworthiness did not indicate a change which could
have had an impact on the fair value of the Bank’s liabilities
during the period under review.

Sight and notice deposit accounts are very short-term
financial liabilities, typically having a notice period of three
days or less. They are designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.

BIS 78th Annual Report

213

12. Gold deposit liabilities

15. Other liabilities

Gold deposits placed with the Bank originate entirely from
central banks. They are all designated as financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost.

As at 31 March

The Bank also takes gold deposits that are repayable on the
maturity date either in gold or at a fixed amount of currency
at the option of the Bank (gold dual currency deposits). The
embedded gold currency option is included in the balance
sheet as a derivative financial instrument and is accounted
for at fair value. The amount of gold dual currency deposits
within gold deposit liabilities at 31 March 2008 was
SDR 54.1 million (2007: none). All of these deposits
matured in April 2008.

13. Securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repo”
liabilities) are transactions under which the Bank receives
a fixed-term deposit from a counterparty to which it
provides collateral in the form of securities. The rate on the
deposit is fixed at the beginning of the transaction, and
there is an irrevocable commitment to repay the deposit
subject to the return of equivalent securities. Securities
sold under repurchase agreements originate entirely from
commercial banks.
As at 31 March 2008 and 2007 all of the securities sold
under repurchase agreements were associated with the
management of currency assets available for sale. They
are therefore all designated as financial liabilities
measured at amortised cost.

19. Other equity accounts

The Bank’s Statutes provide for application of the Bank’s
annual net profit by the Annual General Meeting on the
proposal of the Board of Directors to three specific reserve
funds: the legal reserve fund, the general reserve fund and
the special dividend reserve fund; the remainder of the net
profit after payment of any dividend is generally allocated
to the free reserve fund.

Other equity accounts represent the revaluation accounts
of the currency assets available for sale and gold
investment assets, which are further described in notes 6
and 5 respectively.

Legal reserve fund. This fund is currently fully funded at
10% of the Bank’s paid-up capital.
General reserve fund. After payment of any dividend, 10%
of the remainder of the Bank’s annual net profit currently
must be allocated to the general reserve fund. When the
balance of this fund equals five times the Bank’s paid-up
capital, such annual contribution will decrease to 5% of the
remainder of the annual net profit.
Special dividend reserve fund. A portion of the remainder
of the annual net profit may be allocated to the special
dividend reserve fund, which shall be available, in case of
need, for paying the whole or any part of a declared
dividend. Dividends are normally paid out of the Bank’s net
profit.
Free reserve fund. After the above allocations have been
made, any remaining unallocated net profit is generally
transferred to the free reserve fund.
Receipts from the subscription of BIS shares are allocated
to the legal reserve fund as necessary to keep it fully
funded, with the remainder being credited to the general
reserve fund.
The free reserve fund, general reserve fund and legal
reserve fund are available, in that order, to meet any losses
incurred by the Bank. In the event of liquidation of the Bank,
the balances of the reserve funds (after the discharge of the
liabilities of the Bank and the costs of liquidation) would be
divided among the Bank’s shareholders.

20. Post-employment benefit obligations

As at 31 March

SDR millions
The Bank operates three post-employment arrangements:
1. A final salary defined benefit pension arrangement for
its staff. The pension arrangement is based on a fund
without separate legal personality, out of which benefits
are paid. The fund assets are administered by the Bank
for the sole benefit of current and former members of
staff who participate in the arrangement. The Bank
remains ultimately liable for all benefits due under the
arrangement.
2. An unfunded defined benefit arrangement for its
Directors, whose entitlement is based on a minimum
service period of four years.
3. An unfunded post-employment health and accident
benefit arrangement for its staff. Entitlement to this
arrangement is based in principle on the employee
remaining in service up to 50 years of age and the
completion of a minimum service period of 10 years.
All arrangements are valued annually by independent
actuaries.

The Bank’s special legal status in Switzerland is set out
principally in its Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss
Federal Council. Under the terms of this document the
Bank is exempted from virtually all direct and indirect taxes
at both federal and local government level in Switzerland.
Similar agreements exist with the government of the
People’s Republic of China for the Asian Office in Hong
Kong SAR and with the Mexican government for the Office
for the Americas.

The financial instruments held under the above
arrangements are deposited with external custodians,
either central banks or commercial institutions.

34. Commitments
The Bank provides a number of committed standby
facilities for its customers. As at 31 March 2008 the
outstanding commitments to extend credit under
these committed standby facilities amounted to
SDR 6,767.7 million (2007: SDR 7,211.8 million), of
which SDR 304.6 million was uncollateralised (2007:
SDR 336.0 million).

year are included in the table above along with other

In addition, the Bank operates a blocked personal deposit
account for certain staff members who were previously
members of the Bank’s savings fund, which closed on
1 April 2003. The terms of these blocked accounts are such
that staff members cannot make further deposits and
balances are paid out when they leave the Bank. The
accounts bear interest at a rate determined by the
Bank based on the rate offered by the Swiss National Bank
on staff accounts plus 1%. The total balance of
blocked accounts at 31 March 2008 was SDR 20.8 million
(2007: SDR 18.9 million). They are reported under the
balance sheet heading “Currency deposits”.

B. Related party central banks and connected
institutions
The BIS provides banking services to its customers, who
are predominantly central banks, monetary authorities
and international financial institutions. In fulfilling this
role, the Bank in the normal course of business enters
into transactions with related party central banks and
connected institutions. These transactions include making
advances, and taking currency and gold deposits.
It is the Bank’s policy to enter into transactions with related
party central banks and connected institutions on similar
terms and conditions to transactions with other, nonrelated party customers.

38. Contingent liabilities

The Bank maintains sight accounts in currencies with
related party central banks and connected institutions,
the total balance of which was SDR 539.3 million as at
31 March 2008 (2007: SDR 144.7 million). Gold held in
sight accounts with related party central banks and
connected institutions totalled SDR 27,499.7 million as at
31 March 2008 (2007: SDR 11,837.7 million).

The Bank is indirectly involved in legal proceedings in
France arising out of the mandatory repurchase in 2001 of
the shares in the BIS held by private shareholders.

Derivative transactions with related party central
banks and connected institutions
The BIS enters into derivative transactions with its related
party central banks and connected institutions, including
foreign exchange deals and interest rate swaps. The total
nominal value of these transactions with related party
central banks and connected institutions during the
year ended 31 March 2008 was SDR 43,655.5 million
(2007: SDR 17,005.8 million).

A damages claim was initiated in September 2004 before
the Commercial Court in Paris by a group of claimants who
allegedly sold BIS shares in the market during the period
between the announcement of the proposed mandatory
share repurchase on 11 September 2000 and the resolution
on 8 January 2001 by the Extraordinary General Meeting
effectuating the repurchase. The claim was brought not
against the BIS, but rather against JP Morgan & Cie SA and
Barbier Frinault, who advised the Bank on the appropriate
compensation for the repurchase. That notwithstanding,
the Bank faces indirect liability through an indemnification
clause in its contract with JP Morgan & Cie SA with respect
to litigation and costs that might arise in connection with
the advisory services performed. No provision has been
made for this claim.
In its judgment of 9 October 2006, the Commercial Court in
Paris rejected the claim. A number of claimants have,
however, requested review of this decision by the Paris
Court of Appeals.
The BIS is not currently involved in any other significant
legal proceedings.

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy continuously. The
assessment is supported by an annual capital planning
process. The Bank’s business planning supports this
capital planning process.
The Bank has implemented a risk framework that is
consistent with the revised “International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards “ (Basel II
Framework) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in June 2006. The implementation includes all
three pillars of the Framework, and takes the particular
scope and nature of the Bank’s activities into account.
Since the Bank is not subject to national banking
supervisory regulation, the application of Pillar 2 is limited
to the Bank’s own assessment of capital adequacy. This
assessment is based primarily on an economic capital
methodology which is more comprehensive and geared to
a substantially higher solvency level than the minimum
Pillar 1 capital level required by the Basel II Framework.
The Tier 1 capital for 31 March 2007 has been reduced by
SDR 51.1 million following a change of accounting policy
for bid-offer accounting of financial instruments.

2. Risk-weighted assets and minimum capital requirements under the Basel II Framework
The Basel II Framework includes several approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets and the corresponding minimum capital
requirements. In principle, the minimum capital requirements are determined by taking 8% of the risk-weighted assets.
The following table summarises the relevant exposure types and approaches as well as the risk-weighted assets and the minimum
capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

For credit risk, the Bank has adopted the advanced internal
ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.
Under this approach, the risk weighting for a transaction is
determined by the relevant Basel II risk weight function
using the Bank’s own estimates for key inputs. For certain
exposures, the Bank has adopted the standardised
approach. Under this approach, risk weightings are
mapped to exposure types.
Risk-weighted assets for market risk are derived following
an internal models approach. For operational risk, the
advanced measurement approach is used. Both these
approaches rely on value-at-risk (VaR) methodologies. The
minimum capital requirements are derived from the VaR
figures and are translated into risk-weighted assets taking
into account the 8% minimum capital requirement.
More details on the assumptions underlying the
calculations are provided in the sections on credit risk,
market risk and operational risk.

3. Tier 1 capital ratio
The capital ratio measures capital adequacy by comparing
the Bank’s Tier 1 capital with its risk-weighted assets. The
table below shows the Bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, consistent
with the Basel II Framework.

As required by the Basel II Framework, expected loss is
calculated for credit risk exposures subject to the advanced
internal ratings-based approach. Since the BIS does not
hold any provisions due to the high credit quality of its
credit exposures, the Bank deducts the expected loss from
Tier 1 capital consistent with the Basel II Framework.
The Bank maintains a very high creditworthiness and
performs a comprehensive capital assessment considering
its specific characteristics. As such, it maintains a capital
position substantially in excess of the minimum
requirement.
The Bank’s Tier 1 ratio under the Basel Capital Accord of
1988 was 34.6% as at 31 March 2008 (2007 restated:
29.7%). The material difference between the Bank’s Tier 1
capital ratio under the Basel II Framework and the 1988
Accord is attributable mainly to the higher risk sensitivity
of the Basel II approaches.

Risk management

1. Risks faced by the Bank
The Bank supports its customers, predominantly central
banks, monetary authorities and international financial
institutions, in the management of their reserves and
related financial activities.
Banking activities form an essential element of meeting the
Bank’s objectives and as such ensure its financial strength
and independence. The BIS engages in banking activities
that are customer-related as well as activities that are
related to the investment of its equity, each of which may
give rise to financial risk comprising credit risk, market risk
and liquidity risk. The Bank is also exposed to operational
risk.
Within the risk framework defined by the Board of
Directors, the Management of the Bank has established
risk management policies designed to ensure that risks are
identified, appropriately measured and limited as well as
monitored and reported.

2. Risk management approach and organisation
General approach
The Bank maintains superior credit quality and adopts a
prudent approach to financial risk-taking, by:

•
•

maintaining an exceptionally strong capital position;

•
•

seeking to diversify its assets across a range of sectors;

•

investing its assets predominantly in high credit
quality financial instruments;

adopting a conservative approach to its tactical market
risk-taking and carefully managing market risk
associated with the Bank’s strategic positions, which
include its gold holdings; and
maintaining a high level of liquidity.

A. Organisation
Under Article 39 of the Bank’s Statutes, the General
Manager is responsible to the Board for the management
of the Bank, and is assisted by the Deputy General
Manager. The Deputy General Manager is responsible for
the Bank’s independent risk control and compliance
functions. The General Manager and the Deputy General
Manager are supported by senior management advisory
committees.

232

The key advisory committees are the Executive Committee,
the Finance Committee and the Compliance and
Operational Risk Committee. The first two committees are
chaired by the General Manager and the third by the
Deputy General Manager, and all include other senior
members of the Bank’s Management. The Executive
Committee advises the General Manager primarily on the
Bank’s strategic planning and the allocation of resources,
as well as on decisions related to the broad financial
objectives for the banking activities and operational risk
management. The Finance Committee advises the General
Manager on the financial management and policy issues
related to the banking business, including the allocation of
economic capital to risk categories. The Compliance and
Operational Risk Committee acts as an advisory committee
to the Deputy General Manager and ensures the
coordination of compliance matters and operational risk
management throughout the Bank.
The independent risk control function for financial risks is
performed by the Risk Control unit. The independent
operational risk control function is shared between Risk
Control, which maintains the operational risk quantification,
and the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. Both units
report directly to the Deputy General Manager.
The Bank’s compliance function is performed by the
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit. The objective of
this function is to provide reasonable assurance that the
activities of the Bank and its staff conform to applicable
laws and regulations, the BIS Statutes, the Bank’s Code of
Conduct and other internal rules, policies and relevant
standards of sound practice.
The Compliance and Operational Risk Unit identifies and
assesses compliance risks and guides and educates staff
on compliance issues. The Head of the Compliance and
Operational Risk Unit also has a direct reporting line to the
Audit Committee, which is an advisory committee to the
Board of Directors.
The Finance unit and the Legal Service complement the
Bank’s risk management. The Finance unit operates an
independent valuation control function, produces the
Bank’s financial statements and controls the Bank’s
expenditure through setting and monitoring the annual
budget. The objective of the independent valuation control
function is to ensure that the Bank’s valuations comply with
its valuation policy and procedures, and that the processes
and procedures which influence the Bank’s valuations
conform to best practice guidelines. The Finance unit has a
direct reporting line to the Secretary General.

BIS 78th Annual Report

The Legal Service provides legal advice and support
covering a wide range of issues relating to the Bank’s
activities. The Legal Service has a direct reporting line to
the General Manager.
The Internal Audit function reviews internal control
procedures and reports on how they comply with internal
standards and industry best practices. The scope of
internal audit work includes the review of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information systems
and governance processes. Internal Audit has a direct
reporting line to the Audit Committee and is responsible to
the General Manager and the Deputy General Manager.

B. Risk monitoring and reporting
The Bank’s financial and operational risk profile, position
and performance are monitored on an ongoing basis by the
relevant units. Financial risk and compliance reports aimed
at various management levels are regularly provided to
enable Management to adequately assess the Bank’s risk
profile and financial condition.
Management reports financial and risk information to the
Board of Directors on a bimonthly basis. Furthermore, the
Audit Committee receives regular reports from Internal
Audit, the Compliance and Operational Risk Unit and the
Finance unit. The Banking and Risk Management
Committee, another advisory committee to the Board,
receives regular reports from the Risk Control unit and the
Banking Department. The preparation of these reports is
subject to comprehensive policies and procedures, thus
ensuring strong controls.

C. Risk methodologies
The Bank uses a comprehensive range of quantitative
methodologies for valuing financial instruments and for
measuring risk to the Bank’s net profit and its equity. The
Bank reassesses its quantitative methodologies in the light
of its changing risk environment and evolving best practice.
The Bank’s model validation policy defines the roles
and responsibilities and processes related to the
implementation of new or materially changed risk models.
A key methodology used by the Bank to measure and
manage risk is the calculation of economic capital based on
value-at-risk (VaR) techniques. VaR expresses the
statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss on the
current positions of the Bank measured to a specified level
of confidence and a specified time horizon.
The Bank’s economic capital calculation is designed to
measure the amount of equity needed to absorb losses
arising from its exposures to a statistical level of
confidence determined by the Bank’s aim to remain of the
highest creditworthiness.

BIS 78th Annual Report

The Bank assesses its capital adequacy on the basis of
economic capital frameworks for market risk, credit risk
and operational risk, supplemented by sensitivity and risk
factor analyses. The Bank’s economic capital frameworks
measure economic capital to a 99.995% confidence interval
assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank allocates economic capital to the above risk
categories. An additional amount of economic capital is set
aside based on Management’s assessment of risks which
are not (or not fully) reflected in the economic capital
calculations.
A comprehensive stress testing framework complements
the Bank’s risk assessment including its VaR and economic
capital calculations for financial risk. The Bank’s key
market risk factors and credit exposures are stress-tested.
The stress testing includes the analysis of severe historical
and adverse hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, as
well as sensitivity tests of extreme but still plausible
movements of the key risk factors identified. The Bank also
performs stress tests related to liquidity risk.

3. Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to meet
its obligations in accordance with the agreed contractual
terms and conditions.
The Bank manages credit risk within a framework and
policies set by the Board of Directors and Management.
These are complemented by more detailed guidelines and
procedures at the level of the independent risk control
function.

A. Credit risk assessment
Credit risk is continuously controlled at both a counterparty
and a portfolio level. As part of the independent risk control
function, individual counterparty credit assessments are
performed subject to a well defined internal rating process,
involving 18 rating grades. As part of this process, a
counterparty’s financial statements and market information
are analysed. The rating methodologies depend on the
nature of the counterparty. Based on the internal rating and
specific counterparty features, the Bank sets a series of
credit limits covering individual counterparties and
countries. Internal ratings are assigned to all counterparties.
In principle, the ratings and related limits are reviewed at
least annually. The main assessment criterion in these
reviews is the ability of the counterparties to meet interest
and principal repayment obligations in a timely manner.
Credit risk limits at the counterparty level are approved by
the Bank’s Management and fit within a framework set by
the Board of Directors.

233

On an aggregated level credit risk, including default and
country transfer risk, is measured, monitored and limited
based on the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit
risk. To calculate economic capital for credit risk, the Bank
uses a portfolio VaR model, assuming a one-year time
horizon and 99.995% confidence interval. Management
limits the Bank’s overall exposure to credit risk by
allocating an amount of economic capital to credit risk.

The Bank mitigates settlement risk by using established
clearing centres and by settling transactions where
possible through a delivery versus payment settlement
mechanism. Daily settlement risk limits are monitored on
a continuous basis.

C. Default risk by asset class and issuer type
The following table represents the exposure of the Bank to
default risk at 31 March 2008, without taking account of any
collateral held or other credit enhancements available to
the Bank. The exposures set out in the table below are
based on the carrying value of the assets on the balance
sheet as categorised by sector. Gold and gold deposits
exclude gold held in custody, and accounts receivable do
not include unsettled liability issues, because these items
do not represent credit exposures of the Bank. The carrying
value is the fair value of the financial instruments,
including derivatives, except in the case of very short-term
financial instruments (sight and notice accounts) and gold,
which are shown at amortised cost. Commitments are
shown at their notional amounts.

B. Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk is mitigated through the use of collateral and
legally enforceable netting or setoff agreements. The
corresponding assets and liabilities are not offset on the
balance sheet.
The Bank obtains collateral, under reverse repurchase
agreements, some derivative financial instrument contracts
and certain drawn-down facility agreements, to mitigate
counterparty default risk in accordance with the respective
policies and procedures. The collateral value is monitored
on an ongoing basis and, where appropriate, additional
collateral is requested.

institutions rated A– or above. Limitations on the number
of high-quality counterparties in these sectors mean that
the Bank is exposed to single-name concentration risk.

D. Default risk by geographical exposure
The following tables show the Bank’s exposure to default
risk, as categorised by geographical region. For these
tables, the Bank has allocated exposures to regions based
on the country of incorporation of each legal entity. Gold
and gold deposits exclude gold held in custody and
accounts receivable do not include unsettled liability
issues, because these items do not represent credit
exposures of the Bank. The exposures set out are at fair
value with the exception of gold and very short-term
financial instruments (sight and notice accounts), which
are shown at amortised cost.

reverse repurchase agreements and collateral agreements
for certain interest rate swaps. The Bank is allowed to sell
or repledge this collateral, but must deliver equivalent
financial instruments upon the expiry of the contract.
Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements
comprises sovereign and supranational debt as well as US
agency securities. Eligible collateral for interest rate swaps
comprises US treasuries. No collateral was repledged or
sold during the financial year 2007/08.
The Bank grants facilities which are secured against either
deposits made with the Bank or units held by customers in
funds managed by the Bank. As of 31 March 2008 the total
amount of undrawn facilities which could be drawn down
subject to collateralisation by the counterparty was
SDR 6,463.1 million (2007: SDR 6,875.8 million).
The Bank provides collateral for securities sold under
repurchase agreements. This collateral consists of
government or agency securities.

F. Credit quality per class of financial asset

The following table shows the credit quality of the Bank’s
on-balance sheet financial instruments. The ratings shown
reflect the Bank’s internal ratings expressed as equivalent
external ratings. Gold and gold deposits exclude gold held
in custody and accounts receivable do not include
unsettled liability issues, because these items do not
represent credit exposures of the Bank. The Bank’s
holdings of financial instruments are included in the table
below at fair values, with the exception of gold deposits
and very short-term financial instruments (cash and sight
and notice accounts), which are shown at amortised cost.
The table shows that the vast majority of the Bank’s
exposure is rated equivalent to A– or above.

A financial asset is considered past due when a
counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual
due date. The Bank revalues virtually all of its financial
assets to fair value on a daily basis and reviews its
valuations monthly, taking into account necessary
adjustments for impairment. As of 31 March 2008 and 2007
the Bank had no financial assets which were considered
past due and no adjustment for impairment was necessary.

BIS 78th Annual Report

G. Minimum capital requirements for credit risk

Key inputs to the risk weight function are a counterparty’s
estimated one-year probability of default (PD) as well as
the estimated loss-given-default (LGD) and maturity for
each transaction.

Exposures to sovereigns, banks and corporates
For the calculation of risk-weighted assets for exposures to
banks, sovereigns and corporates, the Bank has adopted
an approach that is consistent with the advanced internal
ratings-based approach for the majority of its exposures.

Due to the high credit quality of the Bank’s investments and
the conservative credit risk management process at the
BIS, the Bank is not in a position to estimate PDs and
LGDs based on own default experience. In the absence of
internal default data, the Bank calibrates counterparty PD
estimates through a mapping of internal rating grades to
external credit assessments taking external default data
into account. Similarly, LGD estimates are derived from
external data. Where appropriate, these estimates are
adjusted to reflect the risk-reducing effect of collateral
obtained giving consideration to market price volatility,
remargining and revaluation frequency.

As a general rule, under this approach risk-weighted assets
are determined by multiplying the credit risk exposures
with risk weights derived from the relevant Basel II risk
weight function using the Bank’s own estimates for key
inputs. These estimates for key inputs are also relevant to
the Bank’s economic capital calculation for credit risk.
The credit risk exposure for a transaction or position is
referred to as the exposure at default (EAD). The Bank
determines the EAD as the notional amount of all on- and
off-balance sheet credit exposures, except derivatives. The
EAD for derivatives is calculated using an approach
consistent with the internal model method proposed under
the Basel II Framework. In line with this methodology, the
Bank calculates effective expected positive exposures that
are then multiplied by a factor alpha as set out in the
Framework.

The table below details the calculation of risk-weighted
assets. The exposures are measured taking netting and
collateral benefits into account. The total amount of
exposures reported in the table as of 31 March 2008
includes SDR 5,998.3 million for interest rate contracts and
SDR 2,823.1 million for FX and gold contracts.

H. Securitisation exposures
The Bank holds only highly rated securitisation exposures. Risk-weighted assets for these exposures are determined using the
standardised approach.
Given the scope of the Bank’s activities, risk-weighted assets under the Basel II Framework are determined according to the
standardised approach for securitisation. Under this approach, external credit assessments’ risk weights are used to determine
the relevant risk weights. External credit assessment institutions used for determining the risk weights assigned to those
exposures are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Risk-weighted assets are then derived as the
product of the notional amounts of the exposures and the associated risk weights.

4. Market risk

A. Gold price risk

The Bank is exposed to market risk through adverse
movements in market prices. The main components of the
Bank’s market risk are gold price risk, interest rate risk and
foreign exchange risk. The Bank incurs market risk
primarily through the assets relating to the management of
its equity. The Bank measures market risk and calculates
economic capital based on a VaR methodology using a
Monte Carlo simulation technique. Risk factor volatilities
and correlations are estimated using a one-year
observation period. Furthermore, the Bank computes
sensitivities to certain market risk factors.

Gold price risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in the price of gold.

In line with the Bank’s objective to maintain its superior
credit quality, economic capital is measured at the 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.
The Bank’s Management manages market risk economic
capital usage within a framework set by the Board of
Directors. VaR limits are supplemented by operating limits.
VaR models depend on statistical assumptions and the
quality of available market data; and while forward-looking,
they extrapolate from past events.
To ensure that models provide a reliable measure of
potential losses over the one-year time horizon, the Bank
has established a comprehensive regular backtesting
framework,
comparing
daily
performance
with
corresponding VaR estimates. The results are analysed
and reported to Management.
The Bank also supplements its market risk measurement
based on VaR modelling and related economic capital
calculations with a series of stress tests. These include
severe historical scenarios, adverse hypothetical
macroeconomic scenarios and sensitivity tests of gold
price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements.

240

The Bank is exposed to gold price risk principally through
its holdings of gold investment assets, which amount to
125 tonnes (2007: 150 tonnes). These gold investment
assets are held in custody or placed on deposit with
commercial banks. At 31 March 2008 the Bank’s
gold position was SDR 2,247.0 million (2007:
SDR 2,115.2 million), approximately 17% of its equity
(2007: 17%). The Bank sometimes also has small
exposures to gold price risk emerging from its banking
activities with central and commercial banks. Gold price
risk is measured within the Bank’s VaR methodology,
including its economic capital framework and stress tests.

B. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in interest rates.
The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk principally through
the interest bearing assets relating to the management of
its equity. These assets are managed using a fixed duration
benchmark of bonds. Limited interest rate risk also arises
from accepting and reinvesting customer deposits.
The Bank measures and monitors interest rate risk using a
VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses taking into
account movements in relevant money market rates,
government bonds, swap rates and credit spreads.

C. Foreign exchange risk
The Bank’s functional currency, the SDR, is a composite
currency comprising fixed amounts of USD, EUR, JPY and
GBP. Currency risk is the exposure of the Bank’s financial
condition to adverse movements in exchange rates. The
Bank is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily through
the assets relating to the management of its equity. The
Bank is also exposed to foreign exchange risk through
managing its customer deposits and through acting as an
intermediary in foreign exchange transactions between
central and commercial banks. The Bank reduces its
foreign exchange exposures by matching the relevant
assets to the constituent currencies of the SDR on a regular
basis, and by limiting currency exposures arising from
customer deposits and foreign exchange transaction
intermediation.

BIS 78th Annual Report

Foreign exchange risk is measured and monitored based
on the Bank’s VaR methodology and sensitivity analyses
considering movements in key foreign exchange rates.
The following tables show the Bank’s assets and liabilities
by currency and gold exposure. The net foreign exchange
and gold position in these tables therefore includes the
Bank’s gold investments. To determine the Bank’s net
foreign exchange exposure the gold amounts need to be
removed. The SDR neutral position is then deducted from
the net foreign exchange position excluding gold to arrive
at the net currency exposure of the Bank on an SDR neutral
basis.

D. Market risk VaR by risk type and in total
The Bank measures market risk based on a VaR methodology using a Monte Carlo simulation technique taking correlations
between risk factors into account. Economic capital for market risk is also calculated following this methodology measured to the
99.995% confidence interval and assuming a one-year holding period. The Bank measures its gold price risk relative to changes
in the USD value of gold. The foreign exchange risk component, resulting from changes in the USD exchange rate versus the
SDR, is included in the measurement of foreign exchange risk. Key figures of the Bank’s exposure to market risk in terms of
economic capital over the past two financial years are highlighted in the tables below:

For the calculation of minimum capital requirements for market risk under the Basel II Framework, the Bank has adopted a
banking book approach consistent with the scope and nature of its business activities. Consequently, market risk-weighted assets
are determined for gold price risk and foreign exchange risk, but not interest rate risk. The related minimum capital requirement
is derived using the VaR-based internal models method. Under this method, VaR calculations are performed using the Bank’s VaR
methodology, assuming a 99% confidence interval, a 10-day holding period and a one-year historical observation period.
The actual minimum capital requirement is derived as the higher of the VaR on the calculation date and the average of the daily
VaR measures on each of the preceding 60 business days (including the calculation date) subject to a multiplication factor of three
plus a potential add-on depending on backtesting results. For the period under consideration, the number of backtesting outliers
observed remained within the range where no add-on is required. The Bank’s minimum capital requirement for market risk and
the related risk-weighted assets as of 31 March 2008 are shown in the table below:

5. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank may not be able to meet
expected or unexpected current or future cash flows and
collateral needs without affecting its daily operations or its
financial condition.
Outstanding balances in the currency and gold deposits
from central banks, international organisations and other
public institutions are the key drivers of the size of the
Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank has undertaken to
repurchase at fair value certain of its currency deposit
instruments at one or two business days’ notice. The Bank
is managed to preserve a high degree of liquidity so that it
can meet the requirements of its customers at all times.
The Bank has developed a liquidity management
framework based on a statistical model underpinned by
conservative assumptions with regard to cash inflows and
the liquidity of liabilities. Within this framework, the Board
of Directors has set a limit for the Bank’s liquidity ratio
which requires liquid assets to be at least 100% of the
potential liquidity requirement. In addition, liquidity stress
tests assuming extreme withdrawal scenarios are
performed. These stress tests specify additional liquidity
requirements to be met by holdings of liquid assets. The
Bank’s liquidity has consistently been materially above its
minimum liquidity ratio and the requirements of its stress
tests.
The Bank’s currency and gold deposits, principally from
central banks and international institutions, comprise 89%
(2007: 91%) of its total liabilities. At 31 March 2008
currency and gold deposits originated from 152 depositors
(2007: 152). Within these deposits, there are significant
individual customer concentrations, with four customers
each contributing in excess of 5% of the total on a
settlement date basis (2007: four customers).
The following table shows the maturity profile of cash flows
for assets and liabilities. The amounts disclosed are the
undiscounted cash flows to which the Bank is committed.

6. Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Bank as the risk of
financial loss, or damage to the Bank’s reputation, or both,
resulting from one or more risk causes, as outlined below:

•

human factors: insufficient personnel, lack of requisite
knowledge, skills or experience, inadequate training
and development, inadequate supervision, loss of key
personnel, inadequate succession planning, or lack of
integrity or ethical standards;

•

failed or inadequate processes: a process is poorly
designed or unsuitable, or is not properly documented,
understood, implemented, followed or enforced;

•

failed or inadequate systems: a system is poorly
designed, unsuitable or unavailable, or does not
operate as intended; and

•

external events: the occurrence of an event having an
adverse impact on the Bank but outside its control.

Operational risk includes legal risk, but excludes strategic
risk.
The Bank’s operational risk management framework,
policies and procedures comprise the management
and measurement of operational risk, including the
determination of the relevant key parameters and inputs,
business continuity planning and the monitoring of key
risk indicators.

The Bank has established a procedure of immediate
reporting for operational risk-related incidents. The
Compliance and Operational Risk Unit develops action
plans with the respective units and follows up on their
implementation on a regular basis.
For the measurement of operational risk, the Bank has
adopted an approach that is consistent with the advanced
measurement approach proposed under the Basel II
Framework for the calculation of operational risk-weighted
assets and the measurement of operational risk economic
capital. Internal and external loss data, scenario estimates
and control self-assessments to reflect changes in the
business and control environment of the Bank are key
inputs in the calculations.
In line with the assumptions and key parameters of the
Basel II Framework, the calculation of the minimum capital
requirement for operational risk does not take reputational
risk into account and is determined assuming a 99.9%
confidence interval and a one-year time horizon. In
quantifying its operational risk the Bank does not take
potential protection it may obtain from insurance into
account.
Consistent with the parameters used in the calculation of
economic capital for financial risk, the Bank also measures
economic capital for operational risk to the 99.995%
confidence interval assuming a one-year holding period.

The table below shows the minimum capital requirement for operational risk and the related risk-weighted assets as of 31 March
2008:

Report of the auditors

to the Board of Directors and to the General Meeting
of the Bank for International Settlements, Basel
We have audited the accompanying financial statements (pages 192–249) of the Bank for International
Settlements. These financial statements incorporate the balance sheet as at 31 March 2008, profit and
loss account for the year then ended as required by the Bank’s Statutes, and the notes thereto. The
financial statements have been prepared by the Management of the Bank in accordance with the
Statutes and with the principles of valuation described under significant accounting policies in the
notes. The Management of the Bank is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate
accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Our
responsibility under the Statutes of the Bank is to form an independent opinion on the balance sheet
and profit and loss account based on our audit and to report our opinion to you.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We have received all the
information and explanations which we have required to obtain assurance that the balance sheet
and profit and loss account are free of material misstatement, and believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements, including the notes thereto, have been properly drawn up
and give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Bank for International Settlements at
31 March 2008 and the results of its operations for the year then ended in conformity with the
accounting principles described in the notes to the financial statements and the Statutes of the Bank.
