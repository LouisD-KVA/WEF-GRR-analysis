pandemic. We were truly honoured when these
efforts were recognized with the 2020 Nobel
Peace Prize.
Across the world, our country teams stayed and
delivered to get life-saving help to those in greatest
need. Thanks to their dedication, WFP reached
115.5 million people last year — an all-time
annual record.
And when borders closed and commercial aircraft
were grounded, WFP was the backbone of the
international humanitarian response, transporting
essential supplies and workers for nearly 400 UN
bodies and NGOs to keep critical global supply
chains moving.

None of these achievements would have been
possible without the support of WFP’s incredible
donors, who gave us a record US$8.4 billion in
contributions in 2020. The trust that they and so
many others have shown in WFP is truly humbling.
The award is a testament to our core values of
integrity, collaboration, commitment, humanity and
inclusion, which WFP’s dedicated women and men
strive to live up to every single day. They will guide
us as we face the future with hope and resolve.
After the turmoil of the past year, we must now
redouble our efforts to end global hunger and seize
the opportunity to start building the better world
we all want to see. It is time to work together, in
partnership, to achieve it.

The challenges of COVID-19 have been immense,
but WFP’s determination to save lives and change
lives remains just as strong as ever.

CRISIS
L

ooking back on the past year, the coronavirus
pandemic looms large. The worst global

health crisis for more than a century, COVID-19
has claimed more than 3 million lives to date
and caused the deepest global recession in
generations. In 12 months, the pandemic pushed
124 million people into extreme poverty — the
first increase in global poverty in two decades —
and could double the number of people facing
acute food insecurity to 270 million.

UPON
For the World Food Programme (WFP) and the people
we work with and for, the pandemic was another
crisis in what would have already been a difficult year.
Conflict didn’t stop for COVID-19; in more than
half the world’s countries, violence intensified.
Communities endured more frequent, extreme
and deadly weather events, which have more than
doubled since the 1990s due to our rapidly changing
climate. The number of forcibly displaced people
reached 1 percent of the global population. Positive
global trends had already slowed or been put into
reverse, with inequality at an all-time high and
690 million people going to bed hungry every night.

The pandemic showed just how important
schools are in sustaining communities and
connecting children and families to a range
of services that allow them to thrive. For WFP,
getting children safely back to school is a
priority — including those who were already
being left behind before the pandemic. Schoolbased meals are pivotal to achieving this goal.
Feeding programmes bring children to school
and give them the energy to learn, grow and
flourish, supporting longer-term health and
productivity. School feeding creates jobs —
2,000 for every 100,000 children fed — and,
when meals are sourced locally, it also boosts
local markets and economies. For girls, in
particular, the importance of school feeding
can’t be overstated: they go to school and stay
there longer, and child marriage rates and teen
pregnancies decrease. WFP is working with
governments worldwide to make sure that, as
schools reopen, we don’t miss this opportunity
to invest in children and a better future.

Community-led nature-based solutions that

protect biodiversity. WFP links these efforts
with conditional food and cash transfers, which

or WFP, food is the pathway to peace. It is
an investment in people and planet that

supports reconstruction, promotes development
and helps to tackle the root causes of conflict
(and therefore hunger) — from economic
exclusion to climate change. Food is an entry
point for dialogue and a catalyst for change.
Conflict is the single biggest driver of food
insecurity, destroying food systems and
infrastructure and forcing people from their
homes. But the dual crises of climate and conflict
exacerbate one another.
Violence prevents communities from adapting
to new climate conditions and displaces people
from their livelihoods and land. Meanwhile
chronic poverty and hunger, driven by extreme
weather, can further trigger violence. Food
shortages fuel social tensions and injustices,
pushing many people to join armed groups.
Understanding and addressing people’s
needs is core to sustaining peace, promoting
development and to ‘leaving no one behind’, and
it is what WFP does every day.
As a trusted UN agency committed to meeting
the needs of the most vulnerable people, WFP
is positioned to speak directly and honestly to
peace and political actors. We work at all levels,
from local to global, as a protective presence
in communities and an influential voice in
international forums.
Preventing conflict and sustaining peace flow
through everything that WFP does. Because
without peace we cannot end hunger — and
where this is hunger, we will never have a
peaceful world.

ountries now have just 10 years to deliver
on their commitments under the Sustainable

Development Goals — to secure a peaceful and
prosperous world. Progress was already too slow
in some areas and COVID‑19 has further eroded
many hard-won gains. But we can get back on track
if we act decisively and act together. We can’t afford
not to: the lost potential is vast, the human loss
reprehensible.
The pandemic, though far from over (and responses
still hampered by inequity), has offered glimpses of
what is possible when we work beyond our silos,
putting people front and centre.

F OR
The scale of the challenges in 2020 prompted new
partnerships and strengthened existing ones.
WFP continued to work closely with the wider UN
family, partnered more with the private sector and
finance institutions than ever before, and engaged
in regions, countries and topics we hadn’t previously.
Civil society, even in countries where we didn’t
have a presence, looked to us for guidance. And
despite mounting domestic pressure, donors and
government partners stepped up their contributions
to our work.

With this continued trust and cooperation, WFP is
confident that we can avert catastrophic famine and
contribute in a much broader way, as we did in 2020,
to a sustainable future for all. But we cannot do this
alone. The challenges we face are not separate, nor
are they confined within borders; we must build
on the commitment and collaboration of 2020,
working together as a global system to engineer
joined-up approaches to interlinked problems. This
is the power for change — and if 2020 has shown us
anything, it’s that change is possible.
