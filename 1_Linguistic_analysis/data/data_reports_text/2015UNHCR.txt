Global Report 2015
UNHCR’s Global Report provides information for
governments, private donors, partners and other
readers interested in the organization’s activities
and achievements in 2015. It is presented in two
ways: through this print publication and on the
Global Focus website.
The Global Report 2015 print publication presents a global overview of the work
carried out by UNHCR in 2015 to protect and improve the lives of tens of millions
of forcibly displaced people: refugees, internally displaced people, returnees,
stateless people and others of concern. It highlights the year’s achievements,
as well as challenges faced by the organization and its partners in attempting to
respond to multiple life-threatening crises and ever-growing humanitarian needs.
The Global Focus website (http://reporting.unhcr.org) is UNHCR’s main operational
reporting platform for donors. The website provides regularly updated information
about programmes, operations, financial requirements, funding levels and donor
contributions.

MISSION

64 MILLION
PEOPLE OF CONCERN

The High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated by the United
Nations to lead and coordinate international action for the
worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee
problems. To date (December 2015), 148 States are parties to the
1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and/or to its
1967 Protocol.

UNHCR’s primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and wellbeing of refugees. In its efforts to achieve this objective, the Office
strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to seek
asylum and find safe refuge in another State, and to return home
voluntarily. By assisting refugees to return to their own country
or to settle permanently in another country, UNHCR also seeks
lasting solutions to their plight.

UNHCR’s Executive Committee (98 member States as of October
2015) and the UN General Assembly have authorized involvement
with other groups. These include former refugees who have
returned to their homeland; internally displaced people; and
people who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed. To date,
92 States are parties to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status
of Stateless Persons and/or the 1961 Convention on the Reduction
of Statelessness.

The Office seeks to reduce situations of forced displacement by
encouraging States and other institutions to create conditions
which are conducive to the protection of human rights and the
peaceful resolution of disputes. In all of its activities, it pays
particular attention to the needs of children and seeks to promote
the equal rights of women and girls.
The Office carries out its work in collaboration with many partners,
including governments, regional organizations, international and
non-governmental organizations. It is committed to the principle of
participation, believing that refugees and others who benefit from
the organization’s activities should be consulted over decisions
which affect their lives.

questions

WHY DID YOU JOIN UNHCR?
In 2000 I was asked to join UNHCR as
Senior Coordinator for Refugee Women.
At first I was reluctant, as I had heard that
the organization was not fully on board on
gender equality issues, but former Assistant
High Commissioner Soren Jessen Petersen
was very convincing! So in spite of some
challenges, I am glad I did join and I feel
very privileged to have worked with UNHCR.

This framework for assuring women’s rights
and gender issues is still being used today
and is about to be updated as part of the
ongoing Gender Equality Review. Second
is the negotiation of the reaffirmation of
citizenship for 200,000 former Burundian
refugees in Tanzania – an unprecedented
durable solution. The third memory is of
the Kagunga operation – during a mass
influx of Burundians in 2015, we had to use
a 100-year-old former German war boat to
transport 35,000 refugees in the midst of
a cholera outbreak, and managed to save
all but 29 from the epidemic. And my best
memories are of the people in my teams in
all of my posts.

Just before retiring from
her final posting as UNHCR
Representative in the United
Republic of Tanzania, and after
more than 15 years of dedicated
service with the organization,
Joyce Mends-Cole agreed to
share some memories and
advice…

ADVICE FOR A YOUNG PERSON
JOINING UNHCR TODAY?
I hope that many more young women will
join or stay in UNHCR and that the new
policies will address some of the reasons for
attrition and inequality. To all young staff be passionate and compassionate. UNHCR
is not a business – it is a life commitment!

A MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT?
I choose three. The first was the 2001
Global Dialogue with Refugee Women,
which resulted in the High Commissioner’s
Five Commitments to Refugee Women.

* The Three Questions interviews put the spotlight on
colleagues who have dedicated much of their working
lives to UNHCR and the refugee cause.

Every life

matters

by Filippo Grandi
UNITED NATIONS
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES

The world again witnessed record levels of forced
displacement in 2015. More than 65 million people
were uprooted by war, conflict, persecution or human
rights abuses by year end, including over 10 million
displaced during the year.
The war in the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) was again
the single largest driver of displacement in 2015. At
the end of the year, more than 4 million Syrians were
living in exile in neighbouring countries and 6.5 million
people were internally displaced.

UNHCR/Kate Holt

The year 2015 was also the year that the
global refugee crisis reached Europe.
More than 1 million refugees and migrants
arrived on the southern European
shores. Tragically, nearly 4,000 died
in the attempt. More than 84 per cent
came from the world’s top ten refugeeproducing countries, chief among them
Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, but also
Eritrea and Somalia. More than one-third
were children, many of them travelling

unaccompanied. Greece, a country already
under strain from a severe economic and
financial crisis, received more than 800,000
arrivals and became overwhelmed by the
sheer numbers. The local communities
demonstrated extraordinary generosity and
thousands of volunteers came to the Greek
islands to help the refugees and migrants.
UNHCR launched its biggest humanitarian
operation in Europe since the wars in the
former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

New crises erupted in Burundi and Yemen,
forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee
their homes and seek safety in neighbouring
countries. Meanwhile, older crises continued
unresolved. South Sudan marked the fourth
anniversary of its independence with more than
2.25 million displaced people. Since then, and
despite a peace deal between the Government
and the opposition concluded in August, violence
has spread to different parts of the country and
unprecedented hunger has driven even larger
numbers of people from their homes. Violence
and instability kept people from eastern Nigeria
and the Central Africa Republic in exile, and the
situation in Ukraine remained precarious for
large numbers of internally displaced people.
Political developments in Afghanistan in early
2015 generated hope for increased stability
and opportunities to find solutions for displaced
people. However, in the second half of the year,
escalating violence in the country brought the
number of internally displaced people to a new
high of 1 million.

Today’s protection challenges
Despite socio-economic challenges, numerous
countries kept their border open, generously
welcoming large numbers of refugees. But
in many parts of the world we also witnessed
threats to the international protection regime,
sometimes fuelled by dangerous anti-foreigner
rhetoric giving rise to xenophobic attitudes.
Europe initially responded to the arrival of large
numbers refugees and migrants on its southern
shores with some very sound decisions on
the internal relocation of people in need of
international protection. However, the lack of a
common vision and solidarity among European
countries resulted in a fragmented and deficient
response. Large numbers of people went
unchecked to a few countries in Northern
Europe, where the initial public support for
welcoming refugees began to waver. Many

8

UNHCR Global Report 2015

countries passed restrictive legislation or used
physical obstacles – including fences constructed
along borders – to dissuade refugees and
migrants from reaching their territories, with dire
consequences for the people on the move.
The phenomenon of dangerous mixed
movements by sea was not limited to Europe. In
South-East Asia, large numbers of migrants and
refugees, including many Rohingya, put their lives
in the hands of smugglers in search for safety and
a future. Inadequate protection, uneven access
to education and employment opportunities, and
a lack of available solutions, are often behind
these irregular movements. Thousands of people
were reportedly abandoned by smugglers at
sea and mass graves were found along the land
border between Thailand and Malaysia near the
deserted camps of smugglers.
In Central America, shocking levels of gang
violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras
displaced tens of thousands of people and
forced many of them along traditional migrant
routes, mostly travelling north, in search of safety
and protection. Asylum applications in the region
from nationals of these three countries increased
sharply, as did recognition rates. But deportations
of large numbers of people, including those who
could be in need of international protection,
have continued. While overshadowed by crises
elsewhere in the world, refugee movements in
Central America are expected to grow.

Building a better future
At the same time, traditional solutions for
refugees, namely voluntary return, local
integration and resettlement, were in short
supply. During the year, some 201,000 refugees
returned to their home countries and 115,800
were assisted to integrate locally. Voluntary
repatriation was at its lowest in three decades,
and possibilities for local integration remained

UNHCR/Emrah Gurel

limited. Few such opportunities brought to the
forefront the importance of resettlement as
part of the international community’s response
to forced displacement. Globally, resettlement
continued to play a crucial protection role in
UNHCR’s response to forced displacement. More
than 81,000 refugees departed for resettlement,
many of them to the United States and Canada.
With the rapid increase in displacement and the
stagnation in the number of refugees finding a
solution, it has become even more important to
invest in quality education for refugee children,
creating livelihood opportunities, and efforts
aimed at finding alternatives to camps and
including displaced people in national economies
and services. The inclusion of nearly 1 million
Afghan and Iraqi refugees in the Islamic Republic

of Iran’s national health insurance plan in 2015
was a remarkable achievement in this regard.

Emergency response
In 2015, UNHCR declared 11 emergency
situations affecting operations in 30 countries
and deployed 460 emergency missions,
involving UNHCR and partner staff, to support
the response mainly in Africa and Europe.
Protection staff comprised more than 25 per cent
of these deployments. From the outset of each
emergency we sent senior-level protection
colleagues to establish community-based
protection mechanisms, to work with partners
to undertake participatory assessments, and
to develop protection strategies. In situations
of internal displacement, we strengthened

UNHCR Global Report 2015

9

the coordination of the protection cluster and
working groups, and developed tools to prevent
and follow up on child protection challenges and
sexual and gender-based violence.
The security of our beneficiaries and our
staff remained key concerns, not only in new
emergencies but also in protracted situations.
Last year, we mourned the loss of one of
our colleagues in Somalia. A brave young
woman, who had recently returned to work
from maternity leave, was gunned down in
Mogadishu; a sad and stark reminder of the risks
so many aid workers face today. In contexts
such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen,
it is extremely difficult to keep staff safe and
deliver protection and assistance at the same
time. In many places we now work in conflict
areas. As these conflicts continue, they draw
in more armed actors including those who see
civilians and humanitarian workers as legitimate
targets. To be able to reach people who are
desperately in need of humanitarian aid in Syria
or Yemen, we must make difficult decisions on
a case-by-case basis as to whether risk levels
are acceptable. At the same time, we keep
investing in expertise and equipment to mitigate
risks, including through training of UNHCR and
partner staff.

Support from donors and partners
On behalf of the millions of refugees, internally
displaced, stateless people and others of
concern to UNHCR, I would like to thank our
many donors and partners for their steady and
generous support.

10

UNHCR Global Report 2015

We continue to work with a growing number
of partners. In 2015, UNHCR disbursed
USD 1.26 billion to 938 non-governmental
organizations, government institutions and United
Nations agencies for protection and assistance
projects worldwide. National NGOs received
30 per cent of the funds we expended to our
partners. In 2015, we consolidated the Refugee
Coordination Model to ensure transparent and
inclusive leadership in large refugee situations
and to improve joint operational planning
and resource mobilization. Countless others
supported UNHCR’s work, including corporate
partners, individual donors and celebrities –
bringing added financial assistance, innovative
solutions and essential advocacy to our efforts.
Last year we received an unprecedented
USD 3.4 billion in financial contributions for which
I am deeply grateful. Our requirements, however,
also stood at an all-time high: USD 7.2 billion
to protect and assist some 64 million people
of concern. This means that in spite of the
extraordinary support from donors over the
last year, the gap between needs and funding
available continued to grow, with very real
consequences for the people we serve.
Looking ahead, we know that these challenges
will persist and perhaps even increase. We are
committed to being even more effective, efficient,
creative and innovative in our responses. We
will continue to push boundaries to uphold
protection principles and preserve protection
space everywhere, rally solidarity and mobilize
resources, and we cannot achieve this without
the steadfast and generous support of our
partners and donors worldwide. n

Throughout 2015, UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina
Jolie Pitt continued to show extraordinary
commitment and dedication towards refugees,
and tirelessly advocated on their behalf around
the globe.
Her advocacy remained centered around the
worsening plight of Syrian refugees. The Special
Envoy began the year with a visit to Iraq to
support the 3.3 million displaced people in the
country and to highlight their dire needs. She
witnessed a dramatic increase in the scale and
gravity of the humanitarian situation since her
previous visit in 2012 as conflicts in Iraq and the
Syrian Arab Republic intensified and became
intertwined.
In the weeks following, the Special Envoy
continued to raise awareness by reaching out to

audiences worldwide. She penned an opinion
editorial in the New York Times on the Syrians
and Iraqis who can’t return home, entitled A New
Level of Refugee Suffering. In April, the Special
Envoy appeared before the UN Security Council
to advocate on behalf of Syrian refugees, and
briefed the Council on nearly a dozen field visits
she has carried out to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
Malta and Turkey since the onset of the Syrian
conflict.
The Special Envoy later joined High
Commissioner Guterres to mark World Refugee
Day in Turkey, the world's largest refugee-hosting
nation. She visited Syrian and Iraqi refugees in
southeastern Turkey, and met with President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to thank Turkey and its
people for their generosity and to discuss the
challenges that refugee-hosting nations face. n

“Any one of the Syrians that I met would speak more eloquently
about the conflict than I ever could. I'm here for them because this is
their United Nations.” - Special Envoy Angelina Jolie Pitt briefing the UN Security Council

Global Strategic Priorities
2014-2015
UNHCR’s Global Strategic Priorities (GSPs) for
the 2014-2015 biennium provided important
direction for operations to target interventions
across a range of core areas where the Office
seeks to improve protection and find solutions
for refugees and other people of concern.
The GSPs are divided into two categories:
operational GSPs for field operations, and
support and management GSPs for headquarters
divisions. The operational GSPs focused on:
establishing and maintaining a favourable
protection environment; providing access to
fair protection processes and documentation;
ensuring security from violence and exploitation;
meeting basic needs and providing essential
services; empowering communities; and
strengthening self-reliance and securing durable
solutions.
The operational GSPs provided guidance for the
development of annual operations plans, and
informed strategic discussions at field level with
UNHCR partners for prioritization. Throughout the
year, staff closely monitored progress achieved
against the GSPs and took corrective actions,
where required.

Information on the progress achieved in 2015
has been analysed and reported on by field
operations through Focus, UNHCR’s resultsbased management tool, and Twine (UNHCR’s
health information system) for health-related
indicators. Focal points within technical sections
at Headquarters have subsequently reviewed the
results in order to assess the progress achieved
against the global engagements.
The GSPs on Support and Management
underpin UNHCR’s organizational commitment
to strengthen its response and improve its
efficiency and effectiveness across a vast range
of functional areas. Over the course of 2015, this
included: strengthening financial and programme
management; providing support and policy
guidance on protection matters; enhancing
UNHCR’s emergency response; reinforcing
UNHCR’s capacity to ensure effective leadership
and coordination of complex operations; and
expanding staff development opportunities.

ACHIEVEMENTS

CHALLENGES

The analysis of progress achieved
in 2015 shows that the focused
efforts on core GSP areas have
yielded very positive results, with
many operations reporting that they
were able to improve the situation
of people of concern in a number
of priority areas. With respect to
protection, sustained advocacy
efforts and technical support led
to positive changes in legislation
and policies which directly impact
refugees, stateless persons and
internally displaced people.

Where field operations reported
difficulty in achieving progress
on some of the priority areas,
it was most often linked to the
challenge of accommodating a
comprehensive response within
finite budgetary resources and
the need to prioritize certain
interventions over others. In
some operations, the occurrence
of new emergency situations
required a reprioritization of funds
towards more pressing life-saving
needs. For some GSP areas,
progress would be dependent on
reaching understanding with key
government counterparts on how
the engagement required could
be accommodated within overall
national priorities and available
resources.

Operations also worked together
with partners and governments
to make further progress in the
prevention and response to sexual
and gender-based violence. More
children were able to benefit from
access to education opportunities
and national child protection
services. The participation of
women in leadership structures
increased further. Progress was
also achieved in improving relations
between displaced populations
and host communities. Almost all
operations managed to be well
below the mortality standards for
children under 5 years old. The
number of refugees resettled
also increased and support was
provided to refugees opting for
voluntary repatriation, although
their number decreased compared
to 2014.

2015 Progress at a glance
Support and Management GSPs
Financial management
• A new High Level Internal Control Framework
was issued. It sets out the respective roles and
accountabilities in the area of financial management.
• The financial statement for 2015 was developed in full
compliance with IPSAS accounting standards.
• The first organization-wide enterprise risk assessment
was completed and results were captured in a
corporate risk register.

International protection
• Legal advice, guidance and operational support was
provided to operations and States, including on the
scope of legal obligations and individual rights of
people of concern.
• Consultations with governments and civil society
were undertaken in the context of UNHCR’s #IBelong
Campaign to end statelessness by 2024. A special report
I Am Here, I Belong – The Urgent Need to End Childhood
Statelessness presented the many challenges faced by
stateless children and youth.
• Numerous protection and resettlement deployments
were facilitated and the centrality of protection
considerations was promoted in all aspects of
humanitarian programmes.

Information and communications technologies
• Support to emergency operations was further optimized
through improved positioning of human and material
resources.
• Network infrastructure was improved in field locations
through migration of new technology and enhanced
bandwidth optimization.

Coordination
• The Global Protection Cluster (GPC), the Global Shelter
Cluster (GSC) and the Camp Coordination and Camp
Management (CCCM) Cluster provided guidance and
field support to cluster members and field coordinators,
including through the deployment of surge capacity staff
and technical specialists.
• The roll out of the Refugee Coordination Model (RCM)
to key operations was supported through issuance of
policy guidance and organization of training programs
on coordination and leadership.

Results-based management
• A new version of the UNHCR Programme Manual was
issued providing UNHCR staff across the world with
updated guidance on the application of rules and
procedures for effective management and coordination
of programmes.
• Workshops and trainings were organized for
programme staff and further improvements were made
to the range of corporate tools available for applying
results-based management.

Emergency preparedness and response
• Over 11,175 metric tons of emergency core relief items
were delivered from global stockpiles for distribution to
people in need.
• Emergency deployments of over 460 trained staff from
emergency standby rosters were organized.
• Emergency preparedness activities were enhanced and
operation-specific workshops on contingency planning
were organized in four situations including staff from
both UNHCR and partner organisations.

Mobilization of support
• The level of donor support received by UNHCR reached
over USD 3.361 billion, with income from private sector
rising to USD 284 million (35 per cent more than in the
previous year).
• A high level of media coverage and enhanced
dissemination of information using social media
resulted in a significant increase in the number of
followers of UNHCR on digital platforms Facebook
and Twitter, reaching 1 million and 1.9 million
respectively – a growth of 60 per cent and 14 per
cent over 2014.

Human resources
• A five-year People Strategy was developed. It aims at
improving the manner in which UNHCR recruits, cares
for, supports and develops its staff to keep up with the
evolving demands on the organization.
• Substantive competency-based learning initiatives
and certification programmes were developed in
key functional areas, such as management, human
resources, and supply chain.

Funding UNHC
UNHCR’s budget has more than doubled
between 2010 and 2015, mirroring the scale of
forced displacement which increased from 34
million to 64 million people of concern to UNHCR
during this period.
Financial requirements to cover the
comprehensive needs of people of concern
amounted to USD 7,232.4 million in 2015. This
included supplementary needs that emerged
during the year of more than USD 1 billion for
new crises in Burundi, Yemen and across Europe,
and for other ongoing emergencies.

Throughout the year, the Office received
extraordinary support from its donors.
Nevertheless, despite the record high level of
USD 3,361 million in contributions, the funding
gap has grown from 36 per cent in 2010 to
49 per cent in 2015.
This chapter presents an overview of UNHCR’s
requirements, income and expenditure in 2015.
Detailed information on the organization’s donors
can be found on UNHCR’s main operational
website Global Focus (http://reporting.unhcr.org).

at its 64th session in October 2013 approved a
budget of USD 5,179.5 million for 2015, which
was revised to USD 6,234.4 million and approved
by the 65th Session of the Executive Committee
in October 2014. Throughout 2015, the Office
issued supplementing appeals totaling to
USD 1,156.4 million.

The year also saw a budget reduction of
USD 158.4 million to the annual programme
budget for the Middle East and North Africa
region following the revision of the Regional
Refugee and Resilience Plan 2015-2016 in
response to the Syria crisis, and the Syria

Budget, income and expenditure overview
UNHCR’s final budget in 2015 of USD 7,232.4 million
comprised: USD 6,763.9 million for programmed
activities; USD 456.5 million as reserve balances;
and USD 12 million for the Junior Professional
Officer (JPO) scheme. This total represents an
increase of approximately USD 662.7 million
(10.1 per cent) in comparison with the 2014 final
budget.
In 2015, total funds available reached
USD 3,706.8 million, representing an increase of
approximately USD 103.7 million (2.9 per cent) in
comparison with 2014.
Expenditure in 2015 reached USD 3,294.8 million,
a decrease of some USD 60.6 million (1.8 per cent)
compared with 2014. The total expenditure
included USD 3,288.2 million for programmed
activities and USD 6.7 million for JPOs.

CHART 1

The resulting closing funding balance to
be brought forward to 2016 is therefore
USD 411.9 million and includes specific earmarked
funds for the continuation of programmed
activities.
Chart 1 illustrates the trends of budgets, funds
available and expenditure for the period
from 2008 to 2015. The sharp increase in
requirements in 2010 corresponded to the
adoption of comprehensive needs-based
planning and budgeting as of that year. While
funds available and expenditure also increased
significantly in response to the growing needs,
the gap between funds available and overall
requirements remains evident, amounting to
USD 3,525.6 million (48.7 per cent) in 2015.

Budget
Requirements by pillar
In 2015, programmed activities (i.e. excluding
reserves and the JPO scheme) made up
93.5 per cent of the total requirements and
reached USD 6,763.9 million; an increase of
USD 530.8 million, or 8.5 per cent, compared to
2014.
UNHCR’s focus remained on responding to
multiple, large-scale refugee operations, while
continuing to ensure its deep involvement in
IDP projects as well as continued investment in
reintegration and efforts to eradicate stateless.
Pillar 1 for refugee programmes amounted to
USD 5,033.2 million and continued to account
for the vast majority (74.4 per cent) of the
requirements for programmed activities. This
is USD 473.9 million or 10.4 per cent more than
Pillar 1 requirements in 2014.

CHART 2

IDP projects in Pillar 4 represented the
second largest allocation in 2015, totalling
USD 1,412.8 million or 20.9 per cent of the
total requirements for programmed activities.
In comparison with 2014, this is an increase of
USD 65.7 million or 4.9 per cent.
Reintegration projects (Pillar 3) represented
USD 242.2 million (3.6 per cent) of the
requirements for programmed activities, with a
modest decrease of USD 16.1 million (6.2 per cent)
compared to 2014, while stateless programmes
(Pillar 2) remained fairly stable at 1.1 per cent
(USD 75.7 million) of programmed activities.
Chart 2 below graphically presents the
comparison between the revised budget for
programmed activities as approved by the
Executive Committee in October 2014 and the
final budget as of 31 December 2015, by region
and pillar.

Requirements by region
Africa again accounted for the largest portion
of programmed activities for the year, totalling
USD 2,775 million or 41 per cent in 2015. This is
an increase of USD 192 million, or 7.4 per cent,
compared to 2014. Refugee programmes
made up the bulk of the requirements
(USD 2,193.2 million or 79 per cent of the total),
followed by USD 468.8 million (16.9 per cent) for
IDP projects.
The Middle East and North Africa region
again had the second largest requirements
(USD 2,137.4 million) in 2015, representing
31.6 per cent of programmed activities. This is
an increase of USD 192.8 million (9.9 per cent)
compared to 2014. Refugee programmes
accounted for 63.2 per cent of the region’s
programmes, followed by IDP projects (35 per cent).
Requirements for the Asia and the Pacific region
totalled USD 596.7 million (8.8 per cent of
programmed activities) in 2015. This is a small
decrease of USD 13.7 million (2.2 per cent)
compared to 2014.
Requirements for Europe stood at USD 592 million,
or 8.8 per cent of the total programmed activities.
This represents an increase of USD 105 million
(21.5 per cent) compared to 2014. The largest

Requirements for programmed activities in the
Americas remained stable at approximately
1.7 per cent of the total, amounting to some
USD 117.4 million.
The aggregate requirements for Global
Programmes and Headquarters stood at
USD 545.3 million, or 8.1 per cent of the total.
This is a slight increase in dollar terms of some
USD 47.9 million compared to 2014, of which
USD 27.3 million (57 per cent of the total increase)
was for Global Programmes and the remaining
USD 20.6 million (43 per cent of the total increase)
was for Headquarters requirements.

Income
Support from donors for UNHCR’s work was again
remarkable throughout 2015. The Office received
voluntary contributions of USD 3,361 billion
during the year – USD 68.8 million more than
2014. This amount does not include the United
Nations regular budget assessed contribution
of USD 44.1 million and USD 412 million of other
funds available, which included the carryover
from 2014 and transfers.
Contributions to UNHCR are shown by type of
budget, in nominal and real terms, in Chart 3.

Efforts to broaden the organization’s

of notable achievements in garnering
private sector support for UNHCR’s
programmes. In 2015, the Office raised
USD 284 million from the private sector
(see Chart 7), more than 8 per cent of total
contributions received. Almost half of this,
some USD 130 million, was unearmarked
funds, which allowed UNHCR to respond
to unforeseen emergencies and helped to
ensure that critical resources are available
for less visible crises.
Contributions from private donors in
Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the
United States of America, Italy, Japan,
Germany, Australia, the Republic of Korea
and online donations were the top 10

Level of earmarking in 2015

Quality of contributions
As the gap between needs and available
humanitarian resources widen even further,
unrestricted support has become even more
crucial in providing both the flexibility to
implement emergency operations as soon as
possible, and the ability to continue to address
ongoing operations including forgotten,
protracted situations.
In these challenging times, therefore, UNHCR
relies more than ever on early, predictable
and unrestricted donor support to provide
uninterrupted protection and assistance for
populations of concern.
In 2015, 85 per cent of funds received were
earmarked to operations, while 15 per cent was
unearmarked (see Chart 10). There was a slight
decrease in the share of tightly earmarked funds,
from 67 per cent in 2014 to 63 per cent in 2015,
balanced by an increase in the level of broadly
earmarked contributions from 18 per cent in 2014
to 22 per cent in 2015 (see Chart 11).
The highest percentage of contributions was
earmarked towards the Middle East and North
CHART 11

Africa region (36 per cent), reflecting the
scale of emergencies affecting this region.
Funding for Africa has remained at a similar
level (USD 980 million, or 29 per cent), despite
substantial growth in needs due to new
emergencies affecting the continent. Earmarking
towards Europe grew from 5 per cent in 2014 to
7 per cent in 2015.

The most underfunded situations were in
Africa: Central African Republic situation was
76 per cent underfunded; South Sudan situation
70 per cent underfunded; Burundi situation was
62 per cent underfunded and Nigeria situation
was 52 per cent underfunded.

Expenditure by pillar

In the Middle East and North Africa, the largest
funding gap was for the Iraq situation, which was
only funded at 65 per cent.
The most underfunded sectors in 2015 were
shelter and basic and domestic items. The
funding gap in just these two sectors constituted
30 per cent of UNHCR’s total funding gap in
2015.

514,168,229

In 2015 expenditure for refugee programmes
(Pillar 1) amounted to USD 2,628.1 million – a
minor increase of USD 8.4 million or 0.3 per cent
from 2014. The ratio of expenditure for refugee
programmes to total expenditure for programmed
activities was 79.9 per cent and 78.2 per cent in
2015 and 2014, respectively.
Expenditure for IDP projects (Pillar 4) amounted
to USD 545.2 million in 2015. This reflects a
decrease of USD 68.1 million (11.1 per cent)
compared to 2014. The ratio of expenditure for
IDP projects to total expenditure for programmed
activities was 16.6 per cent in 2015, a 1.7 per cent
decrease on 2014.

respectively. When compared to 2014,
there was a reduction in expenditure for
stateless programmes (by USD 3.9 million or
10.8 per cent) and an increase for reintegration
projects (by USD 3.7 million or 4.7 per cent).
The ratios of expenditure to total expenditure
for programmed activities remained fairly
stable for both statelessness and reintegration
projects, at 1 per cent and 2.5 per cent,
respectively.

28.8 per cent was for IDP projects. The four
largest operations in terms of expenditure at
the global level were all in this region: Lebanon
(USD 318.8 million) for refugee programmes;
Iraq (USD 266.3 million) for both refugee
programmes (38.3 per cent) and IDP projects
(56.9 per cent); Jordan (USD 208.7 million)
for refugee programmes; and the Syrian Arab
Republic (USD 173.8 million), of which 86.5
per cent is for IDP projects. All four operations
are responding to large-scale displacement
resulting from insecurity in Iraq and the Syrian
Arab Republic.

Although this is a decrease of USD 47.1 million
(3.9 per cent) when compared to 2014, the
region still accounted for 35 per cent of the
total expenditure for programmed activities –
the same level as in 2014. Approximately 70 per
cent of expenditure in the Middle East and
North Africa was for refugee programmes while

Expenditure in Africa amounted to
USD 1,097.7 million in 2015 – a decrease of

the total expenditure for programmed activities
in 2015, compared to 33.6 per cent in 2014. The
bulk of the expenditure (85.7 per cent) was for
refugee programmes, followed by 10.7 per cent
for IDP projects. The largest operations by
expenditure were in the East and Horn of Africa
subregion, namely Ethiopia (USD 152.1 million),
South Sudan (USD 140.5 million) and Kenya
(USD 101 million), in response to refugee
emergencies prompted by the situation in
Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.

F un d i ng

Expenditure in the Asia and the Pacific region
amounted to USD 256.4 million. This was a
reduction of USD 13 million, or 4.8 per cent,
when compared to 2014 but still represents
some 7.8 per cent of the total expenditure for
programmed activities, with no major change
from 2014 (8.0 per cent). While most of the
expenditure remained for refugee programmes
and IDP projects (64.6 per cent and 16.8 per cent
respectively), in percentage terms the region has
the highest rate of expenditure for reintegration
projects (14.5 per cent of the global expenditure
for Pillar 3) for operations in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
Expenditure in Europe continued to increase
in 2015, amounting to USD 243.7 million
(7.4 per cent of total expenditure for programmed
activities in 2015 compared to 6.3 per cent
in 2014). Refugee programmes accounted
for 80.5 per cent of total expenditure in the
region. The largest operations were Turkey
(USD 95.8 million), responding to the Syria
situation, and regional activities in the Northern,
Western, Central and Southern Europe subregion
(USD 82.2 million) associated with the refugee
crisis in Europe. Extensive IDP projects continued
to be carried out in Ukraine, which had total
expenditure of USD 28.4 million, of which some
USD 24 million was in Pillar 4 (84 per cent).
Expenditure in the Americas stood at
USD 59.1 million, which accounted for some
1.8 per cent of total expenditure for programmed
activities – the same level as 2014 but a minor
decrease of USD 2 million in absolute terms.
Expenditure on Global Programmes at
USD 266.5 million decreased by some
USD 12.4 million, or 4.4 per cent, compared
to 2014. The share of expenditure for Global
Programmes as part of total expenditure for
programmed activities remained stable, at
8.1 per cent.
There was a modest increase of USD 7.6 million
to USD 213 million in expenditure on
Headquarters, although the ratio of Headquarters
expenditure to total expenditure for programmed
activities at 6.5 per cent in 2015 is in line with the

Conclusion
UNHCR is deeply grateful for the generous
support of its donor community – governments,
private citizens, corporations and foundations
– who together contributed a record
USD 3.36 billion in 2015. Nevertheless, this
was less than half of the total requirements. As
humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate
around the world, the gap between needs and
resources is likely to grow.
Humanitarian budgets are insufficient to meet
even the absolute minimum requirements of
core protection and lifesaving assistance. In an
effort to fully meet the needs of populations of
concern around the world and sustain reliable
funding levels, the Office will continue to build
strategically upon existing income sources and
expand its donor base through engagement with
development actors, emerging donors and the
private sector.

Working
environment
Despite dramatic situations of forced
displacement throughout 2015, Africa
continued to host the vast majority of
refugees worldwide. In 2015, more
than 18 million refugees, internally
displaced people (IDPs), people at risk
of statelessness and other people of
concern to UNHCR received assistance
across the continent. Globally, eight of
UNHCR’s major emergencies in 2015
were in Africa, with the Burundi and
Yemen situations causing the newest
displacements on the continent.

UNHCR/Catianne Tijerina

Peace efforts were slow to take hold
and continuing conflicts posed the risk
of further entrenching current forced
displacement situations. Persisting
situations of violence in countries such
as the Central African Republic (CAR),
Nigeria and South Sudan prevented
the resolution of many displacement
situations, with only small numbers of
people returning home, in most cases
spontaneously. Consequently, UNHCR’s
programmes began shifting from
immediate relief activities to education,
livelihoods, cash-based assistance, and
other longer-term strategies, in order
to foster the refugees’ self-reliance
and dignity. Participation in hosting
communities helped build resilience in
exile, as flare-ups of violence in countries
of origin dimmed return prospects.

Humanitarian access to populations in
need was hampered in most situations
still affected by conflict, notably in
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the CAR, Chad,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia
and South Sudan. This led to gaps in
services provided, higher malnutrition
and mortality rates, and the potential for
further displacement.
Globally, fewer refugees than ever found
solutions to displacement in 2015. In
Africa, the numbers of those able to
return home continued to diminish.
Nevertheless, returns from Liberia to Côte
d’Ivoire were reinitiated after the Ebola
outbreak ended in the second half of
2015. More refugees were also resettled
out of Africa than in any previous year –
nearly 25,000 refugees, mostly from the
DRC and Somalia, were resettled mainly
to the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and Sweden.

Tanzania (Tanzania) in 2015. Further
efforts were ongoing with respect
to Angolan refugees, particularly in
Zambia, to finally bring a close to that
longstanding displacement chapter.
In recent years, UNHCR has been
strengthening its working relations with
non-traditional development partners,
such as the African Development Bank
and the World Bank, in order to promote
development in refugee-hosting areas.
In 2015, UNHCR worked with the World
Bank to attract support for services
in the areas of agriculture, education,
health and access to markets in underresourced regions that host refugees. In
2015, proposals were made for the DRC,
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
In October 2015, UNHCR and the
European Union co-hosted a ministeriallevel pledging conference to raise
support for Somali refugees. Donors
pledged some USD 105 million
to support an action plan for the
sustainable return and reintegration of
Somali refugees from Kenya to Somalia.
The plan is to be implemented over the
coming two years.

This overview highlights key aspects
of the main situations that required
emergency or sustained response from
UNHCR and its partners in 2015. More
details on individual operations are
available in the relevant subregional and
country operations pages on the Global
Focus website (http://reporting.unhcr.org).
In 2015, more than 234,000 Burundians
were forced to flee into the DRC,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and even
as far as Zambia. A regional refugee
response plan, led by UNHCR, was
issued in May 2015 to mobilize critical
assistance. However, the operations were
beset early on by an outbreak of cholera
in Tanzania, reports of recruitment from
camps in Rwanda, sexual and genderbased violence (SGBV), and other
serious protection concerns. UNHCR,
working closely with governments and
other agencies, quickly responded with
emergency support. By the end of the
year, a contingency plan had been put
in place by all agencies involved in
the refugee response, which included
a worst-case scenario for 2016 and a
strategy to address ongoing needs.

During 2015, efforts were made to
consolidate relief activities and improve
services for refugees from the CAR in
Cameroon, Chad, the Congo and the
DRC. Despite a small number of returns,
the number of refugees from the CAR
continued to grow steadily, particularly
ahead of the presidential and legislative
elections that took place at the end of
the year and required a second round
of elections in February 2016. UNHCR
assisted around 60 per cent of refugees
in neighbouring countries to successfully
participate in the presidential elections.
The situation in the DRC remained tense
in 2015. Sporadic violence, particularly
in the North Kivu area, resulted in further
internal displacement and prevented
humanitarian access for much of the year.
In total, some 1.5 million IDPs remained
displaced in the DRC at the end of the
year, while the country also hosted
106,000 refugees from the CAR, 245,000
from Rwanda (figure based on an initial
pre-registration exercise carried out
by the Government), and 20,000 from
Burundi following the recent conflict.
Despite the signature in June 2015 of the
Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation
in Mali, a sporadic resurgence of violence
prevented voluntary return at anticipated
levels. Humanitarian agencies were
blocked from accessing the north and
central regions of the country. More than
139,000 refugees remained in Burkina
Faso, Mauritania and Niger, and some
61,000 people remained displaced inside
the country. A critical lack of funding also
hampered the delivery of assistance,
with the displaced population growing
more vulnerable as a result of recurrent
droughts and chronic poverty.

50

UNHCR Global Report 2015

The conflict and violence in Nigeria
escalated in 2015, with insurgents
attacking civilian populations across the
borders in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
Despite the contribution of troops by
these countries, the death toll continued
to rise at the end of 2015 and into 2016,
with a growing trend of women and
girls being used as suicide bombers in
markets, schools and other populated
areas. By the end of the year, Cameroon
was host to 62,000 refugees from Nigeria
and had nearly 93,000 IDPs displaced by
the conflict; Chad hosted 14,000 refugees
and had 52,000 IDPs; and Niger hosted
138,000 refugees from Nigeria and had
50,000 IDPs.
In South Sudan, ongoing conflict and
growing food insecurity are causing
more and more people to flee either
across borders or within the country.
As of December 2015, some 2.3 million
people had been forced to flee their
homes: some 650,000 had moved into
Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda; and 1.65
million remained displaced inside the
country. Despite a peace agreement
signed in August 2015, and peace talks
held in Addis Ababa in November 2015,
the conflict that began in December 2013
continued into its third year. By the end
of 2015, unrest led to new outflows in the
south of the country, particularly into the
CAR and the DRC. Lack of security inside
the country exacerbated the effects of
a poor harvest, resulting in higher food
insecurity than previously reported. The
protection of children in South Sudan
and neighbouring countries of asylum
remained critical: more than 65 per cent
of those fleeing were under the age of 18.

A f r i ca

In Somalia insecurity prevailed, however
the violence and bombing throughout
2015 in Yemen caused some 27,000
Somalis – both refugees and migrants
– to cross the Red Sea in order to
return home. Some 3,335 new Yemeni
arrivals also took refuge in the country.
Others sought asylum in Djibouti (17,500
Yemenis and 300 Somalis since April
2015); Ethiopia (1,200 Yemenis and
2,500 Somalis); and Sudan (some 700
Yemenis and Somalis). At least 13,000
nationals from Djibouti, Ethiopia and
Sudan also chose to return. At the same
time, relatively small numbers of Somali
refugees in Dadaab camp in Kenya
decided to avail themselves of the pilot
voluntary repatriation programme into
areas deemed safe in Somalia (Baidoa,
Kismayo, Luuq and Mogadishu). Some
5,700 repatriated voluntarily during the
year.

Achievements and
impact
Seeking durable solutions
Despite declining numbers of those
being able to return voluntarily to their
countries of origin in recent years, efforts
to find durable solutions for refugees
and IDPs continued. In 2015, more than
130,700 refugees were able to return to
their areas of origin.

Some 2,000 people were able to
repatriate from Liberia to Côte d’Ivoire in
2015. An additional 100 Liberian refugees
were also able to return from Benin,
Ghana and Togo. As mentioned above,
some 5,700 Somali refugees were able
to repatriate to Somalia in the course
of the year, while some 10,000 Somalis
in Ethiopia registered for voluntary
repatriation in 2016. A total of 4,650
refugees also returned to Rwanda from
the region, with an estimated 72,000
people still awaiting solutions. Local
integration was also supported for those
affected by several long-term situations,
such as the former Burundian refugees
living in Tanzania since 1972, of whom
nearly 200,000 became Tanzanian
citizens in 2015. Local integration
opportunities were also being sought
for more than 3,700 former Rwandan
refugees in Zambia.

Preventing and reducing
statelessness
The efforts to raise awareness about
statelessness through the #IBelong
Campaign to End Statelessness by
2024 bore some fruit in 2015. The
Regional Ministerial-level Conference on
Statelessness in West Africa, hosted by
ECOWAS in Abidjan on 25 February 2015,
was attended by all ECOWAS countries
and garnered 25 new commitments from
States to accede to either one or both
of the statelessness conventions. The

UNHCR Global Report 2015

adoption in August 2015 of the Protocol
on the Right to Nationality in Africa by
the African Commission on Human and
Peoples’ Rights was a positive step
towards the anticipated overall adoption
of this important protocol by the African
Union in 2016.

Constraints
In 2015, UNHCR encountered problems
of access and insecurity in most situations
still affected by widespread conflict.
Food insecurity in Africa had been a
growing concern, and in 2015 it affected
more than 76 per cent of refugees in the
region, who experienced a reduction
in food rations. UNHCR carried out an
analysis of a large number of African
countries’ nutrition status reports, the
results of which showed above-standard
rates of global acute malnutrition, stunting
and anaemia. Negative coping strategies
such as skipping meals, children
leaving school to work, survival sex and
theft were noted throughout refugee
camps in Africa. In some parts of the

52

UNHCR Global Report 2015

continent including Djibouti, Ethiopia and
Rwanda, cash distributions were being
used to support the most vulnerable.
Nevertheless, it was anticipated that,
particularly in the areas also affected
by El Niño weather conditions, food
insecurity would persist, and further
efforts to address food needs would be
required in 2016.
One of UNHCR’s core priorities was
to ensure a better future for refugees
and other displaced people through
education (see Building better futures
chapter). Nevertheless, with resources
continually stretched and sometimes
diverted to address the most pressing
life-saving needs for a greater proportion
of displaced people of concern, the
Office was concerned that it had not
been able to ensure the availability and
a consistent quality of education for all
refugee children.
With the need to focus on life-saving
emergency measures in so many
situations worldwide, UNHCR was only
able to dedicate around 10 per cent of
available funding in 2015 to livelihoods
and solutions activities in Africa. n

A f r i ca

Expenditure in Africa | 2011-2015

Financial information
The original 2015 budget for the Africa region
approved by the Executive Committee in
2014 amounted to USD 2,169 million. At the
end of 2015, the revised budget for 2015 had
increased to USD 2,775 million.
Emergencies in 2015 accounted for almost
half of UNHCR’s requirements in Africa, mainly
because of additional needs, including for
the Burundi situation (supplementary needs
of USD 207 million), the Nigeria situation
(supplementary needs of USD 91 million),
the South Sudan situation (supplementary
needs of USD 248 million) and the Yemen
situation (supplementary needs in Africa of
USD 39 million).
Total voluntary contributions received for the
Africa region amounted to USD 979.7 million,
leaving 65 per cent of the region’s needs
unmet. While UNHCR was able to consolidate
its response in some major operations, the
new crises required immediate action and,
in the case of the Burundi situation, the
mobilization of hundreds of staff and assets.
Never before has the African continent hosted
as large a number of displaced people in its
history. In the past five years, the proportion of
UNHCR’s resources available to assist people
of concern in Africa has seen a drop. As an
example, in Ethiopia alone, almost 750,000
refugees were affected by reductions in food
assistance in 2015. The food situation has an
impact on the protection of UNHCR’s people
of concern, on the attendance rate of children
in schools, and on child labour, to name only a
few of the consequences.

Working
environment
The Middle East and North Africa
region continued to face high levels of
displacement throughout 2015. With
three system-wide, Level-3 emergencies
in Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria)
and Yemen, the region accounted
for more than 30 per cent of global
displacement, including 2.7 million
refugees, 13.9 million internally displaced
people (IDPs) and an estimated 374,200
stateless individuals.

UNHCR/Bassam Diab

Protection remained UNHCR’s main
priority in the Middle East and North
Africa. The Office worked closely with
governments and partners to enhance
protection space, focusing on: advocating
access to safety and protection from
refoulement; reinforcing registration and
refugee status determination; promoting
legislative frameworks; addressing the
risk of statelessness; ensuring security
from violence and exploitation; and
working towards durable solutions,
including by expanding resettlement
opportunities.

Major operations
This overview highlights key aspects
of the main situations that required
emergency or sustained response from
UNHCR and its partners in 2015. More
details on individual operations are
available in the relevant subregional and
country operations pages on the Global
Focus website (http://reporting.unhcr.org).
The crisis in Syria continued to trigger
unprecedented levels of displacement.
At the end of 2015, more than 6.5 million
Syrians were internally displaced, and
4.6 million sought refuge in Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Against this
backdrop, UNHCR worked with more
than 200 partners to support national
response plans in these five main hosting
countries, in line with the Regional
Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP).
Despite the continued generosity of
host countries and donors, Syrian
refugees faced increasingly difficult living
conditions after more than five years
in exile, with many falling further into
poverty. Meanwhile, host governments
battled economic and security challenges
as a result of the conflict.
Inside Syria, the humanitarian situation
and level of human suffering endured by
the Syrian people dramatically worsened
in 2015. Safe, unimpeded and sustained
humanitarian access in the country
remained a significant challenge. An
estimated 13.5 million people were in
need of humanitarian assistance, including
4.5 million in hard-to-reach locations.
With respect to onward movement, 2015
witnessed a notable increase in those
seeking refuge in Europe. By the end of
the year, Syrians comprised the largest
proportion of those who undertook
dangerous journeys by sea.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

In Iraq, the escalation of armed
conflict resulted in significant internal
displacement. Nearly 3.3 million people
had been displaced across the country
since January 2014. This figure does
not include, however, nearly 1 million
people displaced by sectarian violence
between 2006 and 2008. In 2015,
nearly 222,000 Iraqis sought asylum in
the region. Growing numbers of Iraqis,
facing precarious living conditions and
impoverishment, resorted to negative
coping strategies or onward movement.
Yemen’s alarming and complex
humanitarian situation continued to
deteriorate. With conflict escalating at the
end of March 2015, approximately 170,000
people fled to Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia
and Sudan, as well as other countries
in the East and Horn of Africa. More
than 2.5 million people were internally
displaced, and an estimated 82 per cent
of the Yemeni population were in need
of humanitarian assistance. Despite
insecurity, Yemen continued to host some
267,000 refugees residing either in urban
areas or in Kharaz camp. The country also
received 92,500 new arrivals in mixed
movements, two-thirds of which arrived
after the conflict began. This represented
one of the highest annual totals of arrivals
for Yemen in the past decade. At least 95
people are known to have died or gone
missing in the Gulf of Aden in 2015.
Unrest continued to affect people of
concern to UNHCR in Libya, including
approximately 435,000 internally
displaced people (IDPs) and an
estimated 100,000 refugees and asylumseekers, more than 36,400 of whom
were registered with UNHCR. The
Office provided life-saving assistance
to individuals deemed most vulnerable
through its partners and national staff,
though access remained a challenge.
Cooperation with the Libyan coast
guard and immigration authorities was

200 partners, in line with the 3RP.
Support was provided to host countries
and communities, as well as to Iraqi and
Syrian refugees in the region.

Safeguarding access to
protection and asylum

Cash-based assistance, targeting
the most vulnerable, and registration
activities remained priorities in 2015.
Almost all of Iraqis and Syrians deemed
in need of winter assistance received
relevant support. This included 1.5
million Syrian refugees in the region,
1.1 million IDPs in Syria, more than
94,000 Iraqi refugees in the region, and
more than 500,000 IDPs in Iraq. The
Office continued to conduct individual
biometric registration for those in need
of international protection. In 2015, the
Office registered more than 148,000
Syrians in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and
Lebanon. Operations carried out refugee
status determination under UNHCR’s
mandate to safeguard the integrity,
quality and efficiency of the process.

protection issues, UNHCR continued to
implement a multisectoral, coordinated
and community-based approach to
prevention and response. Activities
aimed at strengthening national and
community-based protection systems,
as well as detention monitoring were
prioritized.
UNHCR provided ongoing support to
the Sahrawi refugees in the five camps
near Tindouf, Algeria. In October 2015,
the Office coordinated the inter-agency
response following unexpected weather
conditions that caused flooding in the
five camps.
Throughout the region, UNHCR
focused on the protection of urban
refugees, assistance to those in need,
and advocacy for burden-sharing with
governments and host communities.

Addressing mixed
movements
Large-scale mixed movements continued,
particularly in North Africa. Many
travelling in such movements came
from sub-Saharan Africa and the Horn
of Africa, as well as from within the
Middle East and North Africa region itself,
seeking to move onwards to Europe.
In response to mixed movements,
UNHCR adopted a regional approach
with four strategic objectives:
preventing refoulement; improving
access to safety and asylum;
empowering people of concern to
make informed decisions about their
lives; and enhancing protection space
and access to solutions within broader
migration frameworks.
In North Africa, UNHCR continued to work
towards establishing responsive national

62

UNHCR Global Report 2015

asylum systems and strengthening the
protection-sensitive management of
mixed movements. Progress on the
development of draft laws on asylum
and national strategies for migration
was achieved in Algeria, Mauritania,
Morocco and Tunisia. In Libya, UNHCR
provided core relief items to nearly
65,000 people of concern and continued
to provide information on the protection
and assistance available through partner
hotlines and community centres in
Benghazi and Tripoli.
UNHCR and the IOM developed a joint
approach to mixed movements through
an inter-agency response plan in Yemen,
The Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea with
a special focus on the Yemen situation IOM and UNHCR Proposals for Strategic
Action, which aimed to address the
onward movement of refugees and
migrants.

Ensuring protection of IDPs
UNHCR continued to support the interagency coordination framework by
leading the protection, shelter and nonfood items, and camp coordination and
camp management sectors in Iraq and
Syria.
Inside Syria, some 3.2 million people
received core relief items, including
nearly 430,000 people in more than
30 hard-to-reach locations and some
469,000 people through cross-border
operations.
In Yemen, the Office worked with
partners to distribute core relief items
and other shelter materials to more
than 283,000 IDPs in 19 of the country’s
21 governorates. UNHCR co-led IDP
protection monitoring and regularly
updated the IDP figures in the country.

M i d d l e

Seeking durable solutions
In 2015, UNHCR encouraged States in
the Middle East and North Africa to take
one or more of the 10 actions contained
in the Global Action Plan, which sets out
the strategy for achieving the goals of the
#IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness
by 2024. Advocacy efforts focused on
addressing the risk of statelessness in
situations of forced displacement, family
separation, and the loss or destruction
of identity documents. UNHCR worked
with governments to ensure the birth
registration of refugee children born in
exile and internally displaced children,
and to address gaps in nationality laws
that increased the risk of statelessness.
UNHCR worked towards achieving
durable solutions for people of concern,
including through resettlement. The
files of nearly 67,000 refugees from the
Middle East and North Africa region were
submitted for resettlement in 2015. In
addition to accelerating resettlement
processing, the Office advocated
alternative pathways for admission, such
as humanitarian visas, community-based
private sponsorships, labour mobility
schemes, and family reunification,
including for extended family members.
In Mauritania, UNHCR enhanced selfreliance activities for some 50,000
registered refugees in M’bera camp,
including by further investing in
education, vocational training and
income-generation projects. Following a
verification exercise carried out in 2015,
the nationality of some 3,700 Mauritanian
returnees was confirmed. The returnees
received assistance to reintegrate into
their areas of origin, and their files were
deactivated from the relevant database
of registered refugees. A further 8,000
returnees whose nationality was
confirmed will have their files deactivated
from UNHCR’s database in 2016.

Strengthening leadership
and coordination
UNHCR further strengthened its
partnership with States, governmental
and non-governmental organizations,
and civil society across the region. The
Office continued to cooperate closely
with regional organizations such as the
League of Arab States, the Organisation
of Islamic Cooperation and the Gulf
Cooperation Council. In addition,
partnerships with the private sector and
development actors were reinforced,
particularly in responding to the Syria
situation.

Constraints
Insecurity continued to impede delivery
of humanitarian assistance and
hinder access to people of concern.
Although every effort was made to
boost assistance in hard-to-reach
areas, providing basic items in some
countries, including Iraq, Libya, Syria
and Yemen, was difficult. Unstable and
unpredictable political situations also
continued to affect UNHCR operations
in the region.
The humanitarian situation significantly
worsened in 2015, with refugees and
other people in need of international
protection becoming increasingly
vulnerable because of ongoing
displacement. The loss of hope among
displaced populations and the increased
burden on refugee-hosting communities
was palpable.
With more than 85 per cent of refugees
across the region living among host
communities, the dire situation of urban
refugees demanded special attention. In
particular, many Syrian refugees in large
cities were living in extreme poverty and

Financial information
The original 2015 budget for the Middle East and
North Africa region approved by the Executive
Committee in 2014 amounted to USD 1,886 million.
At the end of 2015, the revised budget for 2015
had increased to USD 2,137 million, mainly because
of additional requirements for the Iraq and Yemen
situations.
Total voluntary contributions received for the region
amounted to USD 1,229.8 million, leaving almost half
of the region's needs unmet.
Despite record levels of contributions, funding levels
in 2015 did not match needs. The impact of this
shortfall included:
• The livelihoods component of the 3RP was
critically underfunded (21 per cent), weakening
the capacity of refugee and host community
households to cope with poverty.

were forced to resort to negative coping mechanisms for
their survival.
Countries in North Africa were increasingly challenged
by mixed onward movements, including the smuggling
and trafficking of migrants and refugees risking their lives
to reach Europe or other destinations in North Africa.
Owing to the region’s multiple crises and complex
operational environment, the prospects for durable
solutions for most refugee populations remained elusive.
Meanwhile, UNHCR focused on the role of innovation in
improving delivery and gaining efficiencies for the benefit
of refugees and other people of concern.
A lack of funding severely affected UNHCR operations in
the region. For example, by the end of 2015, the 3RP was
only 62 per cent funded. n

• In Algeria, only 2,000 refuge families out of more
than 17,000 received shelter rehabilitation support
after their homes were damaged or destroyed by
flooding.
• In Iraq, the education sector was severely
underfunded. In camps in the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq, only 71 per cent of Syrian refugee children
aged 6-17 attended school. Some schools were
closed in 2015 because teacher salaries could
not be paid. Moreover, many schools ran double
shifts in order to accommodate the high demand
for places.
• In Lebanon, although as many as 860,000
vulnerable Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian
individuals received monthly food assistance
through cash-based programmes, funds provided
on an individual basis decreased from USD 27
per month to an average of USD 18.2 per month.
• In Mauritania, funding constraints limited
livelihoods initiatives. Some 1,500 people of
concern deemed vulnerable could not benefit
from income-generating activities.
• In Yemen, support available for survivors of SGBV
were reduced, and only 90 of the 250 survivors
identified benefited from enrolment in incomegenerating activities.

Working
environment
By the end of 2015, the Asia and Pacific
region was home to 9.8 million people of
concern to UNHCR, including 3.8 million
refugees, 2.9 million internally displaced
people (IDPs) and an estimated 1.5 million
stateless individuals.

and the

Pacific

The majority of refugees in the region
originate from Afghanistan or Myanmar.
Afghan refugees – of whom there were
around 2.6 million – remain the largest
protracted refugee population of concern
to UNHCR. Although they are present
in some 70 countries, 95 per cent live
in the neighbouring Islamic Republics of
Iran and Pakistan. These countries have
generously hosted Afghan refugees for
more than three decades.

UNHCR/Diego Ibarra Sánchez

Over two-thirds of the refugee population
in Asia and the Pacific in 2015 were
hosted in urban and semi-urban
areas. UNHCR, together with partners,
continued to work with States and other
actors to strengthen the protection of
those living outside camps. The Office
focused its interventions on four main
objectives: undertaking community
outreach; strengthening relations with
urban refugees; ensuring access to
essential services such as health care
and education; and promoting livelihoods
and self-reliance.

Major operations
This overview highlights key aspects
of the main situations that required
emergency or sustained response from
UNHCR and its partners in 2015. More
details on individual operations are
available in the relevant subregional
and country operations pages on the
Global Focus website (http://reporting.
unhcr.org).
Positive political developments in
Afghanistan in early 2015 generated
hope for increased stability and
opportunities to find solutions for
displaced people. The National Unity
Government demonstrated a strong
commitment to facilitating voluntary
repatriation in safety and dignity, and to
including both refugee and IDP returnees
in national priority programmes. Another
particularly welcome development was
the establishment of a ministerial-level
High Commission on Migration.
During the year, numerous tripartite
and quadripartite meetings were held
between the Islamic Republics of
Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, together
with UNHCR. Each resulted in closer
cooperation between the three countries
and firm resolve to finding solutions for
Afghan refugees. In addition, the highlevel segment of the 66th session of
the Executive Committee of the High
Commissioner’s Programme focused on
the Afghan refugee situation.

70

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Nevertheless, the situation in Afghanistan
remained challenging. Deteriorating
security and increased levels of violence
during the latter part of the year resulted
in large-scale internal displacement.
Some 190,000 Afghans sought asylum in
other parts of the world, the majority in
Europe. In 2015, Afghan nationals made
up the second largest group of asylumseekers in industrialized countries
worldwide, after Syrians. Approximately
one quarter of this population were
unaccompanied or separated children.
Despite these challenges, UNHCR
continued to work with Afghanistan’s
National Unity Government, humanitarian
and development partners, civil society
and other actors to facilitate the
reintegration of returning refugees and
to assist IDPs. The Office also advocated
support from the international community
to the Governments of the Islamic
Republics of Iran and Pakistan, and for
the continued protection of Afghan
refugees on their territories until lasting
solutions were found.
In Myanmar, the 2015 elections were
a major milestone in the country’s
history, leading to renewed hope for
stability following the establishment
of a democratic government. The coruling National League for Democracy
party made nationwide peace talks the
first priority of the new Government
and committed to efforts to ensure that
all ethnic groups sign the proposed
ceasefire agreement.

A s i a

It is hoped that the newly-elected
Government of Myanmar will pursue
solutions to internal displacement and
refugee returns, and collaborate with
countries in the region to address the
root causes that have prompted large
numbers of people to risk their lives
on dangerous boat journeys in SouthEast Asia. Some 33,600 refugees and
migrants embarked on such movements
in 2015. An estimated 370 people lost
their lives during these journeys, mostly
from starvation, dehydration, disease and
abuse, including at the hands of people
smugglers.

Although departures from the Bay of
Bengal in the first half of 2015 were 34
per cent higher than in the first half of
2014, the total number of departures
during the year was half of the 2014
figure. This decline has been attributed
to heightened scrutiny of maritime
movements following a serious incident
in the subregion in May 2015, when some
5,000 refugees were abandoned in the
Andaman Sea by smugglers.

In Central Asia, UNHCR supported
governments in ensuring that national
status determination procedures were
consistent with international refugee
law, as well as in the development
of protection-sensitive migration
management systems, including through
capacity-building for stakeholders.
States in the region have also made
great strides towards addressing
issues surrounding statelessness
and citizenship. In 2015, UNHCR also
undertook a major restructuring of its
presence in the Central Asia region.

Achievements and
impact
Safeguarding access to
protection and asylum
In 2015, UNHCR continued to work
with States in the region to improve
protection standards, including in the
context of mixed movements. In addition
to advocating and supporting the
establishment of robust national asylum
procedures, the Office also promoted
protection-sensitive migratory systems
that facilitate the mobility of people with
international protection needs in the
region.
Access to protection and asylum is critical
for the large number of Afghan refugees.
In Pakistan, authorities extended
refugees’ proof of registration cards until
the end of 2015 and agreed provisionally
to move this deadline to June 2016.
UNHCR is working with the Government
of Pakistan on a further extension.
UNHCR also implemented 62 Refugee
Affected and Hosting Areas (RAHA)
projects during the year in Pakistan. The
projects spanned numerous sectors,
such as education, health, water and
sanitation and livelihoods, and aimed to
improve the living conditions of close
to 1 million people, including some
226,000 Afghan refugees; increase
tolerance towards Afghans in Pakistan;
improve social cohesion to promote
coexistence; and provide Afghans with
a more predictable means of temporary
stay.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

In a welcome move, the Government
of the Islamic Republic of Iran included
refugees in its Universal Public Health
Insurance scheme, which allowed
refugees to benefit from insurance for
hospitalization that is similar to Iranian
nationals. This large-scale initiative was
based on an agreement signed last year
between UNHCR, the Bureau for Aliens
and Foreign Immigrants Affairs of the
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Health, and the Iran Health Insurance
Organization (Salamat). Access to the
Salamat health insurance stood to benefit
nearly 1 million Afghan and Iraqi refugees
living in the country by addressing the
financial challenges related to the high
cost of health care and improving the
physical, mental, economic and social
well-being of refugees.
In addition, the Government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran also allowed
Afghan children of school age to
access formal education, regardless of
their documentation status. Since May
2015, some 50,000 undocumented
Afghan children have been enrolled in
the national education system for the
2015/2016 academic year.
After some 5,000 refugees and migrants
were abandoned in the Andaman Sea
by smugglers in May 2015, a series
of regional meetings took place to
address States’ concerns with respect
to high-risk mixed movements by sea.
Common priorities emerging from these
discussions in 2015 included: saving
lives; combating people smuggling and
trafficking; expanding legal pathways
for migration; and addressing the root
causes of such movements.

Seeking durable solutions
for protracted refugee
situations
In 2015, the search for solutions for
different populations of concern to
UNHCR remained a priority in Asia
and the Pacific, in particular for Afghan
refugees. With this in mind, the Office
dedicated the high-level segment of the
66th session of the Executive Committee
of the High Commissioner’s Programme
in October 2015 to the Afghan refugee
situation to reinvigorate action and
mobilize the international community’s
support for durable solutions for Afghan
refugees.
The Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran
and Pakistan renewed their commitment
to work towards durable solutions
and reiterated the importance of the
Solutions strategy for Afghan refugees
to support voluntary repatriation,
sustainable reintegration and assistance
for host countries as a key regional,
multi-year framework. The high-level
segment also confirmed the need for the
international community to strengthen
its efforts and advocacy to help remove
the fundamental causes of protracted
displacement in Afghanistan.
UNHCR continued to facilitate the
voluntary return of Afghan refugees in
2015. More than 58,000 Afghan refugees
returned to their home country during the
year, the vast majority from Pakistan.
A major milestone was reached in
2015 with the resettlement of more

an d

t h e

P ac i f i c

than 100,000 refugees from Bhutan.
UNHCR, together with IOM, facilitated
their departure from camps in Nepal to
third countries. The programme was
launched in 2007 and is one of the
largest and most successful programmes
of its kind.
Following the political developments
in Myanmar in 2015, UNHCR stepped
up its preparations for the voluntary
return of Myanmar refugees from camps
in Thailand and other neighbouring
countries. Small numbers of spontaneous
returns took place during the year, and
the Office continues to hold regular
consultations and information-sharing
on voluntary repatriation with Myanmar
refugees, the Governments of Myanmar
and Thailand, non-state actors, as well as
donor and NGO representatives.
In 2015, UNHCR facilitated the return of
some 450 Sri Lankan refugees from India.
These refugee returnees benefitted from
repatriation and transport grants, nonfood items and access to legal advice on
housing, land and property issues.
For the large numbers of refugees
living in urban and semi-urban areas
in the region, UNHCR adopted a
pragmatic approach to solutions. This
included promoting the self-reliance and
empowerment of refugee communities,
pending a durable solution; advocating
with States, regional entities and other
partners; and seeking to ensure the
inclusion of refugees in existing services
run by national authorities or other UN
entities.

Ensuring protection and
durable solutions for IDPs
Promising political developments for
peace in Myanmar may prove significant
for the 416,000 people who remained
internally displaced in different parts of
the country. Many of these IDPs were
forced to flee violence in Rakhine state
in 2012, but they also included some
100,000 people who were displaced
in Kachin and northern Shan states
following the resumption of violence
there in 2011. UNHCR led the combined
cluster for shelter, camp coordination and
camp management, and non-food items,
and coordinated the protection sector.
The Office also pursued efforts to find
durable solutions for IDPs as part of the
inter-agency response.
In Pakistan, almost 700,000 IDPs had
returned home since March 2015, when
the Government of Pakistan began largescale return operations to Khyber Agency,
South Waziristan and North Waziristan.
UNHCR supported the Government by
providing tents and basic household
items to IDP returnees. Throughout
the year, the Office also assisted some
230,000 people who had been displaced
to Afghanistan’s Khost Province from
North Waziristan in Pakistan a year
earlier. UNHCR distributed tents to 9,300
families and non-food items to 7,250
families. The Office also helped families
prepare for winter by providing them with
blankets, firewood and winter clothes.

74

UNHCR Global Report 2015

The deteriorating security situation
in Afghanistan led to the internal
displacement of more than 330,000
Afghans in 2015 – a 70 per cent increase
compared to 2014. This added to the
existing internally displaced population
of nearly 1.2 million people, present in 31
out of the country’s 34 provinces. UNHCR
continued working with the Afghan
Government on the implementation of
the national IDP policy.
The Office contributed to emergency
response operations in the aftermath
of Nepal’s devastating earthquake in
May 2015. Within 72 hours of the quake,
UNHCR distributed 11,000 tarpaulins and
4,000 solar lamps to affected families, in
coordination with local security forces.
In addition, through four cargo flights
from Dubai, 42,000 tarpaulins were
delivered to provide life-saving shelter
for 200,000 people living in the open
and 8,000 solar lamps to provide
greater security and protection for
families living without power. The Office
also helped launch a radio programme
providing psychosocial support to more
than 2 million affected and traumatized
Nepalese listeners.
In the Philippines, UNHCR continued
to monitor the condition of more than
160,000 displaced people in Mindanao,
make referrals to relevant services as
needed, and support the provision of
immediate birth registration to enable
children to access government services.

A s i a

Preventing and reducing
statelessness
Addressing statelessness remained a
key strategic priority in Asia and the
Pacific, with at least 1.5 million people
in the region falling within UNHCR’s
statelessness mandate.
In 2015, solutions to protracted
statelessness situations continued
to progress in South-East Asia. In
December 2015, new figures released
by the Government of Thailand showed
that more than 18,000 stateless people
had acquired Thai nationality since the
beginning of 2012.
In the southern Philippines, more than
7,000 people of Indonesian descent
were registered and provided with legal
assistance in a joint project undertaken
by the Governments of Indonesia and
the Philippines, together with UNHCR.
More than 600 people were found to be
eligible to have either their Indonesian or
Filipino nationality confirmed.
In Malaysia, a UNHCR partner community
organization registered more than 11,000
stateless people of Tamil origin since
mid-2014; at least 5,600 applications for
nationality were made with the assistance
of community-based paralegals and
some 450 applicants acquired Malaysian
nationality.

UNHCR promotes the inclusion of births,
marriages and deaths for all populations of
concern in Asia and the Pacific in national
civil registration systems. Since May 2015,
the Office has been a member of the intergovernmental regional steering group,
which supported States in implementing
their commitments under the 2014
ministerial declaration and the Regional
action framework on civil registration
and vital statistics in Asia and the Pacific.
These instruments were adopted by
States at a ministerial conference in
Bangkok in November 2014.
The Central Asia subregion made
remarkable progress towards resolving
existing cases of statelessness, as well as
in preventing new cases. In 2015, some
7,800 individuals obtained citizenship
or had their nationality confirmed. In
Turkmenistan, important strides were
made towards resolving statelessness
through Government naturalization
programmes. Draft amendments to the
Law on Citizenship were under review
by the Kyrgyz Parliament, while the Law
on Citizenship in Tajikistan was amended
and signed. The Government of Tajikistan
formed an inter-ministerial working group
on statelessness and developed a multiyear national action plan for the profiling
and registration of, and provision of
solutions for, stateless people and those
at risk of becoming stateless by no later
than 2018.

Constraints
The lack of a legal and institutional
framework to anchor protection and
solutions in many of the situations in Asia
and the Pacific continued to pose a major
challenge to UNHCR. Of the 45 countries
in the region, only 20 had acceded to the
1951 Refugee Convention relating to the
Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
Detention and other restrictive treatment
of asylum-seekers and refugees
continued to be of concern to the Office,
including the policy responses of some
States to mixed movements by sea.
Given the increasing need for protection
and solutions for those affected by
conflict worldwide, third-country
resettlement was deemed unrealistic
for most refugees in the Asia and
Pacific region. Therefore, regional

76

UNHCR Global Report 2015

priorities for UNHCR included identifying
alternatives to detention of asylumseekers; alternatives to individual status
determination; and mechanisms to
provide protection to people of concern
in the region beyond third-country
resettlement, including bilateral labour
migration agreements.
In parts of South-West Asia, insecurity
combined with deteriorating political
and socio-economic conditions affected
UNHCR’s operations. Humanitarian
access was severely limited, and staff
security remained a concern.
Meanwhile, in parts of South-East Asia,
the ability of humanitarian organizations
to work independently and impartially
was a challenge, seriously hampering
programme implementation throughout
2015. n

Financial information
UNHCR’s requirements in Asia and the Pacific
remained constant, at around USD 550-600
million, for the previous five years.
The 2015 budget for the region, approved
by the Executive Committee in 2014, initially
amounted to approximately USD 565 million.
At the end of the year, the revised budget for
2015 rose to some USD 596 million, mainly
because of additional requirements in the
amount of USD 28 million, as presented in the
supplementary appeals for the refugee influx
from Pakistan’s North Waziristan Agency to
Afghanistan (USD 16 million) and the Bay of
Bengal and Andaman sea initiative (USD 12
million).
Despite this, total voluntary contributions
received for the region amounted to
USD 207.1 million, leaving almost 65 per cent
of the region’s needs unmet. In this financial
context, UNHCR scaled back operations and
made difficult decisions to decrease the level
of activity in some operations and close some
field offices, particularly affecting Central Asia.
More importantly, protection-related activities
– including registration, monitoring and
refugee status determination – were scaled
down, causing some delays and backlogs. The
overall situation hampered UNHCR’s ability
to adequately respond to the protection and
assistance needs of populations of concern in
Asia and the Pacific.

Working
environment
An unprecedented refugee crisis in
Europe unfolded in 2015 as an increasing
number of people risked their lives to
cross the Mediterranean Sea in search of
safety and protection.
More than 1 million people arrived in
Southern Europe by boat during the
year, with 84 per cent from the world’s
top 10 refugee-producing countries
including Afghanistan, Iraq and the
Syrian Arab Republic (Syria). The majority
of the new arrivals – at least 850,000
people – crossed the Aegean Sea from
Turkey and arrived in Greece. During the
year, some 3,770 people died or were
reported missing in the Mediterranean
Sea. Children made up 31 per cent of
total arrivals; many are unaccompanied
or separated and require particular care
and attention.

UNHCR/Rafal Kostrzynski

The impact of the crisis was felt across
the continent due to the significant
onward movement from Greece to
countries in Western and Northern
Europe through the Western Balkans
route. Refugees dominated the region’s
news and political agenda in 2015 and
the crisis severely tested the Common
European Asylum System (CEAS). Existing
frameworks were unable to facilitate the
management of the crisis or preserve the
protection space in a sustainable manner,
which placed Europe’s asylum system in
jeopardy.

Faced with domestic pressure, numerous
European countries responded to
the crisis by unilaterally imposing
greater restrictions on access to their
territories, both legal and physical. Many
countries along the Western Balkans
route passed legislation that placed
increased limitations on the ability
of various refugee groups to access
asylum systems. Furthermore, 2015 saw
walls and fences erected along borders
between several countries in an effort
to thwart the movement of refugees into
their countries and across Europe.
Xenophobia and intolerance continued
to mark the public discourse in
many countries in Europe, leading to
discrimination and, at times, violence,
increasing pressure on European
governments to further impose restrictive
legislation, such as on family reunification,
and limitations on access to national
asylum systems. UNHCR remained
particularly concerned by States violating
their legal obligations towards refugees
and asylum-seekers, which resulted
in large numbers of people forcibly
returned, across border points, outside of
legal channels.
More than 2 million asylum applications
were lodged in 38 European countries
in 2015 – almost three times the number
in 2014 (709,757). It should be noted,
however, that the recording of statistical
information in Europe in 2015 includes
some instances of double counting.
According to European government
statistics, the main countries of origin
of applicants were Syria (675,668),
Afghanistan (406,300) and Iraq (253,558).
European Union (EU) Member States
received more than 1.2 million asylum
applications, with Germany and Sweden
receiving close to 50 per cent of
applications launched in the EU.

UNHCR also continued to respond
to the critical humanitarian needs of
many forcibly displaced people in
Ukraine, where access was sometimes
challenging.

Major operations
This overview highlights key aspects
of the main situations that required
emergency or sustained response from
UNHCR and its partners in 2015. More
details on individual operations are
available in the relevant subregional and
country operations pages on the Global
Focus website (http://reporting.unhcr.org).
Turkey remained host to the largest
number of refugees in the world. The
Government of Turkey registered more
than 2.5 million Syrians by year end, of
whom approximately 10 per cent resided in
camps and the remainder in urban areas,
and more than 250,000 asylum-seekers
and refugees of other nationalities,
predominantly Afghans and Iraqis, were
also living in the country. Urban refugees
continued to need significant support,
particularly in the areas of education,
livelihoods and social welfare.
Syrian refugees in Turkey benefitted
from temporary protection, which
granted them documentation and
legal stay upon registration, as well
as access to education, primary and
emergency health care, and the labour
market. Under the framework of the
Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan
(3RP), the inter-agency response to
the Syria crisis, UNHCR continued to
support Turkey’s implementation of the
temporary protection regulation, and
Syrian refugees’ access to rights and
entitlements.

Greece experienced an unprecedented
increase in new arrivals by sea with
more than 850,000 arrivals in 2015, the
vast majority of whom moved onwards
through the Western Balkans to Northern
and Western Europe. In response to this
critical situation, UNHCR declared an
internal level 2 emergency in July 2015
and launched a response to significantly
scale up its presence and activities not
only in Greece, but also in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary.
In close coordination with national
authorities, NGO partners, and civil
society, including volunteers, UNHCR
provided protection and assistance to
people of concern, including support
to emergency reception arrangements,
and with a particular focus on those with
specific needs.

The humanitarian situation in eastern
Ukraine remained precarious, with largescale displacement challenging resources
and diminishing the resilience of both
internally displaced people (IDPs) and
host communities. The poor economic
situation complicated the pursuit of
livelihoods, availability of adequate
accommodation and ability to meet
basic living costs. Most of the internally
displaced were not eligible to vote,
presenting obstacles to representation,
integration and solutions.
The situation for civilians living near
the contact line (between governmentcontrolled and non-governmentcontrolled areas) in Ukraine was
particularly difficult. Restrictions on the
movement of people and goods across
contact lines were in place. In addition,

UNHCR Global Report 2015

85

Eur o p e

a registration process for humanitarian
organizations, introduced by de facto
authorities in non-government-controlled
areas in June 2015, further complicated
the humanitarian response. In 2015,
UNHCR and OCHA were the only UN
organizations authorized to conduct
humanitarian activities in the selfproclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic.
In non-government-controlled areas
of Donetsk, no UN organization was
authorized to conduct humanitarian
activities, and the lack of humanitarian
access and presence to support the
conflict-affected populations was of
growing concern.

Achievements and
impact
Emergency response in
Europe
In the context of UNHCR’s Special
Mediterranean Initiative and the interagency Regional Refugee and Migrant
Response Plan, and in coordination with
Governments, NGOs and civil society, and
volunteers, the Office in 2015 launched
emergency response operations in
Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Serbia and
Slovenia.
In accordance with UNHCR’s Regional
Protection Strategy, the response aimed
at ensuring access to asylum; ensuring
a protection-centred humanitarian
response, taking into account age,
gender and diversity and with particular
attention to those with specific needs,
strengthening protection systems and
providing for during solutions. Activities
included significantly strengthening
partnership and coordination structures
together with governments to strengthen

86

UNHCR Global Report 2015

asylum systems and other national
institutions providing protection for
people of concern; enhancing protection,
border, and detention monitoring and
interventions; providing emergency
assistance and supporting efforts to
provide emergency reception capacity;
strengthening efforts to communicate
with people of concern; and further
developing analysis and reporting
capacity.
As part of its overall response strategy
and in particular to mitigate the effects
of the winter, UNHCR and partners
distributed 41,335 blankets, 3,123 hygiene
kits, 4,662 mats and 9,434 raincoats in
Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.
Significant investments were made to
prepare reception and accommodation
facilities for winter.

Safeguarding asylum space
UNHCR continued to advocate for
access to territory and protection against
refoulement in all countries, particularly
along the Western Balkans route and
in key countries responding to the
Europe emergency. UNHCR and partners
maintained a continuous presence at
key borders and transit points, working
to ensure essential services were
available when needed, and potential
protection concerns could be addressed
in a timely and efficient manner. Efforts
ranged from interventions in cases of
violence, including pushbacks; advocating
for access to asylum; preventing family
separation and reunifying those who had
been separated; providing information
on legal options and available services;
and supporting authorities to respond to
the influx. In this context, UNHCR placed
a particular focus on assuring protectioncentred interventions for all people of
concern, including those with specific
needs.

Eur o p e

Often working together with partners,
UNHCR conducted regular and
systematic protection monitoring at
border entry and exit points, and in
detention centres. Of particular concern
was the issue of detention of children
in some countries. Moreover, access to
people of concern in detention remained
limited in some countries, further
restricting the protection space.
UNHCR also provided support to
national asylum systems in Greece, and
along the Western Balkans route, by
providing technical guidance, equipment,
and training. Furthermore, essential
information was disseminated to people
regarding their rights under international
refugee law and under the national
legislation of the country in which
they found themselves. Civil society
organizations working to help the arrivals
were also supported by the Office.
In Eastern Europe and the South
Caucasus, Phase II of the Asylum
Systems Quality Initiative (2015–2017)
was launched, following requests
for continuation by participating
Governments. Phase II maintains the
focus on bringing asylum systems in
the region in line with international
and European norms, and targets an
expanded audience of border guards
and judges involved in asylum cases, in
addition to first-instance decision makers.

Reducing protection risks
UNHCR significantly strengthened its
presence in all countries affected by the
refugee crisis in Europe in order to assist
authorities in mitigating and responding
to protection risks. Working together
with partners, interventions ranged
from support to emergency reception
arrangements and providing emergency
assistance, to providing and coordinating
protection services for people with

specific needs, including separated and
unaccompanied children.
UNHCR worked to strengthen
communications with affected
communities throughout Europe, to
ensure that communication was two
way, participatory and responsive so
as to better address protection risks
through a well-informed response.
UNHCR provided information on asylum
procedures, available services, legal
options, and rights and obligations to
people of concern. Information was
provided in multiple languages through
group information sessions, printed
leaflets, sign boards, loudspeaker, and
individual counselling. Efforts were
also made to solicit information from
people of concern, mostly through direct
engagement, participatory assessments,
and profiling, to better understand and
respond to their needs.
UNHCR, together with UNICEF, the
International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), and other partners, developed
and instituted the innovative Child and
Family Support Hubs (“Blue Dot” hubs),
to ensure basic services and necessary
protection interventions were available
to women, children, and individuals with
specific needs in key transit points and
areas of operation.
In line with the 17-point plan of action
agreed upon by concerned States at
the Meeting on the Western Balkans
Migration Route on 25 October
2015, UNHCR worked together with
authorities and partners to enhance
reception facilities in all countries
affected by the emergency. This
included working to provide genderseparated and well-lit water, sanitation
and hygiene facilities; safe places for
women and children; child-friendly
spaces; the provision of medical
and psychosocial first aid; and the

UNHCR Global Report 2015

87

Eur o p e

availability of legal counselling and
information on asylum procedures.
However, many of the reception centres
fell short of recognized humanitarian
standards in this respect. Consequently
significant protection risks remained,
including risks of sexual and genderbased violence, as well as large gaps in
prevention and response mechanisms.
UNHCR also worked with partners to
strengthen national welfare and child
protection systems, with a particular
focus on separated and unaccompanied
children. However, the impact of UNHCR’s
interventions varied, and depended on
the willingness and capacity of local and
national authorities.

Expanding opportunities for
durable solutions
Throughout 2015, UNHCR worked to
expand opportunities for both durable
and longer-term solutions for people
of concern by continually advocating
for legal pathways to Europe (both EU
and non-EU countries) from countries
of first asylum and countries hosting
large refugee populations. The
Office welcomed the adoption of the
conclusions on resettlement by the
Council of the EU for 20,000 people
over a two-year period (2015-2017), but
is concerned about the restrictions some
EU Member States are introducing on
family reunification.
UNHCR continued advocating large-scale
resettlement and humanitarian admission
programmes, as well as additional
complementary pathways for admission,
such as family reunification and student
scholarship programmes.
Inside Europe, UNHCR advocated for,
welcomed and provided in-kind support
for the EU-wide response mechanism

88

UNHCR Global Report 2015

for relocating people in clear need of
international protection from Greece and
Turkey to other EU Member States.
In its statement of 25 October 2015, EU
leaders agreed on a 17-point plan of
action to address the unprecedented
flow of refugees and migrants along the
Eastern Mediterranean-Western Balkans
route. The plan specifically called on
UNHCR to support Greek authorities to
create an additional 50,000 places in
reception capacity for people in search of
international protection – 30,000 places
to be provided by the Government
while UNHCR would create 20,000
more places primarily for the purpose of
relocating asylum-seekers from Greece
to other countries within the context
of the EU’s “hotspot approach”. On
14 December 2015, a joint declaration
was signed between UNHCR, the Ministry
for Migration Policy, and the European
Commission to formalize implementation
modalities including funding for
increasing the reception capacity in
Greece.
In South-Eastern Europe, the Regional
Office, which was established in Sarajevo
in January 2015, worked with country
operations to identify and address the
needs of vulnerable families who had
been displaced since the 1990s, with a
view to phasing out UNHCR’s operational
engagement for these populations by the
end of 2017.

Addressing statelessness
In 2015, initiatives to prevent statelessness
were taken throughout Europe.
Italy acceded to the 1961 Convention
on the Reduction of Statelessness and
Turkey acceded to the 1954 Convention
relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.
In addition, legislative amendments were
adopted in Estonia. Armenia amended its

Eur o p e

nationality law granting nationality to all
children born on the territory who would
otherwise be stateless. The Parliament of
Montenegro adopted legislation to allow
cost-free judicial procedures for late birth
registration of those born outside the
formal health-care system, benefiting
in particular members of the Roma
communities. The Republic of Moldova
conducted a nationwide campaign
that led to the issuance of Moldovan
nationality documents as of July 2015
to more than 212,000 people who had
previously held expired Soviet passports
and had not been formally recognized as
Moldovan citizens.
On the initiative of the Luxembourg
Presidency, a first ever Conclusion of the
Council of the EU on statelessness was
adopted in December 2015, inviting the
European Commission and EU Member
States to exchange good practices and to
actively coordinate national statelessness
efforts.

Ukraine emergency
response
In 2015, UNHCR worked with the
Government of Ukraine, local authorities,
and non-governmental organizations to
identify and respond to the immediate
and long-term needs of IDPs through
protection monitoring and the distribution
of shelter and core relief assistance. The
Office was actively engaged in protection
advocacy at legislative and policy levels
and successfully lobbied for amendments
adopted in December 2015 to align the
existing IDP law more closely with the
Office’s Guiding Principles on Internal
Displacement. UNHCR continued to lead
the protection and shelter/NFI clusters
and the organization's internal level-2
emergency was extended to March 2016.
In response to acute humanitarian needs,
UNHCR undertook a USD 6 million

winterization programme across eastern
Ukraine, which included cash assistance.

Constraints
The rapid pace at which people were
moving across the Western Balkans route,
coupled with their sense of urgency,
throughout 2015 presented challenges
to UNHCR’s ability to identify specific
needs and provide assistance to people
of concern. More specifically, the
transient nature of the population placed
limitations on UNHCR’s ability to effectively
communicate with those of concern and
obtain their feedback; provide services in
a timely manner, especially for people with
specific needs; and engage with individuals
in the absence of the traditional community
structure UNHCR is accustomed to working
with. Further, sudden changes in the routes
of movement, mainly resulting from border
closures and restrictions, made it difficult to
ensure that field presence was maintained
in locations where it was necessary.
For this reason, UNHCR expanded its
preparedness across the entire region
and invested in detailed analysis and
prediction of travel routes, which informed
contingency planning.
Protecting people on the move has
been made all the more difficult by
the exploitative efforts of large-scale
smuggling networks across the route.
Increased border restrictions have
consequently resulted in the heightened
dependence on illicit groups able to
facilitate movement into Western and
Northern Europe, thereby exposing
people of concern to greater protection
risks, including trafficking. The inherently
invisible nature of associations with, and
movement under, the management of
such groups made UNHCR's efforts to
access people of concern challenging. n

Financial information
The original 2015 budget for the Europe
region approved by the Executive Committee
in 2014 amounted to USD 480.5 million.
At the end of 2015, the revised budget
for 2015 had increased to USD 592
million, reflecting additional requirements
including for: the emergency response in
Europe (supplementary needs of USD 55
million); addressing the critical situation of
IDPs in Ukraine (supplementary needs of
USD 38.4 million); and responding to the
growing number of Iraqi refugees in Europe
(supplementary needs of USD 15.7 million).
Total voluntary contributions received for the
region amounted to USD 234.6 million, leaving
almost 60 per cent of the region’s needs
unmet.
Some 30 per cent of funds were allocated to
protection advocacy and capacity-building
activities, support to IDPs, and statelessness
prevention and response measures in Europe.
Support for Syrian refugees accounted for
52 per cent of available resources, while
9 per cent of resources addressed the
emergency response to the crisis in Europe.

environment

UNHCR/Markel Redondo

In 2015, UNHCR worked in the Americas
region to address multiple challenges,
particularly: placing renewed focus
on solutions in the region through the
Brazil Plan of Action (see Glossary) and
on resolving statelessness in several
countries; supporting ongoing efforts
to consolidate a peace agreement in
Colombia; and responding to the needs
of increasing numbers of displaced
people who were fleeing violence and
criminal activities in the Northern Triangle
of Central America (NTCA).

Major operations
This overview highlights key aspects
of the main situations that required
emergency or sustained response from
UNHCR and its partners in the region
in 2015. More details on individual
operations are available in the relevant
subregional and country operations
pages on the Global Focus website
(http://reporting.unhcr.org).
In 2015, the Government of Colombia
continued to engage in peace talks
with the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia to end the 50-year armed
conflict that has generated over
6.7 million internally displaced people
(IDPs) and some 350,000 refugees.
Ongoing negotiations were due to be
finalized with the signature of a peace
agreement in the first half of 2016.
In 2015, the severity and scale of violence
in the NTCA, namely in El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras, reached
unprecedented levels. The increased
presence and activity of criminal
organizations and other illegal armed
groups triggered the flight of hundreds
of thousands of people to neighbouring
countries, mainly Mexico and the United
States. Almost 40,000 people crossed

96

UNHCR Global Report 2015

the border into the United States
between October and December 2015.
Globally, the number of asylum requests
submitted by individuals from the NTCA
reached more than 55,000 in mid-2015,
more than four times the number in 2010.
In the Dominican Republic, the
authorities provided assurances it would
not deport undocumented individuals
with a legitimate claim to Dominican
nationality, and examined options to
identify nationality solutions for those
who were left stateless.
Collaboration between the Citizenship
and Immigration Services of Canada and
the United States resulted in a capacitybuilding model with Mexico (Comisión
Mexicana de Ayuda a Refugiados), to
strengthen refugee status determination
procedures.

In the Americas, UNHCR continued
its close collaboration with regional
mechanisms, including the Organization
of American States (OAS) and its interAmerican human rights bodies, the
Central American Integration System
(SICA), and MERCOSUR, as well as with
regional fora dealing with issues related
to refugees, displaced and stateless
people, such as the Regional Conference
on Migration.

Inter-agency cooperation improved
in 2015, in particular with respect
to addressing statelessness in the
Dominican Republic and Haiti. Working
within the inter-agency framework also
continued to be a priority in the context
of the Colombia peace process.
In June 2015, UNHCR, the Center for

Open Society Justice Initiative organized
the first regional meeting of the Americas
Network on Nationality and Statelessness

Achievements and
impact
Already in its first year, the Brazil Plan of
Action (see Glossary) made important
strides in building and consolidating
asylum systems, and in implementing the
programmes aimed at enhancing the quality
of asylum. The main achievements in these
areas during 2015 are outlined below.

Enhancing the quality of
asylum
Significant progress was made in the
context of the Quality Assurance Initiative
(see Safeguarding fundamental rights
chapter). Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico,
and Panama continued to align national
procedural standards on refugee status
determination to international ones,
while additional countries started quality
assurance initiatives, including Argentina
and Chile. The Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago
also expressed interest in taking part.

Eradicating statelessness
El Salvador became party to the 1954
Convention relating to the Status of
Stateless Persons, while Belize became
party to the 1961 Convention on the

98

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Reduction of Statelessness. Chiriticos, a
project undertaken in Costa Rica, assisted
indigenous children and youth of NgöbeBuglé origin with late birth registration
and documentation procedures, in
cooperation with the Government and
UNICEF. The nationality of nearly 1,400
Ngöbe-Buglé individuals was confirmed.
The Dominican Republic signalled its
commitment to finding solutions for those
born in the country but whose nationality
remains undetermined.

The Northern Triangle of
Central America
In 2015, the severity and scale of violence
in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala
reached unprecedented levels, leading
to an increase in displacement. UNHCR
developed a regional protection and
solutions strategy to support authorities
in countries of origin, transit and asylum,
to: create robust protection systems;
preserve asylum space; and strengthen
frameworks and policies on asylum,
internal displacement and solutions.
In 2015, UNHCR published the study
Women on the Run, illustrating the
consequences of violence, including
sexual and gender-based violence, on
female refugees and asylum-seekers.
In June 2015, the Central American

Th e

Integration System (SICA) approved
the establishment of the Human
Rights Observatory on Displacement.
The Government of Honduras, in
cooperation with UNHCR and the Joint
IDP Profiling Service, conducted an
IDP profiling exercise that will help in
developing protection policies and
adopting measures to prevent forced
displacement.

Mixed movements in the
Caribbean
Eight key partner countries and territories
– Aruba, the Bahamas, Belize, the
Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and
Caicos Islands – took important steps
towards establishing the Caribbean
Consultations on Migration, a forum to
discuss protection safeguards in the
management of mixed migration.
The Caribbean saw positive legislative
and policy developments on refugee
protection, drafted in Curaçao and
Turks and Caicos Islands. Eligibility
commissions were set up in Antigua, the
Bahamas and Barbuda to process Syrian
asylum-seekers’ claims. Belize reactivated
its refugee eligibility committee and
Trinidad and Tobago established a
refugee unit, while UNHCR assisted

A m e r i ca s

the Government with the development
of refugee legislation and the related
asylum system.

Local integration
For the majority of people of concern to
UNHCR in the region, local integration
remained the solution that offered the
best opportunities. In Ecuador, the
Graduation Model – a poverty-reduction
approach – supported hundreds of
families in increasing their chances of
local integration. In Costa Rica, the active
participation of government institutions
and private-sector organizations under
the social responsibility scheme Vivir la
Integración opened up new opportunities
to effectively ensure refugees’ access to
employment.
In Colombia, UNHCR developed new
protection and solutions strategies built
on the Transitional Solutions Initiative
experience, whose lessons learned will be
shared with the Colombian Government.

Resettlement and other
forms of admission
The region demonstrated firm solidarity
and responsibility sharing in the context
of the global refugee crisis. Canada and
the United States met more than 80
per cent of the global quota agreed by
resettlement countries. Canada resettled
close to 20,000 refugees in 2015 through
both Government-assisted and private
sponsorship programmes.
Canada’s decision to resettle some
25,000 Syrian refugees in addition to its
regular resettlement programme was an
outstanding example of solidarity and
responsibility-sharing. The United States
announced a dedicated resettlement
programme for Central Americans in
addition to the existing family reunification
programme, which benefits children with
documented relatives residing in the
country.
Brazil extended the validity of
humanitarian visas for people affected by
the Syria crisis for an additional period
of two years. It also granted permanent
residency on humanitarian grounds to
some 44,000 Haitians, many of whom
were displaced by the 2010 earthquake.
Argentina extended its humanitarian visa

100

UNHCR Global Report 2015

programme for Syrians for another year.
In line with the Brazil Plan of Action, an
evaluation on the Solidarity Resettlement
Programme was carried out in Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Regional cooperation
Within MERCOSUR, the CONARE
(national refugee commissions)
Presidents’ Meeting was institutionalized
as a primary vehicle for the
implementation of the Brazil Plan of
Action in South America.

Constraints
Peace negotiations in Colombia have only
involved the Government of Colombia
and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia; no other armed groups have
yet participated. The final signature of
the peace agreement, negotiations over
demobilization and restitution to victims,
and agreements with other armed
groups, is still pending.
Despite positive developments in
Colombia, Ecuador still received
approximately 500 asylum-seekers per
month in 2015. n

Financial information
UNHCR’s 2015 budget stood at
USD 117.4 million. This corresponded to an
enhanced commitment by States, within
the framework of the Brazil Plan of Action,
to strengthen protection and solutions for
asylum-seekers, refugees, internally displaced
and stateless persons.
Needs have also increased in the region
due to continued displacement from Central
America. UNHCR was able to establish
a presence in El Salvador, Honduras and
Guatemala, as well as open offices at the
southern border of Mexico to address the
plight of thousands of children, women and
families who travel across the region to find
protection from violence and persecution at
the hands of criminal armed groups.

Crossing at Forcolom to
reach Nigerian refugees
living in Ngouboua, Chad.

UNHCR’s Headquarters staff, located in
Geneva, Budapest, Copenhagen and
other regional capitals, work to ensure
that the Office carries out its mandate in
an effective, coherent and transparent
manner.
Throughout 2015, Headquarters’
divisions and bureaux continued to
provide leadership and support for
field operations, including through their
responsibilities for the following key
functions:
• Developing doctrine and policy
• Articulating strategic directions
• Directing and supporting fundraising
and resource mobilization
• Prioritizing and allocating resources
• Servicing the Executive Committee
and other governance bodies, allowing
them to assume their oversight
functions
• Ensuring financial control in accordance
with United Nations and UNHCR rules
and regulations
• Directing organizational development
and management

104

UNHCR Global Report 2015

• Monitoring, measuring and reporting
(including results-based management)
• Oversight (inspection, evaluation,
investigation and audit)
• Coordinating and directing
communications and external relations
• Supporting inter-agency relations and
strategic partnerships
• Ensuring organization-wide emergency,
security and supply management.
In addition to its country and regional

SAFEGUARDING
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN RIGHTS
The provision of asylum is a consistent feature of human history.
Throughout the ages, societies with different cultures and value
systems have recognized their obligation to provide sanctuary
and help for people in distress fleeing conflict or persecution.
This longstanding social norm was progressively incorporated
into international law in the 20th century, and States continue
to reaffirm their commitment to refugee protection. Close to
130 countries have national asylum laws in place, implementing
relevant international conventions for the protection of refugees.
More than 40 countries have a national instrument related to
internal displacement; in 2015, UNHCR provided protection and
assistance to 37 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in
28 countries - the highest number in the organization's history.
However, there remain a number of recurring gaps, such
as: violations of the principle of non-refoulement; a lack
of admission and access to asylum procedures; a lack of
registration and documentation; shortcomings in refugee status
determination procedures; and detention practices that violate
international standards.
Similarly, while several States and regional bodies have
demonstrated their commitment to eradicating statelessness
by 2024, efforts need to be expanded to address the major
situations of statelessness around the world.
A growing degree of ‘asylum fatigue’ has been witnessed
over the past year. Addressing this and other contemporary
protection challenges remains a high priority for UNHCR. In
2015, UNHCR continued to safeguard the fundamental right of
people whose lives and liberty are at risk to seek safety and
security in another State, and support States to establish and
strengthen institutional refugee and asylum frameworks.

Supervising the application of the 1951 Convention

One of UNHCR’s main functions is to
supervise the application of the 1951
Convention relating to the Status of
Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. In
seeking to ensure that the fundamental
international commitments in these
instruments to protect and find solutions
for refugees are recognized and
respected, UNHCR supports legislative
processes around the world in many
ways, including through the provision
of official comments, expert advice and
active assistance.
The protection of refugees, stateless
people and others of concern to UNHCR
depend increasingly on national, regional
and international jurisprudence. In
2015, the organization continued to
engage with legal practitioners and the
judiciary as part of its core protection
work, including through strengthening
the capacities of lawyers and judges,
developing legal tools and guidance,
funding legal service providers, and
organizing and participating in events
and conferences.

116

UNHCR Global Report 2015

During 2015, UNHCR supported
more than 40 legislative processes
worldwide to address a vast range
of issues, including criteria for
determining eligibility for refugee status;
procedural safeguards in refugee status
determination procedures and other
legal processes; upholding the rights of
recognized refugees; security and border
management issues; and combatting
trafficking.
UNHCR’s views on these issues
are often solicited and appreciated,
positively influencing the outcome of
the development or review of national
laws, as seen in the past year. Concrete
examples of this work are described
in many of the operational reporting
chapters, accessible on the Global Focus
website (http://reporting.unhcr.org).
However, recommendations from the
Office are not always followed, resulting
at times in the adoption of legislation
with reduced protection safeguards
or provisions that are at variance with

S A F E G U A R D I N G

international legal obligations. There are
still a number of countries hosting large
refugee populations that have no asylum
legislation and are not States parties to the
1951 Convention and/or the 1967 Protocol.
In 2015, the large-scale movements
of asylum-seekers and refugees into
Europe have been followed by the
swift introduction in many European
States of restrictive new asylum laws
and provisions, including on eligibility

F U N D A M E N T A L

H U M A N

R I G H T S

for international protection; cessation of
protection; limited procedural safeguards;
and the rights of asylum-seekers and
refugees, including property rights and
family reunification. A general overview
of UNHCR’s efforts to safeguard asylum
space and reduce protection risks in
the region are presented in the Europe
regional summary, with more extensive
coverage in the relevant country
operation chapters on the Global Focus
website (http://reporting.unhcr.org). n

Global Strategic Priorities
Registration and profiling
Registration – the recording, verifying, and
updating of refugee and asylum-seeker
information – is a core UNHCR activity. An
essential tool of protection, registration also
helps prevent refoulement, arbitrary arrest and
detention, and enables people of concern to
access their basic rights. Registration plays a
critical role in the identification of vulnerable
individuals with specific needs, providing them
with immediate and targeted assistance, and
helping to define appropriate durable solutions.
Registration data is also crucial to UNHCR and
partners’ planning and advocacy efforts.
UNHCR operations reported increased levels of
individual registration in 87 per cent of refugee
situations in 2015. In addition, the Biometric
Identity Management System (BIMS) was rolled

out in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Chad, the Congo,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, India, Malawi,
Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand, enrolling a total
of 658,327 refugees. BIMS records iris scans and
finger prints and links them to individual records
in UNHCR’s registration database. In this way, the
Office is able to confirm a refugee’s identity within
seconds and prevent duplicate registration.
UNHCR’s registration activities were also impeded
by resource constraints and insecurity. In Niger, a
reduction in staffing due to resource constraints
prevented the operation from registering the
arrivals of Malian asylum-seekers in a timely
manner and from renewing their refugee
documents and ration cards. In Libya and Yemen,
insecurity regularly inhibited registration.

Assuring safety from violence and exploitation
Displaced women and girls, as well as
men and boys, are at increased risk of
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)
in all regions of the world. Creating safe
environments and mitigating the risk of
SGBV is a high priority for UNHCR, and the
Office continues to establish safeguards
against such violence and response
interventions for victims of abuse for all
people of concern.
In 2015, UNHCR continued to promote
UN system-wide accountability through
SGBV prevention and response in
emergencies, as part of its membership
of the Real Time Accountability
Partnership (RTAP) with UNFPA,
UNICEF, UNOCHA, International Rescue

Committee and the Office of U.S.
Foreign Disaster Assistance.
As part of the Safe from the Start
programme, UNHCR deployed eight
senior SGBV experts to 11 operations
to provide technical support on SGBV
prevention and response at the onset of
emergencies. The Office implemented
nine multi-sectoral projects addressing
SGBV prevention through the use of
alternative energy, access to technology,
and livelihoods programmes.
In 2015, 43 countries received support to
develop and implement SGBV strategies,
either at country-level or for specific
areas of operation. n

Global Strategic Priorities
Prevention and response to SGBV
UNHCR made considerable progress
in providing legal services to Somali
refugees in Dadaab, Kenya. In 2015,
more than 500 survivors received
legal assistance and 62 per cent of
reported cases were prosecuted.
Activities that contributed to this
improvement include the deployment
of 10 translators to police stations
in the camp, which strengthened

118

UNHCR Global Report 2015

confidential reporting of incidents
and enhanced the investigation
of cases. Close collaboration with
partners in carrying out sensitization
and awareness-raising events
– including the use of referral
pathways to access services –
reached more than 200,000 people.
Challenges were encountered in
Malawi to provide appropriate
support to SGBV survivors,

particularly for women and girls
engaged in survival sex. Due to
cuts in food rations and limited
opportunities to engage in livelihood
activities, survival sex was reported
to be a significant problem,
primarily for Congolese refugees.
While some case management
support was provided to survivors,
UNHCR was not able to provide
adequate livelihoods assistance and
psychosocial support.

Working with international human
rights mechanisms to safeguard
the rights of people of concern
UNHCR continues to engage with the UN
human rights mechanisms – the Human Rights
Council and its Special Procedures, the Universal
Periodic Review (UPR), national human rights
institutions, and the treaty monitoring bodies.
These are valuable protection partners and tools,
complementing and reinforcing the protection
environment for people of concern to the Office.
In 2015, the organization significantly increased
the overall inclusion rate of its recommendations
in treaty monitoring bodies’ concluding
observations (65 per cent in 2015 from 47 per
cent in 2014). Themes of relevance to UNHCR
that were addressed in these outcomes included:
non-refoulement; reception conditions; detention;
access to quality refugee status determination
procedures; access to rights; and statelessness.
The following examples illustrate how concluding
observations, recommendations, and partnerships
with human rights mechanisms can be used to
expand and reinforce the protection space for
people of concern:

Child protection
UNHCR noted an increase in
the number of applications for
asylum from unaccompanied and
separated children (UASC) in Brazil
throughout 2015. In response, a
comprehensive strategy on child
protection for 2015-2016 was
developed, including a particular
focus on UASC cases. Brazil has
established appropriate procedures
for the consideration of the child’s
best interests and UNHCR focused

under the human rights instruments to grant
individuals the possibility to claim nationality.
• In Nigeria, UNHCR partners with the Nigerian
National Human Rights Institution to ensure

on monitoring, capacity building,
and advocacy. Throughout the
year, the Office strengthened its
partnerships with public shelters
and civil society organizations
that work with refugee children.
Moreover, a referrals process to
specialized shelters who already
have experience working with
UASC was established.
Formal best interest determination
procedures are yet to be established
in Mexico and many children

remain in immigration detention,
even though the country’s new
regulations prohibit this. In 2015,
only 1 in 5 of the 18,650 UASC
detained by immigration authorities
were referred to appropriate interim
or long-term alternative care. While
access to legal representation is
limited for asylum-seekers in general
(less than 5 per cent have access
to legal representation), children
face additional difficulties as there is
limited expertise on child protection
issues.

Strengthening refugee status determination

UNHCR pursued its efforts to strengthen
access to, and the quality of, refugee
status determination (RSD) procedures,
in particular through its work on RSD
quality assurance projects in partnership
with States. In addition, the Office
provided ongoing guidance, financial
and technical support to State-led
RSD first- and second-instance bodies
across the globe, including through the
provision of training and the publication
and dissemination of guidelines on
refugee status and international
protection.
At the same time, UNHCR continued
to conduct RSD under its mandate in
more than 60 countries and territories.
In 2015, the organization was again

122

UNHCR Global Report 2015

faced with a high number of individual
RSD applications, with the number of
applications continuing to exceed the
number of individual RSD decisions
issued. Provisional statistics indicate that
UNHCR received more than 269,000
individual RSD applications in 2015, and
issued 91,700 substantive individual RSD
decisions.
In many contexts, the Office’s role
continued to be critical to ensuring the
continued viability and sustainability of
State-led RSD systems and, in situations
where such systems do not exist or
are not effective, facilitating access to
UNHCR mandate RSD procedures. While
RSD by both States and UNHCR faced
increasing challenges throughout the

S A F E G U A R D I N G

year, several operations also witnessed
positive developments. These included
the assumption or resumption of (greater)
State responsibility for the undertaking of
RSD in a number of African operations;
improvements in the quality of RSD
decision-making in a number of countries
in Eastern Europe and the South

supported.

Further build the capacity of UNHCR
RSD staff and State decision-makers,
judges and other stakeholders in
asylum/RSD procedures

nn UNHCR mandate RSD staffing levels were maintained globally, while new regional RSD officer posts were
created in the Americas and Eastern Europe.
nn UNHCR staff continued to undergo RSD and COI trainings. 5 sessions of the RSD Learning Programme (targeting
the Asia, Americas and MENA regions) were delivered in 2015. Training on the research and use of COI was
provided through webinars as well as face to face trainings, while progress was made in the development of a
COI e-learning programme.

Ending unlawful detention of people of concern
Detention continues to affect hundreds of
thousands of women, men and children
whose protection is of concern to
UNHCR. Regrettably, in many countries,
the detention of asylum-seekers upon
arrival has become a regular response,
frequently for prolonged periods
and in conditions that fall far short of
international standards.
International law, however, clearly
states that the detention of refugees
and asylum-seekers should only ever
be an exceptional measure, and States
are expected to consider alternatives to
detention prior to any decision to detain.
Seeking asylum is not an unlawful act
and asylum-seekers should not be
penalized for their illegal entry or stay,
provided they present themselves to the
authorities without delay and show good
cause for their presence. There is ample
evidence that detaining asylum-seekers
and refugees is harmful, costly and,
ultimately, less effective than alternatives
to detention and other appropriate
reception models.
In this context, UNHCR continued to
implement Beyond detention 2014-

124

UNHCR Global Report 2015

2019: A global strategy to support
governments to end the detention of
asylum-seekers and refugees. The
strategy was rolled out in Canada,
Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Lithuania,
Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Thailand, the
United Kingdom, the United States,
and Zambia. In addition, UNHCR and
the International Detention Coalition
released 12 national action plans during
the year, outlining strategies to further
improve conditions and reduce the use
of detention in these focus countries.
Concerned about the devastating
effects of detention on children and
their development, the Office has
focused primarily on engaging with
existing national child protection actors
to develop or strengthen emergency
care arrangements for children upon
release from detention, as well as the
use of alternatives to detention and
other case management strategies to
prevent their detention. Other measures
taken included prioritizing registration of
asylum claims by children (and families) in
detention to hasten release procedures;
providing legal counselling; and
introducing child-sensitive screening
mechanisms, including to address

S A F E G U A R D I N G

best interests and vulnerabilities,
with different stakeholders. Finally,
further engagement with national
human rights institutions and national
ombudsmen was strengthened to
help bolster national capacities in
monitoring immigration detention of
children.

and cost-effective management of
asylum and migration processes in
some States. However, maintaining safe
protection space was challenging amid
the restrictive approaches taken by many
governments to manage borders and
asylum systems when faced with large
mixed migratory flows during 2015. In
Europe, the closure of external borders
and imposing of criminal sanctions for
illegal crossing of borders also led to
more detention. n

Eradicating statelessness

In 2015, UNHCR marked the completion
of the first year of the #IBelong Campaign
to End Statelessness by 2024.

The urgent need to end
childhood statelessness
In 2015, there was a particular focus on
eradicating childhood statelessness.
In order to better understand the
challenges confronting stateless young
people, UNHCR carried out consultations

with more than 250 stateless children
and youth, as well as their families
and caregivers, in seven countries
(Côte d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic,
Georgia, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, and
Thailand). The consultations focused on
the effects of statelessness in four areas:
education, health, being a child, and
employment. They confirmed that being
deprived of a nationality had a profound
and lasting impact on the lives of these
young people. Many of them spoke
of their struggle to gain an education,

UNHCR Global Report 2015

125

S A F E G U A R D I N G

F U N D A M E N T A L

H U M A N

R I G H T S

receive adequate health care, or to find
a life-sustaining job. The psychological
toll of statelessness was apparent and
damaging, with young people describing
feeling “like a street dog”, “invisible” or
“worthless.”
The results of the consultations were
analysed and compiled into a report
called I Am Here, I Belong – The urgent
need to end childhood statelessness.
Launched on the first anniversary of the
campaign, the report recommends four
concrete actions to resolve and prevent
childhood statelessness:
• Allow children to obtain the nationality
of the country in which they were born,
if they will otherwise be stateless.
• Reform laws to allow women to pass on
their nationality to their children on an
equal basis to men.
• Eliminate laws and practices that deny
children nationality because of their
ethnicity, race or religion.
• Ensure universal birth registration for all
children.

Towards a world without
statelessness
Endorsement of the #IBelong campaign
and the corresponding Global Action
Plan by States will be key to achieving
their goals. Despite greater global
acknowledgment of the plight of stateless
people, the number of stateless people
who acquired nationality remained
relatively low and fewer nationality
law reforms took place in 2015 than
anticipated. While several States and
regional bodies demonstrated their
commitment to the implementation of the
Global Action Plan during the first year of
the campaign, efforts need to be amplified
to address in particular the major situations
of statelessness around the world.

126

UNHCR Global Report 2015

UNHCR continued to provide technical
advice and support to governments on
accession to the two UN Statelessness
Conventions. The Office promoted
national legal reforms to harmonize
State policies and the implementation of
international standards to prevent and
reduce statelessness, and to protect
stateless people.
As a result, in 2015 four countries
acceded to the Statelessness
Conventions and a number of States
reformed or took important steps towards
amending their national laws and
procedures. For example, in November
2015, members of Madagascar’s
Parliament confirmed their commitment
to eliminate gender discrimination in the
forthcoming Nationality Act. Reforms
to remove gender discrimination from
nationality laws are also underway in the
Bahamas, Liberia and Somalia.
Armenia amended its citizenship
law to ensure all children born on
Armenian territory who would otherwise
be stateless may acquire Armenian
nationality. In April, Kosovo (all references
to Kosovo in this report shall be
understood in the context of Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999), henceforth
referred to as Kosovo (S/RES/1244 (1999))
adopted an administrative instruction
that established a statelessness
determination procedure and grants
protected status to stateless individuals.
The Estonian Parliament adopted
amendments to the Citizenship Act in
January 2015, enabling children born to
stateless parents to acquire citizenship
automatically at birth, and easing the
requirements for naturalization for
people over 65 years of age – a change
that would potentially benefit many
of the 88,000 stateless people in the
country.

S A F E G U A R D I N G

To prevent statelessness arising in the
context of the conflict in the Syrian Arab
Republic (Syria), the Office continued
to promote and support universal birth
registration among Syrian children born
in the neighbouring countries, as well
as those born in Syria. As part of these
efforts, legal aid and counselling services
for refugee families was established in
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and
Turkey.
In addition, to bolster the work of
operations in key areas around the world,
UNHCR provided targeted resources
to support statelessness activities
in 19 operations through the Seeds
for Solutions mechanism and other
specialized funds.
For example, in Malaysia, building on
the progress made during the previous
year, a local NGO supported by UNHCR
registered nearly 7,000 stateless
people and those of undetermined
nationality, and provided them with
advice on acquisition and confirmation
of nationality. Subsequently, communitybased paralegals submitted more than
5,000 of these cases to the Government
for grant of nationality, and at least 500
people had acquired nationality by the
end of the year.
In Zimbabwe, UNHCR supported the
Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission to
conduct a study to assess the scope of
the risk of statelessness in the country,
while in Kenya, efforts to develop a
national action plan to end statelessness
were boosted and birth registration of
4,000 children in communities at risk of
statelessness was supported.
In Thailand, UNHCR’s support to the
Government and a local NGO accelerated

F U N D A M E N T A L

H U M A N

R I G H T S

the process of confirming the nationality
of members of hill tribes who were living
in remote border areas with limited
access to information about nationality
procedures.
Continued efforts by the governments
of Central Asia, local civil society
organizations and UNHCR resulted
in further progress towards ending
statelessness in the region. For example,
in Tajikistan, more than 19,000 stateless
people or people at risk of statelessness
were identified and assisted to find a
solution to their situation.
To increase awareness of statelessness,
and the capacity to address it, in the
Middle East and North Africa, the issue
was included in regional protection
training conducted in Sharjah, United Arab
Emirates. Participants included officials
of the Governments of Algeria, Egypt,
Iraq, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco and
Tunisia, as well as representatives of civil
society. As part of the training, participants
from North African States shared their
good practices in removing gender
discrimination from nationality laws.
UNHCR continued to reinforce its
partnerships with NGOs globally,
including through the fourth annual
statelessness retreat, where 25
organizations from 20 countries
shared good practices related to the
implementation of the relevant actions
of the Global Action Plan to End
Statelessness and discussed ways to
enhance their collaboration.
Strengthening NGO collaboration also
continued in Asia and the Pacific, where
more than 40 civil society participants
agreed to establish a network focused on
eradicating statelessness in the region. n

nn Advocacy was undertaken and advice provided in 63 countries.
nn Armenia and Estonia amended their nationality legislation, improving the prevention of statelessness at birth
through automatic acquisition of nationality.
nn Montenegro adopted legislation that introduced a judicial procedure for late birth registration of people born
outside the health-care system – an important measure to mitigate the risk of statelessness in the country.
nn Belarus amended its Law on Citizenship to allow children born on the territory to stateless parents residing
temporarily in Belarus to acquire Belarusian citizenship (previously only children born to permanent resident
stateless parents could acquire nationality).
nn Tajikistan adopted the Constitutional Law on Nationality, including a number of provisions for the prevention and
reduction of statelessness.

Support development of national
capacity to implement standards
contained in the Statelessness
Conventions by providing expert
and technical advice, as well as
training

nn UNHCR, the Center for Justice and International Law, and the Open Society Justice Initiative organized the first
regional meeting of the Americas Network on Nationality and Statelessness (ANA) in San José, Costa Rica. More
than 30 representatives from NGOs discussed common challenges related to preventing and responding to
statelessness, particularly in the context of operationalizing UNHCR’s Global Action Plan to End Statelessness
2014-2024 and the Brazil Plan of Action.
nn UNHCR published a good practices paper on Action 3 of the Global Action Plan to End Statelessness: Removing
gender discrimination from nationality laws.
nn In the Middle East and North Africa, 17 training events were attended by more than 800 officials from the
subregion, including from Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to examine areas where
national legislation and civil registration systems could be strengthened.

nn Legal aid and counselling were established in all Iraq and Syria situation operations (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria and Turkey); community-based protection and communication with communities was strengthened to help
families register new births and marriages; and solutions were reached with host governments to make
procedures simpler and more accessible. With the benefit of these interventions, the percentage of Syrian
refugee children born in the region who went undocumented at birth (receiving neither a birth certificate nor a
medical birth notification) reduced from 35% in 2012, to 7% in 2015 across the region.
nn Some countries witnessed dramatic improvements: in Jordan, 12 times as many Syrian refugee children born in
camps in 2015 received an official birth certificate in comparison with 2013; in Iraq, Syrian refugee birth registration
rate increased from 30% in 2012 to 73% in 2015; and in Egypt, interventions achieved a 93% birth registration rate
for Syrian refugee children.
nn In Bosnia and Herzegovina, 60 focus group meetings in Roma communities were conducted, reaching a total of
1,147 Roma of different ages and gender. Participants also included representatives in charge of civil registration
from municipalities and centres of social welfare as well as representatives of Roma NGOs/Roma mediators. In
2015, 153 field visits were conducted by UNHCR and its partner Vasa Prava to 107 Roma communities.

Addressing internal displacement
It is estimated that 80 per cent of the
world’s internally displaced people (IDPs)
had been uprooted from their place of
origin for more than five years (BrookingsLSE Project on Internal Displacement,
December 2014). Reversing this trend
by focusing on law and policy related to
solutions for IDPs remained a priority for
UNHCR operations worldwide in 2015.
In Sri Lanka, UNHCR supported the
development of an IDP policy intended
to ensure that durable solutions were
found for the country’s conflict-affected
displaced people. Similarly, in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the
organization actively supported the
development of a national solutions
strategy that engaged national
development actors to better the situation
of almost 1.5 million people displaced
by armed conflict in the country. In
Puntland, Somalia, UNHCR supported
the authorities in implementing its 2012
IDP policy through a local integration
strategy for IDPs. Several operations,
including in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Sudan, laid the groundwork for
drafting laws or policies concerning
durable solutions for IDPs.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

As the lead of the Global Protection
Cluster, UNHCR engaged in the
protection of civilians in the Central
African Republic, Mali and South Sudan,
and continued its work to galvanize interagency support for government-owned
solutions plans based on development
approaches, which will be implemented
alongside humanitarian responses. The
Office pursued its collaboration with
governments, civil society and the private
sector to support the removal of legal
and practical barriers to self-reliance.
The Global Shelter Cluster (GSC), coled by UNHCR in conflict situations and
by the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
in natural disaster settings, supported
25 country-level clusters or cluster-like
mechanisms in 2015. UNHCR led the
shelter cluster in 11 countries including
the Central African Republic, Iraq, Syria
and Ukraine, coordinating some 340
partners responding to the needs of 12
million people with shelter solutions and
non-food items such as plastic sheeting,
mats, blankets and kitchen sets. The
organization’s shelter cluster support
team mobilized experts for 650 days to

S A F E G U A R D I N G

nine countries in the course of the year,
stepping up the cluster capacities in areas
such as information management in Iraq,
Somalia and Ukraine.
UNHCR also co-led the Global Camp
Coordination and Camp Management
(CCCM) Cluster in conflict settings,
alongside IOM, the co-lead in natural
disasters. The Global Cluster encourages
strong partnerships with key government
actors and national stakeholders to
enhance capacity in coordination
and management of displacement
situations, based on general principles
of protection and seeking durable

solutions. In 2015, the Global CCCM
Cluster supported 35 national clusters
and cluster-like mechanisms in
emergencies and situations of protracted
internal displacement through expert
deployments, the development of tools
and guidance, and capacity building
for national authorities and civil society.
UNHCR led nine country-level clusters in
the Central African Republic, Chad, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq,
Myanmar, Pakistan, South Sudan, Turkey
(under the framework of cross-border
assistance to Syria) and Yemen, four of
which were operating jointly with the
shelter cluster. n

Key achievements in 2015

nn In Mali, a technical committee composed of members of key ministries, members of parliament, civil society and
the African Union Mission for Mali and the Sahel, was created to work on integrating the Kampala Convention
into national law and policy. The technical committee’s action plan called for a draft law by 2016-17.
nn In commemoration of the third anniversary of the entry into force of the Kampala Convention, the Global
Protection Cluster (GPC) task team on law and policy held a three-day capacity-building workshop for
parliamentarians, civil society actors, UN and international humanitarian and development organizations, expert
IDP law and policy practitioners, and other stakeholders from six countries (Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, Mali, Nigeria, South Sudan and Zambia). The workshop focused on the domestic implementation and
operationalization of the Kampala Convention; promoting national responsibility and the sharing of experiences
between countries; and strengthening the role of the African Union and of other inter-governmental and nongovernmental actors. The six country teams produced and committed to roadmaps for the passage of a domestic
Kampala bill in their respective countries.
nn A study on UNHCR’s engagement with national human rights institutions (NHRI) for IDP protection was
undertaken in 2015. The stock-taking exercise included seven findings related to UNHCR’s engagement with
NHRIs, which will form the basis of a GPC roundtable in 2016.

Durable solutions
Improve livelihood opportunities for
IDPs

nn UNHCR collaborated with governments, civil society and the private sector to support the removal of legal and
practical barriers to self-reliance.
nn UNHCR’s partnerships with ILO and ITC promoted the right to work and labour mobility through dialogue with
governments and employment representatives, and supported market development activities for people of
concern.

Adopt a progressive approach to
solutions for IDPs, in close
collaboration with partners

Key achievements in 2015
nn In Colombia, UNHCR sought to ensure the country’s restitution policy complemented reparation and protection by
promoting a permanent coordination between the Land Restitution Unit, the National Protection Unit, the Ministry
of the Interior and local authorities.
nn In Somalia, the recently approved IDP policy in Somaliland was used as a focus for training on durable solutions.
In Puntland, UNHCR supported the authorities’ follow-up on the 2012 IDP policy through a jointly agreed upon
local integration strategy for IDPs.
nn Several operations, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sudan, laid the groundwork for drafting laws or
policies concerning durable solutions for IDPs in 2016.
nn In Sri Lanka, UNHCR supported the development of an IDP policy intended to ensure durable solutions were
found for conflict-affected displaced people in Sri Lanka. Technical assistance was provided to draw up a national
policy on this issue, scheduled for completion in 2016.
nn In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UNHCR supported the development of a national solutions strategy
that engaged national development actors.
nn In September 2015, UNHCR initiated a regional inter-agency consultation in Nairobi with the participation of the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, as
well as other key stakeholders. It focused on the theme of “preserving the civilian and humanitarian character of
asylum and IDP settlement”. The recommendations that emerged included to enhance cooperation and
guidance for government and UN counterparts in the protection of refugees and IDPs in particular, and for
civilians exposed to forced recruitment, both within the context of UN peace operations and in non-mission
settings.

Coordination and operations support
Coordination and operations management strengthened
Build field capacity for a stronger
and more targeted operational
response in IDP situations, notably in
emergencies

nn Operational guidelines for UNHCR’s engagement in situations of internal displacement were completed in 2015
(release scheduled in 2016). The guidelines, which replace the 2014 provisional guidance, establish institutional
standards and parameters for UNHCR’s engagement (or expected engagement) in a coordinated response to
internal displacement.
nn More than 500 individuals enrolled in the IDP e-learning course, with at least half completing the course in 2015.
In addition, five separate IDP protection training sessions were held for 155 participants.
nn An information management toolkit containing a variety of needs assessments tools, as well as tools for
protection monitoring and population data tracking, was finalized and released.
nn Good practices and lessons learned gathered by the GSC support team through assessment and evaluations
were publicly available on the GSC website (www.sheltercluster.org), which increased its reach in 2015 to 60,194
unique visitors with 229,997 page views - a 190% increase in the number of unique visitors and 120% increase in
visits compared to 2014.
nn In order to increase the pool of experts available to deploy as members of the cluster coordination team, IFRC
and UNHCR, in collaboration with Oxford-Brookes University, developed a master-level course on humanitarian
shelter coordination. 25 participants successfully completed the course and have been included in the shelter
coordination surge capacity roster.
nn Two deployment roster modalities – rapid response team technical experts and CCCM Cap deployees –
reinforced CCCM capacity in several system-wide, Level 3 emergencies as well as protracted situations. In 2015,
the Cluster conducted field support missions and deployed experts to the Central African Republic, Chad, Iraq,
Jordan, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Somalia, South Africa and Yemen. Tools, lessons learned and guidance for
field-based practitioners were either updated or developed.
nn The Global CCCM Cluster increased its efforts for improved and sustained communication with its partners. Its
website (www.globalcccmcluster.org) continued to be used widely as a knowledge-sharing platform, offering
access to CCCM tools, training materials and information. Almost 16,000 people accessed the website in 2015.
nn The Global CCCM Cluster issued a fully revised camp management toolkit in April 2015 and launched camp
closure guidelines.
nn With the support of the Global CCCM Cluster, 1,539 individuals were trained in CCCM in field operations, including
662 by experts deployed by UNHCR to Burkina Faso, Iraq, South Africa and South Sudan. In April 2015, a global
trainers’ workshop in Turin, Italy, brought together CCCM experts and trainers to review and update the existing
training and capacity-building materials, and to create a community of practice. An independent evaluation of the
effectiveness of CCCM capacity-building activities was also undertaken to gather lessons learned.

Refugee and sexual violence survivor
restores hope in Rwanda
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
17 December 2015

KIGALI, Rwanda | Jacqueline Umutesi
had a traumatic childhood. But that hasn’t
stopped the 37-year-old refugee from
helping to heal others as one of Rwanda’s
most outspoken community organisers
fighting sexual and gender based violence
(SGBV).

For a year, she and her family lived in the
Mudende Refugee Camp. Then, in 1997,
a militia invaded and opened fire, killing
hundreds. Seeking safety, Jacqueline
moved to Gihembe Refugee Camp, which
today houses over 14,500 Congolese
refugees – almost all of whom are
survivors of the massacre.
One year after arriving in Gihembe,
Jacqueline experienced a cultural practice
known as guterura –traditional bride
kidnapping. “In the middle of the night,
a group of people came to my home,”
she recalls. “I was seventeen. They put a
plastic bag over my mother’s head so she
could not see, and they took me.”
“The following year I gave birth to a girl,
my first born daughter,” she continues.
“The man who took me became my
husband. He was a soldier from the DRC.”
For the next two decades, Jacqueline
was subjected to violence, humiliation
and deprivation. “Even when I became
pregnant, my husband would beat me,” she

Jacqueline’s own experiences of exile
and violence underpin her work, having
been forced to flee her home in Itongo
in Rutshuru, Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) at the age of just 14.

Jaqueline Umutesi, a Congolese refugee, works to prevent sexual and gender
violence in Gihembe camp, Rwanda.

says. “He would sleep with other women
and became infected with HIV. He was
angry and tried to set fire to my house, so I
ran away to live with my mother.”
Despite her fears, Jacqueline was
determined to restart her life. Today,
she is part of a team of nine community
mobilizers with UNHCR partner Plan
International, who work in Gihembe
camp, engaging in discussions and raising
awareness on SGBV and gender equality.
The results of their efforts are clear. The
practice of bride kidnapping and forced
marriage has stopped, and physical and
sexual violence against women and girls is
no longer considered acceptable. “Today,
if someone beats his wife, people cry out
against him and we bring them to the
police.”

However, survival sex is still a problem,
with many refugee women and girls
desperate enough to sell their bodies for
food, clothing or other essential needs.
As a mother, Jacqueline worries about
her daughter. “I worry about the risks she
faces after school, especially survival sex,
which is a problem for adolescent girls,”
she says. “At least when my daughter
is in school, I know I don’t have to be
worried.”
But, having seen how her work has
already transformed the lives of women
and girls in the camp, Jacqueline has high
hopes for the future.
“I hope that by telling other women what
happened to me today, tomorrow the
same thing cannot happen to them.” 

SUPPORT
In 2015, the international humanitarian system continued to
be challenged by an unprecedented series of new or rapidly
deteriorating conflicts. These large-scale emergencies had
a serious impact, both on the lives of millions of uprooted
people and on the social and economic fabric of refugeehosting countries. Strengthening UNHCR’s capacity to respond
to emergencies, and assuring its preparedness for new
emergencies, were accordingly key priorities.

RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES

Mobilizing resources to save
lives
Eleven UNHCR emergency declarations
were active at the end of 2015, covering
more than 30 operations. These included
five new emergencies declared during the
year to respond to refugee and internal
displacement situations generated by the

crises in Burundi, Nigeria, Ukraine and
Yemen, as well as for the Europe situation
and ongoing regional responses to
protracted conflicts.
The Office also worked with partners in the
Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
to respond to four ongoing system-wide
Level 3 (L3) emergencies in the Central
African Republic (CAR), Iraq, South Sudan
and Syria, as well as to the Yemen L3
emergency, which was activated in 2015.

Emergency classifications
Level 3 – a system-wide Level 3 (L3) emergency is the
global humanitarian system's classification for the most
severe crises that require system-wide mobilization to
significantly increase the scope of the response and
improve the overall effectiveness of assistance. A systemwide L3 emergency is declared by the Emergency Relief
Coordinator on behalf of the IASC, of which UNHCR is an
active member.
UNHCR classifications – UNHCR defines three levels of
emergency response (level 3 being the most severe).
Considerations in assessing the level of an emergency
include the impact on affected populations, the complexity
of the situation and the capacity of the Office to respond.
A UNHCR emergency declaration triggers an immediate
mobilization of financial, human and material resources to
support the country office to respond to the crisis.

136

UNHCR Global Report 2015

In responding to lifesaving needs, UNHCR
worked hard to ensure that the needs,
perspectives and aspirations of people
of concern remained at the centre of its
engagement in emergencies, including by
deploying community-based protection
officers and applying participatory
approaches. Efforts were made to ensure
that emergency operations were tailored
to the needs and realities on the ground,
taking into account and supporting
national and local capacities including
government, NGO and local communities.
In 2015, UNHCR continued to maintain
global stockpiles in seven locations
capable of deploying aid to at least
600,000 people, within 72 hours from
the onset of an emergency. The Office
established regional warehouses closer

R E S P O N D I N G

to emergency operations to pre-position
items and to ensure a timely response.
As part of its work to strengthen its
emergency engagement and response,
UNHCR issued a policy in 2015 on
emergency response activation,
leadership and accountability. A number
of mechanisms introduced by the
policy were activated during the year,
including new procedures for emergency
declarations; joint senior-level missions
to newly-declared emergencies; realtime reviews of emergency operations;
and the deactivation of three emergency
declarations. The policy is supported
by the updated digital version of
UNHCR’s emergency handbook (https://
emergency.unhcr.org), also released in
2015, which contains more than 220
entries on preparation, implementation
and coordination topics.
Operating in conflict environments
required the organization to constantly
review and adapt security measures for
UNHCR staff and people of concern. As
one of the few humanitarian agencies
with dedicated structural security
engineering capacity, the Office
contributed significantly to equipping
operations to deal with possible attacks.
In 2015, UNHCR undertook continuous
security reviews and developed
mitigating measures to ensure the
safety of staff and people of concern
in a number of countries, including
Cameroon, CAR, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia,
South Sudan and Yemen.

Deploying staff to
emergencies
UNHCR continued to maintain
permanent standby teams for automatic
deployment upon declaration of an

emergency. A key focus was to ensure
rapid and effective field-level delivery
by deployed teams, led by emergency
coordinators, to support governments
and partners with an emphasis on
protection.
In addition to the deployment of UNHCR
staff, agreements with standby partners
provided flexible mechanisms to send
highly qualified personnel swiftly to
emergency operations. Some 460 new
deployments were made to support
UNHCR’s emergency preparedness
and response during the year, including
172 through standby arrangements with
partners.
Technical staff supported efforts in
the areas of shelter and site planning,
information management, supply
management, and water, sanitation
and hygiene. Additional staff
supported programme, administration,
telecommunications, reporting and
field safety activities. In total, 117
protection staff were deployed to
establish community-based protection
mechanisms (such as support to
unaccompanied children, community
policing, and protection monitoring);
develop protection strategies; coordinate
humanitarian organizations focusing
on protection; establish mechanisms to
reduce SGBV; and provide protection
training and capacity building to partners,
newly recruited staff, and people of
concern.
In 2015, UNHCR also instituted refugee
response agreements (RERAs), initially
with three international NGOs, to mobilize
additional capacity in emergencies where
critical gaps were identified, with the aim
of assuring a more predictable response
capacity.

MEETING BASIC NEEDS

Institutionalizing the use of
cash assistance
The expanded and systematic use of
cash-based interventions (CBIs) is an
institutional priority for UNHCR. In 2015,
the Office responded to refugees’ needs
with cash grants or vouchers in more
than 60 operations worldwide, with a
combined value of USD 357 million – a
significant increase from USD 302 million
in 2014.
CBIs were used to provide assistance
and services to protect people of
concern across a variety of sectors, and
to respond to their basic needs in a
comprehensive manner. As an example,

UNHCR Global Report 2015

UNHCR provided cash assistance to more
than 145,000 Syrian refugee families
(an estimated 726,000 individuals) in
Lebanon to help them withstand the
harsh winter conditions.
The Office also started to prepare for
implementing its five-year policy on the
institutionalization of CBIs. The policy will
ensure that UNHCR has the knowledge,
systems and processes in place to
support the efficient implementation
of CBIs by building staff capacity, and
identifying and addressing potential gaps
and opportunities across sectors and
functions.
UNHCR and partners conducted research
on the protection implications of CBIs
and the use of multi-purpose cash grants
to meet basic needs. The research led to
the development of guidance and tools,
including to mainstream protection in
CBIs and to ensure their use contributes
to protection outcomes.

CBIs

nn Technical support missions were conducted to 14 operations; remote support was provided to 32 operations
across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.

Providing safe, dignified and
sustainable shelter solutions
UNHCR’s Global Strategy for Settlement
and Shelter (2014-2018) provides a
framework to achieve effective and
comprehensive immediate shelter and
settlement responses, while pursuing
more sustainable shelter and settlement
solutions.
Throughout 2015, UNHCR’s operations
worldwide continued efforts to ensure
people of concern were provided with
adequate dwellings. Close to 70 per cent
of priority countries (those with a shelter
budget of at least USD 1 million) were
implementing a comprehensive shelter
and settlement strategy, compared to 30
per cent in 2013.
As part of the emergency response
in Europe, UNHCR assisted with the
identification and winterization of
temporary accommodation and reception
centres across the region, notably for
people transiting via the Balkans route.
In Presovo, which became the main
entry point for refugees moving into
Serbia from the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia, UNHCR and partners
rehabilitated rundown buildings to
accommodate refugees.

The Office consistently advocated the
implementation of more sustainable
and durable shelter solutions from the
early stages of an emergency to ensure
refugees do not remain in emergency
shelter for long periods of time. In
Rwanda, the prompt deployment of
technical specialists enabled UNHCR and
partners to develop a comprehensive
shelter strategy for Burundian refugees
during the first month of the emergency.
The construction of more than 1,150
transitional shelters, using timber,
eucalyptus and mud, assured the
refugees access to safe and dignified
living conditions, and reduced the
costly use of tents. Furthermore, in
order to support field practitioners
in developing comprehensive and
technically sound strategies, UNHCR
developed a shelter design catalogue
outlining how shelters can progress from
an emergency structure toward longer
term accommodation while using local
materials.
Improving existing shelter solutions and
developing new options for homes for
people in need remained at the forefront
of UNHCR’s research and development
efforts. In 2015, the new self-standing

family tent developed through an interagency technical committee, composed
of UNHCR, the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the
International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), underwent
rigorous testing to verify its safety and
structural resistance to extreme weather
conditions, and to assess its cultural
suitability in a variety of contexts. UNHCR
was finalizing the specifications for the
new tent on the basis of laboratory and
field testing in Burkina Faso and Pakistan,
with a view to making an improved tent
model available to operations worldwide
in 2016.

Finding alternatives to
camps
UNHCR’s 2014 Policy on Alternatives
to Camps – which incorporates the
2009 Policy on Refugee Protection
and Solutions in Urban Areas –
promotes more inclusive, sustainable
and development-oriented approaches
to programming for refugees. The
ultimate aim is to create opportunities for
refugees to live legally, peacefully and
independently in host communities.
At the field level, UNHCR continued to
promote settlement alternatives that
enable refugees to play a role in national
and local development, society and the
economy. The ‘master plan’ approach
(see Glossary), developed in partnership
with Stanford University and Ennead

144

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Architects LLP in 2014, was employed to
inform the development and rethinking
of refugee sites in Chad, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Mozambique and Rwanda.
The master plan concept encourages
a holistic approach to settlement
planning by linking the settlement to
the local context, thereby taking into
consideration the integration prospects
of refugees as well as the needs of
the local population. As an example, in
Mozambique, UNHCR introduced plans
to integrate the Maratane refugee camp
into UN Habitat’s development strategy,
in collaboration with the municipal
authorities.
UNHCR and host governments achieved
encouraging results throughout 2015 in
mainstreaming refugees into national
health-care and education systems. In
the Congo and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, refugees from the Central
African Republic were integrated into
the national education system. In Egypt,
more than 133,000 Syrian refugees
were able to access the national primary
health-care services for a nominal
fee, while refugees in Malaysia could
subscribe to private insurance plans
considered affordable by more than
95 per cent of them. The comprehensive
strategy for the integration of Malian
refugees into the public health-care
system was being successfully piloted
in Aballa and Mangaize camps in Niger,
where pregnant women and children
younger than five years had access to
consultations free of charge.

Key achievements in 2015

Basic needs and essential services
Shelter and infrastructure established, improved and maintained
Roll out the Global Strategy for
Settlement and Shelter (2014-2018)

nn Of all priority countries, 68% (17 out of 25) had a comprehensive shelter and settlement strategy in place in 2015,
including 6 established in 2015.
nn 68 technical missions supported new emergencies and more protracted displacement situations.

Enhance capacity to deliver a
combination of settlement options

nn A shelter design catalogue outlining the progression of emergency shelters toward sustainable accommodation,
in terms of design and cost, was produced.
nn 3 settlement and shelter trainings were conducted for 55 staff and partners using standardized software,
hardware and tools.
nn A variety of tools were developed to support site planners in designing more holistic settlements, including a
standard site assessment form.
nn The UNHCR site planning toolkit was piloted by 10 shelter and settlement experts and will be rolled out in 2016.

Invest in research and development
for alternative shelter solutions

nn More than 7,300 refugee housing units were deployed to 8 locations, including Djibouti, Greece and Iraq.

Promote and implement the ‘master
plan’ approach

nn 4 operations (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) were supported in applying the ‘master plan’ approach,
which seeks to promote the integration of refugees within existing host communities as well as sharing key resources.

Enhance monitoring of shelter and
settlement responses

nn New sectoral indicators to improve UNHCR’s ability to monitor the impact of shelter and settlement programmes
were introduced. The development of tools to allow for more systematic data collection was ongoing.

nn The new self-standing family tent developed through the technical committee (UNHCR, ICRC, IFRC) underwent rigorous
field (Burkina Faso and Pakistan) and laboratory testing to ensure its safety and structural resistance to extreme weather
conditions, along with assessing its cultural suitability in a variety of contexts. The specifications for the new tent were to
be finalized in early 2016 with a view to making an improved tent model available to operations worldwide.

Providing essential services
to improve health and wellbeing
Several factors affect the extent to which
refugees have access to national health
care, including the levels of coverage for
health and social services available to
refugees in the country of asylum and the
varying funding mechanisms. UNHCR’s
Global Strategy for Public Health (20142018) and Policy on Alternatives to
Camps support synergies with national
development planning by contributing to
local infrastructure and bringing refugees
within national social protection and
service delivery systems.
The Office works with national authorities,
using country-specific strategies to
mainstream refugees within national healthcare systems. As an example, in 2015, the
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Iranian Health
Insurance Organization and UNHCR signed
a tripartite agreement on the inclusion of

nearly 1 million Afghan and Iraqi refugees
in the Government-sponsored Universal
Public Health Insurance Scheme. This
allows refugees access to health-care
services in all public hospitals affiliated with
the Ministry of Health.
In 2015, eight new disease outbreaks
affected people of concern, including
a cholera outbreak among Burundian
refugees in Tanzania which claimed
29 lives. Through rapid procurement of
medicines and supplies, and enhanced
coordinated health, water, sanitation
and hygiene interventions in Nyarugusu
camp, UNHCR and partners managed to
contain the cholera outbreak and provide
treatment. Many more fatalities were
prevented through an ensuing cholera
vaccination campaign at the camp and in
surrounding communities.
With both new and ongoing crises
and growing numbers of refugees, the
demands on health services increased

significantly, putting further strain on
UNHCR’s capacities. The variety of
interventions and settings called for rapid
adaptation and allocation of resources
in an appropriate and timely manner in
each situation. UNHCR sought to ensure
effective quality responses through the
introduction of tailored public health and
WASH strategies. This included measures

Areas of intervention in 2015

to calculate the needs related to the largescale arrival of people of concern in Europe
in 2015, to ensure coherent interventions
in the region. The minimum standards of
20 litres of water per day/person and a
maximum of 16 people per latrine were met
globally, although challenges remained and
many sites still reported below-standard
figures. n

Key achievements in 2015

Basic needs and essential services
Health status of population improved
Improve access to quality primary
health care programmes

nn Acceptable under-5 mortality rates were achieved in 98% of operations worldwide (from 93% in 2014).

Improve child survival (Increased
vaccination coverage)

nn The coverage of measles vaccination improved slightly, reaching 90% among refugees.

Decrease morbidity from
communicable disease (Improved
outbreak response)

nn Overall fatality rates in eight new disease outbreaks were kept below threshold through well-coordinated health
WASH and logistical support.

Improve access to comprehensive
reproductive, maternal and newborn
health services

nn UNHCR continued to support access to comprehensive reproductive health services. Refugee women enjoyed
access to safe childbirth, with 90% of women having full access to skilled birth attendants.

Improve care of mental illness

nn More than 270 staff of partner organizations working in refugee camps in Cameroon, Chad and Ethiopia completed a
four-day mental health training course on the mhGAP Humanitarian Intervention Guide, developed with WHO in 2015.

nn As part of the inter-agency task team HIV in Humanitarian Emergencies, UNHCR led the development of a guide
to help improve prevention of mother-to-child transmission in emergencies (PMTCT in Humanitarian Settings),
based on a review of lessons learned.

nn Health and community workers also benefited from one-day workshops to foster cooperation between clinical
staff and the refugee workforce around mental health.

Nutritional well-being and food security improved
Implement standardized expanded
nutrition surveys (SENS)

nn SENS surveys were conducted at 84 sites in 2015.
nn 48 sites (57%) met the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) standards of < 10%, whilst 19 (23%) were above the
emergency threshold of ≥ 15%.
nn Remarkable decreases in levels of anaemia were recorded at 21% of sites.

Promote and support adequate
infant and young child feeding (IYCF)
and care practices

nn An IYCF-friendly framework to guide multi-sectoral integration to improve infant and young children nutrition and
survival was developed and piloted in three countries (Bangladesh, Jordan and Kenya). Experiences from these
pilots will feed into wider implementation in 2016.
nn 22% of all sites monitored showed levels of exclusive breastfeeding to be low (<50% of infants 0-5 months).

Improve effectiveness of food
assistance

nn New and innovative approaches to food assistance targeting were piloted in Chad, Jordan and Lebanon, the
results of which are being analysed.

Population lives in satisfactory conditions of sanitation and hygiene
Ensure refugees have safe access
to sanitation facilities

nn A global average of 16 people per latrine was achieved, although many sites still reported instances where the
standard of 20 people per latrine was not met.

Supply of potable water increased or maintained
Ensure refugees have safe access
to water of sufficient quality and
quantity

146

UNHCR Global Report 2015

nn A global average of 20 litres of water per day per person was achieved, although many sites still reported figures
below the standard.
nn UNHCR reduced operational costs for water supply systems by increasing the number of water pumping facilities
powered with photovoltaic (solar) energy. In 2015, 13 boreholes in Dadaab, Kenya were converted to operate with
solar-hybrid energy. After conversion, fuel consumption for pumping water was reduced by 50%.

News and views

For refugees in Iran, health plan
brings care and comfort
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
17 December 2015

TEHRAN, Islamic Republic of Iran |
As an Afghan refugee and an only
son, Ajab Khan Yaghoubi’s entire
family relies on him to survive.
But the 22-year-old suffers from
hemophilia, a genetic illness which
until recently left him with painful
bleeding, expensive medical bills
and an uncertain future.

Ajab is part of the second generation
of Afghan refugees whose parents
fled to neighbouring Iran following
the Soviet invasion in 1979. He and his
four sisters were born and raised in
the Saveh settlement, 165 kilometres
southwest of Tehran, where they still
live today.
With hemophilia affecting many in
Ajab’s family, heavy medical expenses
made life in exile harder than ever.
“I felt hopeless,” Ajab recalls, tearyeyed. “I always wanted to contribute
to the society that I am living in and to
the livelihood of my family. Every time I
wanted to get my medication, I had to
see if I could borrow money from friends
and relatives.”

UNHCR/S. Maghsoudi

Now, he can once again live life to the
fullest thanks to an unprecedented
initiative from the Government of
the Islamic Republic of Iran that will
eventually bring nearly a million
refugees within the national healthcare
safety net.

Afghan refugee Ajab Khan holds up his Salamat Health Insurance booklet.

It was the Universal Public Health
Insurance scheme, also known
as Salamat Health Insurance, that
eventually came to Ajab’s aid. The
large-scale initiative is based on an
agreement between UNHCR, the Bureau
for Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs
of the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of
Health, and the Iran Health Insurance
Organisation (Salamat).

António Guterres, as “unprecedented.”
Guterres said he hoped other countries
would follow Iran’s “exemplary initiative
which is going to profoundly impact the
lives of its refugees.”

Through it, refugees can benefit
from a health insurance package for
hospitalization, similar to that of Iranian
nationals. It was hailed on its launch by
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,

Access to Salamat Health Insurance
stands to benefit nearly one million
Afghan and Iraqi refugees living in Iran,
and addresses the financial challenges
related to the high cost of health care. 

Just three weeks after Ajab obtained
his Salamat insurance booklet, he had
already obtained the first batch of his
medication.

BUILDING
BETTER
FUTURES
The ultimate objective of UNHCR’s work is to seek durable
solutions for those who are forced to flee from conflict and
serious human rights violations. Nevertheless, it can take years
before it is safe for displaced populations to return home, or to
find a new place they can call home. And so it is fundamental
to help these individuals and communities to retain a sense of
human dignity and hope for the future.
UNHCR works to empower refugees and other people of
concern and to help them maximize their potential for growth
and development. The Office assists in this process by
promoting access to education, skills training and productive
livelihoods.
The organization continues to promote more inclusive,
sustainable and development-oriented approaches to
programming for refugees.
In addition, UNHCR continues to facilitate resettlement
for refugees with specific protection needs that cannot be
addressed in the country where they have sought asylum.

In this chapter:
• Multi-year planning for solutions
• Complementary pathways to protection and solutions
• Promoting access to inclusive and quality education
• Facilitating voluntary repatriation in safety and dignity
• Building self-reliance
• Enabling access to energy

Multi-Year Planning for Solutions
The number of people of concern to
UNHCR today continues to rise at
a higher rate than comprehensive
durable solutions are being realized.
UNHCR takes a progressive approach
to solutions that entails incorporating
solutions-oriented planning into the
early stages of displacement and that
recognizes that truly durable solutions
for all population groups require longterm investments, through multi-year,
multi-partner strategies that address the
four dimensions of a solution: the legal,
the economic, the social-cultural and the
civil-political.
UNHCR has launched a multi-year
planning pilot to explore how the
existing planning system supports or
hinders planning. Selected operations
in Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda,
Ecuador and Costa Rica are developing
protection and solutions strategies,

150

UNHCR Global Report 2015

working with all levels of government
and with a wide array of partners on
strategies designed to achieve concrete,
longer-term protection and solutions
objectives.
The pilots will provide an evidence-base
to improve support to other operations
already moving towards multi-year
planning and to identify and design
any necessary changes to planning,
budgeting and reporting systems. The
pilot will serve as the first step towards
adapting to a planning and programming
environment that recognizes the
longevity of displacement and
statelessness situations and, therefore,
the necessity of direct and early links to
a wider range of national actors and to
national development planning, as well
as to international actors focused on
longer-term support.

B U I L D I N G

Tanzania is implementing an integration
strategy for some 160,000 newly
naturalized Tanzanians and those former
Burundian refugees whose processes are
ongoing. The strategy is also exploring
how emergency and longer term
responses for other populations can be
better designed to support local growth
and multiple solutions over the medium
to longer-term, complementing ongoing
large-scale resettlement of the Congolese
refugee population.
Uganda is focusing on enhancing selfreliance and resilience and supporting
a range of pathways towards legal
solutions, including resettlement, as an
integral part of national development and
regional planning.
Costa Rica and Ecuador are both
addressing the links between economic
self-sufficiency and eligibility for
naturalisation and Ghana is exploring how
refugees from ECOWAS member states
can benefit from regional agreements
in the search for definitive solutions.
In Senegal, the last elements of a
comprehensive approach to solutions for
Mauritanian refugees will require regional
commitment but the strategy aims for

planning, including with the support
of the Solutions Alliance. The strategy
developed in Zambia supports a
comprehensive solution including a
strong legal element, as well as ties
to broader development planning in
settlement areas. In Somalia, the goal
of the national group is to use the
national development plan and support
from international donors and technical
experts to improving the inclusion of
refugee and IDP returnees in national
development plans and priorities.
Protection and solutions planning in other
regions is also leading to approaches that
will be formalized in the coming years.

Seeds for Solutions
Through Seeds for Solutions funding, more than
20 UNHCR operations have been provided financial
and technical support in 2015 and are currently applying
solutions-oriented interventions in their programming,
including in the documentation of legal solutions; support
for greater self-reliance; skills training; infrastructure
investments to support social cohesion and the inclusion
of persons of concern to UNHCR in national systems and
other key contributions to comprehensive solutions. In the
cases of Niger, Sri Lanka and Somalia, Seeds for Solutions
facilitated the launching of programmes that were later
able to continue independently of the initiative’s support.

Other operations are also working
towards comprehensive solutions

Complementary Pathways to Protection and Solutions

UNHCR works in partnership with
governments and others to identify and
share information about and, where
necessary, to adapt legislation, policy,
and existing administrative systems
that can facilitate refugees’ search for
protection and solutions. Humanitarian
pathways, such as resettlement and other
humanitarian admission programmes,
private sponsorship programmes for
individuals in humanitarian need, some
special humanitarian visas, and medical
evacuation are designed to provide
protection and solutions for refugees at
risk.

152

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Complementary pathways may not be
specifically based on the protection
risks faced by refugees, but can offer
protection and solutions for refugees
and serve as an important expression
of solidarity and responsibility sharing.
Such pathways may include: family
reunification for extended family
members that do not fall within
resettlement criteria, points-based and
labour migration and labour mobility
schemes and academic scholarships
and apprenticeships.

B U I L D I N G

UNHCR has been exploring the possibility
of alternate pathways to solutions for
some time, including through formal
studies in the MERCOSUR and ECOWAS
regions exploring how schemes that
permit nationals to move and work freely
could offer secure futures for refugees.
In addition to new opportunities
opening for safe labour mobility and
education schemes, some West African
States are looking at how the ECOWAS
framework and their own national laws
could offer facilitated pathways to
permanent residency and, in some cases,
naturalization.

Ensuring protection through
resettlement
In 2015, global resettlement needs
exceeded 1 million places for the first
time. The number of refugees and
migrants arriving in mixed flows in Europe
increased dramatically, prompting a surge
of political and public interest in refugee
and migration issues. Many countries

B E T T E R

F U T U R E S

announced additional resettlement
quotas in 2015 specifically for Syrian
refugees, who made up the majority of
arrivals to Europe.
UNHCR resettlement submissions
to resettlement countries in 2015
exceeded 133,000 – a 28 per cent
increase on 2014. The number of
resettlement States also grew, with Italy
and the Republic of Korea announcing
pilot resettlement programmes which
began in 2015.
The organization’s submissions from
Africa exceeded 38,800 individuals in
2015 – a 147 per cent increase since
2012. Almost 90 per cent of the total
resettlement submissions from Africa in
2015 were made to the United States.
Resettlement out of Asia continued
to decrease; however there was one
notable milestone during the year: the
number of Bhutanese refugees resettled
out of Nepal since 2007 reached more
than 100,000.

“Globally, resettlement continued to play a crucial protection
role in UNHCR's response to forced displacement. More than
81,000 refugees departed for resettlement in 2015.”
- High Commissioner Filippo Grandi

From the Middle East, North Africa
and Turkey, some 70,000 people
were submitted for resettlement and
humanitarian admission during 2015,
including more than 52,000 Syrian
refugees. The Syria Core Group has
played a pivotal role in ensuring
continued support for resettlement
from host States in the region, by
demonstrating that large-scale
resettlement can be an effective means
of sharing responsibility for refugee
protection. The Syria Core Group
has also been an important forum for
addressing issues related to integrity
and status adjudication, enabling States
to move forward with expedited and
simplified resettlement procedures to
address the needs of displaced Syrians.
The resettlement needs of Iraqi refugees
remained significant, with more than
11,000 Iraqi refugees submitted for
resettlement in 2015.
The unprecedented level of interest
in resettlement and other forms of
admission for refugees required UNHCR
to significantly increase its response
capacity. Preparation for a global
upscaling of resettlement began in late
2015, as UNHCR predicted a 37 per cent
increase in resettlement submissions in
2016 in order to meet quotas.

154

UNHCR Global Report 2015

The Office continued to focus on
upholding the integrity of asylum
systems throughout the year, as well as
reviewing and revising its relevant policy
and operational guidelines in order to
reduce the risk of fraud. A new policy and
guidelines – to be issued in 2016 – are
expected to provide a comprehensive
framework for addressing fraud and
include prevention, detection, and
investigation measures aimed at all
stages of case processing, including
registration, refugee status determination
and resettlement. Emphasis will be
placed on tracking and reporting fraud
or fraud-like incidents, which will allow
the organization to proactively identify
trends. Dedicated anti-fraud posts
were introduced in several operations,
including Kenya and Malaysia.
The chairing of the Annual Tripartite
Consultations on Resettlement (ATCR)
and the Working Group on Resettlement
(WGR) was passed to the Netherlands by
the Norwegian Government. During 2015,
resettlement States, UNHCR, NGOs, and
resettled refugees participated in no less
than five WGR meetings. It was agreed
that core and contact groups would meet
on an annual basis to discuss work plans
and how to achieve a simpler approach
to resettlement processing, including the
potential use of electronic submissions. n

nn In 2015, UNHCR resettlement submissions rose to more than 133,000 – 28% more than the 103,890 individuals
submitted in 2014.
nn Efforts were made with resettlement States to reduce the time between submission and departure. 81,273 people
departed in 2015 – an 11% increase on 73,330 in 2014.
nn Since the Annual Tripartite Consultations on Resettlement in July 2014, UNHCR has been calling for the
resettlement of 10% of the Syrian refugee population. At the end of 2015, more than 162,000 pledges of
resettlement places were made for Syrian refugees.
nn There were slightly fewer resettlement submissions than the previous year from Iraqi refugees in the Middle East,
North Africa and Turkey – 10,930 were submitted in 2015, a 6% decrease compared to 11,608 in 2014.
nn More than 52,000 Syrians were submitted for resettlement consideration from the Middle East, North Africa and
Turkey, compared to 20,903 Syrian refugees in 2014. This included Syrians from Jordan (22,273), Lebanon
(18,476) and Turkey (8,091).
nn UNHCR submitted more than 38,800 resettlement applications from Africa in 2015, compared to 35,079 in 2014.
This includes more than 20,460 Congolese refugees, bringing the total since 2012 to over 57,000.
nn In 2015, 56 victims of trafficking were submitted for resettlement consideration from Egypt, compared to 203 in
2014. Victims of trafficking who departed for resettlement increased from 51 individuals in 2014 to 175 individuals

PROMOTING ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE AND QUALITY EDUCATION

UNHCR’s Education Strategy 2012-2016
places particular focus on assuring the
provision of refugee education, not as a
peripheral stand-alone service, but as a
core component of UNHCR’s protection
and durable solutions mandate. Quality
education that builds relevant skills and
knowledge enables refugees to live
healthy, dignified, productive lives and
become more self-reliant.
In 2015, UNHCR implemented multi-year,
country-specific education strategies in 25
priority countries and continued its work
to achieve greater inclusion of refugee
children in national education services.
Through the Educate a Child (EAC) global
programme, in 2015 UNHCR launched

of UNHCR’s Learn Lab, which works
to enhance and expand educational
programming for people of concern
using innovative approaches. More
than 80,000 students in 11 countries
participated in Learn Lab initiatives,
and a notable improvement in exam
performance results in Kenya and the
United Republic of Tanzania, as well as a
positive psychosocial impact, have been
observed.
In addition, more than 3,400 refugees in
42 countries were given higher education
scholarships through the Albert Einstein
German Academic Refugee Initiative
(DAFI) and other programmes in 2015. n

FACILITATING VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION IN SAFETY AND DIGNITY

In 2015, conditions for voluntary repatriation
continued to be challenging and not
conducive to the safe return of refugees in
many operations. In 2015, a total of 201,416
refugees opted for voluntary repatriation,
75,416 higher than the 126,000 refugees
who voluntarily repatriated in 2014.

UNHCR and partners supported the
voluntary repatriation of 5,709 individuals
from Kenya to Somalia. In Mali, the
registration of returnees was resumed
in August, leading to the registration of
4,088 spontaneous returnees by the end
of 2015.

A total of 58,460 Afghans repatriated to
Afghanistan in 2015. Shrinking asylum
space and lack of access to protection
elsewhere is thought to have contributed to
these returns, which are an increase over
the previous year despite deteriorating
security conditions.

The Office had planned the voluntary
repatriation of 20,000 Rwandan refugees
from North and South Kivu in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2015,
although only 5,193 people repatriated
voluntarily.

In Côte d’Ivoire, voluntary repatriation
resumed in late 2015 (after the suspension
in 2014 due to the Ebola virus) and 1,226
refugees returned to their communities of
origin by end December. Significantly more
have returned since the beginning of 2016
and the pace continues to increase.

158

UNHCR Global Report 2015

UNHCR closed the chapter on the
voluntary repatriation of former Angolan
refugees with approximately 4,600 persons
returning in 2015, of which 3,886 returned
from the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. n

BUILDING SELF-RELIANCE

UNHCR works to enable refugees to
carry out safe and secure livelihood
activities while they are living in host
communities and after they go home,
with various forms of support services, to
help them gain lawful access to markets
and acquire the human, financial, social,
and physical capital that may be required
to work productively.
In 2015, the Office continued to
implement its five-year Global
Strategy for Livelihoods (2014-2018)
which aims to ensure a sustainable
income for refugees by linking
their productive capacity to market
opportunities through evidence-based
and technically-sound livelihoods
programming.
In line with the Global Strategy,
Operational Guidelines on the Minimum
Criteria for Livelihoods Programming
were issued in 2015. The minimum
criteria outlined the most important steps
for effective planning, implementing and
monitoring of livelihood programmes in

order to maximize the impact of UNHCR’s
interventions. Through these minimum
criteria, UNHCR operations were able
to conduct socio-economic and market
assessments, as well as value-chain
analyses, to assist in developing contextspecific, multi-year strategic plans, while
ensuring results through proper targeting,
quality partnerships and expertise. By the
end of 2015, 97 UNHCR operations had
compliance plans in place for achieving
the mandatory minimum criteria.

Right to work
UNHCR partnered with ILO and others
to support field operations in conducting
market assessments and value-chain
analyses. In Zambia, UNHCR and ILO
organized entrepreneurial training
programmes to ensure sustainable
livelihood opportunities for refugees.
UNHCR has also been working with the
International Trade Centre to promote
access to work with governments and
employers.

Collaboration with Governments, NGOs
and civil society in Asia, Europe, the
Middle East and the Americas is exploring
how civil society and the private
sector can contribute to employment
opportunities for refugees and others of
concern.

The Graduation Approach
Throughout the year, UNHCR successfully
pursued the Graduation Approach (see
Glossary) in Burkina Faso, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Egypt and Zambia, which
aims to help people to ‘graduate’ out of
poverty through a targeted, sequenced
and time-limited livelihood support
process. This process would see them
earn an income to cover their basic
needs through safe and sustainable work
opportunities or self-employment.
In Costa Rica, the Graduation Model
was included in the country’s 20152018 National Development Plan.
Progress was made in granting refugees
access to national programmes on
poverty reduction, employability and
development. Through its corporate
social responsibility scheme, Vivir la
Integración, UNHCR worked with roughly
90 companies in Costa Rica to provide
access to training and sustainable
employment opportunities for refugees.
Since 2014, an estimated 2,000 people
of concern in Costa Rica have begun
to achieve socio-economic integration
thanks to the Graduation Approach,
and 300 refugees and asylum-seekers
had found employment through Vivir la
Integración.
UNHCR’s graduation programme in
Egypt supported refugees in urban areas
to improve their livelihoods through
obtaining a sustainable wage or selfemployment. A mid-term evaluation

160

UNHCR Global Report 2015

conducted in 2015 showed that 754
participants had been employed and
797 had successfully started their own
business. According to initial estimates,
the average income per person per
month had increased by around 18
per cent in Cairo and 27 per cent in
Alexandria.
A business incubator model developed
by UNHCR in Ecuador, together with
the Pontifical Catholic University of
Ecuador Esmeraldas, sought to provide
refugees, asylum-seekers and vulnerable
populations with entrepreneurial skills to
develop their businesses. The initiative
has supported 28 enterprises over
two years with only a few unsuccessful
ventures (14 per cent) compared to the
significant 90 per cent overall failure
rate of enterprises in Esmereldas within
two years. On average, the businesses
supported by this initiative have
increased their income by 10 per cent.

New opportunities
Three additional sectors in which
refugees have demonstrated great
potential to be active economic agents of
change are artisan work, agriculture and
telework (working remotely with the aid of
online technologies). These sectors were
chosen for specific support in view of
the global growth trends, as well as their
potential for employing large numbers of
people in developing countries.
In 2015, an estimated 37 per cent of
Malian refugees in Sahel camps and the
urban centre of Bobo-Dioulasso were
skilled artisans, of whom 19 per cent
were heads of household. A value-chain
analysis revealed the high potential of the
artisan sector for refugees to generate
sustainable income, and UNHCR worked
to address some of the challenges

B U I L D I N G

that refugee artisans face in accessing
tools, skills and markets. To harness the
potential for artisan activities in Burkina
Faso, the Office started a project to
contribute to the socio-economic wellbeing and self-reliance of 1,000 Malian
refugee artisans in Goudebou and
Mentao camps, as well as in the urban
centre of Ouagadougou. It supported
product innovations, facilitated access
to production inputs and infrastructure,
developed skills and entrepreneurship,
and provided links to local and
international markets.
Nonetheless, despite concrete
successes and UNHCR’s ongoing

B E T T E R

F U T U R E S

efforts to increase its technical
expertise, the implementation of
livelihood programming in many
contexts remained complex and were
hindered by the lack of an enabling
environment, resulting in legal, political,
social and economic challenges for
people of concern in accessing work
and market opportunities. Sparse
resources continued to limit the
capacity of the Office and its partners
to design, implement and monitor
livelihood programmes that could make
a remarkable difference in opening up
economic opportunities for people of
concern. n

Global Strategic Priorities
Local integration
Political support for local integration varies greatly
across different operational contexts. In Georgia,
UNHCR contributed to the development of an
integration strategy and action plan to improve
prospects for integration of refugees, which has
now been approved by Parliament. In Bolivia,
the Government established a coordination
mechanism to address local integration issues,
in line with a comprehensive plan to strengthen
protection and durable solutions, developed with
technical guidance and funding of UNHCR.

In the Gambia, advocacy efforts targeting local
authorities enabled refugees to acquire plots
of land for residential and farming purposes
and secured a waiver of the ‘expatriate’ tax for
refugee employees. In September 2015, the
Government of Zambia approved expanded
criteria for the local integration of Angolans,
offering local integration to all former Angolan
refugees who arrived in Zambia by 2003, as well
as for some 4,000 Rwandans.

permits

nn 2,557 temporary residence permits were delivered to former Angolan refugees in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
nn 1,120 residency visas were issued to refugees and asylum-seekers in Ecuador.
nn It was anticipated that 2,000 Togolese refugees would receive residence permits in Ghana in 2015. However, a
different strategy on legal local integration is being pursued to ensure longer-term residency rights (including
potentially naturalization).
nn Some 1,200 residence permits have been distributed to former Angolan refugees in Zambia. Some 1,100 former
Angolan refugees and Zambian nationals have been allocated land plots under the national settlement scheme
as part of the Government of Zambia Local Integration Strategy for former Angolan refugees.
nn Technical and financial support was provided in the Americas (Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay,
Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, El Salvador, Guatemala), as well as in India and Georgia, for 1,291 refugees to pursue
alternative migratory solutions, including by obtaining family reunification visas, residence visas or naturalization.
nn The Government of the Gambia agreed to provide multi-year residence and work permits (5 to 15 years) to
refugees to integrate locally and approved the exemption of expatriate tax on refugees, which encourages
employment of refugees and facilitates their economic integration.
nn Practical guidance on rule-of-law initiatives, such as right to work, housing land and property and access to justice,
were developed in the Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Senegal, with pilot projects in
housing land and property initiated in the Central African Republic, Myanmar and Senegal.

centres and community-based outreach, to support the operationalization of community-based protection by
highlighting successful approaches and methodologies based on good practices from UNHCR operations.
nn An online community of practice was developed with partners, bringing together resources and examples of
good practices from the field to facilitate peer learning between humanitarian and protection actors around the
world.
nn Targeted technical support was provided to 8 operations through field missions, training and remote support.

ENABLING ACCESS TO ENERGY
UNHCR launched a five-year Global
Strategy for Safe Access to Fuel and
Energy (SAFE) in 2014 to improve the
quality of life in refugee camps and
hosting communities by enabling
refugees’ access to clean energy facilities
for cooking and lighting. The provision
of lighting, energy and fuel in camps
contribute to safeguarding refugees
from protection risks such as sexual and
gender-based violence (SGBV), which
often occurs in the search for firewood
and during hours of darkness. In 2015,
UNHCR’s operations paid particular
attention to supporting the use of new or
improved renewable energy technologies
for refugee households in a number
of settings, and to documenting these
efforts to determine whether and how
they may be replicated.
The Office has ongoing solar farm
projects in Azraq and Za’atri refugee
camps in Jordan, to meet lighting and
low-powered energy needs. Excess
energy is channeled back to the
Jordanian national grid. In Bangladesh,
UNHCR was able to convert all human

waste in one camp into biogas that could
be used for cooking.
In the Jijiga camps in Ethiopia, refugees
who previously used kerosene now
use healthier and safer ethanol-fuelled
cooking stoves. This shift resulted in the
creation of a carbon financing project
to generate carbon credit that allows
UNHCR to provide additional stoves, fuel
or other services. UNHCR is expanding
the use of ethanol cooking stoves to
three additional locations in the country.
In Kenya’s Dadaab camps, a pilot test
using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was
underway. In addition to the health benefits
stemming from clean energy, the use of LPG
for cooking reduces negative environmental
impacts and has the potential to lessen
tensions that may arise between refugees
and the host community over the depletion
of common natural resources.
The integration of a responsible natural
resource management component
into energy programming remains
fundamental to UNHCR. It is key to

UNHCR Global Report 2015

163

addressing some of the negative
environmental impacts that often
accompany refugee influxes and
associated humanitarian operations,
and for determining ways in which well
designed, innovative and participatory
resource management can contribute
to securing safe and sustainable
energy access and livelihoods in these
contexts.
UNHCR operations supported a range of
environmental resilience projects, including

Areas of intervention in 2015

reforestation programmes in refugee sites
and environmental-awareness promotion.
Similarly, the Office was looking at
ways to reduce its carbon footprint and
energy costs by utilizing renewable
energy sources for staff accommodation,
administration and water delivery.
Seeking accreditation to the Green
Climate Fund and financing opportunities
will have considerable impact on potential
funding for environmental management,
renewable energy and climate change
adaptation. n

Key achievements in 2015

Environment and energy
Implement the UNHCR Global
Strategy for Safe Access to Fuel and
Energy (SAFE) effectively

nn 10 operations developed a country-specific SAFE strategy (Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nepal,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda). These strategies resulted in a shift from over-reliance on firewood as
the main source of cooking energy to other eco-friendly sources. In Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Kenya, for
example, ethanol, solar cookers, liquefied petroleum gas and other alternative energy technologies have been
tested.
nn In 2015, close to 99,000 households received fuel-efficient cookstoves in five countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda) and more than 99,700 households received solar lanterns. In Ethiopia alone, 52% of
households received clean cookstoves and 66% solar lamps.

Increase knowledge of energy
interventions through strengthened
monitoring and evaluation

nn In collaboration with the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and Berkeley Air Monitoring, UNHCR worked to set
minimum standards for cooking technologies that can be procured at various stages of an emergency response.
The Office was working simultaneously to produce guidance on monitoring, evaluation and performance
measurement of energy programming, with the aim of ensuring the use of appropriate and sustainable
cookstoves and fuel supplies.
nn A study in Chad for the Light Years Ahead project indicated that with the introduction of solar lamps, households
had cut their expenditure on lighting by half. Moreover, 94% of the individuals interviewed indicated that the solar
street lights had greatly improved the sense of security at night time.

Expand energy and environment
expertise and capacity in field
operations

nn Energy and environment training was conducted for participants from 17 country operations.

Test innovative approaches to
energy and environment

nn The carbon credit cooking stove project, launched in Rwanda with the involvement of 300 refugees, not only
helped the refugees to earn an income but also generated EUR 50,000 in 2015.

nn An online learning programme on safe access to fuel and energy in refugee situations was developed to build
UNHCR and partner staff’s awareness and capacity to handle this. The eLearning programme was due to be
rolled out in 2016.

nn The introduction of the environmental management plan for Mahana camp in Rwanda included: the procurement
of improved cooking stoves for 20,000 households; the establishment of a sludge-management system for the
temporary water treatment plant and a specific environmental management plan for the construction and
operation of a permanent water treatment plant at the site.
nn Pay as you go (PAYG) technologies linked livelihoods and energy priorities, and the first renewable energy and
livelihoods joint intervention to create energy co-ops and income-generation opportunities for refugee and host
communities across 3,300 households was launched.
nn The Azraq Electrification Project was implemented in Jordan. In Chad, UNHCR was developing hybrid systems for
offices and accommodation in addition to designing a land restoration pilot project.
nn UNHCR in Nepal is exploring the feasibility of installing a mini-grid with Engineers Without Borders. Mini-grids
provide power in remote areas that are not linked to the national grid.

veterinarian, but success is unlikely without
stable employment. A new programme
involving UNHCR is giving 200 refugee
families like them new hope.

Their chances of success are being
increased by a new programme, the
Graduation Model, which is using a
comprehensive approach to make refugees

relief assistance, participants will receive
vocational training, financial education and
legal assistance.

Amelia has raised her granddaughter Paula
since they fled to Ecuador in 2006 after
death threats by members of an illegal
armed group in Colombia. Paula’s mother,
pregnant at the time, stayed in their home
country.

To address this need, UNHCR and a number
of state and partner organizations, in
coordination with the private sector, have
launched the Graduation Model in Santo
Domingo de los Tsáchilas, a refugee-hosting
city 200 kilometres from the capital, Quito.

Despite their efforts, it has been hard for
Amelia and her husband – both elderly
– to secure stable employment. The odd
jobs they have taken on are barely enough
for daily needs. Paula is often forced to
miss entire weeks of school to help her
grandmother.

The pilot – involving the local government,
the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the
Jesuit Refugee Service, the national Banco
del Pichincha and a financial education
provider Fundación CRISFE – supports
self-employment, formal wage earning
and microfinance to create livelihood
opportunities.

Many Colombian refugees in Ecuador –
lacking social networks and resources –
cannot find stable employment. Creating

It goes beyond providing simple relief
assistance to a more targeted and self-

empowering approach that offers
consumption support, legal assistance,
financial education and vocational training
to refugees.
By participating in the Graduation Model,
Amelia’s family is hoping to secure a
more stable income, allowing them to put
some money aside for later needs like her
granddaughter’s education.
Banco Pichincha, Ecuador’s largest banking
institution, are providing these families
with individual savings accounts and basic
financial education.
In a couple of weeks, Amelia and her
family will start receiving food support and
will attend their first classes on financial
education and self-reliance. 

However, there remain a number of recurring gaps, such

international standards.
Similarly, while several States and regional bodies have
demonstrated their commitment to eradicating statelessness
by 2024, efforts need to be expanded to address the major
situations of statelessness around the world.
A growing degree of ’asylum fatigue’ has been witnessed
over the past year. Addressing this and other contemporary
protection challenges remains a high priority for UNHCR. In
2015, UNHCR continued to safeguard the fundamental right of
people whose lives and liberty are at risk to seek safety and
security in another State, and support States to establish and
strengthen institutional refugee and asylum frameworks.

HOSTING THE WORLD’S
REFUGEES
The arrival of refugees always has an
impact on host communities. Depending
on the size of the refugee population
relative to the host community, and the
prevailing socio-economic circumstances
prior to their arrival, the consequent
effects can be both positive and negative.
These are often hard to document,
especially as the scale and scope of
most refugee situations are not easily
predictable.
But in all instances of refugee arrivals,
an important objective of governments,
UNHCR and its partners is to ensure
timely and effective protection by
supporting social cohesion between
refugees and their local community.
The huge demographic shock
experienced in Lebanon, Jordan and
Turkey of absorbing millions of Syrian
refugees has highlighted the importance
of interventions to mitigate the impact on
political, economic and social stability.

countries, 2015 (in millions)

This includes refugees and other categories of Iraqis.

168

UNHCR Global Report 2015

The significant numbers of Syrian
refugee arrivals have raised important
questions about the needs of local
communities as well. If these are not
immediately comparable to the losses
and trauma experienced by refugees,
the requirements at local level to offset
the consequences of a rapid rise in
population can also be considerable.
The generosity of host countries and
communities has certainly been at a high
cost. The spillover effects of the conflict
have had a visible impact at the macroeconomic level since business, trade
and investment have all been affected.
Indeed, like other conflict situations,
the war has been the principal cause of
economic and social distress not only
inside the country but across the region.
The Governments concerned have
primarily borne the higher costs of the
increased consumption of public services
and utilities by the refugees. Local
communities have been obliged to share
resources and services with refugees.

Many other countries receiving refugees
have experienced similar effects in the
past. However, most refugee situations
account for less than 3 per cent of
national populations. These smaller
refugee populations can nevertheless
represent a considerable challenge for
local authorities and communities.
Beyond providing essential life
preserving support – security, food,
water, and shelter – during the initial
stages of an emergency, issues of social
service delivery (health, education) soon
arise. As refugees start to consume local
natural resources, purchase goods in
local markets, and look for livelihood
opportunities, other effects also become
more identifiable.
These can include a rise in tension
between local communities and
refugees as often goods can become
scarcer, prices rise, and resources
diminish. Refugees can also compete
for jobs and opportunities in local labour
markets. However, their arrival often
brings opportunities too, particularly in
remote regions where socio-economic

U N H C R ’ S

W O R K

development often lags behind national
indicators. They represent an increase
in the number of consumers that can
spur local productivity, trade and
business. And they attract government
engagement, aid and private sector
investment.
The impacts are rarely uniform and can
vary considerably over time too. The
immediate effects of refugee arrivals
do cause imbalances at local level.
Depending on the level and speed of
public and private sector responses, and
on the socio-economic context, these
initial problems generally stabilize and a
new but different equilibrium follows.
In addressing these circumstances, two
main considerations for the provision
of assistance predominate. First, the
evident need to ensure efficient and
effective support both to refugees and
local populations affected by a refugee
crisis. The needs may not necessarily be
the same and do require assessments to
find the appropriate form of support. But
a balanced response is certainly needed
to ensure social cohesion.
Second, most refugee situations do
take many years to resolve. So beyond
the initial emergency response, longer
term, more structural support is required
to ensure that overall socio-economic
conditions do not deteriorate for refugees
and local communities alike.
Governments, donors and aid
agencies increasingly recognize that
protracted displacement demands
more than short-term assistance.
Finding the optimal mix of emergency
and developmental engagement, and
devising implementation arrangements
that strengthen and support national
responses, will likely be a feature of aid
delivery to refugee situations in future.

ENGAGING WITH PARTNERS

Refugee response
coordination
UNHCR is committed to coordinating,
planning and delivering refugee
responses that are effective, collaborative
and based on principles of partnership.
In 2015, the Office continued to apply the
Refugee Coordination Model (RCM, see
Glossary), which drew on more than 60
years of experience, and was designed
to provide transparent and inclusive
leadership and coordination in refugee
operations worldwide.
In line with the RCM, the organization
expanded the terms of reference of
the regional refugee coordinators
responsible for leading operational
planning and resource mobilization for
the Central African Republic, Nigeria,
South Sudan and Syria situations, and
designated new coordinators for the
Yemen situation and the crisis in Europe.
In 2015, seven regional refugee response
plans covered 30 countries, involving
more than 270 partners.

170

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Wherever applicable, the Office also
continued to follow the Joint UNHCROCHA Note on Mixed Situations, which
provided a framework for leadership and
coordination in settings where there were
both refugee operations and complex
humanitarian emergencies. This could
include the development of technical
guidance and capacity building, as well
as the provision of field support.
In applying the provisions of the Joint
Note in field operations, UNHCR worked
to ensure the complementarity and
efficiency of its activities. As an example,
following UNHCR’s suggestion to use the
existing refugee coordination platform
to respond to the needs of internally
displaced people (IDPs) in Maroua in
northern Cameroon, in April 2015 an
inter-agency mission assessed the most
appropriate coordination arrangements
for humanitarian actors on the ground.
Subsequently, the High Commissioner
and the Emergency Relief Coordinator
agreed that existing refugee coordination
mechanisms in Cameroon could be
used for this internal displacement
situation, while maintaining respective
accountabilities and reporting lines.

S upporting

Partnership within the United
Nations system and with other
international organizations
In 2015, UNHCR continued to work within the
framework of the established coordination
arrangements at global and field levels under
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (IASC)
Transformative Agenda. The Office continued
to participate in the IASC early warning system,
the Emergency Directors Group (EDG) as well as
part of an inter-agency emergency preparedness
project. For more information on UNHCR’s
leadership of the global clusters providing
protection, shelter and camp coordination and
camp management, please see the Safeguarding
Fundamental Human Rights chapter.
With other key UN system partners, UNHCR
pursued international efforts to preserve the
safety and well-being of displaced populations,
notably with the following agencies:
• WFP - WFP remained one of UNHCR’s most
important operational partners to target food
assistance to the refugees most in need in
camp and urban settings, whether through
cash or in-kind food assistance. In October
2015, WFP and UNHCR, together with UNICEF,
committed to strengthening cooperation on
cash-based interventions.
• UNICEF – UNHCR and UNICEF updated joint
guidance to staff to strengthen their partnership
in the field and provide consistent technical
support to populations of concern in the areas of
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); education;
health and nutrition; and child protection. In
2015, letters of understanding were signed for
joint interventions in South Sudan and Sudan.
• WHO - UNHCR and WHO intensified their
collaboration in several areas, including in
countering tuberculosis and non-communicable
diseases in humanitarian settings, and in
establishing health systems in response to
the influx of refugees and migrants in Europe.

U N H C R ’ S

W O R K

The work on non-communicable diseases in
humanitarian emergencies will gain momentum
in the coming years with the increased evidence
base and improved guidance.
• Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) - It was a critical year for UNAIDS,
of which UNHCR is a co-sponsor. The new
UNAIDS strategy Fast-tracking to zero outlined
the measures envisaged to help end the AIDS
epidemic by 2030. During the 36th UNAIDS
Programme Coordinating Board, held in July
2015, UNHCR and WFP highlighted the risks
associated with neglecting HIV in funding and
programming decisions.
• IOM – UNHCR and IOM developed joint
approaches to mixed movements, ranging from
inter-agency response plans in Europe and
Yemen, to joint responses to rescue at sea.
Forms of collaboration included mixed migration
task forces, joint strategies to address human
trafficking, and joint advocacy on refugees
and migrants – notably when the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) were being
developed.
• UN Secretariat – UNHCR was increasingly
engaged in assisting the work of the Executive
Office of the Secretary-General, the Secretariat
and the broader United Nations in efforts to
address challenges associated with large
movements of refugees and migrants. In 2015,
its New York Office participated in humanitarian
and development fora seeking to ensure that
considerations of the rights and needs of people
of concern to the Office were mainstreamed
into the work of the United Nations. This
included informing deliberations around the
reform of the role of the UN Secretariat in
assisting States to: maintain international peace
and security; improve humanitarian action;
strengthen women’s empowerment; and meet
the newly adopted SDGs. Thanks to UNHCR
and partners’ advocacy, refugees and stateless
people are part of the commitment to ‘leave no
one behind’ and are considered in the goals of
the SDGs.

Partnering with NGOs
The principles of partnership
The five principles of partnership (see
Glossary) highlight the fundamental
importance of upholding the values of
equality, transparency, responsibility,
complementarity and results-orientation
in humanitarian efforts. In 2012, at the
High Commissioner’s structured dialogue
with the IFRC and non-government
organizations (NGOs), participants drew
up 10 recommendations for putting
these principles into practice in UNHCR’s
partnerships.
Since then, UNHCR’s engagement
with NGO partners to carry forward
these recommendations included the
production of guidance notes – on
improving strategic information sharing
among partners, on partnership in
advocacy for protection, and on problem
resolution – to help operations and
colleagues to strengthen partnerships.
A series of joint missions also enabled
the Office and partners to follow up
on the recommendations. In 2015,
four country-specific joint missions
with the participation of UNHCR and
the International Council of Voluntary
Agencies (ICVA) and InterAction took
place in Chad, Kenya, Lebanon and
Myanmar, and three regional followup meetings in West Africa and in
Thailand were completed. In addition, 15
consultations were organized with more
than 200 participants from NGOs and
UNHCR staff. These meetings provided
a unique opportunity for UNHCR staff to
hear directly from national partners about
their priorities and concerns.

172

UNHCR Global Report 2015

The main areas identified by both NGO
and UNHCR participants as still requiring
improvement were: information-sharing;
joint planning; advocating protection
together; problem resolution; and
strengthening the capacity of national
NGOs.
At a global level, UNHCR further explored
how respective expertise and resources
in bilateral partnerships with major NGO
partners could be complementary in
various settings, as well as embarking
upon the revision of memoranda of
understanding, where necessary, and
supporting regular consultations.
A record-breaking year for the Annual
Consultations with NGOs
UNHCR’s annual consultations with NGOs
have brought together representatives
of partner NGOs who collaborate in
protecting, assisting and advocating for
refugees and other displaced people
across the world.
In July 2015, the event gathered some
500 delegates to discuss the theme
In pursuit of solutions, making it the
largest annual consultation with NGOs
to date. More than 270 different NGOs,
UN and international organizations were
represented (of which 76 per cent were
national NGOs). These consultations
covered a wide range of topics and
continued to provide a unique forum
for sharing feedback, information and
experience. Almost 6,000 tweets were
posted with the event’s dedicated
hashtag, #UNHCRNGOs, during the
three-day event.

Strengthening collaboration
with implementing partners
In 2015, UNHCR entrusted
USD 1.26 billion to 938 partners (584
national NGOs, 168 international NGOs,
172 governmental partners and 14 UN
agencies) for 1,732 projects to provide
protection and assistance to, and help
find solutions for, people of concern. The
funds channelled to partners represented
38 per cent of UNHCR’s annual
expenditure (USD 3.3 billion).
Consultations with NGOs and other
stakeholders on the development and
application of the Enhanced Framework
for Implementing with Partners – a
management instrument for providing
quality assistance and protection to
populations of concern and accountability
for resources entrusted by donors continued throughout the year. In total,
14 joint workshops were held to roll out
the framework and strengthen capacities,
which benefited at least 500 staff of
UNHCR and partners.

information about their organization
and its ability to respond to the needs
of refugees and people of concern –
was launched in 2015 and already has a
portfolio of more than 600 partners.

Partnerships for solutions
Collaboration remained fundamental
when seeking solutions for refugees, with
challenges often complex and resourceintensive. UNHCR continued to work
with partners to design comprehensive
protection and solutions strategies that
addressed the four dimensions of a
solution for refugees: legal; economic;
civil/political; and social/cultural. This
approach recognized the progressive
attainment or enjoyment of human rights,
such as freedom of movement and
residence; the right to work; and security
of tenure in housing and agricultural
land, were all elements required to
support independence and resilience
among forcibly displaced, settled and
returning populations. It also recognized
that refugees could and should be
able to contribute to the communities
in which they live, providing them with
opportunities to be economically active,
and to learn and build skills to lead a
more dignified life.
The Solutions Alliance brought
together host and donor governments,
United Nations agencies, civil society
organizations, the private sector,
international financial institutions and
academic institutions to seek approaches
that resolve situations of displacement
and prevent new ones from becoming
protracted. As part of the Alliance,
UNHCR was a member of the Somalia
and Zambia national groups and cochaired thematic groups on the rule of
law, as well as on research, data and
performance management.

The organization continued to strengthen
its partnership with development actors
to improve coordination on solutions and
increase recognition of displacement
as a development issue. Four new joint
studies with the World Bank – three
in Africa and one in the Middle East
– provided regional situation analysis
of forced displacement and informed

programming priorities. Through ongoing
partnership with the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), local
integration and self-reliance measures
in Uganda and Zambia were being
supported. UNHCR’s partnerships with
ILO and the International Trade Centre
promoted the right to work and market
development interventions for refugees.

The Sustainable Development Agenda: a universal
pledge to leave no one behind
On 25 September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally
adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, consisting of a
Declaration, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 associated
targets and 229 indicators. The SDGs replace the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), which were agreed in 2000 and ended in 2015.
Unlike the Millennium Development Goals, the 2030 Agenda explicitly
refers to refugees and internally displaced people as those whose needs
and aspirations, as well as their contribution to sustainable development,
must be taken into account. The Agenda, led by the SDGs, pledges
to ensure that ‘no one is left behind’, including refugees and internally
displaced people, and resolves to adopt measures to meet the needs
of those affected by complex humanitarian emergencies. While the
implementation of the Agenda is left to States, all UN agencies are
expected to incorporate the Agenda into their programmes and to support
the national authorities to progressively work towards achieving the goals
within the next 15 years. UNHCR was involved in the development of the
2030 Agenda and collaborated with other UN agencies to ensure that
people of concerns were included.

MOBILIZING THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Since 2007, UNHCR had placed great
importance on developing its private
sector fundraising relations and functions,
recognizing the need to expand the
organization’s resources and donor base,
as well as the growing interest of private
entities and individuals in engaging in
response to global humanitarian issues.
Thanks to the generosity of private
supporters who donated USD 284 million
in 2015, UNHCR significantly exceeded
its initial private sector fundraising target
for the year. While the organization’s
overall funding gap was greater than ever
before, the private donations allowed
UNHCR to be more responsive to a
number of underfunded situations and
have a greater impact on the safety and
well-being of many displaced people.

The number of individual donors
supporting UNHCR’s work in 2015
grew to more than 1.4 million people
located across more than 20 countries
worldwide. In total, USD 194.4 million
was raised from individuals. Partnerships
with corporations, foundations
and philanthropists generated
USD 89.5 million in financial support, as
well as awareness of UNHCR and people
of concern to the organization.
More than 50 per cent of the overall
funds were mobilized by UNHCR’s six
National Fundraising Partners (see box),
with innovative collaborations leading
to outstanding results. Established
in accordance with the laws of the
country in which each operates, these
independent organizations raised funds

significant growth in private donations in
both countries.

The refugee crisis in Europe
triggered a particularly strong
corporate and community
response in Australia. During six
days in September, an online
initiative by one donor raised more
than USD 28,000 for UNHCR’s

fundraising activities and attracted
new corporate partners to the
refugee cause, including Australia
Post, the Australian Football
League, the Australian Islamic
Museum and Telstra. Combined
with a direct marketing and online
emergency appeal, the campaign
raised close to USD 1 million for
the crisis in Europe.
España con ACNUR, UNHCR’s
national partner in Spain,
transferred USD 51.9 million to
UNHCR in 2015 and increased
its total number of donors to
over 350,000. Collaboration
was renewed with key corporate
donors such as the multinational
Spanish Banking Group BBVA,
which donated more than USD
329,000 to the refugee cause.
New partnerships were also
entered into with Inditex, a
Spanish multinational clothing
company, and El Corte Inglés, the
biggest department store group

in Europe. A partnership with the
Spanish supermarket chain Eroski,
which has close to 1,000 outlets
throughout the country, increased
awareness of the refugee cause
and raised more than USD 162,000
by selling Christmas cardboard
stars in all of its supermarkets.
In 2015, España con ACNUR also
worked with Atresmedia/LaSexta,
Spain’s leading TV and media
group, to raise awareness and funds
for UNHCR’s work in sub-Saharan
Africa. The campaign reached more
than 33 million people and was
seen or commented 145,000 times
in social media.
The Japan Association for UNHCR
contributions had increased
significantly during the last 15
years, raising USD 16.9 million
in 2015. Around 90 per cent of
all donations raised by UNHCR’s
national partner in Japan were
unrestricted and could be allocated
to any UNHCR programme, making
Japan’s donor base a reliable
source of funds for UNHCR’s
most underfunded programmes.

refugee children; and strengthen
capacity and partnerships with
ministries of education and
others, to enable more refugee
children to go to school.
UNHCR also mobilized matching
grants for this EAC programme
from new and existing partners.
A number of matching grants
were donated through UNHCR’s
national partners in Germany,
Japan, Spain and the United
States.

CELEBRITY SUPPORT

Celebrity support provided important
leverage to UNHCR's efforts to raise
awareness, press advocacy points, and
mobilize giving across the globe.

UNHCR/Jordi Matas

With displacement numbers nearing 64
million, the Syria crisis entering its sixth
year, and gaps in funding remaining
challenging, the voices of UNHCR's
goodwill ambassadors and high-profile
supporters were more important than
ever in 2015.

Syria in Chouf, Lebanon.

Advocacy and awarenessraising
Some of the ways in which UNHCR's
supporters brought their voices and
influence to bear in 2015 included:
Cate Blanchett moderating a panel on
global displacement at a high-profile
event in Delhi; Mika meeting displaced
families in Lebanon; Khaled Hosseini
highlighting innovative solutions for
refugees in Jordan; Yao Chen and Kristin
Davis celebrating the achievements of
Nansen Refugee Award laureates in
Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of
the Congo; Barbara Hendricks speaking
to government leaders at an ECOWAS
Conference on statelessness.

Goodwill Ambassadors and Supporters generated
1,598 pieces of media covereage in 2015
with an audience reach of over 2.1 billion

an estimated value of coverage of over $1.45 million

and a social media reach of over 357 million.

Spotlight on crises

Europe

Syria

In Europe, high-profile voices speaking
up for refugees included Douglas Booth
and David Morrissey, who travelled to
Lesvos; George Dalaras, Omar Sy and
Jesús Vázquez, who shared support
on their social media channels; Livia
Firth and Annie Lennox, who spoke
out on behalf of refugee and migrant
women at the Women on the Move
Awards in London; and a host of 34
French authors contributing to the book
Bienvenue, a collection of texts and
drawings of authors
and cartoonists on the
thematics of asylum
and exile with the
aim of promoting a
message of tolerance
and openness.

Through written and social media, film
and interviews, goodwill ambassadors
helped retain focus on the human
impact of displacement. The Syria crisis
remained a key focus of this activity.
Khaled Hosseini's mission to Jordan
resulted in a wealth of in-depth media
coverage across the globe including
on the BBC, El Mundo, La Repubblica
and The Huffington Post. When singersongwriter Mika travelled to his birthplace
Lebanon, new audiences came to
understand how war and persecution had
devastated the lives of young people,
including those targeted because of their
sexual orientation.
Also helping to bring the individual
stories of refugees closer to public
hearts and minds were Cate Blanchett,
Peter Capaldi, Alessandro Gassman and
Friederike Kempter, all of whom visited
countries neighbouring Syria which host
the majority of Syrian refugees. Others
such as Douglas Booth, Neil Gaiman
and David Morrissey gave strong social
media support for UNHCR's winterization
campaign.

Also, in an effort to
challenge xenophobia
and misconceptions
around the terms
“refugee” and
“migrant,” a group
of high-profile
supporters including Peter Capaldi,
Helena Christensen, Kristin Davis, Craig
Ferguson, Colin Firth, Neil Gaiman,
Barbara Hendricks, David Morrissey,
Patrick Stewart and Rokia Traoré,
recorded a short social media film which
reached nearly 150 million people and
triggered substantial media coverage on

a former refugee himself, was announced
as a regional goodwill ambassador in
Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya on World
Refugee Day. Through his appearances
at the Nansen Refugee Award, the Social
Good Summit, the Tokyo Film Festival
and at a conference organized by the

a travelling Mochila (backpack) campaign,
supported by a host of celebrities
including Juanes, Diego Luna and James
Rodríguez, drew attention to the needs of
refugee children across the Americas.

Global campaigns
World Refugee Day
Celebrity activity provided key support
for World Refugee Day. In the face of
increasingly polarized views about
refugees, goodwill ambassadors
encouraged the public to “get to know”
refugees better by exploring and sharing
their individual stories and finding points
of common experience. Among those
introducing refugees they had personally
met were Zaruhi Babayan, Cate
Blanchett, Kristin Davis, Neil Gaiman,
Emma Thompson, Jung Woo-sung and
Maher Zain, while social media activity
featured the voices of Fatima Bhutto,
Roberto Cavalli, Yao Chen, Luol Deng,
Juanes, Patrick Stewart, Forest Whitaker,

UNIQLO distributes 10 millionth item
of clothing to refugees with UNHCR
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
4 June 2015

KAMPALA, Uganda | The UN refugee
agency’s relationship with UNIQLO passed
a major milestone at a recent distribution
in Uganda, where staff handed out the
10-millionth piece of clothing donated
by the Japanese retail giant to refugees
worldwide.

“I think my children will be ecstatic,” said
Jonathan, a refugee and pastor from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. “These
clothes will keep them warm and protect
them [at night].”
Jonathan continues to carry out religious
work in Kampala, while his wife works
as a seamstress. Together, they bring in
just enough to pay the rent and feed their
family of eight, but there’s little left over for
anything else.
The UNIQLO donation will make a real
difference to the lives of many refugees,
who are struggling to make ends meet.
Many of the refugees at the clothes
distribution were parents and all agreed
on the importance of their children
wearing suitable clothing. “When they
see other kids wearing clothes that
don’t have holes or aren’t ripped, they
feel bad about themselves, they feel
inadequate,” explained Marion, also from

UNHCR/Jiro Ose

The event in Kampala will be followed by
further distributions in the coming weeks,
which will benefit more than 400,000
refugees across Uganda. In the capital,
refugees spoke of their joy at receiving
t-shirts, jumpers, trousers, coats and other
used clothes donated by customers in
UNIQLO stores in several countries.
Urban refugees receiving donated clothing collected by UNIQLO customers at
Old Kampala Primary School in Kampala, Uganda. Congolese refugees compare
items of clothing donated by UNIQLO, which has now distributed more than
10 million items of clothing through UNHCR.

the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
“Wearing the same clothes every day
brings dust and bacteria and the children
get sick,” she added, highlighting the link
between clothes and health.
UNIQLO has worked in partnership with
UNHCR for close to a decade, donating
clothing to refugees through the innovative
All-Product Recycling Initiative. Customers
are encouraged to bring in second-hand
clothes that are in good condition and
these are donated to refugees.
The company has, since 2006, donated
more than 10 million items of clothing
to forcibly displaced men, women and
children in more than 37 countries, as well
as providing millions of dollars in financial
contributions. 

10-Point Plan of Action

Asylum

BID (best interest determination)

An action plan which seeks
to assist States in ensuring
that refugee protection
needs are recognized and
appropriately addressed
in situations of mixed
migration. The Plan sets
out ten areas in which
UNHCR has an interest and
a potential role to play in
partnership with other key
actors. The Plan is especially
relevant to situations where
refugees are at risk of
refoulement or hazardous
onward movements.

The granting by a State
of protection on its
territory to individuals
from another State who
are fleeing persecution or
serious danger. Asylum
encompasses a variety of
elements, including nonrefoulement, permission to
remain on the territory of the
asylum country and humane
standards of treatment.

Formal process with strict
procedural safeguards
designed to determine
the child’s best interests
for particularly important
protection decisions
affecting the child.

Agenda for Protection
A declaration and
programme of action,
agreed by UNHCR and
States as part of the
Global Consultations on
International Protection,
including six goals to
improve the protection
of refugees and asylumseekers around the world.
The Agenda was endorsed
in October 2002 by the
Executive Committee
and welcomed by the UN
General Assembly.

Amicus curiae
Latin for “friend of the court.”
A person or group who is/
are not a party to a particular
litigation but permitted by
the court to advise it in
respect to some matter of
law that directly affects the
case in question.

AU Convention for the
Protection and Assistance
of Internally Displaced
Persons in Africa (Kampala
Convention)

This African Union
Convention was adopted
in 2009 and entered into
force on 6 December
2012. It is the first legallybinding instrument on
internal displacement with
a continent-wide scope. It
provides a comprehensive
regional framework setting
out provisions for the
protection and assistance of
IDPs. The Convention also
looks at the root causes of
displacement and at ways
to prevent it.

BIA (best interest assessment)
Assessment made by staff
regarding the individual
protection needs of
displaced children to ensure
that care programmes give
primary consideration to the
child’s best interests.

Asylum-seeker

An individual who is seeking international
protection. In countries with individualized
procedures, an asylum-seeker is someone
whose claim has not yet been finally decided on
by the country in which the claim is submitted.
Not every asylum-seeker will ultimately be
recognized as a refugee, but every refugee was
initially an asylum-seeker.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Brazil Plan of Action:
End 2014, the governments
of Latin America and the
Caribbean met in Brasilia to
mark the 30th anniversary of
the Cartagena Declaration
on Refugees of 1984. At
the end of the Ministerial
Meeting, 28 countries and
three territories in Latin
America and the Caribbean
adopted by acclamation
the Declaration and Plan of
Action of Brasilia, agreeing
to work together to maintain
the highest standards
of protection at the
international and regional
level, implement innovative
solutions for refugees and
displaced persons, and end
the difficult situation faced
by the stateless persons in
the region.

Cartagena Declaration on
Refugees
A Declaration adopted by
a colloquium of experts
from the Americas in
November 1984. The
Declaration enlarges the
1951 Convention definition
of a refugee to include
“persons who have fled their

country because their lives,
safety or freedom have been
threatened by generalized
violence, foreign aggression,
internal conflicts, massive
violation of human rights or
other circumstances which
have seriously disturbed
public order.”
While the Declaration is
not a treaty, its provisions
are respected across
Central America. This
refugee definition has
been incorporated in the
legislation of most of the
countries of the Americas.

Cessation clauses
Legal provisions that set
out the conditions under
which refugee status comes
to an end because it is no
longer needed or justified.
Cessation clauses are found
in Article 1 (C) of the 1951
Convention and in Article I
(4) of the 1969 OAU Refugee
Convention.

glossary
s a r y
Children

Individuals who are below the legal age
of majority and are therefore not legally
independent. This term includes adolescents.
Under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, a “child” is a person who is below the
age of 18, unless the applicable law sets a
lower age.

Cluster leadership
approach

Community-based
approach

The Cluster leadership
approach is part of the
overall UN-led humanitarian
reform process initiated in
2005 aimed at improving
the effectiveness of
humanitarian response
through improving
the predictability
and accountability of
humanitarian actions. It was
adopted by the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee as
a mechanism that would
address identified gaps
in response and enhance
the quality of humanitarian
actions by strengthening
partnerships between UN
agencies, the Red Cross
movement, international
organizations and NGOs.
UNHCR has been
designated the cluster
lead for protection,
emergency shelter, and
camp coordination and
management in situations
of conflict-related internal
displacement.

An inclusive partnership
strategy that recognizes
and builds on the capacities
and resources of people
of concern, by promoting
participation in programme
activities.

Common Humanitarian
Pipeline
The Common Pipeline is a
logistics solution designed
for efficient response to
large-scale humanitarian
needs. In addition to
providing economies of
scale, a single pipeline
provides uniformity in
the items provided to all
beneficiaries and assists in
the identification of gaps in
humanitarian assistance and
coordination of response. It
was first launched in 2004,
during the Darfur crisis.

Complementary protection
Formal permission to reside
in a country, extended by a
country under national law
or practice, to individuals
who are in need of
international protection even
though they do not qualify
for 1951 Convention refugee
status.

Comprehensive solutions
strategies
Strategies whereby UNHCR
engages with concerned
parties (including authorities
in countries of asylum, origin
and affected refugees
themselves) with the aim of
enhancing solutions
opportunities by applying a
combination of durable
solutions. These strategies
have included support for
voluntary repatriation; the
strategic use of resettlement;
increased opportunities for
local integration; support to
refugee-hosting
communities by UNHCR,
development partners and
bilateral donors; as well as
maximized opportunities for
greater mobility as a
pathway to solutions.

Convention on
the Reduction
of Statelessness
(1961 Convention)

A treaty that provides for
the acquisition of nationality
by those who would
otherwise be stateless and
who have an appropriate
link with the State, through
birth on the territory or
through descent from a
national.
The Convention also
provides for the retention
of nationality by those who
would become stateless
if they were to lose their
nationality to that State.
UNHCR has been mandated
with specific functions under
Article 11 of this Convention.

Convention refugees
Individuals recognized
as refugees by States,
under the eligibility criteria
in Article 1 of the 1951
Convention, and who are
entitled to the enjoyment of
a variety of rights under that
treaty.

Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees
(1951 Convention)

This treaty establishes the
most widely applicable
framework for the protection
of refugees. The Convention
was adopted in July 1951
and entered into force in
April 1954. Article 1 of the
Convention limits its scope
to “events occurring before
1 January 1951” but this
restriction was removed by
the 1967 Protocol relating to
the Status of Refugees.

Convention relating
to the Status
of Stateless Persons
(1954 Convention)

A Convention that provides
the definition of a stateless
person and establishes
a framework by which a
stateless person, who is
lawfully resident in a State,
can have legal status. The
Convention was adopted
in September 1954 and
entered into force in June
1960.

Earmarking

(also known as One UN)

A donor restriction that limits
or directs the purpose for
which a contribution may be
used.

A mechanism designed
to improve the United
Nations’ ability to
implement development,
humanitarian assistance and
environmental activities.
The framework is based
on a unified and coherent
UN structure at the country
level with one leader, one
programme, one budget
and, where appropriate,
one office. Achievements
are measured by resultsbased management and
accountability standards.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

No limitations on the use of
funds.
Regional/subregional
earmarking

A collection of data about
displaced populations
broken down into groups
according to age/sex/
diversity criteria and
location.

Broadly earmarked
contributions towards
a region (e.g. Africa) or
subregion (e.g. West
Africa) and towards
Headquarters or Global
Programmes. Broadly
earmarked contributions for
supplementary programmes
that cover more than one
country, i.e. at subregional or
regional level for a specific
situation (e.g. Somalia
situation).

Dublin II Regulation

Thematic earmarking

A European Council
Regulation, effective
from 1 September 2003,
which provides the legal
basis for establishing the
criteria and mechanism
for determining the State
responsible for examining
an asylum application in
one of the Member States
of the European Union
(excluding Denmark), as well
as in Iceland, Liechtenstein,
Norway and Switzerland.

Contributions that are
earmarked for a specific
theme at the subregional
level or higher. Aligned with
the key themes identified
in the Global Strategic
Priorities: protection policy;
registration, profiling and
documentation; security
from sexual and genderbased violence; child
protection; basic health care;
education; livelihoods; and
durable solutions.

Durable solutions

Country earmarking

Any means by which
the situation of refugees
can be satisfactorily and
permanently resolved,
enabling refugees to resume
a normal life. Traditionally,
UNHCR pursues the
three durable solutions
of voluntary repatriation,
local integration, and
resettlement.

Contributions that are
earmarked for a specific
country without any
further limitations. Broadly
earmarked contributions for
supplementary programmes
that cover only one country.

Disaggregated data

Unrestricted contributions

Sector earmarking

Contributions that are
earmarked at the country,
regional or global levels
for specific sectors and/
or activities. All in-kind
contributions and staffrelated contributions,
including JPOs, consultants
and secondees fall under
this category.

Exclusion clauses
Legal provisions that deny
the benefits of international
protection to people who
would otherwise satisfy the
criteria for refugee status.
In the 1951 Convention,
the exclusion clauses are
found in Articles 1D, 1E and
1F. These clauses apply to
the following categories:
• individuals who are
receiving protection or
assistance from United
Nations agencies other than
UNHCR;
• individuals who possess
the rights and obligations
attached to the possession
of nationality of their country
of residence;
• individuals in respect of
whom there are serious
reasons for considering that
they have committed a crime
against peace, a war crime,
a crime against humanity, a
serious non-political crime,
or acts contrary to the
purposes and principles of
the United Nations.

Executive Committee
of the High Commissioner’s
Programme (ExCom)
The Committee charged
with approving UNHCR’s
assistance programmes,
advising the High
Commissioner on the
exercise of his/her
functions and overseeing
the Office’s finances
and administration.
ExCom is composed of
representatives of 98
States with a demonstrated
interest in refugee issues
(2015)

Facilitated voluntary
repatriation
Even when conditions in
the country of origin are too
difficult or dangerous for
the majority of refugees to
return, UNHCR can assist
(“facilitate”) the repatriation
of any refugee who makes
an informed and voluntary
decision to return, and
requests such assistance.

Final budget
The budget adopted by
the Executive Committee,
adjusted with allocations
from the Operational
and the NAM Reserves,
carry-over amounts,
transfers, allocations and
supplementary budgetary
appropriations.

First country of asylum
concept
An asylum-seeker may
be refused access to
the asylum procedure in
the country where the
application has been made
if the applicant has already
found protection as a
refugee in another country
(i.e. where international
protection has been made
available and is accessible
to the applicant).

Focus
UNHCR’s results-based
software used to support
the planning, managing and
monitoring of its operations.

Gender-related
persecution
Persecution that targets
or disproportionately
affects a particular gender.
Under certain factual
circumstances, genderrelated persecution may
come within the refugee
definition.

Internally displaced person (IDP)

An individual who has been forced or obliged
to flee from his home or place of habitual
residence, “…in particular as a result of or in
order to avoid the effects of armed conflicts,
situations of generalized violence, violations of
human rights or natural or human-made
disasters, and who have not crossed an
internationally recognized State border”
(according to the Guiding Principles on Internal
Displacement).

Graduation approach
The graduation approach
is a poverty-reduction
model that aims to
“graduate” people out
of poverty through a
sequenced combination
of interventions. The
approach is part of
UNHCR’s Global Strategy
for Livelihoods 2014-2018.

Group-based protection
responses
Approaches whereby the
protection and assistance
needs of refugees are
met without previously
determining their status on
an individual basis.
Appropriate where
asylum-seekers arrive en
masse and individualized
procedures are neither
feasible nor necessary (the
cause of flight often being
self-evident).
The two main approaches
are recognition of refugee
status on a prima facie
basis and temporary
protection.

Humanitarian programme
cycle (HPC)
The humanitarian
programme cycle is a
coordinated series of actions
undertaken to help prepare
for, manage and deliver an
inter-agency humanitarian
response. This approach
was agreed upon by IASC
Principals as part of the
Transformative Agenda.

Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (IASC)
The IASC is the primary
mechanism for interagency coordination of
humanitarian assistance.

Implementing partner
Any organization or agency
to which UNHCR delegates
responsibility for the
implementation of material
assistance and provides
funds for this purpose
through a standard project
agreement.

International protection
All actions aimed at
ensuring the equal access
to and enjoyment of the
rights of women, men,
girls and boys of concern
to UNHCR, in accordance
with the relevant bodies of
law (including international
humanitarian, human rights
and refugee law).
International Public Sector
Accounting Standards
(IPSAS)
International accounting
standards for public sector
entities adopted by the
UN system as per General
Assembly resolution
(A/RES/60/283 (IV) 1), and
applied by UNHCR since
January 2012.

Junior Professional
Officer (JPO)
Government-sponsored
young professional working
for UNHCR.

Groups with specific needs

Individuals, families or groups requiring additional support in order to
enable them to overcome the challenges they face in accessing and
enjoying their rights.

UNHCR Global Report 2015

Kampala Convention
See AU Convention.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex
(LGBTI) individuals
Individuals who may be
subject to serious human
rights abuses because
of their real or perceived
sexual orientation and
gender identity.

Level 3 emergency
UN agencies have their
own internal classification
of levels of emergency. In
the context of the IASC, a
Level 3 emergency would
typically be a suddenonset complex emergency
requiring the activation of a
UN system-wide response,
with agreed mechanisms,
tools and procedures.

Local integration
A durable solution to the
plight of refugees that
involves their permanent
settlement in the country in
which they sought asylum.

Malnutrition
Cellular imbalance between
the supply of nutrients and
energy and the body’s
demand for them to ensure
growth, maintenance, and
specific functions.
It is a general term for
the medical condition that
is caused by improper or
insufficient nutrition, which
is not adequate to maintain
good health.
The adverse effects of
malnutrition include both
physical and developmental
manifestations.

Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM)

is a measurement of the
nutritional status of a
population (often used
in protracted refugee
situations). It is one of
the basic indicators for
assessing the severity of
a humanitarian crisis. To
evaluate levels of GAM,
the weight and height of
children between 6 and
59 months are measured,
and used as a proxy for the
health of the population as
a whole.
Severe Acute Malnutrition

• Kwashiorkor
Malnutrition brought on by
a protein deficiency which
causes fluids to drain from
the blood into the stomach,
causing swelling.
• Marasmus

Resulting from a general
lack of calories, causing
extreme emaciation with a
loss of muscle and fat tissue.
It is considered a medical
emergency and, untreated,
will most often result in
death.

Management Systems
Renewal Project (MSRP)
UNHCR’s electronic systems
for finance, supply chain,
human resources and
payroll.

Master Plan
A comprehensive settlement
plan that defines land use,
emphasizing its links to
the broader environment,
enabling both refugees and
host communities to benefit
from improved services and
infrastructure. This approach

Mandate refugees

Individuals who are recognized as refugees
by UNHCR acting under the authority of its
Statute and relevant UN General Assembly
resolutions. Mandate status is especially
significant in States that are not party to the
1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol.

192

UNHCR Global Report 2015

integrates the spatial, social,
cultural, environmental
and economic dynamics
of a particular location to
ensure all basic needs of
the affected population
are addressed within one
common vision.

Mexico Plan of Action
The Mexico Plan of Action,
launched in 2004, aims
to enhance international
refugee protection in
Latin America by further
developing international
refugee law, consolidating
protection networks and
improving the ability of
States to provide effective
protection to all people
in need. Its focus is on
providing durable solutions
for urban refugees, in
particular self-reliance; the
special needs of refugee
women; the Colombian
conflict and its impact, as
well as solutions at border
areas; and the use of
resettlement opportunities in
the region.

New or Additional
Activities — Mandaterelated (NAM) Reserve
Established to facilitate the
acceptance of additional
funding from donors for
activities consistent with
the mandate and capacity
of UNHCR and the broad
objectives of a country
operation, but for which no
express budgetary provision
has been made.

Mixed migratory flows
Movements of people
from one country and/
or continent to another
which may include both
people who are in need of
international protection and
others who are not.
Mixed flows are likely
when a country of origin
is simultaneously affected
by human rights violations,
economic decline and an
absence of opportunities
of livelihood. Such flows
of people, involving both
refugees and migrants, are
commonly referred to as
“mixed movements”.

Modified-cash basis
Modified-cash basis is an
accounting method that
combines elements of
the two major accounting
methods, the cash method
and the accrual method. The
cash method recognizes
income when it is received
and expenses when they
are paid for, whereas the
accrual method recognizes
income when it is earned (for
example, when the terms of
a contract are fulfilled) and
expenses when they are
incurred. The modified-cash
basis method uses accruals
for long-term balance sheet
elements and the cash basis
for short-term ones.
UNHCR currently prepares
its budget under the cash
basis, and will use the
modified-cash basis to
compare actual amounts to
budget amounts as required
by IPSAS 24.

OAU Convention Governing the
Specific Aspects of Refugee
Problems in Africa

This regional complement
to the 1951 Convention
provides for a broader
refugee definition. Adopted
in 1969, the OAU Convention
stipulates that the term
“refugee” also “applies to
those fleeing from external
aggression, occupation,
foreign domination or events
seriously disturbing public
order in either part or whole
of the country of origin.”

Operational partner
Any organization or
agency with which UNHCR
collaborates to provide
protection and assistance
for refugees, or other people
of concern to UNHCR, but
which does not receive
funds from UNHCR to
implement activities on its
behalf.

Participatory assessment
A process of building
partnerships with women
and men of concern - of
all ages and backgrounds
- through systematic,
structured dialogue on
issues that they identify as
important.

Prima facie refugees

Individuals who are recognized as refugees,
by a State or UNHCR, on the basis of objective
criteria related to the circumstances in their
country of origin, justifying a presumption that
they meet the criteria of the applicable refugee
definition.
See also Group-based protection responses.

Person of concern to
UNHCR
A person whose protection
and assistance needs are
of interest to UNHCR. This
includes refugees, asylumseekers, stateless people,
internally displaced people
and returnees.

Principles of Partnership
UNHCR endorsed the Global
Humanitarian Platform's
Principles of Partnership in
July 2007. These principles
set out common standards
of equality, transparency,
complementarity and a
results-oriented approach
among all humanitarian
groups.

ProCap
Mechanism to enhance the
UN protection response
through the provision of
trained protection officers for
short-term field assignments.

Programme support
The costs of organizational
units, whose primary
functions are the
formulation, development,
delivery and evaluation of
UNHCR programmes.

Promoted voluntary
repatriation
Voluntary repatriation
encouraged and
organized by UNHCR,
when conditions are
considered conducive
for the safe and dignified
return of refugees.

Protection
All activities aimed at
obtaining full respect for
the rights of the individual,
in accordance with the
letter and the spirit of the
relevant bodies of law
(i.e. international human
rights law, international
humanitarian law and
refugee law).
Protection,
monitoring and
coordination
In financial reports, the
cost of UNHCR’s
presence at operating
locations (i.e. the direct
cost of providing
international protection to
refugee populations). This
differs from the “Legal
assistance” sector, which
refers to the cost of
specific projects and/or
materials. Refugee status
determination (RSD)
Legal and administrative
procedures undertaken
by States and/or UNHCR
to determine whether
an individual should be
recognized as a refugee in
accordance with national
and international law.

Refugee
A refugee is any person who,
“…owing to well founded fear of being persecuted
for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership
of a particular social group or political opinion, is
outside the country of his [or her] nationality and is
unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail
him [or her]self of the protection of that country; or
who, not having a nationality and being outside the
country of his [or her] former habitual residence as a
result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear,
is unwilling to return to it.”
Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention

or

who is outside his/her country of origin or habitual
residence and is unable to return there because of
serious and indiscriminate threats to life, physical
integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence
or events seriously disturbing public order.
OAU Convention and Cartagena Declaration

Refugee-like situation

The category of people in a refugee-like
situation is descriptive in nature and includes
groups of people who are outside their country
of origin and who face protection risks similar
to those of refugees, but for whom refugee
status has, for practical or other reasons, not
been ascertained.

Refugee coordination
model (RCM)
In line with the High
Commissioner’s mandate,
the RCM outlines UNHCR’s
role and responsibilities
and re-articulates and
standardises UNHCR’s
responsibility to lead and
coordinate international
actions relating to refugees
with all partners engaged
in the response through an
inter-agency platform and
under the overall leadership
of the host government.

The removal of a person to a territory where
he/she would be at risk of being persecuted, or
being moved to another territory where he/she
would face persecution. Under international
refugee law and customary international law,
refoulement is permitted only in exceptional
circumstances.

Results-based management
(RBM)

A management approach
that emphasizes the
achievement of results
as the essential task of
management.

Registration Levels

Returnee

Registration can be
carried out in different
manners, depending on the
operational circumstances
and data requirements.
Level-1 Registration, often
referred to as “household
registration”, gathers only
elementary information from
persons of concern for the
purpose of establishing a
basic distribution system
or to provide demographic
estimates. In Level-2
Registration, limited
personal data is collected
from each individual, for
basic planning, monitoring
and protection activities.
Level-3 Registration
represents the most
comprehensive recording
of detailed personal data of
persons of concern, which is
required for individual case
management and delivery of
durable solutions.

An individual who
was of concern
to UNHCR when
outside his/her
country of origin and
who remains so,
for a limited period
(usually two years),
after returning to the
country of origin. The
term also applies to
internally displaced
people who return to
their previous place
of residence.

Reintegration
A process which enables
returnees to regain their
physical, social, legal and
material security needed to
maintain life, livelihood and
dignity and which eventually
leads to the disappearance
of any observable
distinctions vis-à-vis their
compatriots.

Resettlement
Refoulement

durable solution as well as
a tool for the protection of
refugees. It is also a practical
example of international
burden-and responsibilitysharing.

The transfer of refugees
from the country in which
they have sought asylum
to another State that has
agreed to admit them. The
refugees will usually be
granted asylum or some
other form of long-term
resident rights and, in
many cases, will have the
opportunity to become
naturalized citizens. For this
reason, resettlement is a

Rights groups

Rights groups are
thematic groupings
of objectives with a
similar theme used
for planning and
budgeting. There
are nine rights
groups for different
areas of protection,
assistance, external
relations and
operations support,
for example, the
objectives for shelter,
water and sanitation
services are all
grouped under the
rights group “basic
needs and essential
services”.

Safe third country concept

Sphere Project

Transformative Agenda

An asylum-seeker may
be refused access to
the asylum procedure in
the country where the
application has been made
if responsibility for assessing
the asylum application
in substance is assumed
by a third country, where
the asylum-seeker will be
protected from refoulement
and will be able to seek and
enjoy asylum in accordance
with accepted international
standards.

The Sphere Project was
launched in 1997 by a group
of humanitarian NGOs and
the Red Cross and Red
Crescent movement. The
project has developed
several tools, such as
a handbook, in order
to improve the quality
of assistance provided
to people affected by
disasters, and to enhance
the accountability of the
humanitarian system in
disaster response.

Secondary movements

Subsidiary protection

The Transformative Agenda
of the IASC was adopted in
December 2011. It is a set
of concrete actions aimed
at transforming the way
in which the humanitarian
community responds to
emergencies. It focuses on
improving the timeliness
and effectiveness of the
collective response through
stronger leadership, more
effective coordination
structures, and improved
accountability for
performance and to affected
people.

The notion refers to asylumseekers and refugees
moving independently from
their first host country to
another country in search of
protection and solutions.

Beneficiaries of subsidiary
protection are persons
who have been found not
to meet the Convention
definition of a refugee
but who face a real risk
of serious harm. This
includes the death penalty
or execution, torture or
inhuman or degrading
treatment, or a serious and
individual threat to their
life or person by reason of
indiscriminate violence in
situations of armed conflict.

Seeds for Solutions
A UNHCR initiative to
help ensure investment in
solutions to displacement
whenever opportunities
arise, even when
humanitarian emergencies
are placing heavy
financial demands on the
organization.

Temporary protection

Acts that inflict physical,
mental or sexual harm or
suffering, threats of such
acts, coercion or arbitrary
deprivation of liberty, that
target individuals or groups
of individuals on the basis of
their gender.

An arrangement or device
developed by States to offer
protection, of a temporary
nature, to people arriving
en masse from situations
of conflict or generalized
violence, without
prior individual status
determination. Temporary
protection has been mostly
used in industrialized States.

Self-reliance

Trafficking (human)

In the refugee context, the
ability of an asylum-seeker
or refugee to provide for his/
her own living needs, and
those of his/her dependants.

The organized illegal
movement of people for
profit. The critical additional
factor that distinguishes
trafficking from migrant
smuggling is the use of
force, coercion and/or
deception throughout,
or at some stage in the
process. While the additional
elements that distinguish
trafficking from migrant
smuggling may sometimes
be obvious, in many cases
they are difficult to prove
without active investigation.

Sexual and gender-based
violence (SGBV)

Stateless person

An individual who is
not considered as a
national by any State
under the operation
of its law, including
a person whose
nationality is not
established.

Transitional Solutions
Initiative (TSI)
The TSI promotes
collaboration between
humanitarian and
development actors and
national governments in
order to find solutions and
self-reliance for displaced
people and local community
members.

Unaccompanied and
separated children (UASC)

Children who are not
in the company of
parents or another
adult caregiver
in a situation of
displacement.
UN security-level system
The UN security-level
system (SLS) is designed
to describe the security
environment that exists in an
area or location where the
United Nations operates.

1 - Minimal;
2 - Low;
3 - Moderate;
4 - Substantial;
5 - High;
6 - Extreme.
As the level changes, there
are specific actions required
within the UN Security
Management system.

United Nations Volunteers
(UNV)

The volunteer arm of the
United Nations which serves
as an operational partner in
development cooperation
and humanitarian aid at
the request of UN member
States. It deploys qualified
volunteers to different UN
organizations.

UN Secretary-General’s
Policy Committee Decision
on Durable Solutions
This decision establishes
priorities and responsibilities
in supporting the sustainable
reintegration of returning
refugees and internally
displaced persons in the
aftermath of conflict.

Voluntary repatriation
Return to the country
of origin based on the
refugee’s free and informed
decision. Voluntary
repatriation is one of the
three durable solutions
and may be “organized”
(under the auspices of the
concerned governments
and/or UNHCR) or
“spontaneous” (the refugees
return by their own means
without the involvement of
UNHCR and governments).
See also “facilitated” and
“promoted” voluntary
repatriation.

A security level is
determined using
a structured threat
assessment, which evaluates
five categories: armed
conflict, terrorism, crime,
civil unrest and hazards.
Following this evaluation, a
security level is determined
which is as:
