Key messages
The global mean temperature in 2022 was 1.15 [1.02–1.28] °C above the 1850–1900
average. The years 2015 to 2022 were the eight warmest in the 173-year instrumental
record. The year 2022 was the fifth or sixth warmest year on record, despite ongoing
La Niña conditions.
The year 2022 marked the third consecutive year of La Niña conditions, a duration which
has only occurred three times in the past 50 years.
Concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide,
methane and nitrous oxide – reached record highs in 2021, the latest year
for which consolidated global values are available (1984–2021). The annual
increase in methane concentration from 2020 to 2021 was the highest
on record. Real-time data from specific locations show that levels of the
three greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2022.
Around 90% of the energy trapped in the climate system
by greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. Ocean heat content,
which measures this gain in energy, reached a new observed
record high in 2022.
Despite continuing La Niña conditions, 58% of the ocean
surface experienced at least one marine heatwave during 2022.
In contrast, only 25% of the ocean surface experienced a marine
cold spell.
Global mean sea level continued to rise in 2022, reaching
a new record high for the satellite altimeter record (1993–2022).
The rate of global mean sea level rise has doubled between
the first decade of the satellite record (1993–2002, 2.27 mm
per year) and the last (2013–2022, 4.62 mm per year).
In the hydrological year 2021/2022, a set of reference glaciers
with long-term observations experienced an average mass
balance of −1.18 metres water equivalent (m w.e.). This loss
is much larger than the average over the last decade. Six of
the ten most negative mass balance years on record (1950–
2022) occurred since 2015. The cumulative mass balance
since 1970 amounts to more than −26 m w.e.
In East Africa, rainfall has been below average in five consecutive
wet seasons, the longest such sequence in 40 years. As of August
2022, an estimated 37 million people faced acute food insecurity
across the region, under the effects of the drought and other
shocks.
Record-breaking rain in July and August led to extensive flooding
in Pakistan. There were at least 1 700 deaths, and 33 million people
were affected, while almost 8 million people were displaced. Total
damage and economic losses were assessed at US$ 30 billion.
Record-breaking heatwaves affected China and Europe during the summer.
In some areas, extreme heat was coupled with exceptionally dry conditions.
Excess deaths associated with the heat in Europe exceeded 15 000 in total
across Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Portugal.

Foreword
This report shows that, once again, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
continue to reach record levels – contributing
to warming of the land and ocean, melting of
ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels, and
warming and acidifying of oceans. There are
major gaps in the weather and climate observing
networks, especially in the least developed
countries (LDCs) and small island developing
States (SIDS), which is an obstacle for climate
baseline monitoring, especially at regional and
national scales, and for the provision of early
warning and adequate climate services. WMO
works with its members and partners to improve
climate observations through the Global Climate
Observing System (GCOS) and by ensuring
adequate financial mechanisms for weather and
climate observations through the Systematic
Observations Financing Facility (SOFF).
While emissions continue to rise and the climate continues to change, vulnerable populations
continue to be gravely impacted by extreme weather and climate events. For example, in 2022,
continuing drought in East Africa, record-breaking rainfall in Pakistan and record-breaking
heatwaves in China and Europe affected tens of millions, drove food insecurity, led to mass
migration, and cost billions of dollars in loss and damage. However, collaboration amongst
United Nations agencies has proven to be very effective in addressing humanitarian impacts
induced by extreme weather and climate events, especially in reducing associated mortality
and economic losses.
The United Nations Early Warnings for All Initiative, spearheaded by WMO, aims to fill the
existing capacity gap to ensure that every person on Earth is covered by early warning
services. Achieving this ambitious task requires sound observations and regular updates on
key climate indicators, as provided in this report.
WMO is also preparing a new scheme for monitoring the sinks and sources of the main
greenhouse gases based on modelling and on ground-based and satellite measurements.
The scheme will enable better understanding of the uncertainties related to the strength of
carbon sinks and sources associated with land use, as well as those related to the sources
of methane.
I take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the experts and lead author, who jointly
compiled this report using physical data analyses and impact assessments, and to thank all the
contributors, particularly WMO Member National Meteorological and Hydrological Services
and Regional Climate Centres and United Nations agencies, for their collaboration and input.

Global climate indicators
The global climate indicators provide an overview of changes in the climate system.1 The set
of interlinked physical indicators presented here connect the changing composition of the
atmosphere with changes in energy in the climate system and the response of land, ocean and ice.
The global indicators are based on a wide range of data sets which comprise data from
multiple observing systems including satellites and in situ networks (for details on data sets
used in the report, see Data sets and methods).
The present report makes numerous references to the Working Group I contribution to the
IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 2 (hereinafter referred to as IPCC AR6 WG I) and the IPCC
Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. 3

BASELINES
Baselines are periods of time, usually spanning three decades or more, that are used as a
fixed benchmark against which current conditions can be compared. For scientific, policy
and practical reasons, a number of different baselines are used in this report, and these are
specified in the text and figures. Where possible, the most recent WMO climatological standard
normal, 1991–2020, is used for consistent reporting. This is the first year that the new normal,
1991–2020, has been used, and differences are described in Updating the climatological
normal to 1991–2020.
For some indicators, however, it is not possible to use the standard normal owing to a lack
of measurements during the early part of the period. For others – precipitation, for example
– a longer period is required to calculate representative statistics. There are also two specific
exceptions. First, for the global mean temperature time series – and only for the global mean
series – a reference period of 1850–1900 is used. This is the baseline used in IPCC AR6 WG I as
a reference period for pre-industrial conditions and is relevant for understanding progress in
the context of the Paris Agreement. Second, greenhouse gas concentrations can be estimated
much further back in time using gas bubbles trapped in ice cores. Therefore, the year 1750 is
used in this report to represent pre-industrial greenhouse gas concentrations.

GREENHOUSE GASES
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance between emissions from
human activities, natural sources and sinks. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere due to human activities have been the major driver of climate change since at
least the industrial revolution. Global average mole fractions of greenhouse gases – referred
to here for simplicity as the “concentration” in the atmosphere – are calculated from in situ
observations made at multiple sites through the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme
of WMO and partner networks.

In 2021 – the latest year for which consolidated global figures are available – atmospheric
levels of greenhouse gases reached new highs (Figure 1), with globally averaged surface
mole fractions for carbon dioxide (CO2) at 415.7 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4)
at 1908 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 334.5 ± 0.1 ppb, respectively 149%,
262% and 124% of pre-industrial (1750) levels. Real-time data from specific locations, including
Mauna Loa4 (Hawaii, United States of America) and Kennaook/Cape Grim5 (Tasmania, Australia)
indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to increase in 2022.
The increase in CO2 from 2020 to 2021 was equal to that observed from 2019 to 2020, but
higher than the average annual growth rate over the last decade. While the long-term increase
in CO2 is due to human emissions, year-to-year variations in the rate are largely associated
with natural variability in the land and ocean carbon sinks. The record annual increase in 2016
was associated with the strong 2015/2016 El Niño.6
The annual increase in CH4 from 2020 to 2021 was 18 ppb. This is the largest annual increase
on record, and its causes are still being investigated. Measurements of the atmospheric
CH4 burden and its stable carbon isotope ratio 13C/12C suggest that the largest contribution
to the renewed increase in CH4 since 2007 stems from microbial/biogenic sources, but the

relative roles of anthropogenic and natural sources are as yet unclear.7,8 Improving observation
networks in climate sensitive areas like tropical wetlands and the Arctic is a way to improve
understanding of the processes that drive changes in GHGs. This knowledge could then be
used to support efficient mitigation strategies.

TEMPERATURE
In 2022, the global mean temperature, which combines near-surface temperature measurements
over land and ocean, was 1.15 [1.02–1.28] °C above the 1850–1900 pre-industrial average
(Figure 2). The six data sets used in the analysis place 2022 as either the fifth or sixth warmest
year on record (1850–2022). Differences between the data sets and hence in their rankings
arise from differences in method and inaccuracies in the input data, and because some areas
of the Earth remain sparsely observed. The years 2015 to 2022 are the eight warmest years
on record in all data sets (for details see Data sets and methods).
La Niña conditions continued into a third year, having started in late 2020 (see Short-term
climate drivers). La Niña is typically associated with a temporary reduction in global mean
temperature, and both 2021 and 2022 were less warm than 2019 and 2020 due to the shift
to La Niña conditions. Nonetheless, 2021 and 2022 were warmer than 2011 (when the global
mean was 0.87 [0.74–0.99] °C above the 1850–1900 average), the last year to be affected by
a significant La Niña event, and indeed warmer than any year prior to 2015. In most of the data
sets, 2016, which was associated with an exceptionally strong El Niño, remains the warmest
year on record globally (with a global mean 1.28 [1.15–1.40] °C above the 1850–1900 average).

differences between 2022 and the
1991–2020 average. The map shows the
median anomaly calculated from six data
sets. For details on the data sets and
processing, see Data sets and methods.

In the IPCC AR6 WG I report, long-term warming was assessed using multi-year averages.9
For the decade 2011–2020, the average temperature was estimated to be 1.09 [0.95–1.20] °C
above the 1850–1900 average. The 10-year average for the period 2013–2022 based on the
data sets used here is estimated to be 1.14 [1.02–1.27] °C, indicating continued warming.
Over land (Figure 3), record high annual temperatures were reported in Western Europe (where
a number of countries had their warmest year on record, including the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Italy, Germany and Switzerland), the western Mediterranean, parts of Central and Eastern
Asia, and New Zealand. Over the ocean, record warmth extended across wide areas of the
North and South Pacific as well as areas of the Southern Ocean.
No areas experienced record-low annual temperatures in 2022 (Figure 3). Conditions were
colder than the 1991–2020 average in Canada, parts of Southern and Northern Africa, parts of
Australia (New South Wales had its coolest year since 1996) and parts of South America. La
Niña is associated with a “cold tongue” of cooler-than-average surface waters in the central
and eastern equatorial Pacific, which is typically surrounded by areas of warmer-than-average
waters running from the North Pacific, along the western rim and down into the South-west
Pacific. In 2022, record warmth was measured over large areas of the North and South-west
Pacific.

OCEAN
Covering around 70% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean is an important part of the climate system.
It absorbs both CO2 and heat, thus slowing the pace of global warming in the atmosphere. At
the same time, the resulting changes in chemistry and temperature have profound effects,
reducing the pH of the ocean, raising sea level, changing ocean currents, and affecting sea
life and biodiversity as well as the people who depend on the ocean for their livelihoods.10

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
Increasing human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases cause a positive radiative
imbalance at the top of the atmosphere leading to an accumulation of energy in the form of
heat in the Earth system that is driving global warming.11,12 Around 90% of the accumulated
heat is stored in the ocean, leading to ocean warming. Ocean heat content (OHC) is an indicator
that measures the accumulated heat. A positive energy imbalance signals that the climate is
still responding to the current forcing and that more warming will occur even if the forcing
does not increase further.13 In a recent report the IPCC concluded that “It is virtually certain
that the global upper ocean (0–700 m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that
human influence is the main driver.”14
The upper 2 000 m of the ocean continued to warm in 2022,15 and it is expected that it will
continue to warm in the future, causing changes that are irreversible on centennial to millennial
time scales.16,17 OHC in 2022 was the highest on record (Figure 4), exceeding the 2021 value

by 17 ± 9 ZJ18 . All data sets agree that ocean warming rates were particularly high in the
past two decades: the rate of ocean warming for 0–2 000 m was 0.7 ± 0.1 W m –2 from 1971 to
2022, but 1.2 ± 0.2 W m –2 from 2006 to 2022. Deep ocean warming below a depth of 2 000 m
is estimated to have been 0.0725 ± 0.1 W m –2 from 1992 to 2022.
Although global mean OHC has increased strongly, the rate of ocean warming has not been
the same everywhere.19 The strongest warming in the upper 2 000 m occurred in the Southern
Ocean, North Atlantic and South Atlantic, where warming locally exceeded 2 W m−2 (Figure 5).
The Southern Ocean is the largest reservoir of heat, accounting for around 36% of the global
OHC increase in the upper 2 000 m since 1958. This strong warming is associated with the
absorption of anthropogenic heat by the cold upwelling waters which is then exported to the
northern edge of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current by the background overturning circulation.
Some limited regions are losing heat and are cooling, including the subpolar Atlantic Ocean
extending from near the surface down to >800 m depth (also the only area to show centennial
cooling at the surface). The contrasting pattern of cooling (50°N–70°N) and warming (20°N–50°N)
in the North Atlantic is associated with a slowing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation and local interactions between the air and sea.

Ocean heat content is measured in zettajoules. A zettajoule is 10 21 joules, which is 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 joules.

SEA LEVEL
Global mean sea level (GMSL) continued to rise in 2022 (Figure 6). The GMSL rise is estimated
to be 3.4 ± 0.3 mm yr –1 over the 30 years of the satellite altimeter record (1993–2022), but the
rate has doubled between the first decade of the record (1993–2002) and the last (2013–2022),
during which the rate has exceeded 4 mm yr –1. The acceleration in GMSL is estimated to be
0.12 ± 0.05 mm yr –2 over the 30-year period. Sea level rise is not the same everywhere, with
the differences due in part to local changes in OHC (Figure 7).

Ocean warming, ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets, and changes in land water storage all
contribute to changes in sea level. The GMSL budget compares the sum of estimates of the
individual components to the total GMSL measured by satellites. If the sum of the estimates
matches the total GMSL, the budget is said to be “closed”. The budget has recently been
updated,20 and the GMSL budget can now be closed to the end of 2020 within data uncertainties
(Figure 8). For the period 2005–2019 where individual mass contributions can be estimated,
total land ice loss from glaciers, Greenland and Antarctica contributed 36% to the GMSL rise,
and ocean warming (through thermal expansion) contributed 55%. Variations in land water
storage contributed less than 10%.

MARINE HEATWAVES AND COLD SPELLS
As with heatwaves and cold spells on land, marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells
(MCSs) are prolonged periods of extreme heat or cold in the seas and oceans that can have
a range of consequences for marine life and dependent communities. 21 MHWs have become
more frequent over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries (Figure 9(d)), while
MCSs have become less frequent (Figure 10(d)). Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature
(SST) are used to monitor MHWs and MCSs globally, categorized here as moderate, strong,
severe or extreme (for definitions, see Data sets and methods).
Overall, 58% of the ocean surface experienced at least one MHW during 2022 (Figure 9(d))
– less than the record of 65% in 2016 and similar to 2021 (57%). In total, 25% of the ocean
surface experienced at least one MCS during 2022, similar to 2021 (25%) and much less than
the 1985 record (63%).

La Niña and associated lower-than-average SSTs mean that the equatorial Pacific was one
of the few ocean regions to see widespread strong MCSs in 2022 (Figure 10). The Southern
Ocean is, however, the only region in which there have been long-term increases in the
duration of MCSs, albeit over limited areas. 22 In the Arctic, the Laptev and Beaufort Seas
experienced severe and extreme MHWs from spring to autumn of 2022. The ice edges to the
north of Svalbard and to the east of the Ross Sea experienced notable extreme MHWs for
the second consecutive year.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
Between 1960 and 2021, the ocean absorbed around 25% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere, thereby helping to partially alleviate the impacts of climate
change. 23 However, the negative impacts on the ocean are high; CO2 reacts with seawater,
resulting in a decrease of pH referred to as ocean acidification. Ocean acidification threatens

organisms and ecosystem services. 24 As the acidity and temperature of the ocean increases,
its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere decreases, potentially impeding the ocean’s
role in moderating climate change. 25 The importance of ocean acidification is reflected in
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 14.3.1, 26 and global efforts are underway to
monitor ocean acidification.
The limited number of long-term observations in the open ocean have shown a decline in pH
(Figure 11, left), with a change in average global surface ocean pH of 0.017–0.027 pH units per
decade since the late 1980s. 27 The IPCC AR6 concluded that “There is very high confidence
that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26 [thousand years] and
current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time”.28 Observations of ocean
acidification from coastal areas present a more varied picture (Figure 11, right), due to the
complex interplay of factors such as freshwater influx, biological activity and anthropogenic
influences in coastal seas.

CRYOSPHERE
The cryosphere comprises the frozen parts of the Earth – glaciers and ice sheets, sea ice,
snow and permafrost. The inhospitable and often remote environments in which they form
mean that it has sometimes been challenging to undertake long-term measurements of these
phenomena.

SEA ICE
Arctic sea-ice extent in 2022 was below the 1991–2020 average for most of the year, with a
spring sea-ice monthly maximum of 14.59 million km2 in March 2022, 0.44 million km2 below the
long-term mean (Figure 12). The monthly minimum extent in September was 4.87 million km2,
0.71 million km2 lower than the long-term mean. The minimum ice extent was greater than
the average minimum values of the last decade (2012–2021) – consistent with a moderate
summer for Arctic sea-ice melt – but is still tied for the eleventh lowest monthly minimum ice
extent in the satellite record. The smallest daily extent of the year, 4.67 million km², occurred
on 18 September 2022 and tied for the tenth lowest annual minimum daily extent on record.29
Sea-ice extent in the Antarctic has seen both record highs (2014) and record lows (2017/2022)
in the past 10 years. Antarctic sea-ice extent dropped to 1.92 million km2 on 25 February 2022,
the lowest level on record and almost 1 million km2 below the long-term (1991–2020) mean. 30
The origins of the ice loss can be traced back to October/November 2021 when there was a
series of storms to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. This area is strongly influenced by the
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the storms are consistent with La Niña conditions

at the time. Southerly winds of up to 30 m s –1 moved sea ice away from the coast of West
Antarctica, creating a 1 million km2 area of open water known as a polynya. The exposed
ocean warmed rapidly in the summer sun, leading to further sea-ice loss.
Following the annual sea-ice extent minimum in February, the total extent of Antarctic sea
ice was continuously below the 30-year (1991–2020) mean up to the end of 2022, including
periods with record lows in June and July. The maximum annual Antarctic sea-ice extent in
October 2022 was 0.8 million km2 below the mean maximum extent.

GLACIERS
Glaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which then deforms and
flows downhill to lower, warmer altitudes, where it melts. Where glaciers end in a lake or the
ocean, ice loss also occurs through melting where the ice and water meet and via calving
when chunks of the glacier fall off.
In the hydrological year 2021/2022, the approximately 40 glaciers with long-term observations
monitored by the World Glacier Monitoring Service experienced an average mass balance
of −1.18 m water equivalent (m w.e.). 31 This loss is much larger than the average over the last
decade (Figure 13). The cumulative mass balance since 1970 amounts to over 26 m w.e. Strong
regional differences were observed; record glacier melting occurred in the European Alps
(see below), but there were some mass gains in Iceland and northern Norway associated with
higher-than-average precipitation and a relatively cool summer. Measurements on glaciers

reveal substantial glacier mass losses. The major glacier melt in most regions in 2022 is in
line with the long-term acceleration of glacier mass losses, with six of the ten most negative
mass balance years on record, including 2022, occurring since 2015.
In the European Alps, glacier mass loss records were broken by large margins in 2022.
Mass losses were far beyond the range of historical variability. 33 Average thickness changes
of 3 to over 4 metres were measured throughout the Alps, substantially more than in the
previous record year of 2003. In Switzerland, 6% of glacier ice volume was lost between
2021 and 2022 (Figure 14). There are three reasons for this extreme glacier melt. First, there
was very little winter snow, which meant that the ice was unprotected in early summer.
Second, dust from the Sahara blew over the Alps in March 2022. The dust darkened the
snow surface (reduced its albedo), which consequently absorbed more heat from the sun,
further accelerating snow melt. Third, heat waves between May and early September 2022
led to massive ice loss. Snow on the glaciers started melting about one month earlier than
usual and, for the first time in history, no snow survived the summer melt season even at the
very highest measurement sites and thus no accumulation of fresh ice occurred. Between
2001 and 2022 the volume of glacier ice in Switzerland has decreased from 77 km3 to 49 km3,
a decline of more than one third.
During the summer, the zero-degree line in the European Alps rose to over 5 000 metres above
sea level. A weather balloon ascent at Payerne in Switzerland recorded 0 °C at a height
of 5 184 m on 25 July, the highest in the 69-year record and only the second time that the height
of the zero-degree line had exceeded 5 000 m. 34 New record temperatures were reported at
the summit of Mont Blanc. Related to the heat, strong rockfall activity was observed, and an
ice avalanche and glacier detachment triggered by meltwater at Marmolada, Italy, claimed
the lives of 11 climbers.
33

While the longest records exceed 100 years, systematic long-term observations at a number of other glaciers started
in the 1950s.

Glaciers of Western North America experienced mass loss in 2022 in line with average mass
balances over the last two decades. However, there were unusually negative mass balances
in early autumn 2022 in this region (and in Greenland, see below), associated with high
temperatures in September and October. In south-western Canada, glaciers remained snow
free through these months and lost an additional ~0.6 m w.e. of ice, roughly doubling the net
annual mass loss from these glaciers for the hydrological year September 2021–August 2022
after the season had finished. This mass loss is not captured in typical field campaigns, which
survey changes at the end of the summer melt season, for example in early September.

ICE SHEETS
An ice sheet 35 is an area of ice on land that exceeds 50 000 km2. In the current climate there
are two ice sheets: the Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet. The total mass balance
(TMB) of an ice sheet is the sum of three components: the surface mass balance (SMB), the
marine mass balance (MMB) and the basal mass balance (BMB). The SMB is the difference
between snow accumulation and meltwater runoff from the ice sheet. The MMB is the mass
loss at the edge of the ice sheet from the calving of icebergs and the melting of ice that is in
contact with the ocean. BMB consists of melting at the ice sheet bed due to geothermal heat
and friction as the ice slides over the ground beneath it. A negative mass balance indicates
a loss of ice mass; a positive mass balance indicates a gain.
For the Greenland ice sheet, 36 the estimated TMB in the 2022 mass balance year (1 September
2021 to 31 August 2022) was −85 Gt, 37 a net ice loss. The 2021–2022 SMB was about 420 Gt,
which is the tenth highest value in the dataset (1980–2022) (Figure 15). Nevertheless, the
Greenland ice sheet ended with a negative TMB for the twenty-sixth year in a row, mainly

due to the strong negative MMB of −480 Gt. An independent measure of the TMB has been
available since 2002 based on the GRACE and GRACE Follow-on (FO) satellite missions. The
GRACE-FO data indicate a TMB of −305 Gt (Figure 17(a)), a much larger mass loss than the
estimate of −85 Gt from the regional mass balance models. This reflects the different methods
and may also reflect additional mass losses in September captured by GRACE-FO.
The melting and ablation seasons in Greenland began late in 2022 and the summer was
relatively cool compared with recent years. However, there was a period of high temperatures
at the end of July 2022 with intense melt over large parts of the ice sheet. September 2022
was also extraordinarily warm, with anomalous melting throughout the month (Figure 16).
Summit Station, the highest point in Greenland (at an altitude of 3 200 m), had its warmest
September on record (since 1991) and experienced melting conditions on 3 September 2022,
the first time melting has been registered at this site in September.38 Later in September,
heavy rain associated with post-tropical cyclone Fiona fell on the ice sheet, also a first for
September. The September mass loss is not included in the −85 Gt cited above, as the end
of the Greenland melt season is conventionally taken to be 31 August.

The Antarctic ice sheet also has a long-term trend of mass loss, with an average rate of mass
change of −117 ± 57 Gt per year for the period of record of the GRACE mission, April 2002 to
October 2022 (Figure 17(b)). In 2022, the Antarctic ice sheet countered this long-term trend
and gained mass, with an estimated mass change of +110 Gt from January to October 2022.
Years of positive TMB are not unusual in the GRACE record (see for example 2004, 2005
and 2016), but preliminary results through October 2022 indicate that the ice sheet experienced
its greatest mass gain since 2005.
The gain in mass was a result of anomalously high snowfall and SMB (Figure 18). From March
2022 through December 2022, snow accumulation was almost 300 Gt above normal, associated with above-normal temperatures and high snowfall amounts on the western Antarctic
Peninsula, Wilkes Land and much of the East Antarctic plateau (Figure 18(c)). The Antarctic ice
sheet always has a positive SMB (more snow accumulation than melt), which is countered by
marine melt and iceberg discharge. Recent mass losses in Antarctica (Figure 17(b)) of about
−100 Gt per year were driven by high rates of marine melting and iceberg discharge on the
Amundsen Sea coast. The surplus SMB of about 300 Gt was enough to offset this, leading
to a positive TMB in 2022.

SNOW COVER
Seasonal snow cover in the northern hemisphere has been experiencing a long-term decline
in the late spring and summer. Snow-cover extent (SCE) in 2022 was close to the 2001–2020
average and was consistent with these long-term trends. Based on analyses of the Rutgers
northern hemisphere SCE product, 39 the average daily SCE in the snow season from August
2021 to July 2022 was 2.5% below the 2001–2020 average, with the largest anomalies in June
2022 when snow extent was –1.68 million km2, 21% below average. Reductions in northern
hemisphere spring snow extent are consistent across data sets, and in 2022 the below-average
June extent was driven by below-normal snow cover in both North America and Eurasia, where
June SCEs were the second and third lowest on record, respectively, for the period 1967–2022.40

PERMAFROST
Permafrost is ground (soil and rock) with a temperature that remains below 0 °C for at least
two consecutive years. Permafrost can contain significant amounts of ice, and warming and
thawing of permafrost can have important implications for landscape stability, hydrology,
ecosystems and infrastructure integrity. Frozen soil can also contain carbon which can be
released upon thawing, with impacts on GHG concentrations and climate feedbacks. The
IPCC AR6 WG I report concluded that “increases in permafrost temperatures in the upper
30 m have been observed since the start of observational programs over the past three to
four decades throughout the permafrost regions (high confidence)”.41
Permafrost temperatures are measured in numerous boreholes across the Arctic, with
records for some sites now more than four decades long. Temperatures at depths at or near
the level of minimal seasonal change indicate that permafrost has been warming since the
1970s (Figure 19), with record high values observed in the most recent available data at
Beaufort Chukchi Sea – northern Alaska and Northwest Territories

many sites.42 Greater rates of permafrost warming (0.4 °C to 0.6 °C per decade) are generally
observed in the colder permafrost (<−2 °C) of the western North American Arctic, the Canadian
high Arctic, Nordic regions and Russian Federation/Siberia. In warmer permafrost, with
temperatures close to 0 °C, in regions such as interior Alaska and the central Mackenzie
valley of Canada, lower rates of warming have been observed (<0.2 °C per decade). The lower
rates of temperature increase are due to the phase change as ground ice melts. Although
temperatures may change little over time as permafrost temperatures approach 0 °C, the
melting of ground ice has important impacts on soil strength and ground stability.
Active layer thickness (ALT) is the maximum thickness of the surface layer that thaws seasonally.
The depth of the active layer is increasing worldwide. Of all Arctic regions, the Beaufort Chukchi
Sea region has the lowest trend, with an increase of <0.3 cm per year from 2000 to 2021. The
situation in interior Alaska and Canada is very different, with ALT increasing by 0.9 cm per
year. Thaw depths were substantially greater than average from 2018 to 2021, and ALT in
2021 was the second highest since 2000 (after 2020). ALT in mountain environments is highly
variable. Sites in the European Alps show an increase in ALT (>1 cm per year), while sites in the
Norwegian Alps have negligible trends. Antarctica has few active sites and the available data
suggest relatively small changes, but ALT on the Antarctic Peninsula has increased since 2013.

STRATOSPHERIC OZONE AND OZONE-DEPLETING GASES
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol, production and consumption of halons
and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has been reported as discontinued, but their levels in the
atmosphere continue to be monitored. Because CFCs have long lifetimes, they will remain
in the atmosphere for many decades, and even if there were no new emissions, there would
still be more than enough chlorine and bromine present to cause nearly complete depletion
of ozone in the lower stratosphere over Antarctica from August to December. As a result,
the Antarctic ozone “hole” continues to form every spring, with its area and depth governed
to a large degree by meteorological conditions. The “hole” is not strictly a hole; it is an area
where the total column ozone in the stratosphere falls below 220 Dobson units.

The evolution of the ozone “hole” in 2022 was similar to its evolution in 2021. The hole
developed relatively early and continued growing, resulting in a large and deep ozone
hole. On 5 October it reached 26 million km2, comparable to 2020 and 2021, and close
to the maximum area observed in earlier years such as 2015 (28.2 million km2) and 2006
(29.6 million km2)43 (Figure 20). NASA reported a minimum ozone column of 97 Dobson units
on 1 and 2 October 2022. Concentrations of stratospheric ozone were persistently reduced
to near zero between 15 and 20 km altitude over Antarctica at the end of September 2022,
which, along with the values measured in the season of 2021, are among the lowest ozone
values ever measured via sondes at the Antarctic stations.44 The unusually deep and large
ozone hole was driven by a strong, stable polar vortex and lower-than-average temperatures
in the stratosphere.

with a marked rainfall deficit included: large parts of Europe, the Mediterranean region and
North-west Africa as well as parts of the Middle East; Central Asia and the Himalayas; Eastern
Africa and Madagascar; Central and Southern South America; and Central and Western North
America (Figure 21).
The Indian Monsoon onset was earlier and the withdrawal later than normal in 2022. The
majority of the Indian subcontinent was wetter than average and the monsoon extended
farther westward than usual towards Pakistan, where there was extensive flooding. The
onset of the West African Monsoon was delayed as it was in 2021. Later in the West African
Monsoon season, rainfall totals were higher than normal. In total, the seasonal rainfall was
close to normal except in the eastern and western coastal regions.

SHORT-TERM CLIMATE DRIVERS
Climate modes are recurrent patterns, usually of pressure or sea-surface temperature (SST),
typically characterized by negative and positive phases, which each have distinctive effects
on the distribution of rainfall, temperature and other meteorological elements on time scales
varying from days to seasons and beyond.
In 2022, two such climate modes – the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian
Ocean Dipole (IOD) – contributed to major weather and climate events across large areas of
the world. Examples are provided in the following sections.

21

EL NIÑO–SOUTHERN OSCILLATION
ENSO is one of the most important drivers of year-to-year variability in weather patterns
worldwide. It is linked to hydrometeorological hazards such as heavy rains, floods and
drought. El Niño, characterized by higher-than-average SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific
and a weakening of the trade winds in the region, typically has a warming influence on
global temperatures. La Niña, which is characterized by below-average SSTs in the central
and eastern tropical Pacific and a strengthening of the trade winds, has the opposite effect.
La Niña conditions emerged in mid-2020 and continued into 2021, with SSTs briefly becoming
ENSO-neutral (within 0.5 °C of normal), although still cooler than average during most of the
northern hemisphere summer. SSTs decreased again, and La Niña re-emerged during the
July−September period of 2021, quickly evolving to moderate strength, where it remained
through the end of 2022 (Figure 22). This marks the third consecutive year of La Niña, 45 the
third time such an event, informally referred to as a “triple-dip” La Niña, has occurred in the
last 50 years, following 1973–1976 and 1998–2001.
As well as having a temporary cooling influence on global mean temperature, La Niña is often
– though not always – associated with characteristic patterns of rainfall. In some regions the
pattern of precipitation anomalies in 2022 was typical of La Niña: drier than usual conditions
in Patagonia and South-west North America, and wetter than usual in Southern Africa,
Northern South America, the maritime continent and eastern Australia. In early December, a
week-long heatwave with dry conditions and record-breaking maximum temperatures affected
Argentina, which is in its third consecutive year of drought. Parts of southern and central Chile,
meanwhile, continue to experience drought conditions which have now persisted for more
than a decade.46 La Niña is also associated with more intense and longer monsoon rainfall
in South-east Asia. Pakistan experienced record rains in July and August. La Niña and the

negative phase of the IOD are associated with drier-than-normal conditions in East Africa.47
Most of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia have experienced five consecutive below-average rainfall
seasons, with severe humanitarian impacts.
Although it typically reduces global temperature, La Niña is not associated with lower temperatures everywhere. In New Zealand it is typically associated with warm, wet air masses.
The country reported its warmest and wettest winter on record, the third consecutive winter
to break the seasonal temperature record, and 2022 was the warmest year on record for the
country, surpassing the record set in 2021 by 0.20 °C.

INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE
The positive phase of the IOD is characterized by below-average SSTs in the Eastern Indian
Ocean and above average SSTs in the west. The negative phase has the opposite pattern.
The resulting change in the gradient of SST across the ocean basin affects the weather of the
surrounding continents, primarily in the southern hemisphere. Positive IOD events are often,
but not always, associated with El Niño and negative events with La Niña.
For the second consecutive year, a negative IOD developed during austral winter. In combination with La Niña, this phase contributed to wet conditions across much of Australia in
late austral winter and spring. It was the wettest spring and wettest October on record for
New South Wales and Victoria, and the second-wettest spring nationally after 2010. Major
flooding affected multiple regions in the spring, particularly across large areas of eastern
Australia. The negative IOD returned to neutral as austral summer began.
As previously mentioned, the negative IOD, in combination with La Niña, contributed to the
ongoing dry conditions in Eastern Africa. More details are to be found in the sections on
Extreme events and Socioeconomic impacts.

Extreme events
Although broad-scale changes in the climate are important, the impacts of weather and
climate are most clearly felt during extreme events such as heavy rain and snow, droughts,
heatwaves, cold spells and storms, including tropical storms and cyclones. These meteorological and climatological extremes, individually, in combination and in conjunction with
other factors, can lead to other events such as flooding, landslides, wildfires and compound
extremes. Together, these have a wide range of impacts on human and natural systems. This
section, which describes a selection of extreme events in 2022, is based largely on input from
WMO Members. The wider socioeconomic risks and impacts are described in the section on
Socioeconomic impacts. Additional information comes from EM-DAT.48

HEAT, DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES
China had the most extensive and long-lasting heatwave since
national records began, extending from mid-June to the end
of August and resulting in the hottest summer on record by
a margin of more than 0.5 °C. It was also the second-driest
summer on record, with most of the southern half of China
(apart from Guangdong province) having seasonal rainfall
20% to 50% below average. Across the country 366 locations
had their highest temperature on record. The heat was
particularly severe in the Yangtze River valley, which also
suffered from significant drought during its driest summer
on record; the Yangtze River at Wuhan reached the lowest
level ever recorded for August. There were also numerous
wildfires in the region. There were significant heatwaves
elsewhere in East Asia, including a record nine consecutive
days above 35 °C in Tokyo from 25 June to 3 July 2022.
Europe also experienced numerous heatwaves, with significant heatwaves occurring in each of the three summer
months. During the summer, around 4 600 deaths in Spain,
4 500 in Germany, 49 2 800 in the United Kingdom50 (among
those aged 65 and older), 2 800 in France 51 and 1 000 in
Portugal were associated with the unusual heat. The most
exceptional heatwave occurred in mid-July. Temperatures
reached 40 °C in the United Kingdom for the first time
(Figure 23), with a reading of 40.3 °C at Coningsby on
19 July, 52 while 33.0 °C on 18 July at Phoenix Park (Dublin)
was the highest in Ireland since 1887. Numerous locations
broke previous records by more than 3 °C, particularly
in northern England and western France. A temperature

of 40.1 °C at Hamburg-Neuwiedenthal on 20 July was the northernmost 40 °C reading on
record in Germany. The heat extended as far north as Sweden, where the reading of 37.2 °C
at Målilla on 21 July was the country’s highest since 1947.
The Mediterranean region experienced major heatwaves in June and August. A number
of June record high temperatures were set in Italy, including 40.0 °C at Urbe (Rome) on
27 June. Tunisia had its hottest June on record, and some locations set all-time record highs
in August, while a record high of 49.1 °C was set at Smara (Morocco) on 10 July. North-east
Europe had major heatwaves in mid-August with records set in Finland and Estonia. Nearly
the entire Mediterranean Sea was affected by marine heat waves, which lasted from March
to December, setting new records for cumulative intensity in the region.
Drought also affected many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean (Figure 24). In Europe,
conditions were at their most severe in August, when rivers including the Rhine, Loire and

Danube fell to critically low levels, significantly disrupting river transport. In France, low
river flows, and high river-water temperatures led to output being reduced at some nuclear
power stations.53 Three states in west-central Germany had their driest summer on record, in
a region which had experienced extreme flooding the previous summer. France had its driest
January to September period since 1976, and the United Kingdom and Uccle (Belgium) had
their driest January to August since 1976, while the 12 months ending in August 2022 were
the driest for at least 40 years in Morocco. Northern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula were
exceptionally dry in winter 2021/2022, and spring was drier than average across large areas
of Europe. Significant drought also continues to affect parts of South-west Asia, particularly
the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq. Baghdad had 24.3 mm of rainfall from September 2021
to May 2022, 78% below the long-term average.
South-western France was severely affected by wildfires, with over 62 000 ha burnt. For the
second consecutive year, wildfires were associated with major loss of life in Algeria, with
44 deaths reported from 16 to 18 August.
The pre-monsoon period was exceptionally hot in India and Pakistan. Pakistan had its hottest
March and hottest April on record, with both months having national mean temperatures more
than 4 °C above the long-term average. In India, grain yields were reduced by the extreme
heat and there were a number of forest fires, particularly in Uttarakhand.
Drought intensified in the Greater Horn of Africa region, focused on Kenya, Somalia and
southern Ethiopia. Rainfall was well below average across the region in the March–May
and October–December rainy seasons, the fourth and fifth consecutive poor wet seasons
since the second half of 2020, the longest such sequence in 40 years, with major impacts on
agriculture and food security. As in the previous prolonged drought in 2010–2012, La Niña
and the negative IOD were substantial contributors to the dry conditions. Significant rain
fell during 2021–2022 in many parts of Southern Africa, with some easing of the long-term
drought which has been affecting southern Madagascar.
The first half of January was extremely hot in many parts of subtropical South America.
The temperature of 44.0 °C recorded at Paysandú on 14 January equalled Uruguay’s
national record. There were also extensive and prolonged wildfires in northern Argentina
and Paraguay, with over 900 000 hectares burned in Corrientes province between early
January and late February. 54 Significant drought continued in many parts of the region.
Although 2022 rainfall in Chile was not as far below average as in recent years, it was still
well below average in places.55 Buenos Aires had its first rainless June on record, and much
of north-eastern Argentina from the Buenos Aires region northwards was in severe drought
by the end of the year. For this region, as well as for Uruguay, it was the third consecutive
year of significantly below-average rainfall. After a cool autumn and winter, extreme heat
returned to the region late in the year with heatwaves in November and December, including
a December record high temperature of 46.0 °C on 7 December at Rivadavia (Argentina).
Fire activity in the Brazilian Amazon was near the 1998–2021 average, but also among the
highest of the last decade.56 Estimated wildfire carbon emissions in Amazonas state were
the highest in at least 20 years.57

Significant drought continued in much of the western half of North America. In the United
States, drought conditions covered many western and southern states, although summer
monsoon rains brought some relief to the interior south-west, and rains late in the year
resulted in some easing of drought in California and the lower Mississippi valley. Total
economic losses during the year from drought were assessed at US$22 billion. Texas,
which had its second-driest January to July on record, and adjacent areas of northern
Mexico were especially dry, while California had its driest January to October on record
(65% below the 1901–2000 average), continuing a long-term drought in which precipitation
for the 36 months ending October 2022 was the lowest on record. In late July, Lake Mead
in the Colorado River basin reached its lowest level since the reservoir was filled in 1938.
Drought extended to many other parts of the southern United States during the year. River
levels reached record lows during October in places on the middle and lower Mississippi,
and more than 82% of the contiguous United States was experiencing abnormally dry
conditions by mid-October, the largest such area in the 23-year history of the U.S. Drought
Monitor. Heavy spring precipitation eased drought in the north-central United States and
the Prairie Provinces of Canada.
Total area burned during the United States wildfire season was slightly above average, with one
of the most active seasons on record in Alaska and the largest recorded fire in New Mexico,
but loss of life and property was lower than in most recent years. The July to September
period was the hottest on record for many parts of the western United States.
Exceptionally high regional temperatures occurred over the plateau of East Antarctica in
mid-March as an atmospheric river originating near Australia brought warm, moist air over
the Antarctic continent. On 18 March, temperatures reached −10.1 °C at Dome C and −17.7 °C
at Vostok. Both values were more than 15 °C above previous March records at the sites and
35 °C above March averages, with the Dome C reading being the highest on record at any
time of year.

COLD EXTREMES
Few significant cold records were set globally in 2022. In late December, an intense cold
outbreak affected many parts of the United States and Canada. Intense blizzards affected
Buffalo and surrounding areas, with significant loss of life. Blizzard conditions lasted 36 hours,
with a storm total snowfall of 132 cm. Further west, Casper (Wyoming) had its lowest
temperature on record (−41.1 °C). December was also cold in parts of Europe, particularly in
the north and north-west. A maximum of −9.3 °C at Braemar on 12 December was the lowest
maximum temperature in the United Kingdom since December 2010, while Iceland had its
coldest December since 1973.
Greece had two significant snow events in late January and mid-March. Both cold outbreaks
also affected other parts of the eastern Mediterranean, with snow falling at elevations above
600 m in Libya. For the second consecutive year, widespread frosts in early April resulted in
crop losses in Western Europe, particularly in France. A coastal low brought Boston in the
United States 60 cm of snowfall on 29 January, equalling the daily record. It was a snowy
winter in Argentine Patagonia; northern Patagonia had its second-most extensive snow cover
in the twenty-first century and southern Patagonia its third-most. A cold spell in July brought
Puerto Natales (Chile) its second-coldest temperature on record, −16.2 °C, with El Calafate
(Argentina) reaching −16.5 °C.

FLOODING AND HEAVY RAIN
Pakistan experienced exceptional flooding (Figure 25) during the monsoon season, peaking
in late August. July (181% above normal) and August (243% above normal) were each the
wettest on record nationally. Sindh province was particularly badly affected, with Balochistan
also hard-hit. Preliminary satellite data indicated that 75 000 km2, about 9% of Pakistan’s area,
were inundated at some stage during August.58 Adjacent areas of Afghanistan were also
affected. Over 1 700 deaths were reported in Pakistan and over 2 million dwellings damaged
or destroyed, with over 33 million people affected in some way.59 Crop and livestock losses
were also severe, as the floods affected much of the country’s agricultural land. Total damage

and economic losses were assessed at US$ 30 billion.60 The impacts of the floods were broadly
similar to those of 2010. There was also significant flooding in India at various stages during
the monsoon season, particularly in the north-east in June, with over 700 deaths reported
during the season from flooding and landslides, and a further 900 from lightning.
There was flooding in eastern Australia on numerous occasions during the year. The most
severe floods were in late February and early March, affecting eastern coastal areas in
south-east Queensland, northern New South Wales and the area around Sydney. The worst
flooding was south of Brisbane, where the Wilsons River exceeded previous record levels
by about 2 m. In western Sydney the Hawkesbury-Nepean Rivers reached their highest level
since 1978. Twenty-two deaths were reported and insured losses were near US$ 4 billion.
The Sydney region also had major flooding in early July. There was further major flooding in
many parts of the south-east quarter of Australia in the final quarter of the year, particularly in
the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin. New South Wales and Victoria both had their wettest
spring on record. Flooding continued into early 2023 in the lower Murray-Darling basin as
water drained slowly downstream, with some parts of the Murray River in South Australia
reaching their highest peak since 1956. Sydney received 2530 mm of rain for the year, well
above its previous full-year record of 2194 mm.
The eastern Brazilian city of Petropolis experienced extreme rainfall and flash flooding twice
in the space of a few weeks, on 15 February and 20 March. In the February event 250 mm of
rain fell in three hours, while in March 415 mm fell in 10 hours. Two hundred and thirty deaths
were reported in the February event, many of them as a result of landslides. North-east Brazil
also had significant flooding in May, while later in the year, flooding affected many parts of
Venezuela after heavy rains in October and November. In the worst single incident, 50 deaths
were reported with 56 people missing after a landslide in Tejerìas on 8 October 2022.
Many parts of the Sahel, particularly its eastern half, saw significant flooding during the
monsoon season, especially towards its end. Nigeria, Niger, Chad and the southern half of
Sudan were particularly affected. The flooding was exacerbated in Nigeria when heavy local
rains in October fell as floodwaters arrived from upstream. Over the course of the season,
603 deaths in Nigeria and 159 in Niger were attributed to flooding, with US$ 4.2 billion in
reported economic losses in Nigeria. Over 250 000 people were displaced in Chad’s capital,
N’Djamena, between October and December.61 While rainfall in South Sudan, where prolonged
flooding occurred in 2020 and 2021, was near or below normal, extensive flooding continued
as a result of flows from upstream.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Tropical cyclone activity was near or below average in most regions in 2022, except for the
South Indian Ocean, which had an active season overall despite an unusually late start. The
South Indian Ocean had one of the season’s highest-impact systems; subtropical depression
Issa, in combination with a cut-off low-pressure system, caused extreme flooding in April in
the KwaZulu-Natal province of eastern South Africa, with rainfall totals of up to 311 mm in
24 hours on 11–12 April. Over 400 deaths were attributed to the flooding62 and 40 000 people

were displaced. Madagascar had four landfalls in the space of a month in late January and
February. Ana (in January) and Batsirai (in February, Figure 26) both caused significant loss
of life there, with Ana also going on to have major impacts from flooding in Mozambique and
Malawi. Gombe (March) brought flooding to Mozambique with significant casualties.
The North Atlantic hurricane season had an inactive start compared with recent years but had
two major landfalls in September. Hurricane Ian crossed western Cuba before intensifying to
category 4 and making landfall in south-west Florida on 28 September. Ian brought extensive
storm-surge inundation in low-lying coastal areas and river flooding further north-east,
where four-day rainfall exceeded 500 mm around Daytona Beach. Sustained 10-minute winds
of 241 km per hour made Ian the fourth strongest landfall on record in Florida. Economic
losses from Ian in the United States were assessed at US$ 113 billion, making it the third
most costly tropical cyclone on record, while with 152 deaths, it caused the greatest loss of
life in a Florida tropical cyclone since the 1930s.63,64
Hurricane Fiona crossed the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands
in September, causing significant flooding and widespread power outages, before intensifying
and tracking north towards Canada. It made landfall as a transitioning extratropical storm
in Nova Scotia on 24 September with an estimated central pressure of 931 hPa. Hart Island
reported 932.7 hPa, the lowest mean sea level pressure on record at a Canadian station. There
was widespread wind damage and power outages, and substantial storm surge and wave
flooding in coastal areas, particularly in south-western Newfoundland.

The western North Pacific had a below-average season, particularly for intense cyclones, but
still had a number of significant impacts. The two most destructive systems were both of
tropical storm intensity when they hit the Philippines but nonetheless caused major loss of life
through severe flooding and landslides. Tropical Storm Megi (Agaton) crossed the Philippines
on 10−12 April and Nalgae (Paeng) did so on 29–30 October. Over 200 deaths were attributed
to Megi and over 150 to Nalgae, 65 with Megi’s worst impacts being experienced around Cebu,
whilst those from Nalgae affected many parts of the country. Floods associated with monsoonal
rains also resulted in significant loss of life in Mindanao in the last week of December.
The two strongest systems of the season both occurred in September. Typhoon Hinnamnor
had significant impacts when it reached the Korean Peninsula in early September despite some
weakening before landfall, while Typhoon Nanmadol affected southern Japan. Also in September,
although it had limited impact as a tropical system, after transitioning to an extratropical system
and moving north-east, Typhoon Merbok caused major coastal inundation in western Alaska.

SEVERE STORMS
An exceptional derecho 66 affected parts of southern and central Europe on 18 August, bringing
severe winds and heavy rainfall on a track which extended 1600 km from the Balearic Islands
(Spain) across Corsica (France), Italy, Slovenia, Austria and Czechia. The system reached its
peak severity over Corsica, where wind gusts of 225 km per hour were recorded, the strongest
reliably observed wind gust on record for metropolitan France.67 Five deaths were reported.
There was also significant damage in Italy, where hail reached 8 cm in diameter. On 23 October,
an EF3 tornado crossed northern France causing significant damage; its path was 206 km long,
the longest recorded in France. The most significant windstorm of the western European season
was Eunice, which crossed England and Wales on 18 February. A gust of 196 km per hour at
The Needles (on the Isle of Wight) was the highest on record in England. Four deaths occurred
during the storm in the United Kingdom, four in the Kingdom of the Netherlands and a further
two in Belgium, while more than a million households in England and Wales lost power.
The United States tornado season had a near-average number of tornadoes, despite a very
active March, but casualties were below long-term averages. There were numerous flash
flood events during the summer across various parts of the country, including Yellowstone
National Park in June, St. Louis and eastern Kentucky in July, Death Valley on 5 August and
Dallas-Fort Worth on 22 August. In the Kentucky event, where daily rainfalls were between
100 and 200 mm, at least 37 deaths were reported, while in the Dallas event some locations
received more than 300 mm in 12 hours. Flooding of a treatment plant cut the water supply
in Jackson (Mississippi) in late August.
Abnormal rainfall and storm activity affected South-west Asia and the Arabian Peninsula
in late July and early August, normally a dry time for the region. Fujiarah Port (United Arab
Emirates) received 255.2 mm over two days on 27 and 28 July. Flash flooding occurred in
many locations and significant casualties were reported in Yemen and Iran. There was further
intense rainfall and flash flooding in November; Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) received 179 mm in
six hours on 24 November, about three times its average annual rainfall.

Socioeconomic impacts
The risks posed by weather and climate-related hazards are complex and context specific,
depending on the vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity of human and natural systems.
Weather and climate-related events pose multiple humanitarian risks to society. Climate
and extreme weather events also affect the use and distribution of natural resources across
regions and within countries and have large negative impacts on the environment.
In the face of global systemic risk, such as climate change, changes in how society addresses
disaster risks are needed.68 Governments have been making consistent efforts to address
disaster and climate risks and build resilience. Around 125 countries have developed national
disaster risk reduction strategies (Target E of the Sendai Framework).69 However, international
cooperation and financing for disaster risk reduction remains low.70 One of the essential
components for reducing the impact of disasters is to have effective multi-hazard early warning
systems (MHEWSs), and to have people act on the warnings. There is evidence suggesting that
countries reporting good MHEWS coverage have lower mortality rates compared to countries
that have little or no such coverage.71 The UN Secretary-General has tasked WMO with leading
action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.72

FOOD SECURITY
As of 2021, 2.3 billion people faced food insecurity, of whom 924 million faced severe food
insecurity. Projections estimated that 767.9 million were people facing undernourishment
in 2021, or 9.8% of the global population (Figure 27). Half of the 767.9 million are in Asia and

one third are in Africa.73 Rising undernourishment has been exacerbated by the compounded
effects of hydrometeorological hazards and COVID-19 on health, food security, incomes and
equality, as well as the effects of protracted conflicts and violence.74 As of October 2022,
several countries in Africa and Asia (such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen,
and Afghanistan) and the Caribbean (Haiti) experienced starvation or death and required
urgent humanitarian action (IPC Phase 5: Catastrophe 75). In these countries, the key drivers
and aggravating factors for acute food insecurity were conflict/insecurity, economic shocks,
political instability, displacement, dry conditions and cyclones.
Heatwaves in the 2022 pre-monsoon season in India and Pakistan caused a decline in crop
yields. This, combined with the banning of wheat exports and restrictions on rice exports in
India after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, has threatened the availability, access to and
stability of staple foods within international food markets and posed high risks to countries
already affected by shortages of staple foods.76 Heavy monsoon rains caused severe flooding
and landslides in Pakistan, leading to the spread of water-borne diseases, with the greatest
impacts in the most vulnerable and food-insecure regions of southern and central Pakistan.
Over 1 700 people died,77 along with 936 000 head of livestock. Large areas of croplands

transportation and building infrastructure.79,80
Protracted La Niña conditions that persisted from 2020 to early 2023 may have intensified
droughts and, consequently, crop and livestock losses in Central Asia much like the protracted
1998–2001 La Niña. 81,82 As of September 2022, food insecurity concerns remained at the
highest level for Afghanistan, and around 18.9 million people (45% of the population) were
expected to face Level (3) (Crisis) or worse levels of acute food insecurity from June to
November 2022. In the Syrian Arab Republic, the 2021–2022 season had poor rainfall and dry
spells, constraining crop yields for the second consecutive season. The 2022 winter growing

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a common global scale for classifying the severity and magnitude
of food insecurity and malnutrition. For Acute Food Insecurity, the system has five levels: (1) Minimal/None; (2) Stressed;
(3) Crisis; (4) Emergency; (5) Catastrophe/Famine. There are similar scales for Chronic Food Insecurity and Acute
Malnutrition.

season from November onwards also had below-average rainfall which, combined with high
costs of agricultural inputs and limited access to irrigation water, resulted in a below-average
cereal harvest in 2022.83
In the Greater Horn of Africa, the rains failed for the fifth consecutive season since late 2020.
Across the East Africa region, under the effects of the drought and other shocks, an estimated
22.5 to 23.4 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia faced Crisis or worse levels of
acute food insecurity as of January 2023. 84,85 Heavy rainfall and flooding in the Darfur region
and Nile River basin of Sudan, and the Sudd Wetlands in South Sudan, have exacerbated
crop damage, displacement, and conflictual and food insecurity conditions, putting over
7 million people at risk of Crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity as of July 2022.86 In
South Sudan, four consecutive years of flooding, as well as macroeconomic challenges are
expected to keep food insecurity at extreme levels. In 2022, the crop yield is expected to be
below average due to widespread floods and prolonged dry spells.
As of June 2022, 28 million people were recorded as food insecure in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and this food insecurity was exacerbated by the impact of hurricanes and storms.
The agricultural sector in Honduras and Guatemala has been affected by increased international
agricultural and food prices, with 4.6 million people in Guatemala and 2.6 million people in
Honduras projected to face Crisis or worse levels of food insecurity.87

POPULATION DISPLACEMENT
Throughout the year, hazardous climate- and weather-related events and conditions played a
significant role in driving new population displacement. Most people displaced in climate- or
weather-related events remained within the territories where they resided, while in some
situations people were forced to flee across international borders in search of safety and
assistance. At the same time, climate- and weather-related hazards worsened and prolonged
the situations of many of the 95 million people already living in displacement at the beginning
of the year.88
The Horn of Africa faced its worst drought in 40 years, with Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia
particularly hard hit.89 In Somalia, almost 1.2 million people90 became internally displaced by
the catastrophic impacts of drought on pastoral and farming livelihoods and hunger during
the year.91 Over 60 000 people fleeing the combined impacts of drought and conflict crossed

into Ethiopia and Kenya during the same period. 92 Concurrently, Somalia was hosting almost
35 000 refugees and asylum seekers in drought-affected areas, including over 2 600 new arrivals
from Ethiopia, 93 and almost 3 million people were already living in conflict-induced internal
displacement at the end of 2021.94 A further 512 000 internal displacements associated with
drought were recorded in Ethiopia. As a result of funding shortfalls and the global increase in
food prices, more than 3.5 million refugees in the region (75% of the total refugee population)
were affected by major cuts in food assistance.95
In the Syrian Arab Republic, severe winter storms, heavy snowfall and flooding damaged
displacement sites, leading to more than 5 000 secondary displacements.96 In July, devastating floods in Yemen aggravated the vulnerabilities and protection concerns of more than
10 000 displaced families, with their shelters, food and household items damaged.97
Record rainfall and the worst flooding in decades hit Pakistan in late August. Some 33 million
people were affected, including about 800 000 Afghan refugees hosted in affected districts.
By October, around 8 million people had been internally displaced by the floods, with some
585 000 sheltering in relief sites.98 By the end of the year, with the onset of difficult winter
conditions and flood waters yet to fully recede, an estimated 5 million people remained
exposed to or living near flooded areas, including some 205 000 people still displaced in
the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan.99 People displaced by floods who live in informal
camps, informal settlements or transitional shelters were particularly vulnerable to the cold
weather, while many returnees and people who remained in flood affected areas were living
in damaged, barely insulated houses.100
In Bangladesh, the monsoon season brought the worst floods in 20 years, affecting nearly
7.2 million people.101 By June, 663 000 displacements had been recorded in Assam102 and
481 000 in Sylhet and Mymensingh,103 while in Cox’s Bazar, heavy rains affected nearly
60 000 refugees and triggered secondary displacement.104 Weather-related hazards also
contributed to significant displacement in the Americas, predominantly in Brazil. In the
first half of 2022, Brazil saw floods and storms which triggered a record 656 000 internal
displacements.105

Some high-impact weather events in 2022 happened consecutively, leaving little time for
recovery between shocks and compounding repeated and protracted displacement. The
southern Africa region was hit by a series of five cyclones over two months, leading to a
surge in the need for protection and shelter. Hundreds of thousands of people were affected,
including pre-existing refugees and people internally displaced. More than 190 000 people
in Malawi who lost or fled their homes during Tropical Storm Ana in late January were still
displaced in April.106 In Mozambique, two months after Ana’s impacts included destruction
of the homes and shelters of over 20 000 pre-existing internally displaced households,107
Tropical Cyclone Gombe compounded its impacts, affecting over 736 000 people, damaging
or destroying some 142 000 homes in many of the same areas, and forcing over 23 000 to take
refuge in official shelters.108 An assessment of existing shelter sites for internally displaced
people in Nampula found that around 40% of the temporary shelters had been destroyed.109
Meanwhile, displacement continued for over 129 000 people in Sofala Province who had been
forced to flee by Tropical Cyclone Idai in 2019.110

CLIMATE IMPACTS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Climate change has important consequences for ecosystems and the environment. For
example, a recent assessment focusing on the unique high-elevation area around the Tibetan
Plateau,111 the so called Third Pole of the world and largest storehouse of snow and ice outside
the Arctic and Antarctic, found that global warming is causing the temperate zone to expand.

PHENOLOGY
Phenology is the study112 of recurring events in nature, such as when trees blossom or birds
migrate, and how these are influenced by climate. Anthropogenic climate change has been
shown to induce phenological shifts in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.113 For example,
flowering of cherry trees in Japan has been documented since AD 801 and has shifted to
earlier dates since the late nineteenth century114,115 due to the effects of climate change and

Not all species in an ecosystem respond to the same climate influences or at the same rates,
which may lead to phenological mismatches that desynchronise ecological interactions and
threaten ecosystem function.118 For example, spring arrival times of 117 European migratory
bird species over five decades119 show increasing levels of phenological mismatch to other
spring events, such as leaf out and insect flight, which are important for bird survival. Such
mismatches are likely to have contributed to population decline in some migrant species,
particularly those wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.

Updating the climatological normal
to 1991–2020
John Kennedy
Climatological normals are used as a benchmark against which conditions can be compared120
(see, for example, Figure 3). They are typically based on a mean of 30 years of data. WMO
guidelines recommend the use of a 30-year period ending in a ‘0’ year, with 1991–2020 being
the most recent.
In this year’s report, the period 1991–2020 is used for the first time, replacing the 1981–2010
baseline. Figure 29 shows annual mean temperatures for 2022 relative to both baselines.
The differences between baselines (Figure 30) are typically smaller than the variability of
annual anomalies, but the same colour scale is used in both figures to aid comparison. The
temperatures themselves and their rankings do not change, but the new baseline affects
the anomalies, with larger areas being close to, or cooler than the new baseline. This makes
patterns associated with natural variability more obvious, including La Niña and the negative
phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (see Short-term climate drivers) which were present through
much of 2022.
The difference between normals for different periods can provide insight into long-term
changes, though there is a 20-year overlap between the two periods. The long-term warming
between 1981–2010 and 1991–2020 (Figure 30, left) was generally larger over land than the

ocean, exceeding 0.5 °C in western Eurasia and parts of the Middle East, and was highest of
all over the Arctic, where warming locally exceeded 1 °C. Limited areas of little change or
weak cooling were also observed, mainly in the Southern Ocean.
Over the ocean, the areas of strongest long-term warming were in the North and South-west
Pacific. There was also a limited area of cooling in the East Pacific. This pattern arises from
decadal changes associated with the shift from the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation121 (roughly from 1980 to 2000) to the negative phase (from 2000 to present),
combined with long-term warming.
The global temperature time series in the main report is shown relative to an 1850–1900
baseline. Between 1981–2010 and 1991–2020, the global mean temperature increased by
0.22 °C, from 0.77 °C to 0.99 °C above the 1850–1900 average, which is consistent with the
long-term rate of temperature change of around 0.2 °C per decade.
This period 1850–1900 is used as an approximation of pre-industrial temperatures, though true
pre-industrial conditions are likely to have been slightly cooler.122 IPCC AR6 WG I estimated
the difference between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010 to be 0.69 °C. To calculate anomalies
relative to the earlier period, we therefore took anomalies for each data set relative to the
period 1981–2010 and added 0.69 °C. The uncertainty in anomalies relative to the 1850–1900
baseline arises predominantly from the difference between the two baselines and amounts
to 0.12 °C. It is not possible to calculate a reliable 1850–1900 baseline for many areas of the
world because of a lack of data.

Observational basis
for climate monitoring
Climate monitoring is performed by a system of observing systems covering the atmosphere,
the ocean, hydrology, the cryosphere and the biosphere. Each of these areas is monitored in
different ways by a range of organizations. Cutting across all these areas, satellite observations
provide major contributions to global climate monitoring.
In 1992, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established by WMO, the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
and the International Science Council (ISC) to coordinate and facilitate the development and
improvement of global climate observations. GCOS has identified a set of Essential Climate
Variables (ECVs) that together provide the information necessary to understand, model and
predict the trajectory of the climate as well as plan mitigation and adaptation strategies
(Figure 31). The status of the observational basis for these ECVs is published in regular status
reports. GCOS also identifies what is needed to improve the system in implementation reports.

In 2022, GCOS released its latest Implementation Plan in response to the findings of the
2021 GCOS Status Report, implications arising from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report and
recent scientific studies on the climate cycles. The publication provides recommendations
for a sustained and fit for purpose Global Climate Observing System.
In addition to observations provided by the GCOS-coordinated Global Surface Network (GSN)
and Global Upper-Air Network (GUAN), National Meteorological and Hydrological Services
(NMHSs) of WMO Members provide a more comprehensive and widespread network of
observations, acquired primarily for operational weather prediction. WMO’s Global Basic
Observing Network (GBON), a globally-designed network with prescribed capabilities and
observing schedules and for which international data exchange is mandatory, will provide
critically needed observations for numerical weather prediction and will help substantially
strengthen climate reanalysis.
In order to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance for the implementation
and operation of GBON in the poorest and most poorly observed areas of the globe, WMO, the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNEP have established the Systematic
Observations Financing Facility (SOFF). SOFF has raised significant funds for supporting
observations in least developed countries and small island developing states and commenced
its implementation phase in 2023.
Complementing the observations of the physical and dynamic properties of the atmosphere,
WMO’s Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) coordinates atmospheric composition measurements,
ensuring that reliable and accurate data are obtained from measurements made by WMO
Members, research institutions and/or agencies and other contributing networks.
Ocean observations of ocean physics, biogeochemistry, biology and ecosystems are
coordinated through the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). The GOOS Observations
Coordination Group (OCG) monitors the performance of these observations123 and produces
an annual Ocean Observing System Report Card. Ocean observations are generally made
widely available to international users.
In the terrestrial domain, there is a wider group of observing networks. Hydrological
observations are generally operated by NMHSs and coordinated through WMO. A number
of specialized Global Terrestrial Networks (GTNs), for example, on hydrology, permafrost,
glaciers, land use, and biomass, also contribute to GCOS. Data exchange agreements are
generally less developed for the terrestrial networks, and many important observations are
not made available to international users.
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites/Coordination Group for Meteorological
Satellites (CEOS/CGMS) Joint Working Group on Climate (WGClimate) bases the development
of satellite observations for climate on the ECV requirements established by GCOS. It has
produced an ECV Inventory that includes records for 766 climate data records for 33 ECVs
covering 72 separate ECV products, with more planned. WGClimate is also working on actions
arising from the Implementation Plan. Satellite observations have near-global coverage. Used
with ground-based observations, either as complementary data sets or for validation and
calibration, they form an invaluable part of the global observing system.

TEMPERATURE DATA
GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE SERIES
The method for calculating global mean temperature anomalies relative to an 1850–1900
baseline is based on the assessment of long-term change and its uncertainty made by
Working Group I in its contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6 WG I).
The method uses shorter data sets that are routinely updated to provide an assessment of
recent temperature changes.
In 2021, the IPCC AR6 WG I assessed change from 1850–1900 to other periods based on
an average of four data sets – HadCRUT5, Berkeley Earth, NOAA Interim and Kadow et al.
(2020) – which start in 1850. As two of the four IPCC data sets are not regularly updated, in the
present report the estimate made by the IPCC for the temperature change between 1850–1900
and 1981–2010 is combined with estimated changes between 1981–2010 and the current year
from six data sets to calculate anomalies for 2022 relative to 1850–1900.
There is good agreement between the six data sets on changes from 1981–2010 to the present,
as this is a period with good observational coverage. The additional uncertainty from the
spread of the six data sets is combined with that of the IPCC’s estimate of the uncertainty in
the change from 1850–1900 to 1981–2010.
Global mean temperature anomalies were calculated relative to an 1850–1900 baseline using
the following steps starting from time series of global monthly mean temperatures for each
data set:
1. For each data set, anomalies were calculated relative to the 1981–2010 average by
subtracting the average for the period 1981–2010 for each month separately.
2. An annual average was calculated from the monthly averages.
3. The amount of 0.69 °C was added to each series, based on the estimated difference
between 1850–1900 and 1981–2010, calculated using the method from IPCC AR6 WG I
(see caption for Figure 1.12 in that report).
4. The mean and standard deviation of the six estimates were calculated.

42

5. The uncertainty in the IPCC estimate was combined with the standard deviation, assuming
the two are independent and assuming the IPCC uncertainty range (0.54 °C to 0.79 °C) is
representative of a 90% confidence range (1.645 standard deviations).
The number quoted in this report for 2022 (1.15 ± 0.13 °C) was calculated in this way with
1.15 °C being the mean of the six estimates.

ANNUAL TEMPERATURE MAPS
For the map of temperature anomalies for 2022, a median of six data sets was used, regridded
to the spatial grid of the lowest resolution data sets (NOAAGlobalTemp and HadCRUT5),
which are presented on a 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid. The median is used in preference
to the mean to minimize the effect of potential outliers in individual grid cells. The half-range
of the data sets provides an indication of the uncertainty. The spread between the data sets
is largest at high latitudes and in Central Africa, both regions with sparse data coverage.

MARINE HEATWAVE AND MARINE COLD SPELL DATA
Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are categorized as moderate when the sea-surface temperature
(SST) is above the 90th percentile of the climatological distribution for five days or longer;
the subsequent categories are defined with respect to the difference between the SST
and the climatological distribution average: strong, severe or extreme, if that difference is,
respectively, more than two, three or four times the difference between the 90th percentile and
the climatological distribution average (Hobday et al., 2018). MCS categories are analogous
but counting days below the 10th percentile.
The baseline used for MHWs and MCSs is 1982–2011, which is shifted by one year from the
standard normal period of 1981–2010 because the first full year of the satellite SST series on
which it is based (Banzon et al. 2016) is 1982.

et al., 2017). Sea ice concentrations are estimated from microwave radiances measured from
satellites. Extent is the area of ocean grid cells where the sea-ice concentration exceeds 15%.
There are relatively large differences in the absolute extent between data sets, but they agree
well on the year-to-year changes and trends. In this report, NSIDC values are reported for
absolute extents, while rankings are reported for both data sets.

GLACIER DATA
Glacier mass balance data for the global network of reference glaciers are available from the
World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS), https://www.wgms.ch. Data for the 2021–2022
mass balance year are preliminary and are based on a subset of 37 (out of a total of ~42)
WGMS reference glaciers.

GREENLAND AND ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET DATA
Greenland ice sheet mass balance data are reported from three sources. Modelled changes
in surface mass balance and total mass balance from 1985 to 2021 are based on the average
of three regional climate and mass balance models, described in Mankoff et al. (2021).
GRACE and GRACE-FO ice mass time series are calculated using spherical harmonics from
JPL RL06v1, following Velicogna et al. (2020). The degree-1 geocenter terms are calculated
using Sutterley and Velicogna (2019), with C2,0 and C3,0 coefficients from Loomis et al.
(2019). The GRACE/GRACE-FO data are corrected for the long-term trend of glacial isostatic
adjustment from the solid Earth using the regional IJ05 R2 GIA model of Ivins et al. (2013)
over Antarctica and that of Simpson et al. (2009) over Greenland.

In Figure 21, Iceland is shown as being drier than the long-term average. In fact, it was wetter
than average in Iceland during the year (see the annual report from Iceland https://www.
vedur.is/um-vi/frettir/tidarfar-arsins-2022). The discrepancy is likely due to a change in the
way that real time data are processed.
