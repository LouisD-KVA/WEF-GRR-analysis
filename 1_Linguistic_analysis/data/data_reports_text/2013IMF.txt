ASSuMPTIonS AnD ConvEnTIonS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook (WEO). It
has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July 29–August 26,
2013, except for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II), which are assumed
to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will
be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the
Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $104.49 a barrel in 2013 and $101.35 a barrel in 2014 and will
remain unchanged in real terms over the medium term; that the six-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on
U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2013 and 0.6 percent in 2014; that the three-month euro deposit rate
will average 0.2 percent in 2013 and 0.5 percent in 2014; and that the six-month Japanese yen deposit rate will yield on
average 0.2 percent in 2013 and 0.3 percent in 2014. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and
the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would in any event be involved in the projections.
The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through September 23, 2013.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
. . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
–
between years or months (for example, 2012–13 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months;
/
between years or months (for example, 2012/13) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
“Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
“Basis points” refer to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of 1
percentage point).
For some countries, the figures for 2012 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns.
Data refer to calendar years, except for a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the reference periods for each country.
On July 31, 2013, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released the Comprehensive Revision of the National
Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). The revision includes improvements in methodology and data sources as
well as significant changes in definitions and classifications. With this update, the accounts more accurately portray
the evolution of the economy. Most notably, expenditures on research and development activities and for the
creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals are now treated as capital expenditures. Furthermore, the
treatment of defined-benefit pension plans is switched from a cash basis to an accrual basis. The revisions increase
the level of GDP by 3.4 percent and boost the personal savings rate. The revised data also show that the Great
Recession was shallower and the recovery was stronger through the first half of 2012, but also that cyclical weakness was greater during the past year. Overall, the revision does not significantly change the IMF staff’s broad view
on the U.S. economic outlook.
Starting with the July 2013 WEO Update, India’s data and forecasts are presented on a fiscal year basis.
On July 1, 2013, Croatia became the 28th member state of the European Union.
Projections for Cyprus, which were excluded from the April 2013 WEO due to the crisis, are once again
included.
As in the April 2013 WEO, data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
Data for Palau are now included in the Developing Asia region.
Iran’s real GDP growth for 2012 and beyond has not been significantly updated from the April 2013 WEO in
light of the pending publication of national accounts by the central bank and the new authorities’ plans.
Zambia redenominated its currency by replacing 1,000 old Zambian kwacha notes with 1 new Zambian kwacha note.
Local currency data for Zambia are expressed in the new currency starting with the October 2013 WEO database.

If no source is listed on tables and figures, data are drawn from the WEO database.
When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that
is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are not states,
although their statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.
Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless otherwise noted, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.

FuRThER InFoRMATIon AnD DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series
most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the World Economic Outlook are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers
in the context of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and
structural breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques.
IMF staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As
a result, WEO data can differ from other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure, but not
guarantee, their timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. When errors are discovered, there is a concerted effort to
correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are incorporated into the
electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF website (www.imf.org).
All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.
For details on the terms and conditions for usage of the WEO database, please refer to the IMF Copyright and

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international financial
markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information the IMF
staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out in particular by
the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department, European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—together with the
Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and the Fiscal Affairs
Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of Olivier
Blanchard, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Jörg Decressin, Deputy
Director, Research Department, and by Thomas Helbling, Division Chief, Research Department.
The primary contributors to this report are Abdul Abiad, Jaromir Benes, John Bluedorn, Rupa Duttagupta,
Davide Furceri, Jaime Guajardo, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Andrea Pescatori, Damiano Sandri, and John Simon.

The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff from other IMF departments, as well as by
Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on September 23, 2013. However, both projections
and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive Directors or to their
national authorities.

T

he world economy has entered yet another
transition. Advanced economies are
gradually strengthening. At the same time,
growth in emerging market economies has
slowed. This confluence is leading to tensions, with
emerging market economies facing the dual challenges of slowing growth and tighter global financial
conditions.
The U.S. economy remains at the center of events.
Private demand continues to be strong, although
growth has been hobbled this year by excessive fiscal
consolidation. Politics is creating uncertainty about
both the nature and the strength of the fiscal adjustment. The sequester is a bad way to consolidate, and
conflicts around increasing the debt ceiling could lead
to another bout of destabilizing uncertainty and lower
growth. Nevertheless, it is time for monetary policy
to make plans for an exit from both quantitative easing and zero policy rates. While there are no major
conceptual or technical issues involved, the communication problems facing the Federal Reserve are new
and delicate. It is reasonable to expect some volatility
in long rates as Fed policy shifts.
The recovery in Japan has been spurred by Abenomics, but sustaining it will depend on meeting two
major challenges. The first, reflected in the debate
about increasing the consumption tax, is setting the
right pace for fiscal consolidation: consolidating too
slowly will compromise credibility, and moving too
fast will kill growth. The second is implementing a
credible set of structural reforms to transform what is
now a cyclical recovery into sustained growth.
The core economies of Europe show some signs of
recovery. This is the result not of recent major policy
changes but of a change in mood, which nonetheless
could be largely self-fulfilling if consumers and firms
decide to increase spending. Southern periphery countries are still struggling, however. Progress on improving competitiveness and increasing exports is not yet
strong enough to offset depressed internal demand.
In both the core and the periphery, there is lingering uncertainty about bank balance sheets, which
should be reduced by the promised review of banks’

asset quality. Taking the longer view, just as for Japan,
structural reforms are urgently needed to invigorate
the anemic potential growth rates that plague the
region.
The major news at this time comes from emerging
market economies, where growth has declined—often
by more than we previously forecast.
The obvious question is whether this slowdown
reflects cyclical factors or a decrease in potential
output growth. Based on what we know today, the
answer is that it reflects both, albeit to different
degrees in various countries—more cyclical in Russia
and South Africa, more decreased potential in China
and India. Unusually favorable world conditions,
including high commodity prices and rapid financial
market development, increased potential growth in
these economies during the 2000s, and in a number
of them, there was a cyclical component on top. As
commodity prices stabilize and financial conditions
tighten, potential growth is lower, leading in some
cases to a sharp cyclical adjustment.
Confronted with these changing conditions,
governments in emerging market economies face two
challenges. The first is to adjust to lower potential
growth. While some decrease in growth relative to the
2000s is inevitable, structural reforms can help ease
the adjustment and are becoming more urgent. The
list is a familiar one, from rebalancing toward consumption in China to removing barriers to investment
in Brazil and India. The second challenge is to deal
with the cyclical adjustment, and here the standard
advice also applies. Countries with large fiscal deficits
must consolidate. Countries with inflation running
persistently above target must tighten and—often
more important—put in place a more credible monetary policy framework.
The potential impact on these economies of an
increase in U.S. long rates makes this advice even more
relevant. Normalization of interest rates in advanced
economies is likely to lead to a partial reversal of
previous capital flows. As investors repatriate funds to
the United States, countries with weaker fiscal positions or higher inflation are particularly exposed. The

right response is twofold. First, where needed, countries
must put their macro houses in order by clarifying their
monetary policy framework and maintaining fiscal
sustainability. Second, they must let the exchange rate
depreciate in response to outflows. Foreign currency
exposure and balance-sheet effects, which have created
adverse effects in the past, are more limited today, and
emerging market economies should be able to adjust to
the changed environment without a major crisis.
In short, the recovery from the crisis continues,
albeit too slowly. The focus at this time is on emerging market economies—specifically, on the combina-

xiv

tion of slower growth and tighter financial conditions
triggered by U.S. monetary policy. But, in the background, other legacies of the crisis still linger and may
well come back to the fore. Public debt and, in some
cases, private debt remain very high, and fiscal sustainability is not a given. The architecture of the financial
system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear.
These issues will continue to shape the evolution of the
world economy for many years to come.

lobal growth is in low gear, the drivers of
activity are changing, and downside risks
persist. China and a growing number of
emerging market economies are coming
off cyclical peaks. Their growth rates are projected to
remain much above those of the advanced economies
but below the elevated levels seen in recent years, for
both cyclical and structural reasons. The United States
has seen several quarters of solid private demand.
Although public sector demand has been pushing in
the opposite direction, this counterforce will diminish
in 2014, setting the stage for higher growth. Japan’s
economy is enjoying a vigorous rebound but will lose
steam in 2014 as fiscal policy tightens. The euro area
is crawling out of recession, but activity is forecast to
stay tepid. In these three advanced economies, much
slack remains and inflation pressure is expected to stay
subdued.
These changing growth dynamics raise new policy
challenges, and policy spillovers may pose greater
concern. Two recent developments will likely shape
the path of the global economy in the near term. First,
markets are increasingly convinced that U.S. monetary
policy is reaching a turning point. Talk by the Federal
Reserve about tapering its quantitative easing measures
led to an unexpectedly large increase in long-term yields
in the United States and many other economies, much
of which has not been reversed despite a subsequent
decision by the Federal Reserve to maintain the amount
of asset purchases and policy actions in other countries.
Second, there is strengthening conviction that China
will grow more slowly over the medium term than in
the recent past––previous expectations that the Chinese
authorities would react with a strong stimulus if output
growth were to decline toward the government target of
7½ percent have had to be revised.
The October 2013 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR) explains how spillovers from these changed
perceptions have already provided a sort of mini stress
test for financial systems. In emerging markets, the
spillovers interacted with existing vulnerabilities and
triggered both desirable and undesirable adjustments.
The desirable adjustments feature reallocated capital

flows and currency depreciations that help attenuate
growing competitiveness problems: typically, the currencies that depreciated most were those that the 2013
Pilot External Sector Report had assessed as overvalued.
At the same time, however, volatility has gone up, and
the risk of overshooting could weigh on investment
and growth.
Looking ahead, global activity is expected to
strengthen moderately but the risks to the forecast
remain to the downside. The impulse is projected to
come from the advanced economies, where output is
expected to expand at a pace of about 2 percent in
2014, about ¾ percentage point more than in 2013.
Drivers of the projected uptick are a stronger U.S.
economy, an appreciable reduction in fiscal tightening
(except in Japan), and highly accommodative monetary conditions. Growth in the euro area will be held
back by the very weak economies in the periphery.
Emerging market and developing economies are projected to expand by about 5 percent in 2014, as fiscal
policy is forecast to stay broadly neutral and real interest rates to remain relatively low. Unemployment will
remain unacceptably high in many advanced economies as well as in various emerging market economies,
notably those in the Middle East and North Africa.
Some new downside risks have come to the fore,
while old risks largely remain. At the time of writing, a political standoff in the United States has led
to a shutdown of its federal government. The projections assume that the shutdown is short, discretionary
public spending is approved and executed as assumed
in the forecast, and the debt ceiling––which may be
reached by mid-October––is raised promptly. There is
uncertainty on all three accounts. While the damage
to the U.S. economy from a short shutdown is likely
to be limited, a longer shutdown could be quite harmful. And, even more importantly, a failure to promptly
raise the debt ceiling, leading to a U.S. selective
default, could seriously damage the global economy.
Beyond immediate risks, the October 2013 Global
Financial Stability Report underscores that the prospect
of reduced monetary accommodation in the United
States may cause additional market adjustments and

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

expose areas of financial excess and systemic vulnerability. In this setting, emerging market economies
may face exchange rate and financial market overshooting as they also cope with weaker economic outlooks
and rising domestic vulnerabilities; some could even
face severe balance of payments disruptions. In the
euro area, risks continue to flow from the unfinished
business of restoring bank health and credit transmission and from corporate debt overhang. Insufficient
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms in Japan
could trigger serious downside risks, especially of the
fiscal variety. In this regard, the October 2013 Fiscal
Monitor emphasizes that the large public debt stocks
and the absence of medium-term adjustment plans
with concrete measures and strong entitlement reforms
in key advanced economies, notably Japan and the
United States, combine to keep fiscal risks at a stubbornly high level. Fiscal vulnerabilities are also building
in emerging market and low-income economies to
varying degrees. In the meantime, geopolitical risks
have returned.
Policymakers have shown their determination to
keep the global economy away from the precipice.
Aside from new cliff events, a growing worry is a
prolonged period of sluggish global growth. A plausible downside scenario for the medium term would
be characterized by a continuation of only modest
growth in the euro area because of persistent financial
fragmentation and unexpectedly high legacy effects
from private indebtedness, a hobbling of emerging market economies by imbalances and supplyside bottlenecks, and prolonged deflation in Japan.
Meanwhile, the end of U.S. quantitative easing could
come with a greater and longer-lasting tightening of
global financial conditions than is presently expected.
As a result, the global economy could grow by only
slightly more than 3 percent a year over the medium
term, instead of reaccelerating to over 4 percent.
What is more worrisome, monetary policy in the
advanced economies could be stuck at the zero interest bound for many years. Over time, worrisomely
high public debt in all major advanced economies
and persistent financial fragmentation in the euro
area could then trigger new crises.

xvi

Forestalling the plausible downside scenario or the
advent of new crises requires further policy efforts,
mainly in the advanced economies. Old challenges to
be addressed include repairing financial systems and
adopting a banking union in the euro area and developing and implementing strong plans, supported by
concrete measures, for medium-term fiscal adjustment
and entitlement reform in Japan and the United States.
Furthermore, in the euro area and Japan, in particular,
there is a need to boost potential output, including
through reforms that level the playing field between
insiders and outsiders in labor markets and ease barriers to entry into product and services markets. A new
challenge is for U.S. monetary policy to change tack
carefully in response to changing growth, inflation, and
financial stability prospects. Excessive tightening may
be difficult to undo, and global growth may well fall
short of, rather than exceed, medium-term growth and
inflation projections.
Emerging market and developing economies are facing new policy challenges. The appropriate policy mix
and the pace of adjustment will differ across economies,
in view of the differences in output gaps, inflation
pressure, central bank credibility, room for fiscal policy
maneuvering, and the nature of vulnerabilities. However, many economies share five policy priorities. First,
policymakers should allow exchange rates to respond to
changing fundamentals but may need to guard against
risks of disorderly adjustment, including through intervention to smooth excessive volatility. Second, where
monetary policy frameworks are less credible, efforts
may need to focus more on providing a strong nominal anchor. Third, prudential actions should be taken
to safeguard financial stability, given legacy risks from
recent credit booms and new risks from capital flows.
Fourth, fiscal consolidation should proceed, unless
activity threatens to deteriorate very sharply and funding
conditions permit fiscal easing—issues discussed in more
detail in the October 2013 Fiscal Monitor. Fifth, many
economies need a new round of structural reforms,
including investment in public infrastructure, removal of
barriers to entry in product and services markets, and in
the case of China, rebalancing growth away from investment toward consumption.

Global growth is still weak, its underlying dynamics are changing, and the risks to the forecast remain
to the downside. As a result, new policy challenges are
arising and policy spillovers may pose greater concern.
In particular, markets are increasingly convinced that
U.S. monetary policy is reaching a turning point, and
this has led to an unexpectedly large increase in long-term
yields in the United States and many other economies,
notwithstanding the Federal Reserve’s recent decision
to maintain its asset purchases. This change could pose
risks for emerging market economies, where activity is
slowing and asset quality weakening. Careful policy
implementation and clear communication on the part
of the Federal Reserve will be essential. Also, growth in
China is slowing, which will affect many other economies,
notably the commodity exporters among the emerging
market and developing economies. At the same time, old
problems––a fragmented financial system in the euro
area and worrisomely high public debt in all major
advanced economies––remain unresolved and could
trigger new crises. The major economies must urgently
adopt policies that improve their prospects; otherwise the
global economy may well settle into a subdued mediumterm growth trajectory. The United States and Japan
must develop and implement strong plans with concrete
measures for medium-term fiscal adjustment and entitlement reform, and the euro area must develop a stronger
currency union and clean up its financial systems. China
should provide a permanent boost to private consumption spending to rebalance the growth of demand away
from exports and investment. Many emerging market
economies need a new round of structural reforms.

Growth Dynamics Further Diverge
Global growth remains in low gear, averaging only
2½ percent during the first half of 2013, which is
about the same pace as in the second half of 2012.
In a departure from previous developments since the
Great Recession, the advanced economies have recently
gained some speed, while the emerging market econo-

mies have slowed (Figure 1.1, panel 1). The emerging
market economies, however, continue to account for
the bulk of global growth. Within each group, there
are still broad differences in growth and position in the
cycle.
The latest indicators point to somewhat better prospects in the near term but different growth dynamics
between the major economies (Figure 1.2). World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections continue to foresee
a modest acceleration of activity, driven largely by the
advanced economies (Table 1.1).
• The impulse to global growth is expected to come
mainly from the United States (Figure 1.3, panel
1), where activity will move into higher gear as
fiscal consolidation eases and monetary conditions
stay supportive. Following sharp fiscal tightening earlier this year, activity in the United States is
already regaining speed, helped by a recovering real
estate sector (Figure 1.4, panel 5), higher household
wealth, easier bank lending conditions (Figure 1.4,
panel 3), and more borrowing (Figure 1.4, panels 2
and 4). The fiscal tightening in 2013 is estimated to
be 2½ percent of GDP (Table A8 in the Statistical
Appendix). However, this will ease to ¾ percent of
GDP in 2014, helping raise the rate of economic
growth to 2½ percent, from 1½ percent in 2013
(see Table 1.1). This assumes that discretionary public spending is authorized and executed as projected
and the debt ceiling is raised in a timely manner.
• In Japan, activity is projected to slow in response to
tightening fiscal policy in 2014. Thus far, the data
point to an impressive pickup in output in response
to the Bank of Japan’s Quantitative and Qualitative
Monetary Easing and the government’s 1.4 percent
of GDP fiscal stimulus to end deflation and raise
growth. IMF staff estimates suggest that the new
policies may have boosted GDP by about 1 percent,
although wage increases have remained subdued.
As stimulus and reconstruction spending unwind
and consumption tax hikes are implemented, the
structural deficit will drop––the projections assume
a decline by 2½ percent of GDP in 2014, which

Real GDP growth has disappointed in the emerging market and developing economies, while it
has been broadly in line with projections in advanced economies. The reasons for the weaker
growth differ across emerging market and developing economies and may include tightening
capacity constraints, stabilizing or falling commodity prices, less policy support, and slowing
credit after a period of rapid ﬁnancial deepening.

Industrial production recovered modestly in the advanced economies but is still slowing in the
emerging market and developing economies. There are now some signs of below-trend but
rising growth in emerging market economies. Activity remains very subdued in the periphery
of theeuro area. Together with the MENA region, the euro area is seeing another increase in an
already high unemployment rate.

Figure 1.3. GDP Growth Forecasts

Figure 1.4. Monetary Conditions in Advanced Economies

Activity will continue to pick up in the advanced economies. In many emerging market and
developing economies, the projected pickup is now relatively more modest.

Expectations for policy rate hikes in the major advanced economies have been pulled forward.
Lending continues to contract in the euro area, especially the periphery, but is rising in the
United States. Lending conditions are still tightening in the euro area, even if to a diminishing
extent, while they are continuing to loosen in the United States. The Federal Reserve’s and
Bank of Japan’s balance sheets continue to expand, while that of the ECB contracts as
periphery banks repay their long-term loans. House prices are coming back in the
United States.

is expected to drag down growth from 2 percent
in 2013 to 1¼ percent in 2014. However, if another
“stimulus package” does go ahead, fiscal drag would
be lower and growth higher than presently projected.
• In the euro area, business confidence indicators suggest that activity is close to stabilizing in
the periphery and already recovering in the core
economies. In 2014, a major reduction in the pace
of fiscal tightening, to less than ½ percent of GDP
from about 1 percent of GDP in 2013, is in the offing (see Figure 1.5, panel 1). However, the support
for activity from the reduction in the pace of fiscal
tightening is dampened by tight credit conditions in
the periphery (see Figure 1.4, panel 2). Thus, economic growth is expected to reach only 1 percent,
after contracting by about ½ percent in 2013.
In emerging market and developing economies,
exports driven by stronger advanced economy growth
and solid consumption encouraged by low levels of
unemployment are expected to support activity. Fiscal policies are projected to be broadly neutral (see
Figure 1.5, panel 1), and real interest rates are still low
in many economies, which should foster investment.
However, external funding conditions have tightened
and there is increasing evidence for supply-side constraints. Importantly, for many of these economies the
risks to growth are on the downside (see below).
• The forecasts assume that Chinese authorities do not
enact major stimulus and accept somewhat lower
growth, consistent with the transition to a more
balanced and sustainable growth path. The forecast for real GDP growth for China has thus been
reduced to about 7½ percent for 2013–14. This
slowdown will reverberate across developing Asia,
where growth is expected to remain between 6¼
and 6½ percent in 2013–14 (Figure 1.3, panel 3).
The projections for real GDP growth in India have
also been marked down significantly, with growth
foreseen at 3¾ percent in 2013 and about 5 percent
in 2014. Some economies are seeing an appreciable
tightening of financial conditions because of the
recent global reversal in capital flows.
• In Latin America, projections assume that the recent
repricing of stocks and bonds was largely a one-time
event, with currency depreciations partly offsetting the effect on activity of tightening financial
conditions. However, there is a lot of uncertainty
about this at the moment. The recovery in Brazil
is assumed to continue at a moderate pace, helped
by the depreciation of the exchange rate, a pick-up

Fiscal policy will tighten less in the advanced economies in 2014 and stay broadly neutral in
emerging market and developing economies. Among advanced economies, the pace of
tightening will fall off appreciably in the euro area and the United States. However, this will be
partly offset by tightening in Japan. Public debt will remain very high in the advanced
economies in the medium term, while declining to about 30 percent of GDP in the emerging
market and developing economies.

Figure 1.6. Global Inﬂation
(Year-over-year percent change unless indicated otherwise)
Inﬂation pressure is generally subdued. In the euro area, it is expected to stay appreciably
below the European Central Bank’s objective for several years; in Japan it will bounce up in
response to consumption tax increases and rising inﬂation expectations in response to the
new monetary policy. Consistent with slowing activity and stabilizing commodity prices,
inﬂation has eased in emerging market and developing economies.

in consumption, and policies aimed at boosting
investment. Mexico will receive a fillip from the
rebound in U.S. activity, following a disappointing
first half in 2013. The acceleration of activity across
the continent, however, will be modest (Figure 1.3,
panel 4).
• In sub-Saharan Africa, commodity-related projects
are expected to support higher growth. Exchange
rates adjusted sharply, but external financing has
resumed and the forecasts include no further
disruptions.
• In the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan activity is projected to accelerate in 2014,
supported by a modest recovery in oil production.
Non-oil activity will remain generally robust in the
oil-exporting economies, thanks in part to high
public spending. By contrast, many oil-importing
economies continue to struggle with difficult sociopolitical and security conditions.
• In central and eastern Europe, growth rates are
projected to gradually increase, helped by recovering
demand in Europe and improving domestic financial conditions. With a few exceptions, the effects of
externally induced increases in interest rates will be
limited and partly offset by currency depreciations.
Many economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States are still seeing strong domestic demand;
they will benefit from more external demand,
although some will suffer from the recent external
funding shocks.

Inflation pressure Is Subdued
The differing growth dynamics between the major
economies are projected to come with subdued inflation pressure, for two reasons. First, the pickup in
activity in the advanced economies will not lead to a
major reduction in output gaps, which remain large
(see Table A8 in the Statistical Appendix). Second,
commodity prices have fallen amid improved supply
and lower demand growth from key emerging market
economies, notably China (see the Special Feature).
The latest projections for both fuel and nonfuel prices
indicate modest declines in both 2013 and 2014.
In advanced economies, inflation is currently running below target, at about 1½ percent on average
(Figure 1.6, panel 1). The return to target is projected
to be slow given that output is expected to return to
potential only slowly (Figure 1.6, panels 2 and 3). In

international monetary Fund | October 2013

chapter 1

the United States, the decline in the unemployment
rate partly reflects reductions in labor force participation due to demographic trends as well as discouraged
workers dropping out of the labor force. Discouraged
workers are likely to return to the labor market as
prospects improve, and thus wage growth will be sluggish for some time. In the euro area, a weak economy
and downward pressure on wages in the periphery are
forecast to hold inflation to about 1½ percent in the
medium term, falling short of the European Central
Bank’s (ECB’s) inflation objective. For Japan, the
projection reflects a temporary surge in the price level
in response to the consumption tax hikes in 2014
and 2015; excluding the effect of the consumption
tax hike, inflation is projected to move up only very
gradually, reaching the 2 percent target sometime
in 2016–17.
Inflation is expected to move broadly sideways at
around 5-6 percent in emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.6, panel 1). The drop in
commodity prices and the downshift in growth will
reduce price pressures, but capacity constraints and
the pass-through from weakening exchange rates will
offset this downward pressure to some degree. Another
counterpush to lower inflation will be strong domestic demand pressure in a few of these economies––as
evidenced by many external overheating indicators that
still flash yellow or red (Figure 1.7).

Monetary policies are Gradually Moving in
Different Directions
Monetary conditions have stayed supportive globally, although they will increasingly start to reflect the
changing growth dynamics in the major economies.
Growing uncertainty about the implications for future
policies has prompted financial markets to anticipate
a greater degree of U.S. monetary policy tightening
than in recent WEO forecasts, and this has caused
larger-than-expected spillovers on emerging market
economies.
The April 2013 WEO argued that “markets may
have moved ahead of the real economy” but judged
that near-term financial risks had eased. Since then,
perceptions have changed in two important respects:
• There is strengthening conviction in markets that
U.S. monetary policy will soon reach a turning
point. Following the midyear policy meetings of
the Federal Reserve and communication hinting

Global ProsPects and Policies

at tapering of asset purchases, market participants
raised their expectations for the policy rate (see Figure 1.8, panel 1). Contrary to expectations of many
in the markets, however, the Federal Reserve decided
not to begin tapering in September. This brought
the yield curve down modestly. Nonetheless, since
end May 2013, long-term bond yields are up some
100 basis points, as are fixed rates on 30-year mortgages (see Figure 1.8, panel 2).
• In China, the authorities have attempted to rein in
the flow of credit, including through shadow banks,
preferring more targeted and limited support (such
as to small businesses) over widespread stimulus.
These actions are consistent with their intention to
move to a more balanced and sustainable growth
path. Reflecting this, and the second quarter outturn, projections for growth this year have been
marked down from 7¾ to 7½ percent.
Financial conditions have tightened globally in
response to the rise in U.S. long-term bond yields (see
Figure 1.8, panels 2 and 5)—spillovers that are not
unusual from a historical perspective (Box 1.1).
In the euro area, perceptions of earlier-than-expected
U.S. tightening led to asset price losses. Subsequent
developments brought about rallies—notably an ECB
statement that it expects policy rates to remain at current levels or lower for an extended period because of a
weak economy. Japanese long-term bond yields are up
modestly owing to foreign as well as domestic factors.
In emerging markets, the spillovers interacted with
weaker growth prospects and rising vulnerabilities.
Capital outflows led to a significant tightening of
financial conditions for some economies over the summer (Figure 1.9, panel 1). Markdowns to projections
for Chinese growth and imports, notably commodities,
have added to the repricing. Sovereign bond yields are
up some 80 basis points since the beginning of 2013,
pulled up by fairly large increases in Brazil, Indonesia,
Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey. Equity markets
have been retreating to varying degrees, with the largest corrections typically in those economies with the
largest downward revisions to growth forecasts and the
largest recent inflows of capital (Figure 1.9, panels 5
and 6)––so far this year, they are down some 10 percent (see Figure 1.8, panel 3). Indicators of equity
market volatility are up modestly as are risk spreads
(Figure 1.9, panel 2). Capital outflows typically led to
currency depreciations (Figure 1.10, panels 1 and 2).
The specific developments are discussed in more detail

Figure 1.7. Overheating Indicators for the G20 Economies
Most indicators point to ample cyclical slack in the advanced economies but capacity
constraints in emerging economies. The red and yellow external indicators for Japan point to
a healthy demand-rebalancing process, which has not yet made much progress in Germany.
In Indonesia, India, Turkey, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, the red and yellow external
indicators point to external vulnerabilities.

Regarding ﬁnancial developments, equity prices are ﬂagged as high in the advanced economies
but other valuation indicators are within historical bounds. Credit continues to expand rapidly in
several emerging market economies.

Note: For each indicator, except as noted below, economies are assigned colors based on projected 2013 values relative to their precrisis (1997–2006) average. Each indicator is scored as red
= 2, yellow = 1, and blue = 0; summary scores are calculated as the sum of selected component scores divided by the maximum possible sum of those scores. Summary blocks are assigned
red if the summary score is greater than or equal to 0.66, yellow if greater than or equal to 0.33 but less than 0.66, and blue if less than 0.33. When data are missing, no color is assigned.
Arrows up (down) indicate hotter (colder) conditions compared with the April 2013 WEO.
1
Output more than 2.5 percent above the precrisis trend is indicated by red. Output less than 2.5 percent below the trend is indicated by blue. Output within ±2.5 percent of the precrisis trend
is indicated by yellow.
2
The following scoring methodology is used for the following inﬂation-targeting economies: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, and United Kingdom.
End-of-period inﬂation above the country’s target inﬂation band from the midpoint is assigned yellow; end-of-period inﬂation more than two times the inﬂation band from the midpoint is
assigned red. For all other economies in the chart, red is assigned if end-of-period inﬂation is approximately 10 percent or higher, yellow if it is approximately 5 to 9 percent, and blue if it is less
than 5 percent.
3
Capital inﬂows refer to the latest available value relative to the 1997–2006 average of capital inﬂows as a percent of GDP.
4
The indicators for credit growth, house price growth, and share price growth refer to the annual percentage change relative to output growth.
5
Arrows in the ﬁscal balance column represent the forecast change in the structural balance as a percent of GDP over the period 2012–13. An improvement of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is
indicated by an up arrow; a deterioration of more than 0.5 percent of GDP is indicated by a down arrow. A change in ﬁscal balance between –0.5 percent of GDP and 0.5 percent of GDP is
indicated by a sideways arrow.
6
Real policy interest rates below zero are identiﬁed by a down arrow; real interest rates above 3 percent are identiﬁed by an up arrow; real interest rates between zero and 3 percent are
identiﬁed by a sideways arrow. Real policy interest rates are deﬂated by two-year-ahead inﬂation projections.
7
The data for Argentina are ofﬁcially reported data. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the quality of the
ofﬁcial GDP and CPI-GBA data. Alternative data sources have shown signiﬁcantly lower real growth than the ofﬁcial data since 2008 and considerably higher inﬂation rates than the ofﬁcial data
since 2007. In this context, the IMF is also using alternative estimates of GDP growth and CPI inﬂation for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.

Financial conditions have become more volatile again, as expectations about U.S. monetary
policy tightening have been pulled forward. Equity markets have been buoyant. Long-term
U.S.bond yields are up, but those in Japan and core Europe have increased to a much lesser
extent. Spreads on euro area periphery sovereign bonds have moved up modestly; periphery
banks have continued to repay ECB loans.

Expectations for earlier U.S. monetary policy tightening and slowing growth in emerging
market economies prompted major capital outﬂows from emerging markets during June 2013.
These typically led to a widening of risk spreads and equity market losses. The latter were
larger in economies that previously saw larger downward revisions to their growth projections.
Bond and equity outﬂows were bigger from economies that previously saw bigger inﬂows––
these are typically the deepest and most liquid emerging markets. Large outﬂows came with
exchange rate depreciations.

Figure 1.10. Exchange Rates and Reserves
Nominal exchange rates of various emerging market economy currencies have depreciated
signiﬁcantly as their economies have weakened––since the beginning of the year, the
Brazilian real, Indian rupee, and South African rand have depreciated by 8–16 percent against
the U.S. dollar. For Brazil and India, much of the weakening occurred concomitantly with the
recent reassessment about prospects for U.S. monetary policy. In general, currencies that
were considered overvalued relative to medium-term fundamentals depreciated, while those
that were considered undervalued appreciated. Reserves accumulation has recently picked up
again in developing Asia.

in the October 2013 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR).
The WEO projections assume that the recent repricing of emerging market bonds and equities was largely
a one-time event but there is a lot of uncertainty about
this at the moment. The resulting tighter external
financial conditions and lower net capital inflow levels
should reduce activity in emerging market economies,
all else equal.
Model-based estimates suggest that in most of the
major emerging market economies the externally
induced tightening since late May 2013, should it
persist, could reduce GDP by ¼ to 1 percent (Figure 1.11). However, exchange rate depreciation can do
much to buffer externally induced tightening. Further
considerations include the following:
• Although the U.S. recovery is set to accelerate, based of the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance, WEO projections continue to assume that
the first U.S. policy rate hike will not take place
before 2016. The reasons are that inflation is forecast to remain below 2½ percent, inflation expectations to stay well anchored, and the unemployment
rate to remain above 6½ percent until then. The
forecasts assume that Federal Reserve asset purchases
are scaled back very gradually starting later this year.
The effect of the purchases on activity was widely
estimated to have been limited, and their termination is not expected to have a major effect. Accordingly, the projected path for longer-term government
bond yields in 2014 has been raised modestly, by
some 40 basis points relative to the April 2013
WEO. In short, the assumptions are for U.S. monetary and financial conditions to generate a benign,
growth-friendly environment. Markets, however,
see a significant probability of earlier tightening
(see Figure 1.8, panel 1), and, as discussed below,
a less benign trajectory for financial conditions is a
distinct risk.
• Markets continue to expect a prolonged period of
low interest rates and unconventional monetary support for the euro area and Japan (Figure 1.4, panel
1). In Japan, further monetary easing may be needed
to drive up inflation (excluding consumption tax
hikes) to 2 percent by 2015. In the euro area, the
dominant concern is still sluggish activity and low
inflation, including disinflation or deflation pressure
in the periphery. The projections assume no material
changes to sovereign spreads in the periphery. They

Figure 1.11. Financial Conditions in Emerging Markets since
May 2013
Since the end of May, Federal Reserve communications indicating that tapering of asset
purchases could begin later this year have had a substantial impact on ﬁnancial markets.
Interest rates have increased, equity prices have declined, and exchange rates have
depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar in many emerging market economies. Here the G20
Model (G20MOD) is used to estimate the potential macroeconomic implications of these
developments. It is assumed that the changes in interest rates,1 equity prices, and exchange
rates observed between the end of May and September 20 are maintained for a full year in
G20 economies.2 The estimates are generated assuming that monetary policy in all countries
and regions cannot respond to these developments. The changes in ﬁnancial market prices
and their resulting impact on activity in G20 emerging market economies are presented in the
bar charts below. The emerging markets considered experience a decline in GDP, ranging from
roughly 2½ percent in Turkey to ¼ percent in Mexico. Those countries estimated to experience
smaller declines in GDP have the impact of higher interest rates partially offset by both
currency depreciation and improvements in equity prices. Those countries estimated to
experience the largest declines have the impact of higher interest rates compounded by
declines in equity prices.

For all countries except India, the 10-year government bond rate is used to capture the
change in interest rates. For India, the 1-year government bond rate is used because it is a
better proxy for the tightening that has occurred in ﬁnancial conditions in India since end-May.

Some of the changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices likely reﬂect some

also assume that some tightening of credit conditions will continue (see Figure 1.4, panel 3). The
major factor is banks’ concerns about the economic
environment and their need to improve their balance sheets.

Medium-term prospects for emerging Market economies
are Weaker
Emerging market and developing economy growth
rates are now down some 3 percentage points
from 2010 levels, with Brazil, China, and India
accounting for about two-thirds of the decline (see Figure 1.1, panel 2). Together with recent forecast disappointments, this growth decline has prompted further
downgrades to medium-term output projections for
emerging market economies. Projections for 2016 real
GDP levels for Brazil, China, and India have been
successively reduced by some 8 to 14 percent over the
past two years. Together, the downward revisions for
these three economies account for about three-quarters
of the overall reduction in projections for mediumterm output for the emerging market and developing
economies as a group (Figure 1.12, panel 4).
Postcrisis WEO projections typically assumed that
the emerging market and developing economies of Latin
America and Asia would avoid the large, permanent output losses that were predicted for the crisis-hit economies (Figure 1.13). The pessimistic April 2009 WEO
projections, made in the wake of the Lehman Brothers
collapse, were repeatedly upgraded for these economies
(Figure 1.13, panels 5 and 6). Subsequently, however,
the projections were revised downward. Among the
other regions, large downgrades materialized only in
the euro area periphery as it fell into crisis (Figure 1.13,
panel 4). Thus, it seems that domestic factors have
played a major role in the slowdown of the emerging
market and developing economies. The specific reasons
for lower growth differ, and clear diagnoses are hard
to obtain. IMF staff analysis suggests that cyclical and
structural factors are at play. This seems to be the case
for Brazil, India, China, and South Africa (Box 1.2).
• Following the Great Recession, most of these
economies enjoyed vigorous, cyclical rebounds.
Expansionary macroeconomic policies helped buffer
the loss of demand from the advanced economies.
Financial factors amplified the cyclical rebound
from the recession. In China, credit policy was used
deliberately to inject stimulus in the face of flag-

Economies

Figure 1.13. Real GDP Projections: Past and Current

Output in developing Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa is still above precrisis
trends, but WEO output gaps do not point to output running beyond capacity. Credit in these
economies has run up sharply relative to output; in some economies, it continues to do so at a
time of slowing growth. In response to repeated disappointments during the past two years,
IMF country desks have revised down their estimates of the level of output in 2016. The
downward revisions are particularly large for Brazil, China, and India.
1. Output Relative to Precrisis Trends in WEO Estimates in 20131
(percent of potential or precrisis trend GDP)

An assessment of past WEO forecasts reveals that those made in September 2008, just before
the Lehman failure, have proved too optimistic for all economies; the forecasts that came soon
afterward, in April 2009, were too pessimistic for the emerging market economies in Asia,
Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa. During October 2010–October 2011, forecasts settled
broadly around their current proﬁle, with two notable exceptions. First, the euro area fell into a
crisis, which started with Greece in spring 2010 and broadened in 2011. Second, after
forecast upgrades during 2010, emerging market economies experienced serial growth
disappointments.

ging foreign demand. Capital inflows attracted by
higher yields and better growth prospects than in
the advanced economies supported the expansion
of credit and activity. By 2010, three out of these
four economies (the exception was South Africa)
operated above capacity. During 2011–13, policies
changed course and growth decelerated.
• Although the growth rate declined, headline inflation did not. In several of these economies, core
inflation actually increased, suggesting that part of
the 3 percentage point decline in growth since 2010
is due to lower potential output and is consistent
with reports about bottlenecks in labor markets,
infrastructure, energy, real estate, and financial
systems in most of these economies. The deeper reasons for the structural slowdowns are discussed further in the 2013 Article IV consultation reports for
these economies. Suffice it to say here that in China
the credit policy contributed to an investment boom
that has created a good deal of excess capacity, since
capital accumulation has been running well ahead of
domestic demand. In Brazil and India, infrastructure
and regulatory bottlenecks slowed output supply in
the face of still-strong domestic demand. As a result,
external pressures have grown in these economies
(see Figure 1.7).
Looking ahead, medium-term growth in the emerging market and developing economies is projected to
reach 5½ percent. In historical context, this forecast
is still well above the 3¾ percent growth rate for the
decade leading into the 1997–98 Asian crisis. Likewise, the current forecasts for developing Asia, Latin
America, and sub-Saharan Africa place output above
the favorable 1996–2006 trends. Even if current
projections turn out to be somewhat optimistic, these
economies will still have achieved a continual and
fairly rapid convergence of per capita incomes toward
those of the advanced economies.

external Sector Developments
World trade reflects the weak momentum in global
activity (Figure 1.14, panel 2). Although there is some
concern that slow trade growth could also reflect
diminishing productivity gains from trade liberalization
under the World Trade Organization umbrella, there is
no strong evidence yet to support this.
Global current account imbalances narrowed
in 2011–12 and are projected to decrease modestly in
the medium term, helped by lower surpluses among

Global ProsPects and Policies

Figure 1.14. Global Trade and Imbalances
The latest slowdown in global trade is broadly consistent with the slowdown in global GDP. It
has meant that global imbalances have declined modestly again. Whether imbalances stay
narrow or widen again in the medium term depends on the extent to which output losses
relative to precrisis trends are largely permanent: WEO projections assume they largely are
consistent with historical evidence.

the energy exporters (Figure 1.14, panel 1). During
the past few years, a notable development has been the
larger-than-projected increase in the current account
surplus of the euro area. This increase reflects import
compression and some relative price adjustment in the
economies of the periphery (Box 1.3). However, rebalancing of demand in the core current account surplus
economies remains limited.
Policy has played a limited role in narrowing global
imbalances. In the future, fiscal consolidation in deficit
economies would hold back the cyclical recovery of
import demand. Achieving stronger growth in major
surplus economies will thus require that these economies promote a sustained expansion of their domestic

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

demand, in particular of private consumption in China
and investment in Germany.
Exchange rate movements—appreciation in surplus
economies, depreciation in deficit economies—have
generally supported rebalancing (Figure 1.10, panel
1). The 2013 Pilot External Sector Report’s assessment
of exchange rate levels suggest that the real effective
exchange rates of the largest economies are not far
from levels consistent with medium-term fundamentals. In particular, any undervaluation of the Japanese
yen that may have emerged recently would be corrected if strong medium-term fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms are implemented.
The recent, substantial nominal exchange rate
depreciations against the U.S. dollar in some emerging
market currencies are broadly consistent with corrections in exchange rate overvaluations (Figure 1.10,
panel 2). In real effective terms, the depreciations have
been more moderate, partly reflecting higher inflation
than in trading partners. Many economies intervened
in foreign exchange markets (Brazil, India, Indonesia,
Peru, Poland, Russia, Turkey), and some also resorted
to capital flow management measures to discourage
outflows (India) or encourage inflows (Brazil, India,
Indonesia).

Downside risks persist
Risks to the WEO projections remain to the downside.
An important concern is prolonged sluggish growth.
Quantitative indicators point to no major change
to risks over the near term. However, after considerable improvement before the April 2013 WEO, the
qualitative assessment is that uncertainty has increased
again. The main reason is that financial conditions
have tightened in unexpected ways, while prospects for
activity have not improved. This has raised concerns
about emerging market economies. In the meantime,
many risks related to the advanced economies have
not been addressed. Moreover, geopolitical risks have
returned. Nonetheless, risks remain better balanced
than in October 2012 because confidence has risen in
the sustainability of the U.S. recovery and the longterm viability of the euro area.
A quantitative risk assessment
The fan chart for the world GDP growth forecast
through 2014 is narrower than that in the April 2013
WEO, largely because of lower “baseline uncertainty”

14

as the time span of the forecast has decreased by six
months (Figure 1.15, panel 1). It remains appreciably
narrower than that for an equal-length horizon in the
October 2012 WEO. For example, the probability of
global growth falling to less than 2 percent in 2014
is quite low, at about 6 percent, whereas in October 2012, the equivalent probability, through 2013,
stood at 17 percent.
The IMF staff’s Global Projection Model also shows
a major improvement relative to one year ago. For the
period 2013:Q2–2014:Q1 the probability of recession is close to 30 percent in the euro area; for the
United States, it has dropped to about 10 percent;
in Japan it is very low (Figure 1.16, panel 1). Moving into 2013:Q3–2014:Q4, the probability jumps
to about 20 percent for Japan, assuming considerable
fiscal tightening does take place. Deflation risks remain
elevated in Japan, despite the new inflation target, and
in the euro area, particularly in the periphery (Figure 1.16, panels 2 and 3).
A qualitative risk assessment
Two risks identified in the April 2013 WEO have
materialized already: the U.S. budget sequester and
lower growth prospects and capital outflows for emerging market economies. In the meantime, some unanticipated risks related to U.S. monetary conditions and
emerging market economies have come to pass.
Short-term risks
• Adjustment fatigue and general policy backtracking in
a financially fragmented euro area: A specific concern
was that the events in Cyprus could amplify financial fragmentation. Although further fragmentation
did not happen, progress in reintegrating financial
markets has been very limited. At the same time,
signs of adjustment fatigue are evident in political
disagreements. Absent a true banking union, including a strong single resolution mechanism backed by
a common fiscal backstop, financial markets remain
highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment.
• The U.S. budget sequester, federal government shutdown,
and debt ceiling: Contrary to the U.S. fiscal policy
assumptions in the April 2013 WEO, which envisaged that the budget sequester would be replaced
with back-loaded measures at the end of fiscal
year 2013 (September 30, 2013), the sequester is now
likely to remain in effect in the coming fiscal year. As
a result, U.S. growth for 2013–14 has been revised

Figure 1.16. Recession and Deﬂation Risks

Figure 1.15. Risks to the Global Outlook
The recent bout of ﬁnancial volatility has not come with an appreciable widening of the fan
chart, which indicates the degree of uncertainty about the global outlook. The chart remains
noticeably narrower than in October 2012. For 2013, oil markets and analysts’ forecasts of
the term spread indicate downside risks. For 2014, the skew of analysts’ forecasts for the
term spread switches and signals an upside risk, while the downside risk from oil markets
increases. Equity markets, as captured by options prices on the S&P 500, and the skew of
analysts’ forecasts for inﬂation suggest upside risks across both years.
1. Prospects for World GDP Growth1
(percent change)

The IMF staff’s Global Projection Model (GPM) suggests that recession and deﬂation risks have
dropped in the advanced economies. However, they continue to bear watching. For Japan, the
GPM suggests that they will still rise appreciably in 2014.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

downward in the July WEO Update, but the drag
could be larger than expected given tighter financial
conditions. The damage to the U.S. economy from
a short government shutdown is likely to be limited,
but a longer shutdown could be quite harmful. Even
more importantly, the debt ceiling will need to be
raised again later this year; failure to do so promptly
could seriously damage the global economy.
• Risks related to unconventional monetary policy: The
April 2013 WEO saw those risks mainly for the
medium term (see below). But statements by the
Federal Reserve about tapering asset purchases later
this year caused a surprisingly large tightening of
U.S. monetary conditions. A further surprise is the
jump in emerging market local bond yields, which
is roughly three times the level consistent with the
U.S. monetary tightening scenario of the April 2013
WEO. The current WEO projections assume that the
tightening of financial conditions since May in the
United States and in many emerging market economies
was largely a one-time event and that the actual tapering of purchases will further tighten conditions only
modestly. However, a less benign scenario is a distinct
risk to the extent that international capital flows were
driven more by low yields in advanced economies than
better growth prospects in emerging market economies.
• More disappointments in emerging markets: The risk
of more disappointments could interact with the
“unwinding” risks. Although net capital flows to
emerging market economies are projected to remain
sizable in the WEO forecast, policymakers must be
mindful of risks of an abrupt cutoff and severe balance
of payments disruptions. Fixed-income and emerging market asset quality may have passed the peak,
and the leveraged positions that were built up during the period of low policy rates and high emerging
market growth might well be unwound more rapidly
than expected. Adverse feedback loops could emerge
between further growth disappointments, weakening
balance sheets, and tighter external funding conditions—especially in economies that relied heavily on
external funding to support credit-driven growth.
• Geopolitical risks: A short-lived, small disruption
to oil production with an oil price spike of 10
to 20 percent for a few weeks would only have
minor effects on global growth, if it is clear at the
outset that it will be short-lived (see the Special
Feature). If not, confidence and uncertainty effects
would also weigh on activity. Larger, longer-lasting
production outages and price spikes would have
16

bigger effects on growth, as other, amplifying transmission channels would come into play, including
investor flight to safety and significant corrections
in stock markets. Emerging market economies that
are already seeing a pullback of investors and weak
domestic fundamentals could be hit hard.
Medium-term risks
The medium-term risks discussed in detail in the
April 2013 WEO are as relevant as they were then and
tilt to the downside: (1) very low growth or stagnation
in the euro area; (2) fiscal trouble in the United States or
Japan––for Japan, the October 2013 GFSR specifically
discusses a tail risk scenario of “disorderly Abenomics”; (3)
less slack than expected in the advanced economies or a
sudden burst of inflation; and (4) less potential output in
key emerging market economies plus capital outflows.
A plausible downside scenario
A likely scenario for the global economy is one of
continued, plausible disappointments everywhere.
These disappointments could include the following
(Figure 1.17):
• Investment and growth stay weak in the euro area,
as policies fail to resolve financial fragmentation and
fail to inspire confidence among investors.
• Growth in emerging market and developing economies softens further, and growth in China is lower
in the medium term as the shift toward consumption-driven growth proves more complicated than
expected. This has repercussions via trade and lower
commodity prices.
• Policy implementation in Japan is incomplete. In
particular, the scenario incorporates shortfalls in
structural reforms, a failure of inflation expectations
to durably move up to 2 percent, and consequently,
more fiscal tightening to contain the debt-GDP
ratio and prevent sharp increases in the risk premium on Japanese government bonds.
• U.S. financial conditions tighten more than assumed
in the WEO forecast over the coming year. Also,
private investment does not recover as forecast, and,
consequently potential growth turns out lower than
expected. Tighter financial conditions than assumed
in the WEO projections are already partly priced
into markets, and the scenario assumes that market rates increase further when the Federal Reserve
tapers its asset purchases. Such overtightened financial conditions may be difficult to reverse in a timely
manner because damage to the economy is observed

Global ProsPects and Policies

Figure 1.17. Plausible Downside Scenario
This scenario uses The Euro Area Model (EUROMOD) to consider a plausible downside
scenario. The scenario is based on four main drivers. First, the market is assumed to
misperceive the future pace of tightening in U.S. monetary policy and delivers higher-thanbaseline interest rates, notably in the ﬁrst few years of the WEO horizon when there is little
or no scope for the monetary policy rate to be easing to offset it. In addition, the recovery in
investment in the United States is more subdued relative to the WEO baseline and,
consequently, productivity growth is slower over the entire WEO horizon. Second, weaker
than expected macro outcomes in the euro area, owing primarily to weaker investment and
heightened ﬁscal sustainability concerns, lead to rising risk premiums and additional ﬁscal
tightening. This process is ongoing, with continued surprises each year of the WEO horizon
and growth outcomes that are weaker than expected. Third, emerging market economies
do not recover to their precrisis growth paths. In emerging Asia, particularly China, slower
growth would be driven by weaker investment and would translate into

WEO baseline
4.0 1. United States: Real GDP Growth
(percent)

weaker employment, incomes, and consumption, possibly driven by either policy
measures to help shift to more sustainable growth or by weaker export prospects. In
other emerging markets, slower growth in the euro area and emerging Asia and the
repercussions via lower commodity prices will slow investment and growth. Overall,
lower growth in emerging market economies will lead to mild capital outﬂows and
tightening in ﬁnancial conditions, with the United States beneﬁting marginally. Finally, in
Japan, less than successful implementation of the three-pronged recovery strategy will
diminish growth. Less will be done on the structural reform front, and even tighter ﬁscal
conditions will be required to help stabilize public debt and prevent a sharp increase in
the risk premium, which, in turn, will undermine achievement of the new inﬂation target.
The zero-interest-rate ﬂoor binds in 2014 for the United States, the euro area, and
Japan. Beyond 2014, monetary policy rates are allowed to ease only as much as the
policy space permits in the WEO baseline.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

with a lag and a resumption of asset purchases could
be politically difficult.
• International financial markets experience further
turbulence as all these factors raise risk perceptions
and thus the returns demanded by investors.
In this plausible downside scenario, global growth
would be lower, monetary policy rates in advanced
economies would stay even longer at the zero bound,
and inflation would be subdued.
• Euro area growth would take a number of years to
inch back above ½ percent, as activity in the periphery barely creeps out of the recession. The euro area’s
current account surplus would be slightly smaller.
• In Japan, growth would fall back below ½ percent,
and the current account surplus would widen again,
exceeding 2 percent of GDP. Inflation would fall
far short of the 2 percent target, and fiscal troubles
would build.
• China would see growth below 6 percent in the
medium term and a widening of the current account
surplus from 2½ percent to almost 5 percent of
GDP by 2018. For emerging Asia as a whole,
growth would drop by more than 1 percentage
point in 2014, to under 5¼ percent, and then move
sideways.
• Latin America would see growth rates fall slightly
after 2013, contrary to the baseline projection,
and subsequently recover only modestly above 3
percent. The current account deficit would see little
improvement.
• The United States would grow by about 2½ percent over the medium term. In the short term,
higher interest rates weigh on activity, but over
the medium-term activity resumes as lower growth
induces policymakers to keep rates on hold for longer than under the baseline.
The world would be much less prosperous under
this scenario than in the WEO baseline, and the policy
challenges would be tougher. The number of jobs lost
in the scenario relative to WEO baseline would be just
under 20 million. Unemployment rates would stay at
record highs for many years in the euro area periphery, and concerns about debt sustainability in various
economies would return to the fore. Because growth in
many emerging market economies would not pick up,
it would be harder to satisfy demands for better public
services and social safety nets. Such unmet demands
could trigger further social tension in these economies.
In advanced economies, monetary and fiscal policy

18

space would be much more restricted. Therefore, the
global economy would be more vulnerable to much
worse scenarios. In the United States and Japan, for
example, low growth rates could ultimately raise
questions about the strength of the sovereign. It is,
unfortunately, a world that could plausibly materialize
unless policymakers take stronger action to address the
important issues.

policy challenges
The major economies are seeing increasingly different growth dynamics and some downside risks have
become more prominent. As a result, new policy
challenges are arising, and policy spillovers may pose
greater concern. However, if all economies adopt
strong policies to boost their medium-term growth
prospects, a more sustainable global growth trajectory
can be achieved. Even with strong policies, the growth
trajectory would not be much higher than the trajectory in the WEO forecast. But better policies would
help avoid the plausible downside scenario or even
worse outcomes and would set the stage for stronger
growth beyond the WEO horizon.

U.S. Macroeconomic policy at an Inflection point
U.S. economic policy is set to change in the coming
year. The authorities face two major macroeconomic
policy challenges:
• Begin to unwind unconventional monetary policy: This
unwinding will have to be a function of the strength
of the recovery and inflation pressure, both of which
have so far been subdued. Moreover, the expansionary program has not undermined financial stability.
House prices are still far below their previous peaks
(see Figure 1.4, panel 5); bank credit is still hard
to come by for many agents (see Figure 1.4, panel
2); equity valuations are within historical ranges
(see Figure 1.8, panel 4); and domestic investment
has only just begun to strengthen on a broad front.
Nonetheless, the GFSR underscores that excesses in
some financial markets bear close monitoring and
that there are risks of interest rates overshooting in
response to the unwinding, as illustrated by recent
developments. With these considerations in mind,
the best way to exit to a less easy stance is gradually
and with caution—and with clear communication
about the policy strategy.

international monetary Fund | October 2013

©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution

chapter 1

• Improve fiscal policy: The budget sequester has been
an excessive and inefficient way to consolidate
public finances. Looking ahead, the automatic cuts
need to be replaced with a strong medium-term
plan that includes entitlement and tax reform and
better targeted expenditure measures. Otherwise the
debt-GDP ratio, after decreasing temporarily from
a peak of 107 percent in 2014, will increase again
after 2020.
U.S. monetary and fiscal policies are likely to have
important spillover effects on the rest of the world, as
discussed in Chapter 3. The April 2013 WEO considered three scenarios for rising U.S. interest rates:
(1) faster-than-expected U.S. recovery, which would
likely come with appreciation of the U.S. dollar—a
net plus for the rest of the world; (2) higher U.S. inflation, which would also come with appreciation of
the U.S. dollar but would hinder global growth as
U.S. monetary policy slows U.S. demand; and (3)
a reassessment of U.S. sovereign risk, which would
likely involve depreciation of the U.S. dollar—negative for the rest of the world as rising risk aversion
causes global investment to slump. The latest development falls into none of these categories. Neither
U.S. growth nor inflation outcomes surprised on
the upside, nor were WEO or Consensus Economics
projections for either marked up. Policy rates stayed
put and long-term interest rates jumped, but the real
effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar did not move
appreciably. These developments can be seen as a correction of a previous overshooting of the term spread;
an actual tightening of U.S. monetary policy; or a perceived tightening of U.S. monetary policy. Be that as
it may, in the near term they are negative for U.S. and
global growth.
Similar complications could arise again and trigger further increases in term and risk premiums, not
only in emerging market economies but also in other
advanced economies. The reason is that the nature of
the policy unwinding that lies ahead is unprecedented,
and investor positioning in response to the prolonged
environment of low interest rates may have created
risks to financial stability. Financial fragility in the
euro area adds to these concerns, as do deteriorating
growth prospects and asset quality in emerging market
economies. The improved and more transparent policy
and communications tools now at the disposal of the
Federal Reserve should help limit transition-related
market volatility. In any event, careful calibration of

Global ProsPects and Policies

the monetary policy shift and clear communication
from the central bank will be essential.
Inaction on fiscal policy could produce large
international spillovers. Although the global impact of
the budget sequester was limited, failure to raise the
debt ceiling could be very damaging. In the medium
term, unless entitlement spending is reformed and
deficits are scaled back further, there could be a loss
of confidence in the U.S. sovereign. A scenario in
the April 2013 WEO showed that reassessment of
U.S. sovereign risk could reduce global output by
several percentage points of GDP. Determined and
early action on fiscal policy—notably the adoption of a
comprehensive medium-term plan—would greatly help
put the U.S. and global economies on a more sustainable growth trajectory.

euro area policy in Search of More Growth
The issue facing euro area policymakers is what more
they can do to support growth while advancing with
adjustment and structural reforms. The answer depends
on what is holding back the euro area economy. There
are several forces:
• Fiscal adjustment: Fiscal adjustment has likely played
a role (see the October 2012 WEO). However, the
pace of adjustment is now set to drop off, to about
½ percent of GDP in 2014. For the euro area as a
whole this seems broadly appropriate; economies
posting large deficits are doing more and the others
less, while automatic stabilizers are being allowed
to play freely. Policymakers should further improve
the quality of fiscal adjustment by broadening the
tax base (see the October 2013 Fiscal Monitor)
and reforming entitlements. Although there has
been some progress on the latter, it is small compared with the challenges presented by population
aging and the revenue losses caused by the Great
Recession.
• A weak, fragmented financial system: Banks continue
to shed assets to reduce leverage. Bank surveys signal
that the dominant concern is the weak economic
environment, rather than funding difficulties or
capital shortfalls. However, despite significant
progress, market-value-to-book-value ratios for
many banks suggest that their capital buffers are
still not strong enough to support much risk taking.
The ECB’s 2014 balance sheet assessment provides a
critical opportunity to put the system on a sounder

international monetary Fund | October 2013

19

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

footing. However, if the exercise is not credible, and
if a common backstop for capital—such as through
the European Stability Mechanism—is not available, the review could backfire. In the meantime,
the ECB could mitigate financial fragmentation
and thereby stem balance sheet deterioration in the
periphery with targeted credit and liquidity support
(for example, long-term refinancing operations for
small and medium enterprises), less-onerous haircuts
on collateral, or private asset purchases.
• High private debt, uncertainty, and depressed confidence:
Record unemployment, depressed disposable incomes
and wealth, and high indebtedness in some countries have been weighing on households’ behavior,
and the recovery in private consumption is likely to
be very slow. Meanwhile, uncertainty about growth
prospects continues to play a role in firms’ investment
decisions. An additional concern underscored in the
October 2013 GFSR is a corporate debt overhang in
the periphery that is interacting with vulnerable bank
balance sheets. To bolster confidence, policymakers will need to demonstrate that they can act on a
variety of fronts. Strengthening the currency union
with a strong banking union will be critical and must
include a single supervisory and resolution mechanism, with a common fiscal backstop for emergency
assistance. At the national level, clear medium-term
fiscal and structural reform plans are needed, along
with more predictable policies. Furthermore, judiciary
reforms and other measures are needed to speed up
the resolution of bad debts in some countries.
• Monetary policy: Adjusted for tax changes and
commodity price fluctuations, inflation has been
running below the ECB’s medium-term inflation
objective of slightly less than 2 percent and is projected to stay around 1½ percent over the forecast
horizon (see Figure 1.6, panels 2 and 3). Thus, the
ECB should consider additional monetary support,
through lower policy rates, forward guidance on
future rates (including long-term refinance operations at fixed rates), negative deposit rates, or other
unconventional policy measures.
Since these factors reinforce each other, a vigorous
response on all fronts offers the best way forward. The
response needs to be supported with comprehensive
reforms to labor, financial, and product and services
markets, as recommended in the IMF’s 2013 euro area
Article IV consultation report. In the absence of a comprehensive policy response, matters could easily worsen

20

more than in the plausible downside scenario presented
here. The April 2013 WEO explained how a failure to
build a banking union and repair the area’s financial
systems could lead to long-term stagnation in the euro
area, including years of recession in the periphery and
negative spillovers to the rest of the world.

Sustaining the recovery in Japan
Bold monetary easing and new fiscal spending to support growth and combat deflation have boosted growth
(Box 1.4). Output is now forecast to be about 1 percent higher in 2013–14 relative to the pre-Abenomics
baseline. About half of the 20 percent real effective
depreciation of the yen since late 2012 is attributed to
monetary easing this year. For the rest of the world,
the monetary easing would be slightly negative for
growth. If comprehensive structural and fiscal reforms
are implemented, higher growth in Japan and easier
global financing conditions from fiscal reforms could,
over time, more than offset this negative impact on
trading partners.
However, the policymakers’ work is far from done.
Long-term inflation expectations are still well below
2 percent (see Figure 1.6, panel 2), and the issue now
is what would move these expectations up, considering that inflation is not very sensitive to activity. Also,
activity is more likely to disappoint than to exceed
projections, given external risks and prospects for a
major fiscal tightening in 2014. If expectations fail to
move up further in the course of 2014, achievement
of the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent target will be increasingly implausible, making it even harder to attain.
These factors have important implications for policy.
First, the Bank of Japan needs a plan B in case inflation expectations prove stickier than expected: this may
have to include scaling up asset purchases or adjusting
their composition and clarification of the bank’s plans
to raise expectations. Second, with the gross debt-GDP
ratio closing in on 250 percent, the consumption tax
increase must be implemented, and the government
urgently needs to specify a strong plan with specific
measures for medium-term fiscal consolidation and
entitlement reform. The recently announced decision to implement the first stage of the consumption
tax increase to 8 percent in April 2014 is a welcome
step forward. The planned additional stimulus for

measures to consolidate the public finances over the
medium term as quickly as possible. Without such
a plan, already high fiscal vulnerabilities would rise
further. Third, the government must craft and shoot
the third arrow of Abenomics—structural reforms to
lift potential growth. Delivering on all these fronts is
vital for the sustainable success of the recent measures.
Failure to deliver could put Japan on the path of the
plausible downside scenario or worse. As discussed in
the April 2013 WEO, if the fiscal risks materialize,
output will fall well below the pre-Abenomics baseline
in the medium term.

The key priority is to maneuver a smooth shift to
more sustainable, private-consumption-based growth.
This shift would require liberalizing interest rates to
allow effective pricing of risk; a more transparent,
interest-rate-based monetary policy framework; a
more flexible exchange rate regime; reforms for better
governance and quality of growth; and strengthened
financial sector regulation and supervision. Fiscal
policy space, while narrowing, is still adequate to
maintain social and priority spending and to address
downside contingencies. But the government should
curtail quasifiscal programs.

Managing the transition to private-consumption-Driven
Growth in china

engineering Soft Landings in emerging Market and
Developing economies

Growth in China has been on a decelerating path.
Activity has been supported by a huge expansion
in credit-fueled investment—in 2012 investment
reached close to 50 percent of GDP and credit reached
almost 200 percent. Although this expansion spurred
financial deepening and provided a timely global
growth impulse after the Great Recession, policymakers
are now reluctant to continue stimulating the economy
given the risks of inefficiency, deteriorating asset
quality, and financial instability. Off-budget spending by local governments has also raised contingent
fiscal liabilities, with the augmented fiscal deficit now
estimated to be 10 percent of GDP. Moreover, imbalances between private consumption and investment
have intensified, even as the economy’s external imbalances have narrowed. A decisive move to contain these
imbalances may be accompanied by lower mediumterm growth than achieved by China in recent decades,
but this is a trade-off worth making, since it is likely
to usher in permanently higher living standards than
under the extension of the status quo.
More subdued growth in China would affect the
rest of the world through lower import demand and
lower commodity prices, but the net effect should be
positive if the right policies are in place. First, because
China accounts for only 8 percent of global consumption, the negative spillovers would not be unmanageable. Second, better policies and more balanced growth
sharply reduce the risk of a hard landing. For example,
the 2013 IMF Spillover Report highlights that failure to
rebalance growth is likely to lead to a sharp and prolonged growth slowdown, whose spillover could lead to
a reduction in global GDP of about 1.5 percent.

Following a period of rapid domestic demand and
credit growth, emerging market and developing economies need to tackle two new challenges.
• Tighter external financing conditions and lower capital
inflows over the WEO horizon: These will come
with the strengthening of the recovery in advanced
economies and the normalization of U.S. monetary
policy. Moreover, there is a risk of further bouts of
volatility in capital flows and, for some economies,
of severe balance of payments disruptions.
• Some slowing in potential growth and a cooldown from
cyclical peaks: Accordingly, negative output gaps are
small in most emerging market economies in Asia,
Latin America, and Europe.
As noted, the net effect of the tighter financial
conditions on activity is expected to be negative in
the near term in most economies, notwithstanding
recent currency weakening. For the appropriate policy
response, the three crucial questions are whether to use
policy buffers to stabilize activity and, if so, what policies to use; whether to fight the recent currency depreciation; and how to manage risks from renewed capital
outflows. In general, the policy responses should
feature exchange rate depreciation to smooth activity;
measures to safeguard financial stability; and structural
reforms to boost growth. Within this broad picture,
the appropriate policy mix and pace of adjustment
will differ across economies in view of the differences
in output gaps and inflation pressure, central bank
credibility, room for fiscal policy maneuvering, and the
nature of the vulnerabilities.
Exchange rate depreciation: Exchange rates should
be allowed to depreciate in response to changing

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

fundamentals but policymakers need to guard against
disorderly adjustment. Both structural and cyclical
slowdowns in activity call for a depreciation of the real
exchange rate, all else equal. Such a move would also
help redress current account deficits in a few major
emerging market economies whose deficits are larger
than warranted by fundamentals and desired policies
(Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, South Africa).
Liquidity provision and exchange market intervention: This may be needed to maintain orderly conditions when very rapid flows lead to financial market
disruption. Risks of disorderly conditions in currency
markets are likely to be less acute for those economies
that have strong policy frameworks, deeper financial
markets, sound balance sheets, and limited non-resident portfolio investment. While some intervention to
smooth current market volatility may be appropriate in
countries with adequate reserves, it should not forestall
underlying external adjustment for those economies
where external deficits exceed levels warranted by
fundamentals and desired policies. In economies with
pegged currencies, running down reserves is the natural
response. However, even in those cases it should serve
to ease but not postpone needed adjustments.
Monetary policy: Cyclical weakening of activity, in
principle, calls for easing of monetary policies or, in
economies where real interest rates are still low, less
tightening than earlier planned. But, responses will
need to consider inflationary pressures and policy
credibility. In a number of economies, including Brazil,
India, and Indonesia, more tightening may well be
needed to address continued inflation pressure from
capacity constraints, which will likely be reinforced by
recent currency depreciation.
Prudential policies: Hefty exchange rate depreciation
could lead to some increased solvency risk, especially
for firms in the nontradables sectors, which do not
enjoy a natural currency hedge in the form of export
sales. Strong regulatory and supervisory policy efforts
are needed to ensure that banks address credit quality
and profitability problems, whether from legacy effects
as a result of recent rapid credit growth in an environment with lower potential growth or from lower
capital flows.
Fiscal policy: Policymakers should generally allow
automatic stabilizers to respond freely but eschew
stimulus, except when a major slowdown threatens. In
many emerging market economies, growth is expected
to remain fairly strong by historical standards. At the

22

same time, room for fiscal policy maneuvering has generally declined. Fiscal deficits remain appreciably above
precrisis levels (see Figure 1.5, panel 2). Moreover,
while public debt ratios have mostly stabilized at relatively low levels, the debt dynamics are now projected
to turn less favorable, given that real government bond
yields are already some 100 basis points higher than
expected at the time of the April WEO. Against this
backdrop, there now is a broad need for policymakers
to rebuild fiscal space in emerging market economies.
As discussed in the October 2013 Fiscal Monitor,
the urgency for action varies across economies: early,
decisive steps are desirable in a few economies where
public debt is already elevated (Brazil, Egypt, Hungary,
India, Jordan, Poland, Malaysia). In some economies,
increased contingent risks to budgets and public debt
from substantial increases in quasifiscal activity and
deficits reinforce the need to rebuild fiscal space (Brazil, China, Venezuela).
Structural reforms: Structural reforms to enhance
productivity growth are a general priority, given
the diagnostics of the growth slowdown. The latter is in part a reflection of recent achievements in
many emerging market economies. First, unlike the
large advanced economies, many of these economies have been operating near full capacity. Second,
their incomes have been converging toward those in
advanced economies, and as this income gap closes,
growth in the emerging market economies is eventually bound to decline. Even so, there is simultaneously a need for even more catching up in incomes
(“convergence”) and a risk that some of the capacity
bottlenecks could create a middle-income trap, wherein
relative wage increases end up reducing the competitiveness of these economies and thereby stalling
growth. Many emerging market economies must focus
on strengthening productivity in domestic services and
other nontradables sectors, where there has been less
progress than in tradables sectors, and on improving
their investment regimes.
Many low-income economies have succeeded in
maintaining strong growth during the weak global
recovery. Structural policies fostering favorable business
and investment regimes have been major contributors to this outcome, as have better macroeconomic
policies. With the decline in commodity prices and the
increased costs of external financing, the external environment for these countries has become less favorable
(see the Special Feature). Given these adverse changes,

chapter 1

timely adjustments to fiscal policies will be important;
otherwise, external debt could build up again, as in
past episodes.

rebalancing Global Demand
What are the potential benefits from stronger policies?
Policy simulations suggest that over the WEO horizon,
the main benefit will be growth that is more balanced
and sustained but not necessarily higher. An upside
scenario examines the effects of stronger policies. The
scenario is essentially the same scenario as in the 2013
Spillover Report, except that it also considers stronger policies in other emerging market economies, as
follows:
• In the near term, temporary measures in the United
Kingdom (fiscal and monetary) and the United
States (fiscal) help support demand. In addition,
the European authorities adopt measures to reduce
financial fragmentation and implement a banking
union. These actions reduce the cost of funding
for the private and public sectors and stimulate
investment.
• In the medium term, fiscal policy changes raise public saving in India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, and
the United States. Tax reforms in India increase the
incentives to work and invest. In addition, increased

Global ProsPects and Policies

public investment in infrastructure in South Africa
stimulates private investment, increased efficiency
in public spending in Russia allows for increased
infrastructure investment, and pension reforms
in Brazil and Russia support saving and investment. Fiscal and financial reforms in China reduce
both public and private saving and help rebalance
demand toward private consumption and away from
investment. Finally, structural reforms are undertaken in Brazil, the euro area, India, Japan, Russia,
South Africa, and the United Kingdom that boost
productivity and the labor supply.
At the global level, these reforms have little impact
on growth because above-baseline growth in advanced
economies and in Latin America in the near term
is roughly offset by lower growth in emerging Asia,
primarily China, because of the rebalancing. In the
medium term, growth in China and emerging Asia
returns to baseline, but the effects are offset by belowbaseline growth in the United States and Japan owing
to fiscal adjustment (Figure 1.18).
Although these policy measures have a negligible
impact on global growth over the WEO horizon, they
do reduce external imbalances. This, in turn, would
make for a safer global economic environment, and
help set the stage for more sustained and stronger
growth in the long term.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

Figure 1.18. Rebalancing Scenario
This scenario uses the Euro Area Model (EUROMOD) and the G20 Model (G20MOD) to
examine the global implications of major advanced and emerging market economies
implementing policies aimed at strengthening their medium-term fundamentals while in
some cases also supporting growth in the short term. In the near term, temporary
stimulus measures in the UK (ﬁscal and monetary) and the US (ﬁscal) help support
demand. In addition, measures by the ECB to reduce ﬁnancial fragmentation and
implement a banking union reduce the cost of funding for the private and public sectors,
providing additional near-term support for activity. Looking to the medium term,
increases in public savings occur in India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, and the US with
tax reform in India increasing the incentives to work and invest. In addition, increased
public investment in infrastructure in South Africa further stimulates private investment,
increased efﬁciency in public spending in Russia allows for increased infrastructure
investment, and pension reforms in Russia further stimulate labor supply.

Fiscal and ﬁnancial reforms in China reduce both public and private savings and help
rebalance demand toward consumption and away from investment. Structural reforms
are undertaken in Brazil, the euro area, India, Japan, South Africa, and the UK that raise
productivity and labor supply and stimulate investment.
At the global level, these reforms have little impact on growth as above-baseline growth
in advanced economies and Latin America in the near term is roughly offset by lower
growth in emerging Asia, primarily China. In the medium term, a return to baseline
growth in China and emerging Asia is offset by below-baseline growth in the US and
Japan. Although the impacts on global growth of these policy measures are negligible
over the WEO horizon, they notably reduce external imbalances and set the stage for
strong balanced growth in the long term.

Special Feature: commodity Market review
The impact of slowing emerging market growth is being
felt on commodity prices, particularly metals. The first
section of this special feature discusses likely first-round
impacts of these declines on trade balances and the shortterm challenges from a more balanced and sustainable
growth path in China for metal and energy exporters. It
concludes with the price outlook and risks. The second
section studies the impacts of the U.S. energy boom.
Although the boom has disrupted relationships between
some energy prices, impacts on U.S. output and the current account will be modest.

Metal and food prices have declined while energy
prices have edged up. The IMF’s Primary Commodities Price Index is unchanged from March 2013, with
declines in metal and food prices offset by small gains
in energy prices (Figure 1.SF.1).1
The steep fall in metal prices owes much to a
continuing rise in metals mine supplies in recent years
and some signs of a slowing real estate sector in China.
Oil demand growth has slowed, particularly in China,
India, and the Middle East. Although coal and natural
gas prices have fallen, oil spot prices have remained
above $105 a barrel, reflecting various supply outages
and renewed geopolitical concerns in the Middle East
and North Africa. In addition, new pipeline infrastructure in the United States has allowed surplus crude oil
in the mid-continent to reach coastal refineries and
U.S. crude prices to rise.2 Elevated crude oil prices
have played a role in keeping food prices relatively
high because energy is an important cost component

(Baffes and Dennis, 2013). Despite slowing growth,
demand for food has remained high in China, and is
particularly reliant on world markets for oilseeds—
imports accounted for nearly 60 percent of total
oilseed consumption in 2013.3
A slowdown in economic activity in emerging
markets is an important driver of commodity price
declines (IMF, 2011; and Roache, 2012). The correlation between growth in commodity prices and growth
in macroeconomic activity in emerging markets is very
high; the correlation between the first principal components of the two is 0.8. Moreover, declines in economic

contributing to tightness in grain markets.

growth lead to substantial declines in commodity price
growth for several months (Figure 1.SF.2).4
Commodity price declines can have important and
disparate effects on trade balances across and within
regions. The estimated direct (first-round) effects on
trade balances from commodity price declines of the
magnitude seen during the past six months can be
important for some regions.5 As shown in Table 1.SF.1,
4Principal

components analysis extracts key factors that account
for most of the variance in the observed variables. The correlation
and the impulse response are based on monthly data from 2000 to
the present and use the first principal component. Macroeconomic
activity is measured using industrial production indices, purchasing
managers’ indices, and equity returns as proxies for global economic
activity, economic sentiment, and asset market performance, respectively. Note that the impulse response shown is for the growth rate
of commodity prices, which indicates a persistent decline in the level
of commodity prices.
5The estimates are derived from a partial equilibrium exercise in
which changes in trade balances for 2013 and 2014 are computed
under two scenarios, the April 2013 baseline and under the assumed
declines of 10 percent in energy prices and 30 percent in metal
prices. The numbers in Table 1.SF.1 and Figure 1.SF.4 are the difference between the two scenarios. The estimates thus show the impact
on trade balances of a fall in commodity prices compared with what
was assumed in the April World Economic Outlook baseline prices.

26

a 30 percent decline in metal prices and a 10 percent
decline in energy prices would broadly lead to deterioration in balances for the Middle East, economies
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Latin
America, and Africa, offset by improvements in Asia
and Europe. Within regions, the impacts are heterogeneous—for example, in Africa, the Western Hemisphere, and the Middle East (Figure 1.SF.3).6
A more balanced and sustainable growth path in
China in the medium to long term could imply less
volatile but still robust commodity demand (Ahuja and
Myrvoda, 2012; Ahuja and Nabar, 2012; and IMF,
2012a). However, in the short term, as demand shifts
away from materials-intensive growth, some commodity exporters could be vulnerable. There is particular
concern about the spillover effects of demand rebalancing in China given the assessment that a substantial
share of their slowdown may be in potential growth.
Figure 1.SF.4 illustrates rough estimates of the impacts
of a slowdown in Chinese growth from an average of
10 percent during the previous decade to an average of
7½ percent over the coming decade. The numbers shown
in the figure are the declines in net revenues (as a percent of GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity) for
various commodity exporters as a result of lower Chinese
demand.7 For example, Mongolia’s GDP level in 2025
is estimated to be about 7 percent lower than otherwise,
primarily as a result of slower Chinese demand for coal,
iron ore, and copper. To the degree that the Chinese slowdown is anticipated in forward-looking prices, some of
this slowdown may already have begun to affect exporters.
Nevertheless this chart provides an approximate and illustrative ranking of countries that, in the absence of policy
responses or offsetting favorable shocks, might be some6These estimates are illustrative and prone to caveats (for example,
using 2012 or 2013 data, the deterioration in Chile’s trade balance is
closer to 3–4 percent).
7The procedure used is to (1) calculate China’s share of demand
growth for various commodities during 1995–2011; (2) assess how
much impact this demand growth from China has had on the
respective commodity prices; and (3) calculate the net revenue loss
for various commodity exporters caused by the volume and price
changes. The procedure implicitly assumes that, over the long term,
commodity markets are globally integrated and fungible so that
the impact on prices of slower Chinese growth affects all exporters.
Lack of data precludes including countries such as Myanmar that
otherwise would have ranked high on the list. The calculation does
not take into account any supply effects resulting from the Chinese
slowdown nor the sources of Chinese rebalancing and their differing
commodity intensity. For some estimates of the impacts of slower
Chinese investment see the 2012 IMF spillover report. Commodity price declines also pose risks to the fiscal balance in low-income
commodity exporters.

The IMF’s average petroleum spot price a barrel is projected at $104.5 in 2013 and $101.4 in 2014. These
prices reflect seasonally strong refinery demand and
supply outages. The food price index is also projected
to increase slightly in 2013, but then decline by about
6 percent in 2014, on a favorable supply outlook.
Metal prices are projected to decrease by about 4 and 5
percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Despite rising spot oil prices, futures markets are
broadly signaling declines over the outlook period
(Figure 1.SF.5). Markets expect U.S. natural gas prices
8Not only have oil price declines been reversed during the late
summer, but in addition, such a ranking is illustrative and not necessarily a good indicator of vulnerability. For example, in Chile the
current account is narrowed by compensatory accrued foreign direct
investment profits.
9Many recent IMF country reports discuss the importance of
energy and metal exports for the respective economies, and some
focus on the role of China. Examples include the discussions of
Qatar’s natural gas market (IMF, 2013i, p. 35); Saudi Arabia’s systemic role (IMF, 2013j, p. 4); impacts of decline in copper prices on
Chile’s GDP in the short term (IMF 2013b, pp. 16–17); the impact
of a hard landing in China on Colombia’s commodity exports (IMF,
2013c, p. 32); and Nigeria’s petroleum industry (IMF, 2013g, p. 59).

to rise from recently depressed levels, while most metal
prices are expected to remain subdued. Food prices
also show upside risks mainly due to weather-related
supply uncertainty.
Recently, risks of a spike in oil prices have risen
because of the threat of disruptions due to increasing
unrest and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East
and North Africa. Given these rising tensions, three
oil price scenarios are considered to illustrate possible
impacts on the global economy—simulated with the
GEM, which is a six-region general equilibrium model
of the world economy (Table 1.SF.2). The first scenario
is a short-lived oil production disruption whereby oil
prices spike 10 to 20 percent for a few weeks. This has
only a small impact on the global economy. A larger
production disruption assumes that the Syria conflict
spills over, for example by halting Iraqi oil exports.
Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity compensates, but with
a lag, and possible quality problems, depending on
the grades lost. This second scenario—a larger disruption during which oil prices spike to $150 a barrel for
two quarters—assumes that the global oil market still
functions efficiently via higher prices. Nevertheless,
it reduces global growth by 0.13 percentage point in
2014 and raises other risks. In the third scenario—
given the present difficulties for the global economy—
the same $150 a barrel price spike is accompanied
by greater adverse effects on confidence, with capital
retreating to safe havens and a persistent decline in
equity prices. In this case, the impact on global growth
will be much larger—about 0.5 percentage point lower
in 2014.

economic Impacts of the U.S. energy Boom
The United States is experiencing a boom in energy
production. Natural gas output increased 25 percent,
and crude oil and other liquids increased 30 percent
during the past five years, reducing net oil imports
by nearly 40 percent. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA, 2013) baseline scenario shows
U.S. production of tight oil increasing until 2020
before falling off during the next two decades.10 The
baseline also shows U.S. shale gas production increasing steadily until 2040 (Figure 1.SF.6). The United
States is expected to be a net exporter of natural gas in
the 2020s.

GEM simulations suggest modest impacts of the
energy boom on U.S. output.11 In the GEM, energy is
produced by combining capital and labor with a fixed
factor, which can be thought of as known reserves. As
discussed above, the EIA expects production of tight
oil and shale gas to increase in coming years but there
is uncertainty about the duration and extent of the
increase. The model is simulated under the assumption that there is an increase in energy production
over the next 12 years, so that by the end of this time
horizon production has increased by 1.8 percent of
GDP.12 Figure 1.SF.7 shows the results from the model
simulations.
The main finding is that U.S. real GDP increases
by about 1.2 percent at the end of 13 years and
employment increases by 0.5 percent. This is under
the assumption that the increase in energy production is fully anticipated by households and firms. The
corresponding increase in domestic demand is about
1.8 percent. The decline in the cost of energy induces
firms to employ more capital and labor. Adjustment
costs in investment encourage firms to start putting
capital in place even before all the declines in energy
11This

discussion is taken from Hunt and Muir (2013).
scenario is implemented in the GEM by gradually increasing the fixed factor in oil production over the 12-year period by
enough that, once capital and labor have responded endogenously,
U.S. energy production has increased by 1.8 percent of GDP. IMF
(2013k) presents the results from a scenario in which the increase
in energy production is 0.45 percent of GDP; the results are similar
to those presented here, except that the magnitude of the effect on
GDP is roughly a fourth of that shown here.

prices materialize. In addition to the increase in
investment, consumption also rises because of rising
household real incomes and wealth. The impacts on
GDP levels in other country blocs are also positive,
with the exception of a very small decrease in the
GDP of other energy-exporting countries (see Figure
1.SF.7).
The main reason for the modest impact on U.S.
GDP is that the share of energy in the economy
remains quite small even after factoring in the additional production.13 The impacts are greater when the
economy exhibits slack because in this case monetary
policy does not need to lean against the resulting
increase in aggregate demand.
Simulation results also suggest small impacts on the
U.S. current account, with the direction of the impact
depending on whether the increase in energy supplies
is anticipated or comes as a surprise. In both cases, the
improvement in the energy component of the trade
balance is offset by a decline in the nonenergy balance.
In the case in which the increase in energy supplies is
fully anticipated, U.S. households and corporations
temporarily increase borrowing from abroad to support
13This can also be seen from back-of-the-envelope calculations of
the annual revenue impact of the higher energy production in coming years. The annual revenue from tight oil will be about $80 billion, or ½ percent of U.S. GDP, if future prices are in line with EIA
projections. A similar calculation, even allowing for the possibility
that natural gas prices rise from their current depressed levels, yields
a revenue impact from natural gas production of about 1¼ percent
of GDP. In sum, the total annual revenue impact will be less than
2 percent of GDP.

higher consumption (anticipating the wealth increase
from higher energy production) and investment. The
appreciation of the U.S. dollar reduces import prices
and also contributes to the increase in the nonenergy
balance. Overall, the result is a small decline in the
current account balance.
In the case in which the increase in energy production comes as a surprise each year, consumption and
investment respond more gradually because households
do not anticipate the magnitude of the increase in
their wealth and firms do not anticipate the extent of
the decline in the cost of production. With domestic

demand responding more gradually, the increase in
nonenergy imports is also smaller, and it is offset by
the increase in the energy balance. Econometric evidence on the impact of giant discoveries of oil and gas
on the current account is presented in Box 1.SF.1.
Though its aggregate effects on output are likely to be
small, the energy boom has disrupted historical relationships between energy prices. Brent and West Texas
Intermediate, two major pricing benchmarks for crude
oil, have moved together for three decades, but have
diverged in recent years (Box 1.SF.2). Oil and natural
gas prices have also moved in tandem within and across

countries as a result of substitution and international
arbitrage. Since 2009, however, U.S. natural gas prices
have decoupled from U.S. oil prices, while prices
elsewhere continue to move together, as shown for
Germany (Figure 1.SF.8). Restoration of the law of one
price could take several years, particularly given regulatory and technological barriers to U.S. exports and the
link to oil prices in Asia and Europe.14

14As discussed in Loungani and Matsumoto (forthcoming), over
time more consumers will be able to make the initial investment
needed to switch their energy sources from crude oil (or coal) to
natural gas. Natural gas price differentials across countries will
also diminish if other countries start to extract their own shale gas
reserves or if environmental concerns slow extraction in the United
States. In June 2013, the EIA released estimates suggesting that shale
oil resources worldwide would add roughly 10 percent to global oil
reserves, while shale gas resources would nearly double the world’s
supply of natural gas resources.

Box 1.SF.1. energy Booms and the current account: cross-country experience
Discoveries of giant oil and gas fields—fields containing ultimate recoverable reserves equivalent to at least
500 million barrels—have been relatively widespread
across countries since the 1970s. These discoveries
constitute a unique source of exogenous future income
shocks. Regression results, using a panel of 178
countries over the period 1970 to 2012, show that the
effect of these discoveries was first to decrease the current account balance and then to increase it before the
effect leveled off (Figure 1.SF.1.1).1 Hence, the pattern
of the effect is similar to the case of the unanticipated
increase in energy production shown in IMF Global
Economic Model (GEM) simulations. The regression
estimates imply that a discovery equal to the size of
proven reserves in U.S. unconventional energy in the
United States would lead at its peak to about a 0.1
percent of GDP increase in the U.S. current account
balance.
The effect thus is small, as also suggested by the
GEM simulations. There are cases in which oil and
gas discoveries have had larger effects on the current account, but the size of those discoveries was
larger than the expected increase in the case of the
United States. For instance, the share of North Sea oil
discoveries in U.K. GDP was about 6 to 7 percent at
its peak. After initially moving in line with the sharp
increase and decline in oil revenues, the U.K. current
account decoupled from oil revenues, which have
remained low and stable at about 1½ percent of GDP
since 1990. The impact on the current account was
larger in Norway because of the much larger share of
the gas and oil extraction sector in the economy—
nearly 25 percent—and the country’s fiscal policy of
keeping most of the oil revenues in a special fund.

Box 1.SF.2. Oil price Drivers and the Narrowing WtI-Brent Spread
In recent years, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices
fell substantially below Brent prices as a supply surge
from unconventional energy sources in the United
States and Canada, and difficulties in moving this supply
to U.S. refining hubs, led to a buildup of inventories. But
the differential has narrowed this year (Figure 1.SF.2.1).
To understand fundamental oil price drivers, a signrestricted structural vector autoregressive model is estimated using four variables: global crude oil production,
global industrial production, the real price of Brent
crude oil, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development crude oil inventories (to proxy
speculative demand) for the period 1983:Q1–2013:Q3
(see Beidas-Strom and Pescatori, 2013). Speculation
motives include both decisions to adjust oil inventories
in anticipation of future price movements and behavior induced by possible mispricing in financial (oil
derivatives) markets. Figures 1.SF.2.2 and 1.SF.2.3 show
that Brent prices are largely driven by flow demand
and speculative demand shocks (blue and green bars,
respectively).1 Brent competes more closely with North
and West African and Middle Eastern crude oil varieties, hence its price is more exposed to precautionary
demand stemming from geopolitical risk. Risk premiums and the prevailing Brent futures term structure also
attract financial investors.

Box 1.SF.2 (continued)
Replacing Brent with WTI prices, the model suggests that before 2007 the drivers of the two leading
benchmark prices are almost identical. However,
since 2007, WTI prices have been influenced more by
global supply conditions (burgundy bars)—particularly the boom in North American supply and crude
oil transportation constraints since 2009—and less
by speculative demand. More recently, infrastructure
bottlenecks have eased (yellow bars) and speculative

and seasonal demand increased, raising WTI and narrowing the spread. But this narrowing may not prove
durable. Seasonal U.S. demand will dissipate in the
third quarter, and sufficient crude oil infrastructure
to carry oil from the middle of the United States to
the Gulf coast will not be reconfigured and completed
until late next year. Therefore, downward pressure on
WTI could continue, altering the WTI futures term
structure and lowering recent investor interest.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

Box 1.1. taper talks: What to expect when the United States Is tightening
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s communication in late May
about a future tapering of asset purchases appears to
have been a wake-up call to markets that the exceptionally accommodative U.S. monetary policy could
soon reach a turning point. By August, U.S. 10-year
yields had risen by more than 80 basis points, and
many emerging markets experienced capital outflows,
higher bond yields, and lower equity prices, which
were partly offset by some exchange rate depreciation (see the main text of the chapter). Bond yields
declined modestly after the Federal Reserve recently
communicated its decision not yet to begin tapering of
asset purchases, but they still remain above pre-tapertalk levels.
A key question is how markets will respond when
U.S. monetary stimulus is eventually withdrawn. This
box sheds light on the question by drawing on previous turning points in U.S. monetary policy since 1990
and assessing whether the consequences for emerging
markets may be different this time.1
The analysis indicates that no broad-based deterioration in global economic and financial health
occurred at the onset of previous episodes of U.S.
monetary policy tightening since 1990. Each of the
three previous episodes of sustained U.S. federal funds
rate hikes—starting in February 1994, June 1999,
and June 2004—was motivated by strong economic
growth. The international consequences were limited
in 1999 and 2004, and global growth continued to
be strong. However, the 1994 episode was followed
by deteriorating financial conditions in emerging
market economies—reflecting some ongoing crises
and preexisting imbalances that widened further in the
context of fixed exchange rates after interest rates rose
globally—and some crises and recessions afterward.
The analysis also suggests that the recent tightening in global financial markets was not exceptional
by historical standards. Even in previous episodes,
long-term U.S. bond yields rose before policy rates
were raised, in anticipation of stronger economic

1The stylized facts presented here are associations between
various indicators and a tight U.S. monetary policy stance and
should not be interpreted as the causal effect of the latter on
the former. For an identification of the causal effects of a rise in

(WEO) and Chapter 4 of the April 2011 WEO.

conditions and tighter monetary policy. Still, some
similarities between the current and the 1994 episode
are a concern. Both involved large capital inflows to
emerging market economies prior to the event, cyclical
divergences between the U.S. and emerging market
economies, and marked declines in equity prices and
increases in long-term bonds yields at the onset of
the event. However, policy frameworks in emerging
market economies are stronger today, with greater
exchange rate flexibility and higher foreign exchange
reserve buffers. They should, thus, be better prepared
to weather a tightening in external financing.

Historical turning points in U.S. monetary policy
This box focuses on the post-1990s period, when U.S.
inflation was relatively low and stable, and identifies
three distinct phases of U.S. monetary policy tightening (Figure 1.1.1):2
• February 1994 to July 1995: The federal funds rate,
which had been held constant for more than a year,
was raised on February 4, 1994, motivated partly by
a stronger-than-expected pace of growth of the U.S.
economy.3 Rates were raised by a cumulative 300
basis points within 12 months, to 6 percent from
3 percent. Long-term yields (on 10-year Treasuries)
rose sharply until late 1994 but declined thereafter,
given stabilized inflation expectations.
• June 1999 to December 2000: After continuous rate
cuts since the second half of 1998, the first rate
hike in the next tightening phase occurred on June
30, 1999. The policy rate was raised by 175 basis
points during the next 19 months, to 6.5 percent
from 4.75 percent. Long-term yields rose at a
slower pace than in 1994 and began declining after
six months.
• June 2004 to August 2007: The policy rate was
raised on June 30, 2004, after rate cuts throughout

2The following criteria are used to identify a tightening phase
in U.S. monetary policy: the federal funds target rate is raised
after at least six months of unchanged or declining rates, followed by increases for at least six months. Figures 1.1.1, 1.1.2,
and 1.1.3 trace the evolution of alternative indicators in the
months (quarters) before and after the month (quarter) of the
monetary policy turning point.

period, and the move to announce the intended federal funds
rate established greater credibility and transparency in the policy
framework (see Goodfriend, 2003).

Global growth was generally strong in the aftermath
of these episodes, although to varying degrees across
regions given differences in economic cycles (Table
1.1.1, and Figure 1.1.2, panels 1 and 2):
• In 1994, the U.S. economy was on a cyclical
upswing, and its output gap was declining. In
contrast, many advanced economies (Japan and
advanced Europe) were still recovering at a subdued
pace from the recessions of the early 1990s. Their
recovery continued at a modest pace through
1995. Growth in emerging markets was buoyant in
1993–94, but with rising overheating pressure in
Latin America.4 Asia largely managed a soft landing in 1995, but growth declined sharply in Latin
America.
• In 1999, the U.S. output gap had closed, but there
was still economic slack in some advanced economies and in emerging markets recovering from the
1997–99 financial crises.5 Thus, domestic policies
elsewhere remained supportive despite the U.S.
tightening, and growth continued to pick up in
2000.
• In 2004, advanced and emerging market economies
were broadly synchronized with the U.S. economy.
For emerging markets, the U.S. monetary tightening coincided with a gradual deceleration from very
strong growth levels achieved earlier.
Gross capital flows to emerging markets declined
after U.S. monetary tightening in 1994 and in 1999.
Developments in the 1994 episode stand out, however
(Figure 1.1.3). Flows had accelerated to sizable levels
in the run-up to the episode, in part reflecting increasing financial and capital account liberalization in many
countries but also relatively low U.S. interest rates and
perceived strong economic fundamentals in emerging markets.6 Against this backdrop, the capital flow
reversals in 1994 coincided with growing domestic
vulnerabilities (notably, Mexico) and ongoing crises
4For example, many economies in Latin America were characterized by overvalued exchange rates in the context of fixed
exchange rate regimes, recent lending booms, widening fiscal
and current account deficits, and low foreign reserves (see Sachs,
Tornell, and Velasco, 1996).

(for example, a currency crisis erupted in Turkey in
late 1993). Overall, there were more financial crises
in emerging market and developing economies in the
1994 episode than in other episodes. That said, the
frequency of emerging market financial crises was generally high in the early 1990s, even before the rise in
U.S. policy rates, according to the financial crisis chronology of Laeven and Valencia (2012). In the 1999
episode, capital flows were small after the Asian and
other emerging market financial crises in 1997–98. In
the 2004 episode, there was only a short-lived decline
in capital flows to emerging markets.
Despite the fall in capital inflows in 1994, real
exchange rates depreciated gradually, primarily because
many emerging markets maintained pegged exchange
rate regimes (Figure 1.1.2, panels 3 and 4). However, in
some economies, the pegs could not be sustained after
financial and external imbalances started rising with
the higher global interest rates, and sharp exchange rate
adjustments followed. A prominent example is Mexico,
which abandoned its pegged regime in January 1995
during the “tequila” crisis. Real exchange rates were
broadly stable in most emerging market economies in
1999 and even appreciated for the floaters during 2004.
Sovereign bond yields and equity prices deteriorated significantly only in the 1994 episode (Figure

38

1.1.2, panels 5 and 6). In 1999, emerging market
bonds continued to gain ground, and equity prices
suffered only a temporary setback. In 2004, bond and
equity prices rallied for several months after the U.S.
monetary tightening, despite the growth deceleration
in emerging markets, likely because their economic
fundamentals were perceived to be strong.
The current episode of financial tightening is similar
to that of 1994 in many ways. First, capital inflows to
major emerging markets prior to the event were sizable.
Second, the U.S. long-term yield has risen almost as
sharply as it did in 1994, even without a similar rise in
the policy rate.7 Third, global financial market conditions (equity prices, long-term bond prices) deteriorated
as well, suggesting that worsening domestic fundamentals were at play. However, one key difference is that,
unlike in 1994, large real exchange rate depreciations—
close to 5 percent on average since May 2013 compared
with virtually no change during a similar period in the
1994 episode—may help mitigate the effects on growth.
7However,

the underlying factors behind the increase in the
10-year U.S. Treasury bonds may have been different. With
the Federal Reserve’s unconventional monetary policy largely
concentrated on longer-term paper, the yield curve has steepened
only beyond the one-year tenor, whereas the 1994 tightening was
transmitted across the entire yield curve.

Box 1.1 (continued)
Lessons from history
• History suggests that the world economy did not
fall apart in previous U.S. monetary tightening
episodes. Other than for a few economies, the crossborder consequences were largely benign, and global
growth continued to be strong.
• When difficulties arose, as during the 1994 episode,
they typically reflected prevailing vulnerabilities that
proved to be unsustainable in a changing global
environment.
• The potential consequences of the eventual tightening of U.S. monetary policy will depend on
its magnitude and pace and on how broadly the
tightening affects financial conditions. For instance,
although historical trends suggest that the U.S.
10-year sovereign rate would rise by more than
200 basis points to reach close to 5 percent over
the medium term, the increase could be smaller if

40

medium-term growth and inflation in the United
States do not return to historical averages.
With many emerging market economies slowing after a cyclical peak in 2010–11, they will need
to achieve a soft landing as the external financing
environment tightens. Many of them have adopted
stronger policies during the past decade, have higher
reserves, and flexible exchange rate regimes, although
in some countries fiscal imbalances have widened in
recent years (see the October 2013 Fiscal Monitor),
and the share of nonresident holdings of locally issued
debt has increased (see the October 2013 Global
Financial Stability Report). If these economies rebuild
their policy buffers while times are still good, and use
their exchange rates as shock absorbers while containing inflation and financial stability risks, they should
be better able to endure a tightening in financial
conditions than in 1994.

Box 1.2. What explains the Slowdown in the BrIcS?
For some time, global growth has been boosted by
the BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South
Africa. But over the past couple of years, growth in
these economies has begun to sputter, raising some
fundamental questions. Why have the BRICS simultaneously slowed? Are the slowdowns merely cyclical or
are they structural, with more profound implications
for the global economy?
This box uses a new model-based approach to shed
some light on these questions. Broadly, the analysis
indicates that cyclical factors have played a large,
perhaps underappreciated role. At the same time,
potential growth has fallen, but the IMF staff expects
the associated drop in growth rates to prove durable in
only two economies: China and Russia.
Without doubt, the slowdown in the BRICS has
been quite sizable. Growth for South Africa, China,
Russia, and India is projected in the World Economic
Outlook (WEO) to be 1½ to 4¼ percentage points
lower in 2013 than it was in 2011.1 Brazil’s economy
has slowed only marginally over this period, but only
because growth fell by nearly 5 percentage points in
2011.
That said, the slowdowns are hardly unprecedented,
as shown in Figure 1.2.1. For some of the BRICS,
they are not even unusual. Brazil’s latest growth slowdown is actually mild compared with earlier two-year
slowdowns (since 1980, shaded periods). For South
Africa, the slowdown is smaller than two-thirds of the
earlier slowdowns. Similarly, for China, the current
slowdown is (so far) smaller than the decelerations
seen in the late 1980s and 1990s.
Perhaps the main reason the current slowdowns
have attracted so much attention is that their severity was unanticipated. The BRICS economies were
always expected to decelerate as they settled back to
more moderate growth rates from the bounce-back
levels that prevailed after the global financial crisis,
but growth rates have fallen much further than
expected. Comparing the fall 2011 with the fall 2013
WEO, projected growth in 2013 has been marked
down 1½ to 2½ percentage points for Brazil, China,

Real growth in 2013 is the forecast from the IMF’s Global Projection Model (GPM) as of September 13, 2013, which may differ from the official WEO forecast.
See Carabenciov and others (2013) for details on the GPM.
Note: Growth rates are shown on a calendar year basis. Estimates of potential and cyclical growth and the output gap come from the multivariate filter described
in the text. Real and potential growth are defined as the year-over-year change of the underlying log-level series (× 100). Cyclical growth is defined to be the difference between real and potential growth. Numbers need not sum exactly due to rounding. The output gap is given by the difference between log potential output
and log real output (× 100); a negative number indicates deflation pressure. Change indicates the difference between the 2013 and 2011 estimates.
1

Before attempting to answer this question, the
concept of potential growth needs to be clarified. Following Okun (1962), potential output is taken to be
the level of real output consistent with stable inflation;
its growth rate, then, is potential growth. There are
alternative concepts of potential output, including,
among others, the trend component of output, typically identified using purely statistical methods like
the popular Hodrick-Prescott filter, and the maximum
feasible level of output, computed using a supplyside aggregate production function. The potential
output concept selected, and its associated estimation
approach, will depend on the particular application
and data availability.2
Unlike a purely statistical concept of potential output, Okun’s definition has economic content because
it relates the output gap (the difference between potential and actual output) to the behavior of inflation.
When there is slack in the economy (a negative output
gap), inflation will tend to fall, while if the economy
has little spare capacity (a positive output gap), inflation will tend to rise. This Phillips-curve-like relationship is a key component of the model-based approach
2The

potential output concept and approach followed here
need not coincide with that used elsewhere. For example,
IMF country desks typically estimate potential output using a
mixture of judgment and empirical methods tailored to a specific
purpose, such as the assessment of a broader set of imbalances
than that signaled by variable inflation. For example, see Box
8 in IMF (2012c) for estimates of potential output based on a
production function approach.

42

used here to estimate potential output.3 Put simply,
if growth is slowing but inflation is not, this suggests
that potential growth has fallen.
The inflation-output gap relationship plus descriptions of how potential output and the output gap may
evolve over time together form a simple macroeconomic model for each economy. Using the model’s
structure, a multivariate filter is constructed that leverages the information in observed output, inflation, and
expectations of inflation and growth (from Consensus
Forecasts) to infer potential growth, both historically
and in real time.4 The cyclical component of real
growth is then simply the difference between real
growth and estimated potential growth. The multivariate filter’s limited data requirements mean that it can
be estimated for a wide array of economies.
Table 1.2.1 displays the multivariate filter’s estimates, and Figure 1.2.2 shows them graphically. Note
that the 2013 growth projections differ from those
3The

Phillips curve, named in light of the seminal work by
Phillips (1958), traditionally relates the inflation rate to the
deviation of the unemployment rate from its natural rate (the
unemployment gap). Substituting in Okun’s Law (1962), which
relates the unemployment gap to the output gap, we recover the
relationship that we use in our model-based approach.
4Inflation and growth expectations from Consensus Forecasts
help anchor the model, reducing its sensitivity to data revisions
and extensions (the famous endpoint problem that afflicts twosided filters). See Benes and others (2010) for a more detailed
discussion of the multivariate filter’s structure and how it is
estimated.

of the WEO, as they are based on the IMF’s Global
Projection Model. Also note that India’s data are for
the calendar year, whereas elsewhere in the WEO
they are on a fiscal year basis. Contrary to popular
impression, the cooling down of cyclical factors is an
important part of the story, accounting for the bulk of
the deceleration in Russia and South Africa, and about
half of it in India and China.
The role of unwinding cyclical factors can also be seen
in the estimated output gaps. Although growth in the
BRICS had already moderated in 2011 from the 2010
bounce-back, output was still estimated to be nearly
1 percent above potential in Brazil, China, and India.
Only in Russia and South Africa was output estimated
to be below potential, as it had been ever since the global
recession hit in 2009. In 2013, by contrast, the output
gap is assessed to be negative in all the BRICS. The gap
is largest for Brazil and India (between 1 and 2 percent
of potential), and smallest for China, Russia, and South
Africa (at about ½ percent of potential).

downturn in these economies? Most likely, com-

mon factors have been at work (Figure 1.2.3). In the
wake of the global financial crisis, authorities in these
economies provided exceptionally large monetary and
fiscal stimulus, notably in China but also in the other
economies. At the same time—partly as a result of
the BRICS’ stimulus—the global economy started to
recover, providing further lift, as exports rebounded
sharply, global interest rates fell, and commodity prices
increased, benefiting Russia (energy) and Brazil and
South Africa (nonfuel commodities). But starting in
2011, these factors began to fade: the effects of the
stimulus wound down, global export demand slowed,
and commodity prices began to weaken.
Coincident with the waning of cyclical factors,
potential growth began to fall. The reduction is about
¼ to ½ percentage point for South Africa, Russia, and
Brazil and about 1 to 1½ percentage points for China

and India. These last two are significant reductions.
For the limited time span over which potential growth
estimates from the multivariate filter exist (basically,
post-2000), the declines in China and India are among
the largest these countries have experienced.
These reductions in potential growth point to some
serious structural impediments. For example, India’s
potential has been undermined by supply bottlenecks
arising from problems in the regulatory framework for
mining, energy, telecommunications and other sectors;
a consequent slowdown in permits and project approvals; and overstretched corporate balance sheets.
Still, the reductions in potential growth need to be
placed in context. They do not necessarily imply that
there has been a permanent fall in the longer-term,
steady-state growth rate. That is because potential
growth can and does vary from year to year, reflecting
the evolution of short-term aggregate supply. Consequently, to assess whether the recent reductions in
growth are expected to last, information from outside
the model needs to be brought to bear. The five-yearahead WEO forecasts provide such an insight. For
Brazil, India, and South Africa, these show that growth
is projected to remain roughly in line with (or higher
than) their average of the past 15 years (Table 1.2.2).
There are two exceptions, however: China and Russia,
where growth is forecast to be markedly lower.
Why are China’s and Russia’s longer-term growth
rates expected to fall? In both cases, it is essentially
because time is running out on their current growth
model. So far, China has relied on extensive growth,
with policies devoted to expanding the economy
through capital accumulation and the migration of
labor from the countryside to urban factories.5 But the
extraordinarily high rates of investment, nearly half of
GDP, have resulted in excess capacity and diminishing returns. At the same time, demographic trends
imply that the labor force will start declining after

2014, with surplus labor becoming exhausted around
2020. Moreover, total factor productivity growth will
likely decline as China progresses toward the ranks
of high-income countries. As a consequence, without fundamental reform to rebalance the economy
toward consumption and stimulate productivity
growth through deregulation, growth is likely to slow
considerably.
The story in Russia is similar.6 For some time, the
country has been held back by inadequate physical infrastructure, including the transportation and
electricity networks; overreliance on commodities; and
a weak business climate. The economy has nonetheless
managed to grow, on the back of rising oil prices and
by using up spare capacity. But this model now seems
exhausted, and growth will be further constrained by
negative demographics.
We are now in a position to answer the question
posed at the outset: is the slowdown structural or
cyclical? It seems that much of the fall in growth can
be attributed to an unwinding of earlier positive cyclical factors. Potential growth has also deteriorated. But
only China and Russia are expected to have persistently lower rates of economic growth.

6See IMF (2012d) for deeper discussion of the structural issues
confronting Russia.

Throughout the financial crisis, large external imbalances within the euro area have been a source of
concern, notwithstanding substantial declines. In
particular, progress has been asymmetric and has not
been accompanied by a return to internal balance. The
asymmetry relates to the fact that current account balances in member countries with external deficits have
improved significantly amid market pressure, whereas
current account surpluses in other member countries have not declined because of sluggish domestic
demand (Figure 1.3.1, panels 1 and 2). Consequently,
the euro-area-wide current account position has
reversed into surplus. As for internal balance, output
remains below potential and unemployment rates are
close to record highs in deficit countries, implying that
further substantial adjustment is needed for external
balance to be maintained when the crisis is over (Figure 1.3.1, panel 3).
This box reviews progress on external rebalancing
in the euro area and assesses how much further the
adjustment process needs to go—particularly, in deficit
economies—to restore both internal and external
balance.1 Its main conclusion is that continued adjustment by deficit countries (“internal devaluation”) is
needed to bolster their external competitiveness and to
prevent a reemergence of large current account deficits
as their economies recover. Meanwhile, growth in surplus economies should be more domestically driven.
Stronger domestic demand in surplus economies is
critical to support stronger demand in the euro area
as a whole and help sustain a rebound in exports from
deficit economies.
In the context of the euro area, relative changes
in the competitiveness of deficit countries have to
take place through changes in relative prices, without
possible adjustments in the nominal exchange rate at
the country level. These changes involve two dimensions: (1) a fall in the price of nontradable goods
relative to tradable goods to help reorient domestic
production toward tradables; and (2) a decline in the
price of domestic tradable goods relative to foreign
tradable goods to help boost external competitiveness
and exports. In other words, a relative price adjustment with respect to trading partners would bolster

Box 1.3 (continued)
the competitiveness and health of the external sector
(external balance), while the reallocation of resources
from the nontradables to the stronger tradables sectors would stimulate the overall economy to help it
reach full employment (internal balance). In monetary
unions that are also organized as banking and fiscal
unions (unlike the euro area currently), greater risk
sharing also mitigates the impact of current account
imbalances among member countries on macroeconomic and financial stability.

Progress in reducing the relative prices of
nontradable and tradable goods2
Some adjustment has occurred through a lowering of
costs (Figure 1.3.1, panel 4). Unit labor costs have
fallen significantly in deficit countries since they began
adjustment, with more substantial adjustments in
countries such as Greece and Ireland, on the back of
both productivity gains (as labor shedding generally
exceeded the decline in output) and wage declines
(Figure 1.3.2). During this period, overall unit labor
costs in Germany increased moderately, which helps
rebalancing (Figure 1.3.1, panels 5 and 6).
In terms of the reallocation of resources between
sectors, the dynamics of adjustment show significant
variation among deficit countries (Figure 1.3.1, panels
7 and 8). Ireland, where unit labor costs started to
decline in both the tradables and nontradables sectors
earlier than in the other euro area members, has begun
to experience a recovery of output in the tradables
sector, but it has not yet led to improved wages
and employment (Figure 1.3.2, panels 1 and 2). In
Portugal and Spain, output fell in the recent period
and employment has continued to decline, with little
in the way of wage cuts until recently (Figure 1.3.2,
panels 3–6). In Greece, adjustments are being made
through wage cuts and labor shedding in the absence
of output recovery (Figure 1.3.2, panels 7 and 8).
Overall, there have been no output gains except in
Ireland, which reflects in part the general collapse of
domestic demand in the euro area, and employment
remains below precrisis levels in both the tradables and
nontradables sectors.

2The four deficit countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain)
with the largest precrisis external deficits as of the end of 2007
are the focus of this detailed relative price adjustment analysis.

Progress in improving the price of tradables relative
to trading partners
In the wake of these cost adjustments, export price
competitiveness has started to improve, although
modestly. This is because in Greece, Ireland, Portugal,
and to some extent in Spain, the margins of exporters
(export prices relative to unit labor costs) have risen
since the crisis. This suggests that firms in the tradables
sector have started to rebuild their profitability, which
should increase the attractiveness of the tradables
sector and shift production toward export-oriented
sectors (Figure 1.3.3, panels 1 and 2).
Export recovery after the crisis has benefited from
these relative price adjustments as well as from strong
export demand from outside the euro area. An econometric analysis of quarterly exports between the third
quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2012 shows
that external demand from the rest of the world has
so far been the main driver of export performance,
contributing about 40 to 50 percent of the export
recovery in Germany and Spain and up to 140 percent
in Portugal (Figure 1.3.3, panels 3 and 4). However,
external demand within the euro area has been so
weak that it had a negative impact on export performance. This negative impact was particularly large in
Italy and Portugal.
Export recovery has also been helped by domestic
price adjustment relative to trading partners. Real
effective exchange rates (based on both unit labor costs
and GDP deflators) have depreciated significantly
(Figure 1.3.3, panels 5 and 6). The conclusion is that
adjustment efforts are starting to pay off. Meanwhile,
Germany’s exports also benefited from a decline in its
GDP deflator relative to its trading partners.
However, one question remains: how much of the
current account adjustments in the euro area will be
lasting? In other words, does the adjustment reflect
mainly structural improvements or just cyclical factors
driven by the large increase in output gaps? A method
building on the IMF’s 2013 External Balance Assessment analysis suggests that cyclical factors explain a
significant share of the current account reversals in
these economies (especially in Greece and Ireland),
whereas the impact of measured structural factors
(potential output, demographics, and the like) has
generally been modest except in a few countries,
including Germany (Figure 1.3.3, panel 7).The adjustment in the periphery of the euro area also involved a
number of common mechanisms—including the sharp

Box 1.3 (continued)
reversal in capital flows following the crisis—that arguably reflect both structural and cyclical driving forces.
The implication is that current account deficits could
widen again significantly when cyclical conditions,
including unemployment, improve, unless competitiveness improves further.
In the future, it will be very challenging to reduce
external vulnerabilities by relying on net foreign assets
to converge to more stable levels. Reducing net external liabilities to levels considered healthy elsewhere
would likely require much larger relative price adjust-

48

ments than implied by the need to reverse past unit
labor cost appreciation or to achieve current account
surpluses. Under the baseline World Economic Outlook
projections, without valuation effects, the net foreign
asset positions of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain
are expected to remain below minus 80 percent in
2018, implying that it will take a long time to undo
the deterioraration of the net foreign asset position
during 2000–12. Germany is expected to continue to
accumulate external surpluses (Figure 1.3.3, panel 8).

Global ProsPects and Policies

Box 1.4. abenomics: risks after early Success?
“Abenomics” is an ambitious new policy framework
announced for Japan in December 2012, which has
three main elements or “arrows”: monetary easing,
flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms. The goals
of Abenomics are ending deflation, raising growth
in a durable manner, and reversing the rising debt.
The initiative has already buoyed Japan’s near-term
outlook, but medium-term inflation expectations are
still substantially below the 2 percent inflation target,
highlighting risks that the target will not be met
by 2015 as currently envisaged without more policy
stimulus. But more stimulus could jeopardize the
achievement of the other main elements and could
also set back much-needed reductions in fiscal vulnerability. This box analyzes these risks to Abenomics
and reviews its achievements so far. There are two key
takeaways. First, full and timely implementation of
the three arrows of Abenomics is essential to meet its
overall goals. Second, structural reforms will be critical
to open up the additional policy space that may be
needed to bring inflation up to the 2 percent target.
The first arrow of the new policy framework is
is the new Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary
Easing (QQME) framework, with which the Bank of
Japan seeks to end deflation and achieve its 2 percent
inflation target by 2015. The second arrow is flexible
fiscal policy: (1) a stimulus amounting to 1.4 percent
of GDP in new debt-financed spending in 2013–14;
and (2) fiscal consolidation starting in 2014, with
a goal of halving the primary deficit by fiscal year
2015 from its fiscal year 2010 level of 6.6 percent of
GDP and achieving a primary surplus by fiscal year
2020. The third arrow is a combination of structural
reforms, as part of a comprehensive growth strategy
that aims to boost investment, employment, and
productivity.
The new policy framework had an immediate
financial market impact. From December 2012 to
June 2013, the Nikkei equity price index rose by
about 30 percent and the exchange rate depreciated
strongly, in real effective terms, by 17 percent. Bond
yields declined briefly to historic lows, but subsequently rebounded slightly.
The package has already lifted growth and boosted
the near-term outlook. IMF staff estimates suggest that
the new policy framework explains between a third

and half of the 3.9 percent GDP growth (seasonally
adjusted annual rate) in the first half of 2013, after
two quarters of negative or low growth. The total
effect of the package on real GDP growth for 2013 as
a whole is expected to be about 1.3 percentage points.
Some of this increase is due to wealth effects from rising equity prices, which are estimated to increase consumption and output by about 0.3 and 0.2 percent,
respectively. Another 0.4 percentage point of the output effect is due to the depreciation of the exchange
rate; the remainder represents effects through other
channels. Reflecting these developments, the current
World Economic Outlook baseline projections incorporate the effects of aggressive monetary easing as well as
expected fiscal policy adjustments through 2015.
Despite these achievements, there is no guarantee
of the longer-term success of Abenomics, particularly in increasing inflation. Although medium-term
inflation expectations increased, they are still below
the 2 percent inflation target (Figure 1.4.1).1 In an
1Survey-based

Box 1.4 (continued)
environment of disinflation, medium-term inflation
expectations are often slow to adjust, particularly when
accompanied by low growth and high unemployment.
Similarly, nominal wages have not yet started to rise,
which is not unexpected, given lags due to existing
labor contracts and other factors.
The critical question therefore is whether Japan
will achieve and sustain the high growth that will
likely be needed to overcome deflation. If not and if
inflation expectations fail to increase further, more
policy stimulus will be needed. If the scope for more
monetary policy stimulus is limited, this will mean
additional fiscal measures. But such measures require
fiscal space, and there are few degrees of freedom for
implementing Abenomics. Increasing the consumption
tax rate in two stages (in 2014 and 2015), as envisaged before Abenomics, is essential to containing fiscal
vulnerability. But higher consumption taxes could hurt
growth and inflation expectations, even though activity is expected to remain robust—with an expected
pickup in private investment and given the relatively
low value-added tax multiplier—leading to delays in
hitting the inflation target. Substantially slower growth
could necessitate growth-friendly temporary fiscal
measures (for example, temporary targeted transfers),
provided they are accompanied by a credible mediumterm plan ensuring fiscal sustainability.
To analyze the risks to Abenomics, the IMF staff
used the IMF’s new G20 Model (G20MOD) to compare the potential implications of a scenario in which
the three arrows are fully implemented with those
of a scenario in which they are not.2 Both scenarios
include adoption of a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan with adjustment of 1 percent of GDP each
year after 2015, and the comparison is relative to preAbenomics baseline projections.3
about 1 percent, but this could also reflect the anticipated rise
in the value-added tax. Medium-term expectations have not
changed significantly.
2The scenarios discussed here expand on those in the 2013
IMF spillover report (IMF, 2013a). They now include sticky
inflation expectations.
3Another scenario, which may appear unlikely in light of
Japan’s recent history of low or negative inflation, is analyzed
in more detail in the October 2013 Global Financial Stability
Report. In this scenario, inflation expectations increase above the
target and become less anchored if fiscal consolidation is halfhearted and the risk premium on government debt rises sharply.
In such a case, the central bank could encounter a form of fiscal
dominance, in which it would be unable to tighten policy as
much as it would otherwise prefer.

reforms and fiscal consolidation are mutually
reinforcing. Output is substantially higher than
projected under the medium-term path before
Abenomics, while the public-debt ratio starts to fall
rather than increasing further.
• In an incomplete Abenomics scenario without
growth-related structural reforms, investment and
growth are lower. In addition, inflation expectations
respond more sluggishly to economic conditions.
In this environment, the authorities need to adopt
additional fiscal stimulus to close the output gap
and boost inflation in the near term. But this
requires more fiscal adjustment later, partly because
long-term interest rates rise by more, due to higher
public financing requirements and higher risk
premiums. The outcome is an eventual decline in
the public-debt ratio to below the pre-Abenomics
baseline. But output would remain below the preAbenomics baseline, and the 2 percent inflation
target would be missed in the medium term. In the
absence of more fiscal adjustment, debt would rise
further, increasing the risk of a spike in bond yields
and threatening financial stability.
The simulations also suggest that negative spillover effects of Abenomics are likely to be mild. The
depreciation in the exchange rate attributable to the
QQME has a very small negative impact on shortterm growth in the rest of the world. That said, the
negative impacts are limited to a few countries (for
example, China, Germany, Korea) and are on the
order of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point of GDP in the
near term. Moreover, should the broader Abenomics
package be successful, it would have clear positive net
growth spillovers over the longer term if implemented
completely. However, under an incomplete scenario
these positive long-term benefits do not materialize.4

In sum, the analysis highlights that the authorities
need to be prepared to implement additional policy
stimulus to bring inflation up to the 2 percent target.
It also shows that this could increase the risks to Abenomics and that full and timely implementation of the
three arrows will be essential to mitigate such risks.5
The analysis also underscores that the three arrows are
closely connected. Structural reforms (for example,
increasing the retirement age and the labor force participation of women and measures to raise productivity growth) are needed for stronger long-term growth
and fiscal sustainability.6 Fiscal sustainability is needed
to gain fiscal space to help monetary policy bounded
by the zero interest rate floor and to avoid a sharp
increase in long-term real interest rates. Monetary
policy easing is necessary to lower real interest rates to
stimulate growth and help achieve the new inflation
target, which will further enhance fiscal sustainability. The fact that fiscal consolidation may have to be
delayed because of the need to maintain high growth
for some time underscores the benefits of locking in
longer-term fiscal gains through entitlement reform in
the short term. Raising the retirement age and reforms
to contain health care spending are obvious steps in
this regard. Finally, the analysis suggests that in the
short term, contingency plans for further unconventional monetary stimulus would be useful, given fiscal
vulnerabilities.

5Ambitious structural reforms are also required to offset
underlying deflation pressure from population aging.

T

he global growth constellation is changing.
Activity in the major advanced economies
has started to accelerate from subdued levels.
By contrast, growth in China and many
other emerging market economies in Asia and Latin
America, and to a lesser extent in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), has cooled, after a surge
in output beyond potential following the recovery
from the Great Recession. Structural factors have also
played a role in the slowdown, although to varying
degrees, reflecting infrastructure bottlenecks, a weak
investment climate, and other supply-side constraints.
Activity in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan (MENAP) region has been held back by
ongoing difficult political transitions in many countries
and, more recently, slower oil production in oil exporters. Growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is still strong,
driven by domestic demand, although at a slower pace
than previously anticipated.
The changing growth dynamics have brought new
risks to the fore. The growing conviction in markets that
a turning point in U.S. monetary policy is being reached
has led to a tightening in global financial conditions
since late May of this year. Many emerging markets
have experienced capital outflows and currency depreciations, wider bond spreads, and declining equity prices.
Although the Federal Reserve recently decided not to
taper yet, there is a distinct risk that financial conditions
could tighten further from their current, still supportive
levels (see Chapter 1). This would create spillovers to
the rest of the world. At the same time, risks identified
in recent World Economic Outlook (WEO) reports are
still relevant: the euro area could fall into stagnation;
the recovery in Japan could falter in the absence of
ambitious structural reforms and medium-term fiscal
consolidation plans with specific measures; still weaker
investment and potential output growth could result
in less of a growth bounce-back in emerging markets.
Some economies could even face abrupt balance of
payments adjustments if domestic vulnerabilities lead to
more sizable capital outflows. Finally, geopolitical risks
are also resurfacing. Even if these risks materialize only

partially, all would suffer, including through spillovers.
Chapter 1 discusses a plausible downside scenario under
which mild versions of several of these risks materialize,
and the regional implications are sketched out in this
chapter (see Figure 2.1).

the United States and canada: a Modest
recovery
Although growth in the United States remains tepid amid
strong fiscal consolidation, improving conditions bode well for
a gradual acceleration in growth (Figure 2.2). In Canada,
growth will pick up as export recovery and stronger business
investment offset the slowdown in the housing market and
the deceleration in private consumption growth.
Growth continued at a modest pace in the United States
in the first half of 2013. GDP grew at an annual rate of
about 1¼ percent, held down by sizable fiscal consolidation
(Figure 2.3). With ample slack remaining in the economy,
core inflation averaged only 1.8 percent in August. Recent
indicators suggest that the underlying recovery is gaining
ground, supported by a rebound in the housing market
and higher household net worth, although tighter financial
conditions since May have somewhat slowed the bounceback in activity. The unemployment rate continued to
fall from its peak of 10 percent in 2009 to 7.3 percent in
August 2013, but much of the improvement stemmed
from lower labor force participation. Despite a weak external environment, the current account deficit continued to
shrink through the second quarter of 2013, thanks in part
to increases in domestic energy production.
At the time of writing, a political standoff in the
United States has led to a shutdown of its federal government. The projections assume that the shutdown is short,
discretionary public spending is approved and executed
as assumed in the forecast, and the debt ceiling—which
may be reached by mid-October—is raised promptly.
Predicated on these assumptions, the recovery is projected
to accelerate in late 2013 and in 2014, as the pace of
fiscal consolidation slows, growth continues to benefit
from monetary accommodation, household balance sheets

strengthen further, and the housing market recovery
continues despite higher mortgage rates. Growth will
average 1½ percent in 2013 and accelerate to 2½ percent
in 2014 (Table 2.1). These projections, weaker than the
April 2013 forecast, largely reflect a prolonged budget
sequester, until the end of September 2014. The forecast
also assumes that the monetary policy stance will remain
highly accommodative in that the Federal Reserve’s asset
purchases will be scaled back only gradually starting later
this year and policy rates will remain near zero until early
2016. The unemployment rate is projected to decline
gradually and inflation to regain some momentum while
remaining subdued given the still wide output gap.
Despite some upside potential, risks to the outlook
remain tilted to the downside. On the domestic front,
private domestic demand could be weaker if the effect
of the sequester, tax increases, and recent tightening in
financing conditions on domestic demand and housing
is stronger than anticipated. Moreover, even though
the Federal Reserve recently communicated its inten54

tion to not yet begin tapering of asset purchases, yields
have come down only marginally (see Chapter 1),
and the risk of a further market-induced tightening of
financial conditions even without a stronger recovery,
cannot be ruled out. Other scenarios for larger-thanexpected interest rate increases involve an unexpected
pickup in inflation expectations or, over the medium
term, higher sovereign risk premiums caused by a lack
of further progress on fiscal consolidation. A longer
shutdown could have sizable adverse growth implications. A failure to promptly raise the debt ceiling could
also adversely affect financial markets and economic
activity, with spillovers to the rest of the world.
Overall, an untimely tightening in U.S. monetary
conditions combined with shocks from the external
front—such as further deceleration in growth in other
major economies—as illustrated in the plausible downside scenario (see Figure 2.1) could lower U.S. growth
by close to ½ percentage point over the next year and
by 1 percent in the medium term.

On the upside, a more resilient housing market recovery
could contribute to a virtuous cycle of easing lending conditions, rising house prices, increasing household net worth,
and stronger consumption and investment, with beneficial
growth effects for the United States as well as the rest of the
world. Lower uncertainty and prospects for a faster recovery
in consumer demand could induce businesses to shift away
from cash hoarding toward real investment.
The biggest policy priority is to adopt a comprehensive fiscal consolidation plan to place public debt
on a sustainable path over the medium term while
supporting near-term growth. The fiscal deficit reduction under the sequester is excessively rapid and ill
designed, and it is expected to subtract between 1½
and 1¾ percentage points from growth in 2013.1

back-loaded savings in entitlement spending and new
revenues, would support the recovery.
Given the sizable economic slack, slow employment recovery, and stable inflation expectations, the
accommodative monetary policy stance continues to
be appropriate. Any unwinding in monetary policy
accommodation should be guided by the strength of
the recovery, while considering other potential issues
such as inflation and financial stability challenges.
Careful calibration of the timing of exit, and effective
communication about the strategy, will be critical to
ensure a smooth normalization process and to minimize risks of negative global spillovers. If financial
conditions tighten further and threaten to derail the
nascent recovery, the Federal Reserve may need to ease
monetary policy conditions through forward guidance
or changing the timing and extent of the tapering.

consumption. The economy is projected to expand at
slightly more than 1½ percent in 2013 and 2¼ percent
in 2014, as net exports and business investment benefit
from the U.S. recovery and more than offset slower
consumption growth. The balance of risks to Canada’s
outlook is still tilted to the downside, emanating from
potentially weaker external demand. Moreover, household debt remains historically high, which could
amplify the negative growth impact of adverse shocks
to the economy.
Policies need to continue to support near-term
growth while reducing domestic vulnerabilities. Fiscal
consolidation, particularly at the provincial level, must
proceed as planned to rebuild fiscal space against future
shocks. The current accommodative monetary policy
stance remains appropriate, with gradual tightening
expected to begin in the second half of 2014.

Despite a large ﬁscal contraction, growth in the United States is expected to improve gradually
given strong private consumption growth and still supportive ﬁnancing conditions. However,
there is considerable economic slack, and employment recovery will remain slow. In Canada,
high household debt will dampen consumption growth, but GDP growth will be mainly
supported by a positive contribution from net exports.

Policy actions have reduced some important tail risks in
the euro area and stabilized financial markets. Growth is
beginning to resume but is still very weak (Figure 2.4).
Unemployment is very high, and social and political tensions are hurting the reform momentum in the euro area.
Actions to restore financial sector health and strengthen
its infrastructure are essential to ensure financial stability
and support the recovery. Furthermore, continued nearterm demand support and deeper structural reforms to
raise competitiveness and potential output are essential for
growth and job creation.
The euro area returned to growth in the second
quarter of 2013 after six quarters of recession. Recent
high-frequency indicators suggest that activity is beginning to stabilize in the periphery and recover in the
core. However, unemployment remains high, and labor
markets remain depressed. Moreover, inflation remains
below the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) mediumterm objective, raising concerns about underlying
disinflationary or deflationary trends.
A multitude of factors, all legacies of the global
financial crisis, will continue to interact to restrain
growth and inflation in the euro area, on top of weakening exports from the deceleration in many emerging
market economies (Figure 2.5):

private sectors continue to deleverage, especially in

some periphery economies. In the core economies,
despite recent improvements in confidence, private
demand is also affected by concerns about global
growth and continued uncertainty about euro area
prospects and policies. Moreover, notwithstanding
some relaxation in adjustment targets and a slowdown in the pace of adjustment, fiscal consolidation
continues to weigh on near-term activity.
• Financial market fragmentation and weak bank balance sheets continue to impair the transmission of
the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance to
the periphery, keeping private sector borrowing rates
high and limiting banks’ ability to lend.
• Despite significant reforms, long-standing labor and
product market weaknesses continue to hamper relative price adjustment and competitiveness, especially
in the periphery. As a result, the pace at which external imbalances within the euro area are narrowing
has been slow.
Under current policies, activity in the euro area is
forecast to shrink by about ½ percent in 2013 after a
contraction of a similar magnitude in 2012 (Table 2.2).
Growth is expected to recover from an annual rate of ¾
percentage point in the second half of 2013 to 1 percent
in 2014, driven by a smaller fiscal drag, stronger external
demand, and a gradual improvement in private sector
lending conditions. Inflation is expected to stay at about
1½ percent over the next two years because of persistent
output gaps. Over the medium term, growth is expected
to remain subdued and inflation substantially below the
ECB’s medium-term objective.
Growth is also likely to be subdued in other advanced
economies in Europe. In the United Kingdom, recent
data have shown welcome signs of an improving
economy, consistent with increasing consumer and
business confidence, but output remains well below its
pre-crisis peak. Growth is expected to be about 1½ percent in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014, slowly returning to
trend in the medium term, but output levels will remain
below potential for many years. Sweden’s economy has
been growing slowly along with its main Nordic and
European trading partners, with prospects for a slow
return to higher but still moderate growth.
Risks have become more balanced than six months
ago, but still remain tilted to the downside. Amid a
fragile recovery, limited policy space, and substantial
slack, the region could be hit by further domestic or
external shocks. Any turbulence in global financial
markets, for example, as a result of further tightening

in U.S. monetary conditions, could aggravate fragmentation and complicate policies, although sovereign
spreads in the euro area periphery have fallen below
the low levels reached in late 2012. Disappointing
growth in emerging market economies would also hurt
external demand. On the upside, if the core economies
experience a stronger pickup in investment after years
of underinvestment, it could have positive spillovers
to the entire region. However, this would require the
delivery of current policy commitments, including at
the euro area level. The main risk, therefore, relates
to stalled policy commitments. Absent fundamental
reforms, there is a high risk of stagnation, renewed

stress in the short term, and a loss of potential output
through hysteresis effects in the medium term.
The key priorities for all advanced economies in the
region are to bolster growth while ensuring financial
stability. Attaining this goal requires action in four
interrelated areas:
•• Bank balance sheets should be repaired expeditiously
to improve confidence and revive credit and demand
in the euro area and the United Kingdom. A credible, comprehensive, forward-looking, independent
assessment of capital shortfalls in the euro area is
needed in the context of the forthcoming bank
balance sheet assessment. Such an assessment must

	International Monetary Fund | October 2013

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

be supported with a clear plan to meet bank capital
requirements and a credible area-wide backstop to
avoid disorderly deleveraging in the short term and
help economies, especially those that are fiscally
challenged, to address capital shortfalls without
threatening debt sustainability. In the United Kingdom, the health of the two government-intervened
banks is crucial for credit growth, and a clear
strategy is needed for the Royal Bank of Scotland,
with a view to returning both to private ownership.
Sweden should continue to strengthen financial
stability by further improving bank funding, liquidity, and capital; introducing measures to contain the
buildup in household debt; and improving mortgage
amortization.
• Reforms are also needed to strengthen the financial
sector architecture. A more complete banking union
is necessary to reverse fragmentation and weaken
bank-sovereign links in the euro area. There must
be political commitment to build on the progress
made to operationalize the recently established
Single Supervisory Mechanism and finalize the Bank
Recovery and Resolution and the Deposit Guarantee
Scheme Directives. A strong resolution mechanism,
based on a centralized authority backed by a common
fiscal backstop with power to trigger resolution and
make decisions on burden sharing, is critical to ensure
timely and least-cost resolution. The United Kingdom
needs greater coordination across regulatory bodies,
continued efforts to ensure that the newly established
supervisors are adequately resourced and operationally
independent, and that the Financial Policy Committee has a strong macroprudential toolkit. Structural
banking reforms must be internationally coordinated
to avoid regulatory arbitrage.
• Additional near-term support will be needed to
reverse weak growth. In the euro area, more monetary easing is necessary, including further policy rate
cuts, further reliance on forward guidance to anchor
interest rate expectations, and additional unconventional monetary support to reduce fragmentation
and improve credit access, especially for small and
medium enterprises (see Figure 2.5, panels 3 and
4). Despite the recent postponement of Excessive
Deficit Procedures deadlines for some economies,
meeting fiscal targets may still prove challenging in
some cases, and more flexibility may be needed if
growth disappoints. However, given high debt levels,
fiscal adjustment should be anchored by a credible

60

medium-term framework. Monetary policy should
also stay accommodative in the United Kingdom,
and the Bank of England’s recently adopted forward
guidance framework is an important step toward
greater transparency about the factors that will guide
policy rates. In an environment of still low interest rates and underutilization of resources, public
investment can also be brought forward to offset the
drag from planned near-term fiscal tightening, while
staying within the medium-term fiscal framework.
In Sweden, fiscal and—assuming household credit
growth remains contained—monetary policy should
continue to support the recovery in the short term,
with room for further easing if downside risks
materialize.
• Reforms are also needed to boost potential growth
and competitiveness. In the euro area, this will
involve implementing the Services Directive to help
remove country-specific barriers for protected professions and to the entry and exit of firms, and tackling vested interests in product markets. Improved
pension portability and unemployment benefits
would foster labor mobility. National labor market
reforms could raise participation, level the playing
field between protected and unprotected workers,
and, where necessary, promote more flexible bargaining arrangements that foster job creation.

emerging europe
Emerging Europe is tracking a moderate recovery in 2013
and 2014, but downside risks and domestic policy challenges remain significant.
Emerging Europe experienced a sharp slowdown
in 2012, reflecting weak exports due to the euro area
recession, decreased funding for subsidiaries of western
European banks, and the impact of bad weather in
some economies. Activity picked up in the first half of
2013 thanks to easier financial conditions on account
of monetary easing, improved external funding, and a
bounce-back from the bad weather (Figure 2.6).
The recent global financial market volatility has led
to some renewed tightening of local financial conditions, including in Turkey. Economies with relatively
larger portfolio inflows were more affected than others,
as were countries with higher external imbalances.
Still, incoming data suggest that the adverse impact
of tighter financial conditions on activity is modest in

Increased Financial Volatility
Growth is forecast to rebound this year after bottoming out in 2012. However, the region is
exposed to downside risks from a slowdown in Europe and to potentially greater ﬁnancial
market volatility. Policies should focus on rebuilding ﬁscal balances to maintain market
conﬁdence and implementing structural reforms to raise growth potential and lower still-high
unemployment.

most economies, likely reflecting the offsetting effects
from currency depreciation.
Growth in the region is expected to pick up from
1½ percent in 2012 to 2¼ percent in 2013 and further to 2¾ percent in 2014, unchanged from the April
2013 WEO forecast. However, there are large differences across countries, with strong growth in Turkey
and the Baltics, an incipient recovery in southeastern Europe and Hungary, and further weakening in
Poland.
•• Growth in Turkey, which slowed sharply last year, is
projected to pick up to 3¾ percent this year, decelerating to 3½ percent in 2014. The recent financial
tightening is expected to result in some slowing
of activity in the second half of 2013. In terms of
annual growth in 2013–14, however, the impact of
this slowing will be more than offset by the muchstronger-than-anticipated growth in the first half of
2013, reflecting the boost to domestic demand from
monetary easing and a sharp increase in government
investment.
•• Growth in Poland is expected to decelerate from 2
percent in 2012 to 1¼ percent this year, picking
up gradually to 2¼ percent in 2014. Not only has
the economy been hurt by the weakness in the euro
area, but a long period of strong increases in domestic demand seems to have run its course.
•• Southeastern Europe, which was affected by both
a very cold winter and severe drought in summer
2012, is recovering this year; only Croatia will
remain in a mild recession. Better weather will also
help Hungary, although activity will be broadly flat
this year, recovering by 1¼ percent in 2014.
•• Growth in the Baltics is projected to ease but remain
strong.
With a few exceptions, moderate economic growth
will keep a lid on inflation pressure. However, annual
average inflation will remain elevated in 2013 in
Turkey (6½ percent) and Serbia (8½ percent), reflecting inflation inertia and the impact of currency
depreciation.
The balance of risks to the outlook is tilted to the
downside. A more protracted recession in the euro area
is a key risk, especially for countries with strong intraEuropean links (notably, Croatia, Hungary, Poland).
Further deterioration in external financing conditions
is another major concern, particularly for countries
with relatively large fiscal or external imbalances or
both, such as Turkey and Serbia. Prolonged financial

market volatility could also constrain the funding of
western banks’ regional subsidiaries.
Policies should aim to nurture the recovery and
reduce vulnerability from still elevated fiscal and current account deficits in some countries. The recent
financial market turbulence calls for a differentiated
policy response. In countries with high debt or deficits,
rollover risks have increased in recent months, and
action will be needed to reduce those vulnerabilities. By contrast, in countries where public debt and
deficits are at more moderate levels, giving full play to
automatic stabilizers would help cushion the near-term
impact on activity. In countries where the inflation
outlook is benign, there may be room to further ease
monetary policy.
Policies should also focus on lifting potential
growth, which is estimated to have dropped sharply
since the global financial crisis. For many countries
where a large share of the high unemployment appears
to be structural (for example, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Poland), a bold reform agenda will be needed to
alleviate growth bottlenecks. The agenda will vary
by country but includes addressing low labor force
participation, boosting external competitiveness, and
completing the transition agendas.

asia: a Lower Growth trajectory
Growth has disappointed across the region, largely because
of weaker demand, although supply factors have also
played a role in some economies. Capital inflows have
declined, and domestic assets have been repriced and
exchange rates depreciated, especially in countries where
fundamentals were perceived to be weaker. Still, financial
conditions remain generally supportive from a historical
perspective, and external demand is expected to gradually
strengthen. The outlook is for continued strong growth, but
risks are tilted to the downside. Policies need to strike a
balance between supporting growth and guarding against
inflation and financial stability risks. Where supply-side
constraints are binding, continued structural reforms are
crucial and will also help reduce vulnerabilities.
During the first half of 2013, growth in Asia generally moderated and was weaker than anticipated in the
April 2013 WEO. This was due to a more rapid slowdown in the pace of growth in China, which affected
industrial activity in much of emerging Asia, including through supply-chain links, while India faced

62

persistent supply-side constraints. By contrast, Japan
was the main bright spot, reflecting the new policy
momentum, which has boosted asset prices and private
consumption (see Box 1.4 in Chapter 1).
Awareness of an approaching turning point in
U.S. monetary policy, combined with slower growth
momentum in many Asian economies, resulted in
increased financial volatility in the region in recent
months, with capital outflows in most countries. However, tighter financial conditions have affected a few
economies so far (notably, India and Indonesia).
Growth in the region is expected to remain solid
in the second half of 2013 and 2014, in line with a
projected moderate global recovery—and still supportive financial and monetary conditions in many
economies—and exchange rate depreciations that have
dampened the impact of recent asset price corrections
(Figures 2.7 and 2.8). Overall, growth is projected to
average about 5¼ percent in 2013–14, which is some
½ percent and ¾ percent weaker for 2013 and 2014,
respectively, compared with the April 2013 WEO
(Table 2.3). Consistent with the moderate pickup in
growth and a stable outlook for global commodity
prices, inflation is expected to remain generally within
central banks’ comfort zones.
• Growth in Japan is projected at 2 percent in 2013,
buoyed by the fiscal stimulus and monetary easing
to support private consumption and investment.
Helped by yen depreciation and a pickup in external
demand, exports should also strengthen. Growth is
forecast to decelerate to 1¼ percent in 2014, with
fiscal stimulus withdrawal and the increase in the
consumption tax. However, if an additional “stimulus package” does go ahead, growth in 2014 would
be higher than currently projected. Inflation will
temporarily rise toward 3 percent in 2014, reflecting
the effects of the consumption tax hike, although
underlying inflation is projected to be closer to 1¼
percent.
• In China, growth is projected to decelerate to 7½
percent this year, in line with the authorities’ target,
and further to 7¼ percent next year. Policymakers
have refrained from further stimulating growth,
which is consistent with the objectives of safeguarding financial stability and moving the economy to a
more balanced and sustainable growth path.
• Supported by the recent fiscal and monetary
stimulus, the Korean economy is set for a modest
recovery. Growth is projected to rise to 2¾ percent

in 2013, after bottoming out at 2 percent in 2012,
and rise further to 3¾ percent in 2014.
• In India, growth in fiscal year 2013 is expected to be
around 3¾ percent, with strong agriculture production offset by lackluster activity in manufacturing and
services, and monetary tightening adversely affecting
domestic demand. For fiscal year 2014, growth is projected to accelerate somewhat to 5 percent, helped by
an easing of supply bottlenecks and strengthening of
exports.2 Inflation is expected to stay high at almost

11 percent this year and 9 percent in 2014, driven by
continued domestic food price pressures.
• In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
economies, solid domestic demand should support
growth, particularly in Malaysia and the Philippines. In Thailand, after the slowdown in the first
quarter of 2013, growth should return to potential during the second half of the year, driven by
private demand and higher public spending. Growth
in Indonesia will slow, however, due to sluggish

2Note that, in accordance with international standards, growth for
India is presented in Table 2.3 for GDP at market prices. In terms of
GDP at factor cost, growth is estimated to be 5 percent in fiscal year

2012 and is projected at 4¼ percent in 2013 and about 5 percent
in 2014.

investment and weaker commodity demand from
other emerging market economies, as well as tighter
financing conditions.
• Given weakening external demand until recently,
growth in other developing Asian economies is
projected to slow from 6¼ percent in 2012 to a still
robust 6 percent this year before picking up again
next year.
Risks to growth in the region are tilted to the
downside. A major downside risk is a synchronized
global slowdown, which would take a heavy toll on the
region’s export-dependent economies. Another risk is
that capital outflows—due to a further tightening in
U.S. monetary conditions or deteriorating domestic
fundamentals—could intensify. This could lead to
further declines in domestic asset prices, tighter overall
financial conditions and, ultimately, slower growth,
especially in economies with weaker fundamentals
and less policy space. Although in some countries,
diminished inflows may alleviate previous concerns
about potential credit booms, in others, risks of harder
landings or financial instability have increased. That
said, many countries operate under flexible exchange
rate regimes that would help mitigate these effects,
especially where inflation pressure is absent and high
reserve levels give them room to smooth excess volatility. A persistent deceleration in investment activity
because of structural weaknesses is yet another concern.
Given its high regional integration, Asia would be
affected by an unexpected slowdown in any of its
larger economies, particularly China. In Japan, in the
absence of credible fiscal and structural reforms, the new
macroeconomic framework may be ineffective in raising
growth and inflation expectations, with adverse effects
on the rest of Asia as well. Indeed, under the plausible
downside scenario, growth in the region would decline
substantially. Growth in Japan in the first year would be
¾ percentage point lower, while in the rest of the region
it would decrease by 1 percentage point.
Policymakers need to strike a balance between supporting demand and guarding against financial stability
risks. For many, against the backdrop of greater downside risks to growth and a generally benign inflation
outlook, the accommodative stance is broadly appropriate. However, country circumstances differ given
differences in inflationary and financial stability risks—
for instance Bank Indonesia recently had to tighten
amid downward currency pressure and higher expected
inflation. In Japan, efforts should be focused on meet-

ing the authorities’ inflation target in the near term.
This requires that the accommodative monetary policy
stance be implemented fully and supported with other
much-needed measures (such as structural reforms)
that raise medium-term growth prospects.
Amid heightened global financial market volatility, micro- and macroprudential tools will continue to
play a role in achieving financial stability. Measures that
strengthen the resilience of financial systems will also
help economies weather the consequences of a potential sudden stop in capital inflows. In some economies,
including China, further financial reform is needed to
safeguard financial stability, improve the allocation of
credit, and guide the economy to a more sustainable
growth path.
Fiscal targets, where needed, should be defined in
cyclically adjusted terms, allowing automatic stabilizers to
operate. In many economies, buffers should be rebuilt to
open up space for growth-enhancing infrastructure, social
spending, and future countercyclical policy. In China,
strengthening the management, transparency, and overall
governance framework of local government finances
would also help contain the risks from rising local government debt. In Japan, the recently announced decision to

implement the first stage of the consumption tax increase
to 8 percent in April 2014 is a welcome step forward.
The planned additional stimulus for 2014 to mitigate
the growth impact of this measure puts a premium on
developing a concrete and credible medium-term plan as
quickly as possible to place public debt on a sustainable
path. A successful implementation of Abenomics would
have clear growth benefits not only to Japan but also to
other economies in the rest of Asia (see also Box 1.4 in
Chapter 1). Finally, for a few countries, the recent market
pressure has put a further premium on strengthening
public finances and implementing structural reforms (for
example, India).
If downside risks to growth materialize, exchange
rate flexibility and monetary easing should generally be
the first lines of defense in economies where inflation
is low and expectations are firmly anchored. In some
economies, however (for example, India and Indonesia), more tightening may be called for given continued inflation pressure, further amplified by currency
depreciation. On the fiscal side, automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to play, but high deficits make fiscal
consolidation a priority in a number of economies,
such as India, Japan, and Vietnam. In others, stimu-

lus should be considered only if a serious slowdown
threatens.

Latin america and the caribbean: Growth Is
Subdued
Less supportive external conditions and domestic supplyside constraints have dampened activity in Latin America
and the Caribbean. Output growth is projected to
moderate to 2¾ percent in 2013 (Figure 2.9). Growth is
expected to recover gradually in 2014 as external demand
strengthens, but risks remain on the downside. Allowing
exchange rates to adjust to changes in fundamentals will
help partly offset the effects of tighter financial conditions.
Gradual fiscal consolidation should continue in countries
with limited fiscal space and those with still tight capacity
constraints. With weaker growth prospects and heightened
capital flow volatility, safeguarding financial stability is
a key policy priority. Growth in the tourism-dependent
Caribbean economies remains low, and policy challenges
include addressing high debt, weak competitiveness, and
fragile financial systems.
Growth in most of the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region in the first half of the year was
weaker than envisaged in the April 2013 WEO. Activity was held back by infrastructure bottlenecks, lower
commodity prices, and policy tightening in some cases
(Figure 2.10). The unexpected slowdown in Mexico
was related to lower government spending, a decline
in construction activity, and sluggish demand from the
United States. In Brazil, growth picked up on the back
of stronger investment, including inventories. However, high-frequency indicators point to some moderation in activity going into the second half of the year.
The recent increase in global financial market volatility hit the region’s exchange rates, sovereign spreads,
and stock markets. In some countries, governments
responded to market turbulence by easing capital controls and intervening to contain exchange rate volatility. In many cases, depreciation brought exchange rates
more in line with fundamentals. Moreover, sovereign
and corporate yields are still relatively low from a
historical perspective.
Output in the LAC region is projected to grow by
2¾ percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014, some ¾
percentage point lower than forecast in the April 2013
WEO (Table 2.4). The downward revisions reflect the
weaker-than-expected outturn in the first half of 2013

66

and the effect of tighter financial conditions on growth
going forward. Growth rates in the medium term are
also expected to remain below the cyclically high rates
recorded after the Great Recession:3
• In most of the financially integrated economies
(Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay), growth is
expected to moderate to more sustainable levels.
Strong wage growth and low unemployment should
support consumption. Despite some deceleration,
credit growth is expected to remain relatively strong.
External current account deficits are projected to
widen further in 2013 as commodity prices have
softened and domestic demand continues to outpace
output. Inflation pressure is broadly contained,
except in Uruguay, where inflation remains above
target.
• Brazil’s economy is expected to grow by 2½ percent
in 2013. The recent depreciation of the currency
will improve external competitiveness and partially
offset the adverse impact of increases in sovereign
yields. But higher inflation has lowered real incomes
and may weigh on consumption, while supply
constraints and policy uncertainty may continue to
constrain activity.
• In Mexico, growth is expected to slow to 1¼ percent
in 2013, largely reflecting the weakness in activity
in the first half of the year. Growth is projected to
recover gradually and return to 3 percent in 2014, as
manufacturing picks up on the back of a recovery in
U.S. demand, public spending regains momentum,
and ongoing structural reforms begin to bear fruit.
In the medium term, growth is expected to rise to
an annual average of 3½ to 4 percent, based on the
IMF staff ’s preliminary estimates of the effects of
structural reforms.
• Growth in other commodity-exporting countries
is generally expected to remain strong, except in
Venezuela, where energy shortages and exchange
controls are curtailing economic activity. Growth
in Argentina has recovered due to a strong harvest,
but activity continues to be constrained by foreign
exchange and other administrative controls.
• Output growth will slow in Central America, given
weaker-than-expected external demand and sluggish
remittances.

Note: The data for Argentina are ofﬁcially reported data. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures
to address the quality of the ofﬁcial GDP data. Alternative data sources have shown signiﬁcantly lower real growth than the ofﬁcial data since 2008. In this context,
the IMF is also using alternative estimates of GDP growth for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.

• Activity will be weak in much of the Caribbean as
tourism flows remain subdued and construction
activity contracts. High debt levels, weak competitiveness, and rising financial vulnerabilities continue
to constrain fiscal policy and growth prospects.
Overall, downside risks dominate the outlook.
Given the LAC region’s strong dependence on commodities, a key external risk is a sharp drop in commodity prices. As illustrated in the plausible downside
scenario, slower growth in major economies outside of
the region, including in China, would reduce growth

in Latin America by ½ percentage point through its
effect on commodity prices and exports. Renewed
financial market volatility and continued capital outflows represent another risk.
Policymakers should calibrate macroeconomic policies based on a realistic assessment of their economies’
supply potential. Maintaining unsustainably high
growth rates through fiscal policy stimulus would
weaken public finances and widen current account
deficits. In the context of limited economic slack and
still relatively favorable external conditions in most of

Latin America, countries should proceed with gradual
fiscal consolidation while protecting critical public
investment and social spending. Fiscal consolidation
remains critical for countries with high debt and deficits, including in the Caribbean. In countries with low
inflation and anchored inflation expectations, exchange
rate flexibility and monetary policy should continue to
be the first line of defense if downside risks materialize,
while guarding against excessive exchange rate volatility. Where inflation pressure persists (including in
Brazil), monetary tightening remains appropriate.
Prudential oversight of the financial system needs
to be stepped up, with the goal of identifying and
addressing potential vulnerabilities, particularly against
a backdrop of recent rapid credit growth that was
fueled in part by capital inflows.
Strengthening competitiveness, raising productivity, and increasing saving and investment rates remain
critical medium-term challenges for the LAC region.
With labor participation already high and unemployment rates low, countries will need to rely increasingly
on capital accumulation and productivity gains to
maintain high growth rates. Raising domestic savings
will allow increased investment without additional reliance on foreign borrowing.

commonwealth of Independent States: Slower
Growth amid Weak external and Internal
Demand
Growth in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) has slowed, reflecting both a weak external environment and supply-side constraints in some economies
(Figure 2.11). Reforms are needed to boost the region’s
growth potential, while in several countries policies also
need to reduce macro imbalances, given heightened risks
and limited buffers.
Growth in the European CIS economies, including
Russia, slowed in the first half of 2013 (Figure 2.12).
Soft external demand was a factor but weak domestic
investment also contributed, particularly where output
gaps were small and supply constraints were binding.
In the Caucasus and central Asia (CCA), however, economic activity continued to grow at a strong pace as in
2012, supported by an expansion of productive capacity in extractive sectors for the commodity exporters,
as well as a stable inflow of remittances thus far. The
recent increase in global financial volatility hit the

major European CIS economies more than the CCA,
given the latter’s limited external financial exposure.
Growth in the CIS economies is projected to
decelerate slightly from 3½ percent in 2012 to about 2
percent this year, before rising to 3½ percent in 2014
(Table 2.5). Prospects vary within the region, with
weaker growth in the European CIS economies and
net energy importers, and stronger growth in the CCA
economies and the net energy exporters:
• In Russia, growth is projected to average 1½ percent
in 2013, increasing to 3 percent in 2014. This
estimate reflects a downward revision of close to 2
percentage points for 2013 and ¾ percentage point
for 2014 relative to the April 2013 WEO. Although
consumption is still supported by strong real wage
and retail credit growth, growth prospects have been
dampened by a weak external environment, some

acceleration of capital outflows and declining equity
prices, and subdued investment.
• Outside Russia, growth in the region’s energy
exporters is forecast to remain strong. In Kazakhstan, growth will average 5 percent in 2013 and 5¼
percent in 2014, driven by a recovery in oil production and strong activity in the industrial and services
sectors.
• In Ukraine, which has been in recession since mid2012, growth will be near zero this year. Activity
will be held back by weak exports, political uncertainty, and tight monetary conditions in defense
of an exchange rate under pressure because of the
economy’s twin deficits. Growth is projected to rise
to 1½ percent in 2014.
• Most of the other energy importers have not seen
large capital inflows, in part due to weak recent

remain low in Belarus, reflecting structural rigidities and declining competitiveness. Activity will
rebound in Moldova, driven by agriculture, exports,
and consumption. The Kyrgyz Republic is projected
to grow at 7 percent for 2013–14 as the economy
recovers from earlier disruptions in gold mining and
sustains strong performance in construction, trade,
and services.
• Growth in Armenia and Georgia is expected to
decelerate this year. In Armenia, this reflects slower
growth in the agricultural sector in 2013 after a
strong performance in 2012 related to favorable
weather, upward price adjustments in gas and electricity tariffs, and budget underspending. Growth

70

in Georgia is expected to moderate given slower
private investment, weak credit growth, and budget
underspending.
Inflation in the region will average 6–6½ percent
in 2013–14 and is a pressing issue in a few economies
(Belarus, Uzbekistan). In Belarus, inflation has been
declining, but is projected to remain in double digits.
Inflation in Uzbekistan is also expected to stay in double
digits, reflecting continuing depreciation of the currency,
higher local food and administered prices, and wage
increases. In Russia, inflation is projected to fall to about
6¼ percent by the end of 2013, just above the upper
end of the central bank’s target range of 5 to 6 percent,
as the effects of temporary supply-side shocks fade.
Inflation is expected to remain above the central bank’s
point inflation target of 4½ percent in 2014.

Risks are tilted to the downside. Higher government
bond yields and borrowing costs or more difficult
access to global capital markets would worsen the
outlook for the region, especially for countries with
relatively large fiscal and/or external imbalances and
limited buffers, such as Belarus and Ukraine (which
has seen sovereign credit default swap yields rise to
prohibitive ranges in recent months). For the CCA
commodity importers, however, the large share of
longer-term instruments in the financing of their
current account deficits would be a mitigating factor.
Lower-than-anticipated growth in emerging market
economies elsewhere would lower commodity prices,
which would have a large negative impact on activity
in Russia, Ukraine, and the CCA commodity exporters. Given the prominence of Russia in trade, and
remittance flows in the region, the CCA commodity
importers would be affected indirectly through the
sharper-than-expected slowdown in Russia.
Policies should continue to maintain macroeconomic stability and implement reforms to boost
potential growth. Russia is now in a better position
to absorb external shocks than it used to be because
of its more flexible exchange rate, improved crisismanagement capacity, higher reserves, and narrower
balance sheet mismatches. The priority is to raise the
growth potential, improve the investment regime,
facilitate new energy production, scale back government involvement in the economy, and gradually
strengthen fiscal buffers. Ukraine would benefit from
a more flexible exchange rate regime, tighter fiscal
policy, an increase in domestic gas and heating tariffs,
and a restart of structural reforms. Belarus will need
to coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to tightly
manage domestic demand and adopt structural reforms
to achieve sustainable growth. Kazakhstan should
continue to move toward a long-lasting solution to
its high stock of nonperforming loans and revamp its
monetary and fiscal policy frameworks. Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan should remove fiscal stimulus to keep
inflation at bay and improve fiscal sustainability while
further enhancing the efficiency of government spending. Monetary tightening should continue in Uzbekistan to contain second-round effects on inflation from
local food and administered price increases.
For some economies, budget underspending has
resulted in an unexpected fiscal tightening, which has
also contributed to the recent slowdown (Armenia,
Georgia). For these economies, the priority should be

year’s policy rate cuts should help reduce deflationary pressures, although resolution of recent political
uncertainty is needed to restore investor confidence.

Middle east, North africa, afghanistan, and
pakistan: Growth hinges on Improvements in
Oil production and confidence
Growth in the MENAP region is expected to decline in
2013 (Figure 2.13). Weak global demand and domestic
supply disruptions have reduced oil production. Meanwhile, uncertainties arising from prolonged political
transitions, and a weak external environment, weigh on
confidence in the oil importers. Growth is expected to pick
up in 2014 with improved global conditions and a recovery in oil production (Figure 2.14). However, sustainable
and equitable growth over the medium term depends on
an improved sociopolitical environment and macroeconomic stability, increased economic diversification, and
accelerated job creation.

72

Oil-exporting economies
Growth in the oil exporters decelerated substantially
in the first half of 2013, driven by falling oil production. In a number of economies, such as the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Libya, high geopolitical
tension, economic sanctions, unscheduled maintenance, and deteriorating security have disrupted the oil
supply. All in all, the region’s hydrocarbon output is
expected to fall by 1 percent in 2013, with the decline
driven broadly by Libya and Iran. Saudi Arabia’s oil
production for the year as a whole is also projected to
decline slightly, as it continued to play a stabilizing role
in the global oil market: it reduced production in late
2012 through early 2013 in the face of slowing global
demand and rising supply from suppliers outside the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), and raised it later in the year to compensate
for oil production disruptions elsewhere in the region.
In contrast to oil GDP, non-oil GDP is holding up
well in most countries, supported by high government
spending and recovering credit growth.

volatility, sovereign and corporate bond yields for the

Note: Includes Israel only for reasons of geography. Iran’s real GDP growth for 2012 and beyond has not been signiﬁcantly updated from the April 2013 WEO
in light of the pending publication of national accounts by the central bank and the new authorities’ plans.

MENAP oil exporters rose, but not significantly and
from low levels, reflecting generally limited financial
linkages with global markets and large external buffers.
For the year as a whole, growth is projected to average 2 percent—a downward revision of 1¼ percentage
point from the April 2013 WEO—largely on account
of lower oil production. Growth will likely increase to
4 percent in 2014 with a recovery in global demand
and higher oil production in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and
Libya (Table 2.6). Growth in non-oil GDP is forecast
to increase from about 3¾ percent in 2013 to 4½
percent in 2014.
Average inflation is not an immediate concern for
most oil exporters. In the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) economies, inflation rates have been gradually
rising, largely because of food prices and/or higher
housing costs, but are expected to remain moderate at
about 3¼ percent in 2013–14. By contrast, in Iran,
inflation has accelerated markedly since late 2012,
reflecting pass-through from the large currency depreciation. Elsewhere, inflation has declined further with
the alleviation of supply bottlenecks, moderating food
prices, and, in Algeria, a withdrawal of policy accommodation, but is expected to remain higher than in the
GCC economies.
Risks to the near-term regional outlook are broadly
balanced. On the upside, geopolitical shocks and
supply disruptions in the region may push oil prices
higher, benefiting growth in oil suppliers with spare

capacity as they compensate for shortfalls in other oil
exporters. On the downside, weaker global demand,
particularly a further slowdown in emerging market economies, or a faster-than-expected increase in
non-OPEC supply, could put downward pressure on
oil prices and growth in oil exporters in the region.
Although a sharper-than-expected tightening in global
monetary conditions would lead to higher domestic
interest rates in GCC economies whose currencies are
pegged to the U.S. dollar, the overall growth effects are
likely to be small as long as oil prices remain strong.
A sustained decline in oil prices would leave many
oil exporters in the region with fiscal deficits. Over
the past several years, increased spending has raised
fiscal break-even oil prices (oil prices at which government budgets are balanced) faster than actual oil
prices have risen. As a result, a number of economies
(Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen) have fiscal
break-even prices above the projected oil price for
2014. Although the remaining economies are running
surpluses and public debt levels are still relatively low,
most have not been accumulating wealth fast enough
to build sufficient reserves for future generations and as
a buffer against declines in oil revenue.
The policy priority for the region’s oil exporters is to
increase resilience to oil revenue shocks while diversifying their economies for a rapidly growing labor force.
Only a few GCC economies with long production
horizons and substantial fiscal buffers have the scope to

Figure 2.14. Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan: Growth Hinges on Improvements in Oil Production
and Conﬁdence
Growth in the region is decelerating on account of declining oil production among the oilexporting countries and continued challenges from difﬁcult political transitions in oil
importers. Priorities are to improve the sociopolitical environment, strengthen
macroeconomic stability, reduce ﬁscal and external imbalances, and implement reforms for
sustainable and inclusive growth, further diversiﬁcation, and job creation.

use countercyclical fiscal policy against downside risks;
in others, there is either little or no fiscal space. Fiscal
policy should focus on building buffers against oil
price shocks by finding non-oil sources of revenue and
containing hard-to-reverse current expenditures, while
maintaining social and high-quality capital spending
in support of economic diversification, growth, and
accumulating wealth for future generations.
Measures to raise the quality of education and better
align it with the needs of the private sector could, in
conjunction with measures to promote entrepreneurship and female labor force participation, help boost
non-oil GDP growth and reduce the reliance on fiscal
spending from oil revenues as a source of economic
growth. In the GCC economies, labor market initiatives, including appropriate training, to attract GCC
citizens to private sector work should be complemented with public sector wage restraint and contained expectations of future government employment.
Non-GCC economies should aim to promote private
sector activity through enhanced basic infrastructure
and a better business climate.

Oil-Importing economies
Economic conditions are difficult in MENAP oil
importers. While there are nascent signs of improvement
in tourism, exports, and foreign direct investment (FDI)
in a number of countries, owing in part to increased
demand from the GCC economies, continued political
and economic policy uncertainty weigh on confidence
and economic activity. The intensifying conflict in Syria
and developments in Egypt have sparked concerns
about wider destabilization, which further complicates
economic management. Moreover, in many countries,
external and fiscal buffers are running low.
Overall, growth is expected to remain at about 3
percent in 2013–14. In most economies, this will
result in continued high unemployment and stagnating
living standards, likely contributing to continued social
discontent.
• In Egypt, political developments will largely determine the pace of policy reforms, confidence, and
domestic activity against a backdrop of large fiscal
and external imbalances. Financing from several
GCC countries is alleviating short-term constraints,
and as a result the authorities have announced a
fiscal stimulus package aimed at supporting growth
and creating jobs.

• In Lebanon, political spillovers and refugees from
the conflict in Syria will continue to shake confidence and deter tourism and growth, which will
strain the fiscal position and put pressure on external balances.
• Pakistan’s newly elected government has a mandate
to tackle large fiscal and external deficits, which will
initially weigh on growth. However, reforms in the
energy sector, combined with relatively stable worker
remittances and agricultural production and support
from international and bilateral donors, are expected
to support growth over the medium term.
• Political and security developments in Tunisia will
continue to weigh on the economic outlook and the
pace of fiscal, financial, and structural reforms.
• Morocco’s growth is expected to slow in 2014 as
rain-dependent agricultural production normalizes
after an exceptional harvest in 2013.

• Escaping regional trends, some economies are projected to enjoy continued solid growth. In Djibouti,
strong shipping activity will stimulate construction
and attract FDI. In Mauritania, a thriving mining sector and public infrastructure work will buoy
economic activity.
In most countries, inflation remains elevated,
although it has moderated recently, given decreasing
global food and energy prices. In Pakistan, past currency depreciation and reduced energy subsidies will
likely result in higher inflation.
Domestic and regional factors are the main sources
of risks, which remain tilted to the downside. Setbacks
in political transitions and continued social and security tensions could delay a return of confidence and
reforms. Downside risks to growth in the euro area and
the GCC economies also present risks for the region’s
oil importers, through spillovers on tourism, trade, and

remittances. Limited exposure to international capital
markets should limit risks of a sudden stop in capital
inflows for most countries. Still, with limited exchange
rate flexibility, tighter global monetary conditions
could result in higher domestic interest rates, which
would dampen growth.
In an environment of increased risks due to regional
tensions and heightened political uncertainty, policy
goals are threefold: (1) creating jobs, (2) making
inroads into fiscal consolidation, and (3) embarking on
structural reforms.
• High and rising unemployment calls for an urgent
focus on job creation. Delays in the revival of private investment suggest the need for the government
to play a key role in shoring up economic activity
over the near term. With limited room for widening fiscal deficits, spending on broad-based subsidies
needs to be reoriented toward growth-enhancing
public investment, while improving protection of
vulnerable groups through well-targeted social assistance. External partners could provide additional
financing based on the existence of adequate policy
frameworks.
• With concerns about debt sustainability rising and
fiscal and external buffers eroded, most countries
need to start putting their fiscal house in order.
That said, in some cases, there may be scope for
phasing the fiscal adjustment to limit its impact
on economic activity in the short run. A credible
medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy would be
needed to ensure continued willingness of domestic
and foreign investors to provide adequate financing.
In some cases, greater exchange rate flexibility can
also help to soften the short-term impact of fiscal
consolidation on growth and help to rebuild international reserves.
• A bold structural reform agenda is essential for
propelling private sector activity and fostering a
more dynamic, competitive, and inclusive economy.
Reforms need to focus on a multitude of areas,
including improving business regulation and governance, expanding access of businesses and consumers to finance, and increasing the flexibility of labor
and product markets while protecting the vulnerable
through well-targeted social assistance. Early steps in
these areas can help to signal governments’ commitment to reforms and improve confidence.
Delays in economic recovery and rising unemployment underscore the urgency of policy reforms. Early

76

progress across all three priority areas—supported
by the international community through scaled-up
financing, enhanced access, and technical assistance—is
essential to start achieving the much-awaited dividends
from the recent economic and political transitions.

Sub-Saharan africa: continued Dynamism
Growth in sub-Saharan Africa remained robust in
2012–13 and is expected to accelerate somewhat in 2014
(Figure 2.15), reflecting strong domestic demand in most
of the region. Nevertheless, spillovers from sluggish external
demand, reversal of capital flows, and declines in commodity prices are contributing to somewhat weaker growth
prospects in many countries relative to the April 2013
WEO. Policies should aim to rebuild room for policy
maneuvering where it has been eroded, and more broadly
to mobilize revenue to address social and investment
needs. To achieve sustainable and inclusive growth in
the medium term, governments should deepen structural
reforms and give priority to infrastructure investment and
social spending.
Activity in sub-Saharan Africa remained strong in
the beginning of 2013, although marginally down
from 2012, supported in most countries by domestic
demand (Figure 2.16). Growth was particularly strong
in low-income and fragile states, with the notable
exceptions of Mali and Guinea-Bissau, which were
affected by internal civil conflicts. Angola benefited
from a recovery in oil production. In Nigeria, still high
oil prices underpinned strong growth, notwithstanding
temporary downdrafts from security problems in the
north and oil theft. In Ethiopia, declining coffee prices
and supply bottlenecks slowed growth slightly from a
very high level. However, South Africa’s growth slowed
further, in large part due to tense industrial relations,
anemic private investment, and weaker consumption growth, the latter affected by slowing disposable
income growth and weakening consumer confidence.
With a few exceptions, inflation remained broadly
stable in the region.
Recent global financial market volatility has affected
several economies in the region, although most lowincome countries experienced little impact given their
limited links with global financial markets. Among
frontier markets, Nigeria’s currency weakened against
the U.S. dollar at the peak of the volatility, although
financial conditions have since stabilized. In South

Africa, the currency suffered a steep decline, bond
spreads widened, and equity prices fell due to external
factors combined with domestic economic vulnerabilities. However, with inflows returning during July and
August, by early September South African asset prices
appeared to be stabilizing.
Growth is projected to increase from about 5
percent in both 2012 and 2013 to 6 percent in 2014.
This represents a more than ½ percentage point
downward revision for 2013 relative to the April 2013
WEO for the whole region, and close to a ½ percentage point downward revision for 2014 for the middleincome countries (Table 2.7):
• In Angola, the revisions reflect delays in budget
execution. In Nigeria, among other factors, they
mainly reflect reduced oil production.
• In South Africa, growth is forecast to improve
gradually in 2014 and beyond as global growth
improves and infrastructure bottlenecks are alleviated. However, the tighter financing environment,
still weak investor and consumer confidence,
continued tense industrial relations, policy uncertainty, and elevated household debt will weigh on
economic performance.

• Elsewhere, growth is forecast to remain fairly robust,
driven by investment in infrastructure, energy,
and natural resources projects, as well as increased
output from projects coming onstream (Ghana,
Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone). However, the
recent weakness in international commodity prices
may delay mining investment in a few countries
(Guinea). Medium-term growth in some resource
exporters will also be affected by the Chinese
economy’s slower growth trajectory.4
Inflation is expected to decline further in 2013
through much of the region, helped by some moderate global food prices and prudent monetary policies.
However, current account balances are projected to
continue to weaken, including because of lower global
commodity prices (for example, Burkina Faso and
Nigeria) and continued FDI-financed investment in
infrastructure and natural resources (Mozambique,
Sierra Leone).
The main threats to the outlook are a global economic downturn or a further deceleration of growth
in China or other major emerging markets that could

Growth remains robust and will accelerate further, although at a slower pace than previously
expected. Activity is being helped by strong domestic demand and increases in commodityrelated investment, and spillovers have so far been small given limited ﬁnancial linkages.
Continued economic strength calls for better efforts to rebuild policy buffers, contain inﬂation,

weaken exports through lower commodity prices or
reduced inflows of aid and FDI. A sharp or protracted
decline in oil and commodity prices would affect commodity exporters that do not yet have sufficient fiscal
buffers (Angola, Nigeria) and could affect planned
or ongoing resource development projects (Ghana,
Guinea, Liberia). South Africa is also vulnerable to
further slowdowns or sudden stops in capital inflows,
which could be triggered by global repricing of risk
or domestic shocks, especially escalating industrial
tensions. Some frontier markets, such as Ghana and
Nigeria, could also be vulnerable to such slowdowns
of private financial flows. Domestic risk from further
social and political unrest (for example, in the Sahel
and Central African Republic) and further security
problems in northern Nigeria might also adversely
affect neighboring countries. Given the significance of
subsistence agriculture, lack of rain can also present the
risk of food insecurity and generate price increases in
various pockets of the region. Insufficient capacity in
electricity generation could be an additional drag on
growth in a large number of countries.
Macroeconomic policies should generally remain
focused on rebuilding buffers where these have been
depleted and on keeping inflation under control.
Revenue mobilization is an important objective in
low-income countries more generally, where it can help
address social and investment needs. Related to this,
it will also be crucial to prioritize capital and social
spending while continuing to improve project selection
and execution capacity. Although debt cancellation
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives has improved overall
debt sustainability, continued prudence is needed to
keep debt levels under control, especially where it
has increased recently (for example, Cape Verde and
Senegal). Where inflation remains relatively high,
tight monetary policies are also warranted (Angola,
Tanzania). In some oil-exporting countries (Angola),
steps need to be taken to improve transparency and
public control over the management of oil revenue.
South Africa needs decisive progress in implementing
structural reforms to strengthen education and the
effectiveness of government services, ease infrastructure
bottlenecks, and increase product market competition
and labor market flexibility.
In the medium term, all countries in the region
will need to step up their efforts to promote sustainable and inclusive growth by investing in physical and

he world’s economies moved much more in
lockstep during the peak of the global financial crisis than at any other time in recent
decades. Correlations of GDP growth rates,
which had been modest in the years before the crisis,
rose dramatically during 2007–09 (Figure 3.1, panel
1).1 The increased comovement was not confined to
the advanced economies, where the global financial crisis was centered, but was observed across all geographic
regions and among advanced, emerging market, and
developing economies.
Since 2010, however, correlations have fallen back
sharply (Figure 3.1, yellow bars). The move from a
period of globally synchronized collapse and recovery
to one in which the world’s economies move more
independently of each other—which recent issues of
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) call a “multispeed
global economy”—can thus be considered a return to
relative normalcy.
Could output comovements rise sharply again?
Answering this question requires shedding light on the
factors that drove these sharp changes in correlations.
One possibility is that greater comovements in output
were induced by large common shocks simultaneously
affecting many countries—such as a sudden increase in
financial uncertainty or a wake-up call that triggered a
change in investors’ perceptions of the world.2 A second
possibility is that output spillovers—defined as the transmission of country-specific shocks to output in other
countries—became more important due to the strengthening of financial and trade linkages. A third possibility is that the nature of shocks changed. In particular,
shocks to countries’ financial sectors, such as banking
crises and liquidity freezes, were more prevalent during

Figure 3.1. The Evolution of Output Comovements, 2004–12
Output comovements, whether measured by growth correlations or detrended output
correlations, rose sharply at the peak of the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2007–09. But they
declined sharply in recent years.

the global financial crisis. These financial shocks might
be transmitted to other countries in a more virulent
manner during crises than real shocks, which are more
prevalent during normal times. Examining the roles
played by these factors is of more than academic interest, because policymakers need to know the extent to
which they will have to deal with such sudden increases
in output comovements in years to come.
This chapter explores how output comovements
have evolved in recent years and how they are influenced by various shocks and linkages. Using quarterly
data from 1978 to 2012 for 63 economies, it examines
what types of events drive large spikes in comovements
and the role played by financial and trade linkages in
transmitting shocks. It assesses the possible output
spillovers from the potential shocks that most concern
policymakers, including policy shocks, such as unexpected monetary or fiscal tightening; financial shocks,
such as a systemic banking crisis or renewed financial
turmoil; and growth surprises (which could be driven by
either real or financial shocks) in advanced economies
or in large emerging markets. In this regard, this chapter complements the existing work the IMF has done
on spillovers, including the IMF spillover reports (IMF,
various years). Finally, it discusses the implications for
the outlook and for policy and financial regulation.
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• Following an unprecedented increase in output
synchronization between late 2008 and early 2009,
the world’s economies have once again decoupled.
Global output comovements have fallen back to
normal levels in the past two years, despite the
turmoil in Europe.
• Spikes in regional and global output correlations
occurred primarily during financial crises, such as
those in Latin America in the 1980s and in Asia in
the 1990s, but when a crisis occurred in an economy such as the United States—which is both large
and a global financial hub—the effects on global
output synchronization were disproportionately
large. In this context, preserving financial stability is
key to preventing synchronized output collapses in
the future, but progress on global financial reform
has been incomplete, and the world economy
remains susceptible to risks from financial institutions that are too big to fail.
• During the global financial crisis, financial linkages
contributed to the spread of these financial stresses
across borders, but other factors—such as global
panic, increased uncertainty, and wake-up calls that
82

changed investors’ perceptions—acted as a common
shock and played a much larger role in increasing
output synchronization.
• The effect of financial linkages on output comovements during normal times is the opposite of
the effect during crises. During tranquil periods,
increased financial linkages induce greater output
divergence since capital is better able to move to
where it is most productive.3 The key, then, is to
preserve the benefits of increased financial integration while minimizing the attendant risks through
better prudential oversight, including better policy
coordination and collaboration.
• The fact that comovements are now lower does not
mean that policymakers should not worry about the
effects of external shocks, such as growth slowdowns
or monetary and fiscal tightening in major economies. But policymakers need not worry equally
about all potential shocks. First, size matters: the
United States still matters most from a global perspective, although the euro area, China, and Japan
are important as sources of spillovers within their
respective regions.4 Second, the size of spillovers
depends on the nature of the shock and the strength
of linkages with the economy where the shock originates. For example, while a fiscal tightening in the
United States or the euro area will most affect countries that have stronger trade linkages with these
economies, the effect of interest rate normalization
in the United States primarily affects countries that
peg to the U.S. dollar.
The following section provides a conceptual framework for thinking about output comovements and
describes their evolution in recent years. The next section examines the factors driving large spikes in output
comovements. The chapter then looks more closely at
how various shocks in major economies affect output
elsewhere and ends with some implications for the
outlook.

3These results were first established by Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, and Peydro (2013) and Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, and Perri
(2013).
4These findings are consistent with the 2011 IMF spillover report,
which uses a different approach and also finds significant spillovers
from shocks originating from the United States but only modest
spillovers from shocks elsewhere. The 2013 spillover report finds
much larger effects from policies enacted in major economies over
the previous year, because it posits that these policies helped avert
major crises in the United States and Europe.

dancing together? spillovers, common shocks, and the role oF Financial and trade linkages

Output comovements: conceptual Framework
and Stylized Facts
conceptual Framework
How should we think about comovement and spillovers?
In general, growth in each country can be thought of
as being driven by common shocks that affect many
countries simultaneously, shocks specific to the home
country, and shocks specific to foreign countries that
spill over and affect growth in the home country. Shocks
in a foreign country can spill over to the home country
in many ways, including through conventional linkages such as finance and trade. The nature of the shock,
however, can change the manner in which shocks are
transmitted or the importance of linkages in transmitting the shock—for example, financial linkages might
transmit shocks to a country’s financial sector in a different manner than shocks to the real sector.5
Under this framework, the existence of common
shocks and of cross-border spillover effects from
country-specific shocks implies correlated growth rates
across countries. There are three ways in which these
correlations can change. First, common shocks can
become larger or more frequent relative to idiosyncratic
shocks, increasing correlations by driving economies
up and down together. Second, the linkages that bind
countries together can change.6 Finally, the kinds of
shocks that buffet economies can change, from those
that have mostly a domestic impact to those that have
bigger cross-border effects.
Following this framework, the chapter assesses the
factors behind larges spikes in comovements and the
cross-border effects of observable shocks emanating
from the world’s major economies. The first part of
the analysis assesses whether spikes in global comovements correspond to well-known historical events
5More formally, the growth rate of each country can be assumed
to be determined as yit = et + eit + Sj rijtejt , in which yit denotes real
GDP growth in country i, et denotes common shocks, eit denotes
domestic idiosyncratic shocks, ejt (for j ≠ i) denotes other countries’
idiosyncratic shocks, and rijt measures the linkages between country
i and country j. See Doyle and Faust (2005) for a more in-depth
discussion. In the analysis below, we focus on conventional linkages
such as finance and trade: rijt(h) = r0(h) + r1(h)Financeijt +
r2(h)Tradeijt . The dependence of rijt on h, with h indicating the
nature of shocks (for example, real or financial), is meant to capture
the possibility that the nature of the underlying shock can affect the
sign and magnitude of the spillovers.
6Regarding the role of linkages, economic theory has ambiguous
predictions about the impact of changing financial and trade integration on output comovements. See Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou,
and Peydro (2013) and Doyle and Faust (2005) and the references
therein.

that hit many countries at the same time and whether
shocks characterizing these events are transmitted
through identifiable channels, such as financial and
trade linkages. An important caveat in this analysis
is that it is not possible to definitively distinguish
between comovements attributable to common shocks
and spillovers resulting from country-specific shocks
transmitted quickly through other channels that are
more difficult to quantify (such as global panic or
self-fulfilling expectations): in the data these two
types of comovement are observationally equivalent.
Indeed, even for an event as thoroughly analyzed as
the global financial crisis there is no consensus on
whether it should be characterized as a global shock or
a U.S. shock that spilled over to other countries.7
The second part of the analysis examines the crossborder effect of observable shocks emanating from the
world’s major economies and the channels through
which these shocks are transmitted. The focus here
is on shocks that reflect events and policies in major
economies that are unlikely to be related to other factors
influencing foreign economic activity in the short term.8

Stylized Facts
We begin by establishing the stylized facts on output
comovements in recent years. The sample comprises 34
advanced economies and 29 emerging market and developing economies for which quarterly real GDP data are
available. The regional and income groupings follow
those in the WEO Statistical Appendix. (The countries
included in this sample are listed in Appendix 3.1.)
There are various ways to measure comovements. Perhaps the simplest and most common measure of output
comovements is the correlation of real GDP growth.
Alternatively, one can look at correlations in detrended
output, which requires the choice of a detrending
method. In what follows, we use a five-year backwardlooking moving average to filter out the trend.9 It can
be shown that for a wide variety of data-generating
processes, correlations based on detrended output tend
to be larger than those based on output growth.
7See, for example, Fratzscher (2009, 2012); Acharya and Schnabl
(2010); and Bekaert and others (2011).
8Indeed, our results are essentially unchanged when we control for
other observable factors influencing foreign output growth and when
we include time-fixed effects to account for unobservable common
and country-specific shocks.
9Sensitivity to using alternative detrending methods is explored in
Appendix 3.1.

States, Middle East and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa regions are excluded from panels 3
and 4 due to a lack of quarterly real GDP data for a sufﬁcient number of countries.

Output growth correlations remained relatively low
through much of the past three decades (Figure 3.2,
panel 1). Simple averages of five-year rolling window
growth correlations across all country pairs remained
below 0.2 from the 1980s until 2007. Growth correlations tended to be higher among advanced economy
pairs than among emerging market and developing
economy pairs, even more so for country pairs within
the Group of Seven (G7) countries (Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United
States), for which average correlations were between
0.3 and 0.4 in the early 2000s. Growth correlations
within geographic regions were also relatively low
84

(Figure 3.2, panel 3), although correlations in Asia rose
to 0.3 following the Asian crisis.10 Correlations based
on detrended output were generally higher than, but
similar in pattern to, those based on output growth
(Figure 3.2, panels 2 and 4).
Growth correlations spiked sharply, however, during
the global financial crisis (Figure 3.2, panels 1 and
3). Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
in September 2008, there was a sharp, synchronized,
and across-the-board collapse in output in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. The
synchronized collapse led to a sharp rise in growth
correlations, exceeding 0.5 for all income groups
and geographic regions, with the highest correlations
observed among the G7 economies. Detrended output
correlations exhibit a similarly sharp rise. The rest of
this analysis restricts its attention to output growth
correlations.
Whereas five-year correlations suggest that output
comovements remain high, Figure 3.1 suggests that
output comovements have already fallen sharply, and
this is confirmed by the use of shorter-window or
instantaneous correlations (Figure 3.3). If two-year
rolling window growth correlations are used, there is
a sharp drop in output synchronization in the first
quarter of 2011—when the first quarter of 2009 drops
out of the rolling window. Two measures of “instantaneous” correlation also indicate that average output
comovements are now much lower than at the peak of
the global financial crisis (Figure 3.3, panel 2).11 Output growth correlations during 2011–12 have actually
been quite close to precrisis levels, despite the intensification of the crisis in Europe during this period.12
10The Commonwealth of Independent States; Middle East, North
Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP); and sub-Saharan Africa
regions are included in the chapter analysis but are excluded from
these figures because of a lack of quarterly real GDP data for a sufficient number of countries. Box 3.1 presents stylized facts on output
comovements in the MENAP and the Caucasus and Central Asia
based on yearly output growth correlations.
11One such measure is based on the dynamic conditional correlations
from a multivariate GARCH model, as described by Engle (2002). A
second measure is an instantaneous quasicorrelation, defined as (git – ḡi)
(gjt – ḡj )/si sj. Note that although this measure is similar to a correlation, it is not bounded by 1 in absolute value. If growth rates in both
countries are simultaneously far above or below their respective means—
as occurred during the synchronized global collapse in late 2008 and
early 2009—this quasicorrelation can exceed 1 by a large margin.
12Interestingly, financial market comovements—as measured for
example by equity price correlations—rose at various times during
2010–12 (Forbes, 2013). This chapter’s focus is on output spillovers; Chapter 4 of the April 2009 WEO analyzed the transmission
of financial stress from advanced to emerging market economies.

Could the same shocks that sharply increased output
comovements in recent years reemerge? Answering this
question requires focusing on the factors that drove
these sharp changes in correlations, which is explored
in the next section.

trade linkages.

What Drives Sharp Spikes in Output comovement?

0.35

Given the sizable impact of the global financial crisis
on comovements, it is natural to ask whether other
historical events have also been associated with sharp
increases in comovements. Spikes in global comovement correspond to well-known global or regional
events (Figure 3.4, panel 1).13 These include the second oil shock in 1979 and the recessions in the United
States and Europe that began in 1980; the Latin American debt crisis in the early to mid-1980s; the “Black
Friday” stock market crash in 1987; the U.S. recession
in 1990–91; the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)
crisis and European recession in 1992; the tequila,
Asian, and Russian crises in the mid- to late 1990s;
the dot-com bust in 2000, which was followed by a
U.S. recession; and the recent global financial crisis.
With the exception of the 1979 oil price shock, these
events were either financial in nature or were associated
with downturns in the United States or Europe.
The importance of financial shocks in inducing
spikes in output comovements is made clear in panels
2–4 of Figure 3.4. These charts repeat the earlier
exercise for different regional subsamples, and they
superimpose the number of financial crises in the

13Econometrically, spikes in global comovement are captured by
the coefficients on the time dummies when country-pair comovements are regressed on country-pair and time-fixed effects. In Figure
3.4, panel 1, comovements are measured by instantaneous quasicorrelations, and the time dummy coefficients are estimated over the
entire sample. These time dummies capture shocks common to all
countries (the et in the conceptual framework above) but also pick
up spillovers from country-specific shocks because we do not control
for such spillovers in this regression.

was almost as large as that of the recent global crisis.
For Europe, a regional shock occurred during the
recession of the early 1980s and during the ERM crisis
in the early 1990s, but these are dwarfed by the global
financial crisis, when 18 of the region’s economies
experienced some type of financial crisis. And in Latin
14These include systemic banking crises, currency crises, and debt
crises. Multiple instances of these in a year in a given country (for
example, twin banking and currency crises) are counted as a single
instance.

America, the largest common shocks were the debt
crises that affected many of the region’s economies in
the early 1980s and again in 1989–90, when Argentina
and Brazil both had financial crises.
Panel 1 of Figure 3.4 also shows that the recent
global financial crisis—a financial shock that originated
in the world’s largest economy and a global financial
hub—stands head and shoulders above the other
events in the sample in terms of inducing strong output comovements. It is literally off the charts, with an
impact on output comovements four times larger than
that of any other event during the past several decades.
The general takeaway is that financial shocks, even
though they hit individual countries, often act as common shocks that tend to raise output comovements
regionally or globally. When financial shocks emanate
from a large financial center or a major economy, the
resulting spikes in comovements are disproportionately
large.

Do Financial and trade Linkages amplify the effects of
Shocks on comovements?
To assess the role of financial and trade linkages in
amplifying the effect of shocks, we regress the correlation of output growth between country pairs on the
trade and financial linkages between them.15 We focus
our attention on the past 10 years and divide this period
into two five-year periods: a “normal” period consisting
of the precrisis years (2003–07) and a “crisis” period
corresponding to the past five years (2008–12). The
crisis period is characterized by a major financial shock,
and the normal period is most likely dominated by real
demand and supply shocks. We allow the effect of trade
and financial linkages to differ across these two periods,
since the shocks at work in each period are different.
This allows us to test whether the effect of finance and
trade linkages differs between tranquil times and periods
of financial turmoil.
The econometric estimation suggests that an increase
in financial linkages tends to lower output correlations
during normal times (Table 3.1).16 The coefficient on

Papaioannou, and Peydro (2013) and Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou,
and Perri (2013). Further details on sources for and definitions of
the variables, and on the empirical methodology, can be found in
Appendix 3.2.
16Cross-sectional studies typically find a positive correlation
between trade and financial integration and output comovements
(Imbs, 2006; and Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, and Peydro, 2013;

Note: The table reports panel (country-pair) fixed-effect coefficients estimated in two nonoverlapping five-year periods during 2003:Q1–2007:Q4 and 2008:Q1–2012:Q4
using all country pairs. The dependent variable is the pair-wise correlation of real GDP per capita between country i and country j in each of the two periods. The crisis
period equals 1 for the second period (and zero in the first period). Financial linkages are measured by the log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities
between countries i and j in quarter t relative to the sum of the two countries’ total exposure in the beginning of each period. T statistics for robust errors are reported in
parentheses. *, **, *** denote significance at the 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent levels, respectively.

the financial linkage variable is negative and significant,
indicating that increased financial linkages are associated with less-synchronized growth of output in normal times. The magnitude of the estimated coefficient
suggests that if a country pair moves from the 25th to
the 75th percentile in terms of financial integration—
which is similar to the increase in integration between
Italy and Portugal in the past 10 years—the correlation
of their growth rates would decline by 0.1, a significant
amount given the mean correlation in the sample of
0.2. This supports the view that financial integration
allows countries to diversify during tranquil times,
with capital flowing to where it is most productive.17
During the crisis period, however, this negative association was attenuated because financial sector shocks
were transmitted through financial linkages. Countries
that were more strongly integrated with each other
through the international banking system experienced
a bigger increase in their growth correlations during
the crisis. This is consistent with the idea that financial
linkages, while facilitating efficient capital allocation
during normal times, also transmit large financial
shocks across borders during crisis times. Even though
among others). The difference in the results between cross-sectional
and panel studies is driven by omitted-variables bias arising from
common time-varying shocks and, most important, by unobservable
country-pair characteristics, such as common borders and language,
that affect both comovements and linkages.
17Previous studies also show that financial integration increases
risk sharing and reduces consumption volatility. See, for example,
Bekaert, Campbell, and Lundbad (2005, 2006, 2011); Bekaert and
others (2007); Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2009); Kalemli-Ozcan,
Sørensen, and Yosha (2001, 2003); Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen, and
Volosovych (2010); and Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, and Peydro
(2009), among others.

the partial effect of financial integration on output
synchronization during the recent crisis was reversed
and became positive, the total effect is still negative;
that is, the crisis only weakened the overall negative
relationship between financial integration and output
synchronization, roughly halving it.
Most of the spike in correlations, however, is captured by the crisis dummy itself. This suggests that,
while financial linkages contributed to spreading the
financial stress to other countries, other factors played
a much larger role in raising output synchronization.
In other words, there was a very important common
shock element to the recent crisis, a point made by
Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2013), among others,
who suggest that global panic and self-fulfilling expectations played an important role in the global financial
crisis.
Finally, in contrast to the significant effects of financial linkages on output comovements, the measured
influence of trade linkages is statistically insignificant.
This could be due to the limited time variation in trade
data from quarter to quarter relative to finance data,
since the methodology used here evaluates the effect
of changes in finance and trade linkages on changes
in output correlations. As shown by Frankel and Rose
(1998) and many others, the level of trade linkages
over the long term is strongly and positively associated
with the level of output comovements.18

18The caveat for such average level effects is that they are difficult
to separate from the effect of a common border or language, a common currency, or historical ties, because such countries will also tend
to trade more with each other.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

A multiperiod version of the same regression—
which uses the full sample going back to 1980 and
allows for the inclusion or exclusion of time dummies—corroborates the findings above. The results
confirm the findings that (1) higher financial integration tends to reduce output comovements during
normal times and (2) the effect is weakened during
crises, which tend to induce greater synchronization in
country pairs that are more financially integrated.

Spillovers of country-Specific Shocks to Other
countries and the role of Financial and trade
Linkages
The decline in correlations to precrisis levels does not
imply that spillovers are no longer relevant or worth
analyzing. As demonstrated in this section, various
shocks in major economies affect output in other
countries.
The analysis in this section assesses the impact of
country-specific shocks on output in other countries
and the role of trade and financial linkages in transmitting these shocks, applying the statistical approach used
by Romer and Romer (2010), among others. In particular, two econometric specifications are used, first to
establish whether these shocks materially impact other
countries and then to determine whether the effects
vary with the strength of linkages. The first specification estimates the average response of real GDP growth
in other countries to current and past shocks originating in one of the major economies (China, euro area,
Japan, United States). The second specification allows
the output response to vary with the strength of trade
and financial linkages between each country and the
country where the shock originated, estimating spillovers from conventional channels.19

19In terms of our conceptual framework, these shocks correspond
to observable ejt. In the first specification, we estimate the spillover
effects of these shocks, assuming linkages (rijt) do not vary over
time, while in the second specification, we relax this assumption by
allowing linkages to vary with trade and finance, and we estimate
r0, r1, and r2. Note that if we fail to control for all common and
idiosyncratic shocks, and if these are correlated with the country-specific shocks considered in the analysis, the result will be inconsistent
estimates of the r parameters. However, our series of shocks reflects
events and policies that are unlikely to be related to other factors
influencing foreign economic activity in the short term. Thus, there
is no reason to expect systematic correlations between these shocks
and other determinants of foreign output growth. Indeed, our results
are essentially unchanged when we control for other factors influencing foreign output growth in the first specification (Appendix 3.3,

88

Several types of shocks are considered in the
analysis. First, we consider growth surprises for China,
the euro area, Japan, and the United States. These
shocks are identified for a given country-quarter as the
deviation from the country’s average growth over the
entire period and from average growth for all countries
in the sample in that quarter (Morgan, Rime, and
Strahan, 2004). The analysis then considers financial
shocks, such as the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy;
a measure of banking sector risk (based on credit
default swap—CDS—spreads) for the euro area and
the United States; and the excess bond premium of
U.S. corporate bonds (Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, 2012).
Finally, the analysis covers fiscal policy shocks, such as
exogenous tax changes identified by Romer and Romer
(2010) for the United States and by Devries and others (2011) for the euro area, and exogenous monetary
policy shocks in the United States identified by Coibion
(2012).20

estimated effects of country-Specific Shocks
The analysis starts with an examination of the effect
of growth surprises in large economies on output in
other countries. Note that growth surprises as constructed above do not identify the underlying source
of the shock, which could be real or financial. These
regressions should thus be considered to be indicative
of broad output linkages without any deep structure,
and therefore we refrain from interpreting the sign of
such growth surprises or the transmission mechanism
behind the results. As discussed in the conceptual
framework, growth surprises in one country can lead
to an increase or decrease in other countries’ growth
rates depending on the type of shock that drives the
growth surprise and the policy response to it.21 After
growth surprises, we study in greater detail well-iden-

Figure 3.16) and when we include time-fixed effects in the second
specification (Table 3.2). See Appendix 3.3 for details.
20We analyze monetary policy shocks only for the United States,
as these are the only ones for which we have exogenous measures.
See Appendix 3.3 for details.
21The findings of positive spillover effects in the foreign country
from a positive growth surprise in the home country are not
inconsistent with our previous results of lower comovement for
more financially integrated economies during normal times. Those
regressions attempt to separate real and financial shocks by focusing
on normal and crisis periods, and normal times are presumed to be
periods during which countries mostly face real demand and supply
shocks. The growth surprises constructed here do not identify the
underlying source of the shock, which could be real or financial.

tified shocks, such as exogenous fiscal and monetary
policy shocks and financial shocks, and their spillovers.
Growth surprises: Growth surprises in the United
States have larger and more long-lasting effects than
shocks to economic activity in China, Europe, or
Japan. In general, effects are modest for growth surprises occurring in major economies other than the
United States, although the effects on neighboring
countries tend to be higher.22 In particular, a 1 percent
positive growth surprise in the United States increases
the level of output in other countries by 0.2 percent
after two years; the effect of growth surprises in China
and Japan is about 0.1 percent; for the euro area, it
is close to zero (Figure 3.5). However, we also find
evidence that effects of growth surprises in China and
Japan tend to be higher on other Asian countries,23
while the effects from euro area growth surprises tend
to be much more significant for other European countries (Figure 3.6). The lower impact of growth surprises
in China and Japan may simply reflect the difference
in the size of these economies relative to the United
States.
Financial shocks: Financial crises are typically associated with significant and long-lasting output effects
(Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009;
Chapter 4 of the October 2009 World Economic Outlook). The Lehman Brothers collapse was no exception.
In particular, it reduced the level of output in other
economies by about 7½ percent after eight quarters,
compared with a drop in U.S. real GDP of about
9½ percent (Figure 3.7, panel 1). The nearly one-for22Here we focus on the effect of growth innovations in the source
country on the growth innovation (the idiosyncratic, uncommon
growth component) in other countries.
23The results for China are consistent with the 2012 IMF spillover
report and Ahuja and Nabar (2012), who find larger spillover effects
on Asian supply chain countries.

one drop corroborates the view that the Lehman crisis
acted like a common shock, despite having originated
in the United States (see Figure 3.4).
More generally, financial shocks in the United States
tend to have significant effects on output in other
economies, whereas financial shocks in the euro area
have more limited effects. An increase of 1 standard
deviation in the U.S. CDS-spreads-based risk indicator
tends to reduce real GDP in other economies by about
2 percent after one year (Figure 3.7, panel 2), but the
same size shock in the euro area reduces real GDP in
other economies by only about ½ percent after one
year (Figure 3.7, panel 3).24 That is, an increase in
the U.S. CDS-spreads-based risk indicator to the level
observed during the Lehman crisis (when spreads rose
by 1.8 standard deviations) would reduce output in
other economies by about 3.2 percent; and an increase
in the euro area CDS-spreads-based risk indicator
to the level observed during the peak of European
financial turmoil (when spreads rose by about 3½
standard deviations) would reduce output in other
economies by about 1.8 percent. A renewal of stress in
the U.S. banking sector would have the largest impact
on Europe and Asia, whereas financial sector stress
in the euro area would have a greater effect on other
countries in Europe as well as those in Latin America
(Figure 3.8).
Fiscal shocks: Existing estimates of fiscal spillovers
suggest that while they are on average typically
24The effect of a U.S. (euro area) financial shock on U.S. (euro
area) output is not statistically different from the effect in other
countries. Given the relevance for nonbank financial institutions
in the United States, we repeat the analysis using the excess bond
premium of U.S. corporate bonds as a measure of financial shock.
The results obtained using this measure confirm that U.S. financial
shocks have sizable and statistically significant output spillover effects
(Appendix 3.3).

output in other economies, while ﬁnancial shocks in the euro area have more limited effects.

Renewed ﬁnancial stress in the U.S. banking sector would have the largest impact on Europe

limited, they tend to become large for shocks emanating from large economies (Beetsma, Giuliodori,
and Klaassen, 2006) and for shocks occurring during
downturns (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, forthcoming), and spillovers tend to become large for
countries that are closely interconnected (Beetsma,
Giuliodori, and Klaassen, 2006; Bénnasy-Quéré and
Cimadomo, 2012). The results for U.S. fiscal shocks
suggest that cross-country output effects tend to be
important and long-lasting. In particular, a tax increase
of 1 percent of GDP in the United States is found to
typically reduce output in other economies by about
1½ percent after three years, compared with an output
contraction in the United States of about 2½ percent
(Figure 3.9, panel 1).25 The effect is larger (above

Ilzetzki and Jin (2013), who find that a tax increase of 1 percent of
GDP in the United States decreases foreign industrial production by
about 1½ percent after two years.

(Figure 3.10). Although the estimates of the impact of
U.S. tax shocks on U.S. economic activity are in line
with those found by others (Romer and Romer, 2010,
for the U.S.; Cloyne, 2013, for the United Kingdom;
and Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi, 2012; and Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori, forthcoming, for a panel
of countries) there is a wide range of estimates in the
literature. In addition, Appendix 3.3 examines the
effect of spending-based policy shocks and finds that
spending-based shocks have smaller and less persistent
spillover effects than tax-based policy shocks.26
26Various recent empirical studies find similar results (Alesina,
Favero, and Giavazzi, 2012; Mountford and Uhlig, 2009; and Chapter 3 of the October 2010 World Economic Outlook, among others).
In fact, while most estimates of spending multipliers are less than 2,
some are as high as 5; see Ramey (2011) for details. The focus of the

Fiscal policy shocks for the euro area tend to have
more limited effects. In particular, a tax increase of
1 percent of GDP in the euro area is found to typically
reduce output in other economies by about ½ percent
after three years, compared with an output contraction
in the euro area of about 1½ percent (Figure 3.9, panel
2).27 The spillover effect of a euro area fiscal tightening
is larger for other countries in Europe and for Latin
America, while it is much smaller for Asian economies
(Figure 3.10, panel 2).

chapter, however, is not on the exact magnitude of fiscal multipliers,
but rather on the impact of fiscal shocks on other economies relative
to their domestic impact. For a more detailed discussion on fiscal
multipliers, see IMF (2013).
27Because the euro area fiscal shocks used in the analysis are available at annual frequencies, spillover effects have been estimated using
real annual GDP.

dancing together? spillovers, common shocks, and the role oF Financial and trade linkages

Monetary shocks: Monetary policy shocks in major
economies—defined as changes in policy rates that
are not a response to inflation or economic conditions—may have strong impacts on economic conditions in other countries, particularly those with
pegged exchange rate regimes (di Giovanni and
Shambaugh, 2008).28 A key result is that U.S. monetary policy shocks tend to have a significant effect on
economic activity in other countries.29 In particular,
this chapter’s analysis finds that a surprise increase of
100 basis points in U.S. monetary policy rates typically
contracts the level of industrial production in other
countries by about 0.7 percent after eight months,
compared with 1.7 percent in the United States (Figure 3.11).30 The effect, however, varies across regions,
with Latin American countries typically recording the
largest contraction in output (Figure 3.12).

transmission channels: the role of financial and trade
linkages
The empirical evidence presented above suggests that
U.S. idiosyncratic shocks tend, on average, to have
important effects on economic activity in other countries. What is the role of trade and financial linkages in
the transmission of such country-specific shocks?
For financial shocks, the literature on contagion
provides compelling evidence that they spread mostly
through financial linkages (Forbes, 2013; Claessens,
Tong, and Zuccardi, 2012). For fiscal policy shocks,
studies suggest that trade linkages are the most important channels (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, forthcoming; Beetsma, Giuliodori, and Klaassen, 2006).
For monetary policy shocks, there is evidence that they
impact economic activity in other countries mostly
through the interest rate channel, while financial and
trade linkages are not found to play a significant role

results have been found by Reinhart and Reinhart (2001)

29Because the monetary policy shocks used in the analysis are
available at monthly frequencies, spillover effects have been estimated
using industrial production (see Romer and Romer, 2004).
30A 1 percent change in U.S. industrial production typically
translates into a 0.3 percent change in U.S. GDP, suggesting that a
surprise increase of 100 basis points in U.S. monetary policy rates
will tend to lower U.S. GDP by about half a percent. The results for
industrial production are consistent with Romer and Romer (2004),
who also find relatively large effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks
on industrial production. Estimated magnitudes using this methodology tend to be larger than those found in the literature based on
the vector autoregression approach (Coibion, 2012).

(di Giovanni and Shambaugh, 2008). The results
in this chapter’s analysis corroborate those findings
(Table 3.2), as follows.
Financial shocks are mostly transmitted through
financial linkages. The spillover effect of financial
shocks through financial linkages is negative and
statistically significant, while the effect through trade
is not statistically different from zero. These results are
consistent with the comovement regressions shown in
Table 3.1. In particular, the differential spillover effect
from the Lehman crisis of a country that has relatively
high financial linkages with the United States (at the
75th percentile) compared with a country that has
relatively low financial linkages (at the 25th percentile) is between –2.3 and –2.7 percent, depending on
whether time dummies are included or excluded from
the regression. In other words, following the Lehman
crisis, the contraction in the level of output in a
country that has relatively high financial linkages with
the United States has been between 2.3 and 2.7 percent higher than in a country that has relatively low
financial linkages.
Fiscal shocks are mostly transmitted through trade
linkages. Economies with stronger trade linkages with
the United States have larger spillover effects from
fiscal policy shocks. The contraction in the level of
output in a country that has relatively high trade linkages with the United States (at the 75th percentile)
is between 0.9 and 1½ percent higher, depending on
whether time dummies are included in the regression,
than in a country that has relatively low trade linkages
(at the 25th percentile).
Monetary shocks are mostly transmitted through the
interest rate channel; financial and trade linkages have
limited effects. A U.S. monetary policy shock tends
to raise interest rates and contract output in other
countries, and the magnitude of the effect is larger for
countries that peg their exchange rate to the U.S. dollar (Box 3.2).

are spillovers larger during recessions?
We considered whether country-specific financial
shocks have different effects on other countries during periods of crisis.31 Figure 3.13 suggest that this is
31The analysis could not be repeated for the policy shocks because
data for them are available only for periods before the crisis. See

the case. For financial shocks arising from U.S. credit
default swaps, spillover effects were large (about a
4 percent reduction in the level of output after one
year) during the global financial crisis, but relatively
small (about 1 percent after one year) during other
periods.32 In addition, the strength of financial linkages as a transmission channel increased during the
most recent recession. Thus, the impact of the global
financial crisis has been much bigger than the level
predicted by the magnitude of the underlying financial
shock, suggesting that other unobservable factors, such
as a global panic, or what Bacchetta and van Wincoop
(2013) describe as “a self-fulfilling shock to expectations,” played an important role.

Summary and Implications for the Outlook
The global financial crisis triggered a high degree of
output synchronization unprecedented in the post–
World War II era. This chapter documents that rise in
comovement and also shows that, over the past two
years, output comovements have declined to precrisis
levels. The world seems to have returned to a more
normal state of greater divergence in output movements, which is consistent with the observed “multispeed” recovery discussed in recent WEO reports.
Spikes in regional and global output correlations tend
to occur during financial crises, but when the crisis occurs
in an economy like the United States—which is both
large and a global financial hub—the effects on global
output synchronization are disproportionately large. These
financial stresses spread in part through financial linkages, but other factors—such as global panic, increased
uncertainty, and wake-up calls that change investors’
perceptions—act as a common shock and play a much
larger role. Thus, a large financial shock could again
induce the world’s economies to rise and fall in tandem.
As the chapter shows, spikes in global output comovements have often been driven by large financial shocks,
such as banking crises or the failure of a global financial
institution, as occurred with the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. There are still many systemically important
financial institutions whose reach spans the globe. And as
highlighted in past issues of the Global Financial Stability Report, progress on global financial reform has been
32Similarly, results have been obtained using the excess bond premium (Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, 2012) as a measure of U.S. financial
shocks.

incomplete, so the world economy remains susceptible
to the risk that one of these large systemically important
financial institutions will fail.
While financial linkages transmit financial stresses
across borders in normal times when real supply and
demand shocks are dominant, those linkages facilitate
the efficient international allocation of capital. The key
is to preserve the benefits of increased financial integration while minimizing the attendant risks through
better prudential oversight, including better policy
coordination and collaboration.
Various shocks emanating from the major economies can affect output in other countries. In particular,
the chapter sheds light on the potential spillover effects
from various risks:
• Renewed financial turmoil in the euro area would
have a significant effect on output in other economies, albeit one that is substantially smaller than
financial shocks emanating from the United States.
These effects would vary regionally: a renewal of
stress in the U.S. banking sector would have the
largest impact on Europe and Asia, whereas financial
sector stress in the euro area would have a greater
effect on other countries in Europe and in Latin
America.
• A stronger-than-expected slowdown of growth in
China is a major concern at present. The chapter
finds that this would have the largest effect on Asia
and Latin America.
• Because fiscal shocks are transmitted primarily
through trade linkages, countries with stronger trade
ties to the consolidating country will experience
bigger spillovers. In response to fiscal tightening in
the United States, real spillovers would be largest in
Latin America.
• The effect of a normalization of U.S. interest rates
that is faster than warranted by economic conditions
is also currently of concern. In a given economy,
the magnitude of spillovers in real terms from
U.S. interest rate shocks does not seem to differ
with the strength of its trade and financial linkages
with the United States, but according to whether
it fixes its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. A rise
in U.S. interest rates has the biggest effect on Latin
America, but it also has significant effects on Asia
and Europe.
For policymakers, these results indicate that not
all potential spillovers are of equal concern: their size
depends on the nature of the shock and the strength of

linkages. In general, shocks emanating from the United
States still matter most from a global perspective, but
China, the euro area, and Japan are important sources
of spillovers for regions with strong linkages to these
economies.
Regarding spillovers from monetary policy normalization in the United States, the chapter’s findings
suggest that these depend to a large extent on the
recipient country’s exchange rate regime. But the spillovers from an exit from quantitative easing are harder
to assess because the exit is likely to entail a range of
operational and other policy challenges.33 While the
Federal Reserve has various tools to help manage its
exit from the current highly accommodative policy
stance, enhanced policy agility, careful calibration
of the timing, and effective communication will be
essential.
Finally, the importance of common shocks in
generating synchronized output collapses may give
policy coordination a special role to play during such
periods.34 One element of policy coordination during
crises is on the financial side. During global panics,
liquidity is in short supply for everyone, and coordinated liquidity provision—for example, in the form of
swap lines across central banks, which can be critical
in supporting liquidity and funding stability in various
interbank markets—is an essential part of the crisis
response. But there can also be a macroeconomic element to policy coordination. As noted by Spilimbergo
and others (2008), the international dimension of
these crises means that without coordination, countries
can end up providing too little fiscal stimulus (because
of leakages reducing the domestic impact or incentives
to free-ride on others’ stimulus) or too much (since
leakages imply the need to do much more to achieve
a given level of output stabilization). If all countries
act in concert, then the amount of stimulus needed
by each country is reduced, supporting a coordinated
approach to providing fiscal stimulus. The need for
multilateral surveillance remains critical even during tranquil periods in order to prevent synchronized
output collapses generated by another crisis.

from unconventional monetary policy, see the Selected Issues Paper

and Risks” that accompanied the 2013 IMF Article IV Staff Report on

appendix 3.1. Data Definitions, Sources, and
country Groupings
Data Definitions and Sources
The primary data sources for this chapter are the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Haver Analytics; Bloomberg, L.P.; and
the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO), Global
Data Source (GDS), and Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) databases. The variables are listed in
Table 3.3, with multiple sources listed in their splice
order. Table 3.4 lists the countries included in the
analysis and the definitions of the country groupings
used in the chapter.
Bilateral trade linkages are constructed using (log)
bilateral real exports and imports as a share of the two
countries’ total exports and imports, with data from
the DOTS database.
Bilateral financial linkages are constructed as the
(log) of real banks’ bilateral assets and liabilities as a
share of the two countries’ total assets and liabilities,
using confidential data from BIS locational banking
statistics.
All comovement measures are based on quarterly
real GDP in local currency prices. They are taken from
the WEO database and spliced with GDS and OECD
data. The primary measure of comovement used in the
chapter is the correlation of real GDP growth rates,
but correlations based on detrended output are also
used for comparison. The detrended output correlations in the main text and Figures 3.1 and 3.2 are
based on a backward-looking moving average filter. We
also examined a Hodrick-Prescott (1997) filter, which
removes low-frequency long-term trends from the
output series; the band-pass filter of Baxter and King
(1999), which retains output fluctuations with frequencies between 6 and 32 quarters; and the random
walk filter of Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003). Figure 3.14 shows a comparison of output comovements
using these filters. Detrended output correlations using
these filtering methods show similar patterns, particularly the large spike in the late 2000s; however, the
sharp rise in recent years precedes the global financial
crisis. This is because the synchronized output collapse
in late 2008 and early 2009 pulls the trend down, even
in earlier quarters (due to the two-sided nature of these
filters, in contrast to the one-sided backward-looking
moving average filter), which induces a spurious
increase in comovements as early as 2006 and 2007.

appendix 3.2. Multiperiod comovement
regressions
We estimate a multiperiod version of the two-period
regression described in the main text. The econometric
framework follows Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, and
Perri (2013), which contains a more thorough description and discussion. The regressions, on quarterly data,
use a period-by-period synchronization index defined
as the negative of the absolute value of growth differences between countries. This index, which follows
Giannone, Lenza, and Reichlin (2010), is simple and
easy to grasp. Moreover, it is not sensitive to the choice
of filtering method, which can affect detrended output
correlations, or to the length of the rolling period used,
which can affect correlations more generally.
We estimate the following “difference-in-difference”
regression:
Comvmtij,t = aij + b × Finlinkij,t–1 + g × Tradelinkij,t–1
+ Crisist + ω × Finlinkij,t–1 × Crisist
+ l × Tradelinkij,t–1 × Crisist + eij,t, (3.1)
in which Comvmtij,t is the growth rate correlation between
countries i and j in period t; Finlinkij,t–1 and Tradelinkij,t–1
denote the (lagged) bilateral financial and trade linkages,
respectively, between countries i and j; and Crisist is a
dummy variable equal to 1 during the crisis period.

are measured by the log of the share of the stock of bilateral assets and liabilities
between countries i and j in the previous quarter relative to the sum of the
two countries’ external assets and liabilities in the entire world in the previous
period. The crisis indicator variable equals 1 in all quarters between 2008:Q3 and
2009:Q2 (and zero everywhere else). t stats for robust errors are reported. ***
denotes significance at the 1 percent level.

For the multiperiod version of the regression using
the full sample period (from 1978 to 2012), the estimates are in line with the results reported in the main
text (Table 3.5). The effect of finance during normal
times is negative, but it is positive during crisis periods.
Including or excluding time dummies does not affect
these results.
The economic impact of financial linkages is highly
significant. The coefficient of –0.4 during normal times
implies that a rise in bilateral integration from the
25th percentile to the 75th percentile of the distribution, which is similar to the increase in integration
between Italy and Portugal during our sample period,
is followed by an average decrease in output synchronization of 1 percentage point—that is, on average, the difference in their growth rates increases by
1 percentage point more than before. But during crisis
periods and for the same pair, the effect of banking
integration on output synchronization turns positive,
with a 0.8 percentage point increase in synchronization (that is, on average the difference in their growth
rates declines by 0.8 percentage point). Given that the
median degree of synchronization is 4 percent in terms
of GDP growth rate differences, these are significant
effects.
The effects are also sizable from the perspective of
changes. The actual average increase in synchronization
is 2 percentage points during the global financial crisis.
Thus, our estimates on financial linkages can explain
two-fifths of the actual change in output comovements
during the crisis. The estimated crisis effect of financial linkages is higher when we do not control for the
direct effect of the crisis itself, since most of the impact

in that case is attributed to transmission via financial
linkages. In this case, we can explain up to three-fifths
of the actual increase in comovement during the crisis
period, and the remainder is explained by the commonality of the shock.

appendix 3.3. Growth regressions
empirical Methodology
The statistical techniques used to assess the output
spillover impact of country-specific shocks, and the
role of trade and financial linkages in transmitting
these shocks, is standard and follows the approach used
by Romer and Romer (2010), among others.
We use two econometric specifications: one to
establish whether these shocks materially impact other
countries and the other to determine whether the
effects vary with the strength of linkages. In the first
specification, we estimate the average response of real
GDP growth in other countries to current and past
shocks originating in one of the major economies
(China, euro area, United States). Including lags allows
for a delayed impact of country-specific shocks on
output in other countries.
The first regression specification we estimate is as
follows:
Dyit = ai + bt + ϕ1(l )Shockim + ϕ2(l )Globalt + eit ,
(3.2)
in which the subscript i denotes the ith country, the
subscript t denotes the tth quarter, the superscript m
(with m different from i) denotes the country where
the shock originated, y is the log of real GDP, and
Shock is the country-specific shock examined. The
specification includes a full set of country dummies
(ai ) to account for differences in countries’ long-term
growth rates, a time trend to take account of a common trend in growth rates across countries, and a set
of global factors, including oil prices and global financial uncertainty (Global ). A similar approach has been
used by Ilzetzki and Jin (2013) to assess the dynamic
impact of U.S. fiscal and monetary policy shocks on
economic activity in other countries.
In the second specification, we allow the output
response to vary with the strength of trade and financial linkages between each country and the country
where the shock originated. In particular, the set of
explanatory variables is augmented to include the linkages between country i and country m and the interaction of these linkages with the shock in country m:

Dyit = ai + bt + ϕ1(l )Shocktm + ϕ2(l )Globalt
+ ϕ3(l )ShocktmLinkimt
+ ϕ4(l )Linkim,t + eit ,

(3.3)

in which the coefficient ϕ3 represents the difference in
the spillover effect on an economy with stronger (trade
or financial or both) linkages versus an economy with
weaker linkages. Linkages have been demeaned from
the average country’s linkage to keep the interpretation
of ϕ1 consistent across the two specifications (Balli and
Sørensen, forthcoming). The equation is alternatively estimated using a full set of time dummies to take account of
unobserved global and country-specific shocks.
Finally, we also assess whether country-specific
shocks have different effects on other countries during
periods of crisis.35 To do so, we estimate the flowing
regression:
Dyit = ai + bt + ϕ1C(l )ShocktmDt
+ ϕ1NC(l )Shocktm(1 – Dt )
+ ϕ2(l )Globalt + gDt + eit ,

(3.4)

in which D takes a value of 1 during the U.S. recession
(2008:Q3–2009:Q2) and zero otherwise.
The regression equations are estimated on quarterly data for an unbalanced panel of 34 advanced
economies and 29 emerging market and developing
economies over the period 1978:Q1–2012:Q4 (see
Appendix 3.1).

Description of Shocks
The shocks considered in the analysis include (1)
growth surprises for the United States, euro area,
China, and Japan; (2) financial shocks for the United
States and the euro area; (3) fiscal policy shocks for the
United States and the euro area; and (4) U.S. monetary policy shocks.36
Growth surprises for the United States, the euro area,
China, and Japan (Figure 3.15a) are identified for a
given country-quarter as the deviation from the average growth for that country over the entire period and
from average growth for all countries in the sample in
that quarter. In particular, following Morgan, Rime,
and Strahan (2004), growth surprises are identified as
the residuals (êit ) of the following regression:
Dyit = ai + gt + eit,

(3.5)

35The analysis focuses only on financial shocks, because data for
policy shocks are available only before the crisis.
36We analyze monetary policy shocks only for the United States
because these are the only ones for which we have exogenous measures.

in which y is the log of real GDP and ai and gt are
country- and time-fixed effects, respectively.
The financial shocks considered in the analysis are
(1) the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, (2) a measure
of banking sector credit default swap (CDS)-spreadsbased risk for the United States and the euro area, and
(3) the excess bond premium of U.S. corporate bonds
(Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, 2012).
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is identified as
a dummy that takes a value of 1 in 2008:Q3 and
zero otherwise.37 The measure of banking sector risk
for the United States (the euro area) is obtained by
extracting the first principal component of the 6 (45)
largest U.S. (euro area) banks’ CDSs and considering innovations in the first principal component that
are orthogonal to past and expected current output
growth. In detail, innovations are obtained as the
residuals (ν̂i, Figure 3.15b, panels 2 and 3) of the following equation:
Pt = a + r(l )Pt–1 + θ1Et–1Dyt + θ2(l )Dyt–1 + νt, (3.6)
in which Pt is the first principal component of
U.S. (euro area) banks’ CDSs, Dyt–j are past real GDP
growth rates, and Et–1Dyt is the expected current
output growth proxied by World Economic Outlook
growth forecasts.38 Finally, the excess bond premium
of Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012) is the unpredictable
component of U.S. corporate bonds (Figure 3.15b,
panel 4). As argued by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012),
an increase in the excess bond premium represents a
reduction in the effective risk-bearing capacity of the
financial sector and therefore a contraction in the supply of credit.
Fiscal policy shocks (Figure 3.15c, panel 1) for the
United States consist of legislative tax changes, identified by Romer and Romer (2010) using narrative
records such as presidential speeches and congressional
reports, that are unrelated to countercyclical actions
and factors that may affect output in the near future.
Fiscal policy shocks for the euro area are computed
by aggregating the tax-based consolidation measures
identified by Devries and others (2011), using a similar
narrative approach.

37Similar results are obtained when we let the dummy take value 1
during the period 2008:Q3–2009:Q2, and zero otherwise.
38We consider the forecasts in the April World Economic Outlook
reports for output growth in the last two quarters of the same year
and the forecasts in the October reports for output growth in the
first two quarters of the following year.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

Monetary policy shocks (Figure 3.15c, panel 3) are
exogenous innovations in the U.S. federal funds rate
identified by Coibion (2012) as the residuals from an
estimated Taylor rule with time-varying parameters.39
The approach is similar to the one originally proposed
by Romer and Romer (2004), but it allows a distinction
between innovations to the central bank’s rule (policy
shocks) and changes in the rule itself. In this approach,
random innovations to the rule are classified as monetary policy shocks, but policy changes such as regime
changes or changes in the inflation target or GDP
growth target are captured by the time-varying parameters of the rule and are therefore not classified as shocks.

robustness checks
Our series of shocks reflects events and policies that
are essentially unrelated to other factors likely to
influence foreign economic activity in the short term.
Thus, there is no reason to expect systematic correlation between these shocks and other determinants of
foreign output growth. From an econometric point of
view, this implies that the series of shocks is unrelated
to the error term in equation (3.1) and that ordinary
least squares estimates of φ1 are in principle unbiased.
Here, we assess how our baseline results are affected by
adding lagged foreign output growth as a control:

Including lagged output growth helps control for
the normal dynamic of output. Because determinants
affecting output growth are typically serially uncorrelated, it also helps control for various factors that may
influence output growth in the near term.
Figures 3.16a–c show the results obtained by estimating equation 3.2 (blue lines) and equation 3.7, which
control for lagged output growth (red line). The impulse
response function from equation 3.7 now includes not
only the direct impact of shocks on foreign output, but
also the effects propagated through past growth. The figure shows that controlling for lagged output growth has
almost no effect on the results. The two sets of impulse
response functions are very close to each other, and the

the monetary policy shocks, in the analysis we focus on interest rate
increases greater than 30 basis points, which corresponds to the average size of exogenous increases in U.S. monetary policy. It is worth
noting that the effect for smaller monetary shocks is not statistically
significantly different from zero.

impulse response function obtained with lagged output
growth falls within the confidence bands associated with
our baseline results.
Because there is no reason to expect systematic correlation between these shocks and other determinants of
foreign output growth, we should also expect that the
results are robust when the set of “global” controls is
excluded from the analysis. Figures 3.16a–c (yellow line)
suggest that this is generally the case. Indeed, the figure
shows that excluding the global controls from the analysis has almost no effect on the results. Exceptions are the
results for financial shocks, which suggest that spillover
effects tend to be larger when global control variables are
excluded from the analysis. This, however, is not surprising giving the high correlation between financial shocks
and global financial uncertainty.

tax- versus spending-based output spillover effects
A number of studies suggest that spending-based
shocks tend to have a smaller effect on domestic
output than tax-based shocks.40 A natural question is
whether tax- and spending-based shocks have different spillover effects. Our results suggest that this is the
case. Figure 3.17 shows the impulse response function
obtained estimating equation 3.2 using euro area taxbased shocks (blue lines) and spending-based shocks
(red lines) and shows that tax-based shocks tend to
have large spillover effects both in the short and in the
medium term.

Box 3.1. Output Synchronicity in the Middle east, North africa, afghanistan, and pakistan and in the
caucasus and central asia
Over the past decade, growth in the Middle East,
North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP)
and the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) has become
more synchronized with developments in other
advanced and emerging market economies. Correlations between annual output growth in the MENAP
and CCA countries and the rest of the world increased
to moderate levels during 2003–12 from the low levels
a decade earlier (Figure 3.1.1). The increase in output
synchronicity likely reflects a number of factors,
including greater trade openness of the MENAP and
CCA countries, increased labor migration and remittance flows, and large shocks, such as the recent global
financial crisis.1
One of the most striking changes has been the
significant rise in output correlations between the
MENAP and CCA countries and China. Although
the output cycles of the MENAP and CCA economies
have also become more synchronized with those in the
United States and Europe (their traditional trading
partners), increases in output correlations with China
were much larger, in some cases turning positive from
previously negative levels. Although still high, output
correlations between the CCA and Russia’s economy
weakened over the past decade, reflecting the reorientation of the CCA trade linkages from Russia to China
after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Within the MENAP region, output cycles are not
closely synchronized. Output correlations within both
MENAP oil exporters and importers and between
MENAP oil exporters and importers increased over
the past decade but only slightly, and from low
levels (Figure 3.1.2). Increased comovement within
the MENAP region in 2011 was caused in part by
the onset of the Arab Spring. With the rise of social
unrest, several economies in the region (Egypt, Jordan,
Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen) experienced
disruptions in oil and non-oil production, as well as
negative shocks to confidence, trade, and tourism.
Other countries in the region—for example, in the
Gulf Cooperation Council and Algeria—reacted to
developments in the neighboring economies by also
increasing public sector wages and social spending to
support growth, which led to increased correlations

among them. Despite these effects, average correlations
in the MENAP region remain low, reflecting limited
integration of the region. Correlations between the
MENAP and CCA countries are also low.
Output correlations among the CCA economies
declined during the past decade relative to the previous
decade. After the breakup of the former Soviet Union
in 1991, the CCA countries embarked on a process of
socioeconomic transition. This common experience,
together with the common shock of the Russian crisis
in 1998, explains high output correlations of the CCA
economies during 1993–2002 (see Figure 3.1.2). In

among the CCA economies to decline. The decline
was much more pronounced in the CCA oil and gas
exporters than in the CCA importers, where intraregional correlations plummeted during 2003–12.
Oil and gas production in these transitioning and
opening economies was driven primarily by idiosyncratic factors, such as expansion of domestic productive capacity, which proceeded at an uneven pace
across countries, and only weakly by common shocks

dancing together? spillovers, common shocks, and the role oF Financial and trade linkages

Box 3.2. Spillovers from changes in U.S. Monetary policy
The issue of spillover effects from U.S. monetary
policy is especially important in light of the possibility that interest rate normalization in the United States
may proceed faster than expected. Even though current
times are exceptional from a historical point of view,
a look at how past U.S. monetary policy shocks have
affected output in other countries may help us understand their potential effects and transmission channels.
The approach here assesses how monthly movements in
the U.S. policy rate (the federal funds rate) affect output
and the short-term interest rates of a group of advanced
economies and a group of emerging market and developing economies for which data are available.1
Figure 3.2.1 shows that the output effect of a
U.S. monetary policy shock varies with the exchange
rate regime. In particular, while an increase of 100
basis points in the federal funds rate reduces output by
about 1½ percent after six months in countries with
an exchange rate regime pegged to the U.S. dollar—
compared with an output contraction in the United
States of about 2 percent—it has no significant effect
for countries that float their currency against the dollar. A plausible explanation of the difference is that a
country that pegs its currency to the dollar “imports”
the U.S. monetary policy stance, with implications for
its domestic short-term rates and, thus, its domestic
economy. In practice, however, not all peggers allow
perfect capital mobility; therefore, how much a country’s interest rate is affected by changes in U.S. monetary policy is an empirical question that we investigate.
Our results show a wide range of interest rate reactions
to changes in the U.S. policy rate (Figure 3.2.2); among
the largest reactions are those in countries with histories
of pegging against the dollar (Hong Kong SAR, Israel,
Korea). But the rate reaction in Canada, a floater, is also
among the largest, which exemplifies the possibility that,
in the presence of common shocks (or a well-synchronized business cycle), what we label interest rate spillovers
may instead represent underlying comovements.
For example, if the United States and Canada have
synchronized business cycles—perhaps because of geoThe author of this box is Andrea Pescatori.
1The sample period covers January 1977 to December 2008.
The data are monthly and the panel is unbalanced. Our preferred
definition of the short-term interest rate was monthly averages of
either the policy rate or an overnight interest rate; when one of
those was not available, government Treasury bill rates were used.
Because of the monthly frequency, industrial production is used
as the measure of output.

likely to move with the U.S. policy rate. However, this
could simply reflect synchronized economic fluctuations faced by the U.S. and Canadian central banks.

For all countries, peggers or not, a surprise increase

statistically significant rise in interest rates of at least
18 basis points in the same month. Over the entire

instrument federal funds rate changes in our analysis.

a statistically significant increase of at least 30 basis
points (Figure 3.2.3).
The interaction terms are also significant, supporting
the view that the exchange rate regime plays an important role.4 Countries that peg their currency to the
dollar have an additional impulse of at least 40 basis
points, for a total of about 70 basis points. Statistically,
we cannot reject the possibility that the interest rate
of a pegging country reacts one to one to movements
in the federal funds rate, as theory would predict for a
perfectly credible peg. Even when the exchange rate is
free to adjust, interest rates are affected by U.S. monetary policy. This result may help us reconcile the
fact that the output response of floaters to U.S. monetary policy shocks is not significantly different from
zero. In fact, a 10 basis point surprise increase in the
U.S. policy rate causes the dollar to appreciate by
4While capital controls may also affect the spillover effect of
U.S. monetary policy, with the expectations that more open
countries will be more affected, previous studies typically find
weak evidence in support of this hypothesis (di Giovanni and
Shambaugh, 2008).

the United States and thus output (Figure 3.2.4). This
beneficial effect, however, is probably offset by the
partial increase in domestic interest rates.
The question is nonetheless still open as to why
floaters are affected by U.S. monetary policy shocks.
We propose two possible explanations. First, it is still
possible that we are not able to perfectly control for
common factors. However, this explanation seems
unlikely since surprises in the federal funds rate should
be orthogonal to common factors, to the extent that
these influence inflation and output gaps. Moreover,
this result is robust to domestic output and domestic
inflation as control variables. Second, and more likely,
it is possible that no country completely disregards its
exchange rate with the dollar. In this case, the magnitude we found gives some idea of the trade-off that
a central bank faces between stabilizing the exchange
rate and responding to domestic economic conditions.

Responding to changes in U.S. policy rates should
result in a loss of monetary policy autonomy because
it would reduce the space available for domestic
monetary policy to respond to domestic economic
conditions. This is the open-economy trilemma: an
open economy can pursue only two of three goals:
fixed exchange rates, domestic monetary autonomy,
and capital mobility. Analyzing this question empirically, we find, as expected, that when a country pegs
its exchange rate, it is less likely to react to domestic
inflation (Figure 3.2.5).
Finally, when the same analysis is performed on a
sample of emerging market and developing economies,
the results are obscured by the various episodes of high
inflation in those economies during the sample period.
However, once we exclude these episodes, the results
are qualitatively similar to those for advanced economies although statistical significance declines.

the YIN aND YaNG OF capItaL FLOW MaNaGeMeNt:
BaLaNcING capItaL INFLOWS WIth capItaL OUtFLOWS

When foreign capital surges into countries, there are two possible means of adjustment: financial adjustment through
increases in resident capital outflows or reserves accumulation, or real adjustment through a larger current account
deficit. Historically, surges in capital inflows to emerging market economies tended to lead to domestic booms and current
account deficits and, when the flows reversed, as they almost inevitably did, painful adjustments and sometimes financial
crisis. The global financial crisis, however, marked a change from the past. While some countries experienced the classical
boom-and-bust cycle in response to volatile international capital flows, many did not. Rather, as international capital
flows dried up, domestic residents stepped in to replace them by drawing down their own foreign assets. This pattern of
buffering foreign capital flows with offsetting resident flows was a key contributor to these economies being more resilient to fluctuations in foreign capital inflows. This chapter examines the underlying explanations for this behavior and
assesses whether it is possible for policymakers to encourage such behavior in countries where it may not currently occur.

C

apital flows to emerging market economies
are a source of particular and enduring concern to many policymakers. These concerns
stem from bitter experience, best exemplified
by the 1997–98 Asian crisis, when surges in capital
inflows fueled excessive credit growth, expanded current
account deficits, appreciated exchange rates, and a loss
of competitiveness. When the inflows reversed, there
was a painful adjustment characterized by severe financial disruptions.1 The experience of the past decade has
only intensified these concerns as inflows have increased
in magnitude and volatility (Figure 4.1). A surge in
inflows—greater even than the surge preceding the
Asian crisis—halted abruptly with the global financial
crisis. But the rebound was rapid, in part because of
low interest rates in advanced economies. Yet now that
economic prospects in the United States are picking up,
flows seem poised to reverse—again.
Such volatile capital inflows create many challenges
for emerging market policymakers. For example, when
low interest rates in advanced economies stimulate capital flows to emerging markets, tightening of monetary
policy or sterilized intervention can lead to even larger

capital inflows, thus boosting rather than dampening
credit growth and widening the gap between domestic
demand and output. Furthermore, calibrating policy
to deal with temporary rather than structural fluctuations, such as those that occur when markets oscillate
between “risk on” and “risk off” episodes, adds another
layer of difficulty to the policymaker’s task.2
What, then, can policymakers do? One approach
that has enjoyed increased support in recent years is
intervention to reduce the volatility of capital inflows
and the associated effects on the exchange rate. Recent
research has provided a rationale for the use of capital
controls (“capital flow management measures”) and
foreign exchange intervention, and the IMF has

example, Chilean Central Bank Governor Rodrigo Vergara observed in January 2013 that “We’ve seen inflows

Figure 4.1. Gross Capital Inﬂows
(Percent of GDP)
Capital inﬂows to emerging market economies have shown substantial variability over the
past decade. Median ﬂows peaked at about 15 percent of GDP just prior to the global
ﬁnancial crisis before dropping to zero. They have since rebounded but continue to
demonstrate signiﬁcant volatility. As seen in the interquartile range, this pattern is common
to most emerging market economies.

companies and private pension fund managers invest
abroad.”4 Chile’s policy response—careful monitoring
but limited direct intervention—reflects the relatively
benign domestic effects of these flows. More broadly,
only some countries that experience strong capital
inflows experience unsustainable booms, current
account blowouts, and subsequent painful adjustments.
These differences in behavior and experience point
to an important distinction among countries. From
the balance of payments identity we know that a surge
in capital inflows can be absorbed either via current account deterioration (“real” adjustment) or via
offsetting capital outflows (“financial” adjustment). In
some economies there is a tendency for strong capital
inflows to fuel booms that, particularly when the flows
reverse, require traumatic real adjustment. It is these
experiences that have stimulated the extensive body of
research on how best to moderate the flows of capital.
In other economies, however, capital inflows lead to
financial adjustment that tends to buffer those inflows
and lower the required real adjustment. We show

article/BT-CO-20130123-709695.html).

that this difference has been associated with greater
economic resilience to capital inflows. Thus, instead
of asking what emerging market economies can do to
stem the flow of capital, an area of research that has
been covered extensively previously, we focus on the
related and complementary question: Given volatile
capital inflows, how can countries encourage stabilizing financial adjustment that minimizes the required
real adjustment? In particular this chapter explores the
following questions: Are these economies really more
resilient? What are the policies and characteristics of
countries where financial adjustment helps minimize
real adjustment? How might this financial adjustment
work? And how did these economies become resilient?
To answer these questions, this analysis first categorizes emerging market economies into two broad groups
based on whether they experience more or less real
adjustment in response to capital inflows. Examination
of GDP, consumption, and unemployment in these two
groups of countries after the global financial crisis reveals
that, on average, countries that experienced less real
adjustment were indeed more resilient. The chapter then
looks in more detail at the policies and characteristics of
these two groups. This investigation reveals some surprisingly clear distinctions. The more resilient emerging
market economies have (1) more countercyclical fiscal
policy and better monetary policies; (2) better institutions; (3) more flexible exchange rate regimes; and (4)
more stable net capital flows because of greater financial
adjustment that reflects private rather than official buffering of capital inflows. Also of interest are the dimensions along which the groups do not differ: (1) Both
groups had approximately the same share of resources
and manufacturing. (2) Both had similar levels of real
GDP per capita. And most notably (3) both faced a
similar level and volatility of gross capital inflows.
The chapter then briefly considers various theories
that may explain the findings. It appears that, when
domestic and international financial markets are
relatively free of distortions, the natural consumptionsmoothing behavior of domestic investors tends to
offset and buffer volatile foreign capital flows with
financial adjustment rather than real adjustment.5
While it is helpful to identify the defining characteristics of these more resilient economies, it is
5Such as might result from either misaligned exchange rates and
impediments to the free flow of capital or by the tendency toward
imprudent boom-and-bust behavior in poorly developed or poorly
regulated capital markets.

equally important to understand how these countries
acquired these characteristics and which characteristics
appear to promote resilience rather than being merely
a consequence of resilience. Thus, the second half of
this chapter examines how some currently resilient
economies have developed this quality. In particular, it focuses on the experiences of three countries
that have considerably increased their resilience to
swings in capital inflows: Chile, the Czech Republic,
and Malaysia. While each of these countries took a
somewhat different path, their greater resilience can
be linked to a mix of policy measures that included
better prudential regulation and financial supervision,
more countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy, greater
exchange rate flexibility, and a more liberal regime for
capital outflows. Overall, the success of these countries has been based on embracing these reforms in a
comprehensive manner. Incomplete reforms tended
to be associated with destabilizing effects—too rapid
financial development or premature opening to capital
flows without appropriate prudential regulation can
still lead to financial crisis.

Financial adjustment and resilience
The starting point for this empirical investigation is
to divide countries into two broad groups based on
whether they experience more or less real adjustment
in response to capital inflows. The expectation is that
the extent to which these countries adjust to capital
inflows with real or financial adjustment corresponds
with how resilient they are to those inflows—in other
words, the extent to which they are prone to large current account movements and corresponding economic
dislocation. Building on the discussion above, the categorization is based on the relationship between capital
inflows and current account fluctuations. In particular,
it is helpful to consider the following version of the
balance of payments identity:
Gross inflows = current account deficit
+ gross outflows + reserves accumulation.
This identity shows how changes in gross inflows
must be absorbed through changes in either the current account or in gross outflows and reserves.6 In
some countries, but not in others, surges in capital
6To be precise, we should add to the left side of this equation the
net capital account and errors and omissions. These terms are, however, generally small and therefore are included in gross inflows.

inflows are largely associated with increases in current account deficits that, as history demonstrates, can
require painful adjustments when these inflows reverse.
To distinguish countries that absorb swings in gross
inflows more through changes in gross outflows and
reserves than through the current account, we regress
the current account on gross inflows for each country in a sample of 38 emerging market economies.7
The countries are ranked according to the estimated
relationship between inflows and the current account,
and the sample is split at the median. We refer to the
group of countries with larger positive coefficients, for
which changes in gross inflows are associated with large
changes in the current account deficit, as less resilient
and to those with a lower or negative coefficient as
more resilient.8 As with any such metric, the exact allocation of countries between the groups may be affected
by a number of confounding factors. And, since there
may be only small differences between individual
countries close to the median, undue weight should
not be attached to the particular group any given
country falls into. The division is designed to highlight
the broad characteristics of the group of countries that
display more or less financial adjustment in response to
gross capital inflows rather than to precisely characterize any given country as more or less resilient.

Is Financial adjustment associated with economic
(“real”) resilience?
While the historical experience has been that countries
that undergo large current account corrections gener7The regression uses annual data from 2000 to 2012, and both
the current account and capital inflows are expressed as a percent
of GDP. The sample consists of the group of countries identified as
emerging market economies in Chapter 4 of the April 2011 World
Economic Outlook (WEO) minus countries affected by the Arab
Spring, large oil exporters (countries where oil exports have averaged
over 25 percent of GDP for the past three years), offshore financial
centers, and countries that by 2000 were classified in the WEO
as advanced economies. Among these countries are still some that
have subsequently been reclassified as advanced economies. They
are retained in the sample because their experiences, including the
fact that they have transitioned to advanced economy status, are
instructive.
8The high-coefficient group comprises Argentina, Belarus, Bulgaria, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Hungary, India,
Indonesia, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Pakistan, Romania,
the Slovak Republic, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela. The lowcoefficient group comprises Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia,
the Czech Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Malaysia, Mexico,
Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Thailand,
Ukraine, and Uruguay.

ally suffer large real consequences, it is important to
check whether this remained the case for our sample of
countries in recent years.9 To do this we look at these
countries’ experiences with the capital inflow surge
prior to the global financial crisis and the sudden stop
associated with its onset. Figure 4.2 (panel 1) shows
the evolution of the current account in the two groups
of countries over the past decade. It is in line with the
anticipated patterns. The countries where more of the
adjustment to capital inflows occurred on the current account were also the countries that, on average,
experienced a large blowout and correction during
the 2000s. The subsequent panels trace the path of
adjustment to the large current account corrections
that occurred between 2007 and 2009. Panels 2 and
3 show the deviation of GDP and consumption from
the precrisis trend (calculated from 2002 to 2007), and
panel 4 shows the average unemployment rate for the
two groups of economies. The relative performance
of the less resilient group as a whole was clearly worse
than that of the more resilient group. GDP was lower
than precrisis trends in both groups, but the drop was
larger for the less resilient group. The difference is even
more dramatic for total consumption (private plus
public) and unemployment. While domestic consumption was about 5 percent lower than precrisis trends
in the more resilient group by 2012, it was 16 percent
lower in the less resilient group. Similarly, unemployment rose by approximately 4 percentage points in the
less resilient group, and is still higher than before the
global financial crisis, whereas it was barely affected in
the more resilient group.
Overall, these indicators suggest that countries
whose current account was less responsive to capital
inflows were more resilient in the face of both the
surge in capital inflows experienced through the mid2000s and the large decline in capital inflows during
the global financial crisis. They faced less real adjustment, as reflected in more stable current accounts
and better postcrisis GDP, consumption, and unemployment levels; instead, they undertook much more
financial adjustment.

fluctuations. We consider how the more and less
resilient groups differ in terms of their monetary and
fiscal policy mix, institutions, capital flows, and other
indicators of their economic structure. To benchmark our findings, the two groups in our sample are
also compared with a selected group of small open
advanced economies: Australia, Canada, Denmark,
New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. This analysis
compares averages over the past 10 years for flow variables and the latest observation for stock variables. For
example, the net international investment position as
of 2010 (the latest available value) is used for comparisons across countries, while gross capital inflows are
averaged over the past 10 years.

Figure 4.3. Policies and Institutions
Policies and institutions in more resilient economies are generally stronger than in less
resilient economies. There is a higher share of inﬂation-targeting central banks, and inﬂation
is generally lower and ﬁscal policy more countercyclical. More resilient economies tend to
have more ﬂexible exchange rates than less resilient economies, although there is no
signiﬁcant difference in de jure measures of capital account openness.

Although this analysis divides countries on the basis
of the pass-through from gross inflows to the current
account, there are a number of ways the pass-through
could play out. For example, countries with low passthrough may also experience smaller or more stable
inflows. Panels 1 and 2 of Figure 4.4 show that, in
fact, the level and volatility of gross capital inflows
are similar between the two groups. It is also interesting to note that advanced economies experience even
more volatility in gross inflows than either of the two

Figure 4.3 shows that the more resilient economies
have more flexible exchange rates but no meaningful
or significant differences in capital account openness
(at least as measured by the available, but admittedly
imperfect, de jure measures). Monetary and fiscal policies appear to be better in the more resilient economies
to the extent that inflation is significantly lower and
fiscal policy is more countercyclical.10 Finally, as measured by a very broad metric of institutional quality,
which captures things like the quality of the bureaucracy and the rule of law, the more resilient economies
have significantly better economic institutions.11

groups of emerging market economies in our sample.
Panels 3 and 4 of Figure 4.4 confirm that, as suggested
by Figure 4.2, net capital flows are larger and more
volatile in the less resilient group.12 In other words,
there is much more stabilizing financial adjustment
taking place in the more resilient economies. A different way of looking at this relationship is to note that
there is a lesser correlation between gross inflows and
the current account in the more resilient group (Figure
4.4, panel 5). In principle, financial adjustment can be
performed by either the private sector or the official
(public) sector through reserves management. In practice, most financial adjustment was undertaken by the
private sector. In particular, between 2007 and 2009,
when gross inflows to emerging market economies fell
significantly, approximately 20 percent of the financial
adjustment in both groups was accommodated with
changes in reserves and 80 percent through changes in
private flows. Finally, this analysis also finds that the
more resilient economies have less negative net foreign
asset positions (Figure 4.4, panel 6—although there are
no significant differences in the average levels of assets
or liabilities separately).

Income, reserves, and Industrial Structure
Interestingly, there are few differences between the
two groups of emerging market economies in terms of
industrial structure or income levels (Figure 4.5). Both
have the same average level of resources and manufacturing, and there is no significant difference in the
average level of income. For example, more resilient
economies do not appear to be those with greater
mineral wealth or higher incomes. This analysis does,
however, find that the resilient economies have somewhat higher levels of reserves. However, as mentioned
above, at least during the global financial crisis, there
was little difference in the use of reserves between the
two groups, and the majority of the financial adjustment was actually performed by the private sector.13

12Given the balance of payments identity, net capital flows are
equivalent to the current account.
13These observations are consistent with the findings of Alberola,
Erce, and Serena (2012), who find that large holdings of international reserves prevent capital flight by domestic residents during
global financial stress and make them more willing to repatriate
capital invested overseas.

Summary

Figure 4.5. Economic Structure and Reserves

The main findings are that resilient emerging market
economies have more flexible exchange rates, lower
inflation, more countercyclical fiscal policy, better economic institutions, and more stable current accounts
(net capital flows). Furthermore, the majority of the
financial adjustment in resilient economies is through
private rather than official flows. It should be understood, however, that identifying these characteristics
does not address the question of causality: how countries became resilient and whether these characteristics
explain their resilience or are simply consequences or
indicators of resilience. The case studies that follow,
however, by focusing on the sequence of events and
development of these characteristics, allow clearer
inferences about causality and provide some answers to
the questions about why these countries are more resilient today. A comprehensive analysis of this evidence is
presented in the final section of this chapter.

More resilient economies are not clealy or signiﬁcantly richer or endowed with greater
resource wealth than less resilient economies. They do, however, have somewhat higher
levels of reserves on average.

To provide some background before analyzing the different country experiences, we discuss some theoretical
explanations for why capital outflows may move in the
ways indicated by the data. In particular, we look at what
might explain the fact that, in practice, the majority of
financial adjustment is undertaken by the private sector.
At its simplest, financial adjustment is simply the
embodiment of Adam Smith’s invisible hand. When an
investor withdraws money from a country, this tends
to create forces that raise domestic interest rates and
lower the exchange rate. And these changes tend to
create incentives for others to step in. Impediments to
the operation of these equilibrating mechanisms may
prevent this adjustment from operating automatically.
For example, in countries where exchange rates are
fixed and, through the use of capital controls, domestic
interest rates are independent of world interest rates,
capital outflows must be met with changes in official
reserves—the hand of the public sector replaces the
invisible hand of the market. While either the public
or the private sector can undertake financial adjustment, our analysis indicates that the majority of the
adjustment observed over the past decade has been
undertaken by the private sector.
The theory behind the financial adjustment mechanism discussed does not, however, say anything about
the identity of the private investors on each end of
such transactions. The important feature of how finan-

cial adjustment operates in practice is that inflows from
foreigners are volatile and that these flows are buffered
when residents (rather than other foreigners) step in
when foreigners step out. Explaining these aspects of
the financial adjustment process is more difficult, but
there is nonetheless a growing theoretical and empirical
literature that attempts to do so. First, Forbes and Warnock (2012) show that sharp reversals in gross capital
flows are mostly associated with changes in global risk
aversion rather than domestic factors. They show that
episodes of higher global risk aversion are associated
with an increase in home bias as evidenced by a contemporaneous reduction in both outflows and inflows.

(2012) show, in a relatively standard financial model,
that this buffering effect can result from the presence
of asymmetric information that allows domestic investors to recognize shocks to domestic assets faster than
foreigners and for domestic investors to take advantage
of that superior information.14
While recent capital flows appear to have been
mostly driven by global shocks, Broner and others
(2013) show that, even when a domestic crisis is triggering an outflow of foreign investors’ funds, domestic
residents still tend to offset those flows. While both
foreign and domestic investors may want to reallocate
their investment portfolio out of the country during
a domestic crisis, domestic consumers have an offsetting incentive to repatriate some of their foreign assets
to smooth consumption. In line with this observation, Figure 4.2 shows that consumption was much
smoother in the countries in our sample that had more
financial adjustment. Alternatively or additionally,
Broner, Martin, and Ventura (2010) posit that foreigners are more likely to be defaulted on than domestic
residents during a crisis. Consequently, foreigners may
have an incentive to sell domestic assets to domestic
agents—leading to a reduction in both gross inflows
and gross outflows during instability or crisis.
Overall, even though the theoretical models are still
immature, they suggest that financial adjustment is the
result of ordinary economic forces that tend to create
different incentives for residents and nonresidents.
That is, underlying these models are assumptions that
financial markets are well developed and generally
free of distortions. This provides an obvious explanation for the finding above that the countries with the
greatest financial adjustment had the freest exchange
rate arrangements. The case studies below shed further
light on this mechanism and help assess whether more
financial adjustment is associated with particular policy
decisions.

case Studies
The analysis above provides some indication of what
characteristics are shared by more resilient economies,
14This is an idea with a long history. Smith (1776), when
introducing the idea of the invisible hand, put it this way: “First,
every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as
he can…. He can know better the character and situation of the
persons whom he trusts, and if he should happen to be deceived,
he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek
redress.”

120

but it does not address the question of whether these
characteristics contribute to resilience or merely reflect
it. To shed some light on this question we turn to
three case studies: Chile, the Czech Republic, and
Malaysia.
These three countries had diverse initial conditions
and cover the three major geographical regions that are
home to emerging market economies. In addition, these
economies are different: Chile has a significant resources
sector; the Czech Republic has no resources to speak of
but does have a large manufacturing sector; and Malaysia has elements of both, with a modest resources sector
in addition to significant manufacturing activity. These
countries are also among the most resilient, based on
the correlation of changes in net and gross capital flows
(Chile and Malaysia are in the top quintile) and on
their credit default swap spreads (among the lowest in
the sample). Furthermore, each country took a different
approach in building its resilience—notably, there was
much greater government involvement in Malaysia than
in the Czech Republic or Chile.
Of additional interest is the fact that these economies were not always resilient. Each of them tried a
number of policy mixes over a period of decades, and
it is their earlier unsuccessful experiences, as much as
their recent resilience, that sheds light on the factors
that improve an economy’s resilience. Furthermore,
tracing the sequence of reform in these countries
helps identify which characteristics appear to promote
resilience and which reflect it. In particular, we focus
on identifying whether the current resilience of these
economies seems to be the result of particular policy
choices or benign economic conditions and luck.

chile
Over a period of decades punctuated by crises in the early
1980s and late 1990s, Chile has gradually moved toward
a policy mix that combines an inflation-targeting framework, a freely floating exchange rate, a structural balance
fiscal rule, and open capital markets with strong prudential and financial market regulation. This policy mix has
delivered notable resilience to sometimes large fluctuations
in gross capital inflows. Earlier policy mixes that were
missing one or more elements of the current policy combination ended in crisis. These crises were, however, the
catalyst for changes that resulted in the current policy mix.
In the mid-1970s Chile started deregulating its
financial and capital markets as part of a general shift

toward free-market policies. Foreign capital flows were
allowed, but tightly regulated, and the exchange rate
was fixed. But prudential regulation of the domestic
financial system was lax, particularly of related lending. The prevailing ethos was one of market discipline
rather than explicit regulation. As a consequence, a
number of banks collapsed. Furthermore, when financial institutions gained access to foreign capital markets
in 1980, they expanded their foreign intermediation
activities dramatically and, ultimately, imprudently.
When a debt crisis hit in 1982, a large depreciation in
the previously fixed exchange rate led to extensive corporate defaults and an ensuing financial crisis (Figure
4.6, panel 1). Weak prudential controls allowed financial and foreign exchange risks to build up, and when
the sovereign debt crisis occurred, they compounded
the downturn.
After spending much of the 1980s excluded from
international capital markets, the government policy
mix in the 1990s involved more economic flexibility
than in the 1970s and early 1980s, but it was still
relatively interventionist. The government pursued
an export-led growth model that targeted a stable
and depreciated exchange rate managed in a moving
band to maintain a sustainable external balance. It
was thought that this approach would minimize the
country’s vulnerability to the kind of financial turmoil
that led to the 1982 crisis. The government, however,
also wanted the ability to run independent monetary
policy to reduce the still-high level of inflation. As
a result, capital controls were necessary, and Chile
used an unremunerated reserve requirement known
as the encaje that allowed for a wedge between global
and domestic interest rates.15 In addition, reflecting
the lessons learned in the early 1980s financial crisis,
prudential regulation was much improved, particularly
regarding related lending.
This approach led to many tensions. In line with
the trend in other emerging market economies, capital
inflows to Chile increased markedly during the 1990s.
The exchange rate was consistently pushing against the
strong side of the band, requiring extensive sterilized
intervention. At the same time, the central bank was
trying to maintain high domestic interest rates as it
aimed to deliver price stability, which exacerbated the

Since the late 1990s, Chile has followed a policy mix of inﬂation targeting, a ﬂoating
exchange rate, and free capital ﬂows. It has also improved its general institutional quality and
implemented more countercyclical ﬁscal policy. The net effect has been that ﬂuctuations in
gross capital inﬂows are buffered by gross capital outﬂows, and the country has been much
less affected by ﬂuctuations in gross inﬂows than in the past.

15The empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these capital
controls is mixed. Cowan and others (2007), for instance, argue that
it did not change the volume of inflows—only their composition.

costs involved in defending the exchange rate.16 The
tensions inherent in Chile’s chosen policy framework
eventually came to a head with the Russian bond crisis.
Russia’s default led to a sharp deterioration in sentiment toward emerging markets in general. Interest
rates on Chilean sovereign and commercial debt rose,
and the terms of trade deteriorated as the price of copper fell. Now, instead of defending the exchange rate
against appreciation, the policy framework required the
defense of the exchange rate against depreciation.17 As
a result, monetary policy was tightened, which exacerbated the domestic downturn. Although there was
no “sudden stop” in gross capital inflows, there was
still a sharp reduction in net inflows that contributed
to the strength of the downturn because of a “sudden
start” in gross capital outflows. This was partially a
result of poor timing: limits on foreign investment by
the private pension funds had been gradually relaxed
through the 1990s. But, because Chile had been growing strongly and domestic returns were high, these
relaxations had not translated into strong outflows.
When the crisis started, however, the authorities’
attempt to prevent depreciation of the exchange rate
provided domestic investors with the strong incentive
to move money abroad in order to benefit from a possible depreciation.
The outcome, while better than in 1982, was still
not ideal. Unemployment rose from about 6 percent
to almost 12 percent, and the economy experienced
its first year of negative growth since 1983 (see Figure
4.6, panel 1). The improvement in prudential controls
did, however, prevent a financial crisis and any related
worsening of the situation.
Reflecting on the 1998 crisis, the authorities recognized that the framework in place required a procyclical monetary policy response and that this framework
also encouraged exacerbating private portfolio flows
because investors could anticipate exchange rate movements and make one-way bets.18 The central bank
16This

was because it involved the accumulation of foreign reserves
that paid a lower rate of interest than the central bank was paying on
its liabilities.
17Theoretically, the authorities could have allowed the exchange
rate to depreciate, but multiple, relatively familiar, justifications
were offered for why this would be dangerous. For example, it was
suggested that depreciation would raise inflation and undermine the
central bank’s inflation-targeting credibility and destabilize financial
markets, with an adverse effect on those with foreign currency
exposure.
18See Carrière-Swallow and García-Silva (2013).

122

decided on an inflation-targeting framework under
which most capital controls were removed and the
exchange rate was allowed to float freely. It was hoped
that the increased exchange rate volatility associated
with free floating would serve as a natural disincentive to the kinds of short-term capital transactions that
were a traditional source of concern. Fiscal policy was
also improved with the introduction of a structural
balanced budget rule in 2001, which made fiscal policy
more countercyclical than in the past. (The effect can
be seen in Figure 4.6, panel 2.)
The regulatory framework for banks was reformed to
encourage financial development. In particular, pension
funds were natural counterparties to nonfinancial corporate in the foreign exchange market, and the relaxation of regulations allowed the development of the
markets each needed to hedge their foreign exchange
risk, with banks acting as intermediaries. Furthermore,
with controls on capital outflows relaxed and pension
funds free to hold a significant fraction of their assets
overseas, gross capital flows in Chile began to behave
much more like those in advanced economies, where
gross outflows and gross inflows offset each other and
generally stabilize net inflows and activity (Figure 4.6,
panel 3).
The net result of these policies was that the Chilean
economy now seems much more resilient to global
shocks and capital flow volatility. Large fluctuations in
gross capital flows during the global financial crisis and
earlier Latin American crises had less effect on net capital flows. Furthermore, Chile has been able to respond
to downturns with countercyclical and stabilizing fiscal
and monetary policies, assisted by the automatic stabilizer that a floating exchange rate provides.

Malaysia
During the Asian crisis, faced with the prospect of a sudden stop in capital inflows and capital flight, Malaysia
closed its financial account and fixed its exchange rate.
Over the following decade, it carefully built financial
sector resilience, moved to a flexible exchange rate regime,
and gradually relaxed restrictions on capital flows. The
improvements in resilience have been such that, despite
more open capital markets, highly volatile gross inflows
during the global financial crisis did not lead to a sudden stop in net flows or domestic financial instability.
In the early 1990s, Malaysia experienced strong growth
characterized by high investment and large current

account deficits that reached 10 percent of GDP in 1995
(Figure 4.7, panel 1). The sudden stop of capital inflows
in 1998 as part of the Asian crisis led to a dramatic contraction of investment and GDP as well as a sharp reversal
of the current account. In order to avoid a hemorrhaging
of foreign capital, prevent an even larger depreciation of
the currency, and allow for monetary and fiscal easing, Malaysia introduced capital controls and fixed the
exchange rate with respect to the U.S. dollar on September 2, 1998. The economy rebounded quickly, returning
to healthy growth rates by the end of 1999.
Although capital flow restrictions and the fixing
of the exchange rate may have helped avoid a more
severe financial crisis in the short run (Kaplan and
Rodrik, 2002), the Malaysian authorities concluded
that international financial integration remained crucial
for the ultimate success of the country. They therefore
embarked on a staged process of reforms that involved
both strengthening the domestic financial sector and
gradually reopening the financial account. This strategy foresaw the development of the domestic financial
sector over the subsequent 10 years through three ex
ante planned phases: During the first three years policy
efforts focused on enhancing the capacity and capability
of the existing banks. The subsequent three to four years
saw increased competition through the deregulation and
liberalization of the sector. Finally, during the last phase,
the authorities promoted greater international integration by allowing new players into the domestic economy
and supporting investment abroad. Another important
step that increased the resilience of the financial sector
was to foster the development of equity and bond markets, which expanded financing beyond bank lending.
Finally, the Malaysian authorities took considerable
steps to improve financial regulation and supervision by
adopting risk-based capital requirements, stress testing,
peer group comparisons, and horizontal reviews.
The strengthening of the financial sector was
accompanied by a gradual easing of restrictions on
capital flows and exchange rate transactions in order
to increase efficiency and reduce the costs of conducting business internationally. A notable consequence of
fewer restrictions on capital outflows was the gradual
accumulation of a substantial gross international asset
position. While international liabilities stayed relatively
constant as a proportion of GDP, Malaysia more than
doubled its gross foreign holdings between 1997 and
2012, leading to a large correction in the net foreign
asset position, which turned positive.

Figure 4.7. Malaysia
Despite larger swings in gross capital inﬂows, Malaysia weathered the global ﬁnancial crisis
much better than the Asian crisis. This is due in part to more countercyclical use of ﬁscal
policy and larger capital outﬂows that signiﬁcantly offset movements in gross inﬂows.

world economic outlook: trAnSitionS And tenSionS

The accumulation of international assets was initially
fueled by the increase in official reserves accumulated
to offset appreciation pressure on the exchange rate.
Importantly, the accumulation of reserves limited the
incentives for private agents to invest abroad, given the
possibility of eventual appreciation of the currency. As in
the case of Chile during the late 1990s, this behavior is
emblematic of the distortionary effects a large accumulation of official reserves can have on capital outflows.
When official reserves are used to resist fundamental
movements in exchange rates, they present private investors with the opportunity for a one-way bet against the
continuation of policy intervention, which can lead to
inefficient allocation of private capital.
Indeed, when Malaysia moved its exchange rate
regime to a managed float in 2005, allowing the local
currency to appreciate and further removing restrictions on international transactions, the accumulation
of foreign assets accelerated. Gross outflows in U.S.
dollars increased by about 50 percent during 2006–09
compared with 2002–05, with a dramatic increase in
private outflows. The proportion of official reserves in
total private and official outflows fell from more than
50 percent during 2002–05 to less than 20 percent
during 2006–09. This increase in private capital
outflows was characterized by strong growth of foreign
direct investment by Malaysian companies fueled by a
desire to seek new markets and benefit from economies
of scale. A similarly rapid increase was recorded in
bank lending abroad and in foreign deposits. Overall,
the increase in gross private outflows contributed to a
considerable improvement in the net foreign asset position of Malaysia, which was also reflected in a positive
net foreign asset position by domestic banks.
The accumulation of foreign assets has played an
important role in reducing the volatility of net capital
flows. Indeed, the reduction in capital inflows during
the Great Recession was largely offset by the sales of
foreign reserves and the repatriation of domestic capital
invested abroad. In particular, large sales of domestic bonds by foreign investors were absorbed with
minimal impacts on yields by the Employee Provident
Fund and other deep-pocketed domestic institutional
investors. The stabilizing role of reserves and private
outflows, coupled with the greater flexibility of the
exchange rate and strength of domestic financial institutions, allowed Malaysia to weather the global financial crisis much better than during the crisis of the
late 1990s, despite the larger reduction in gross capital
inflows. An additional element that has strengthened
124

the resilience of Malaysia to swings in capital flows has
been a significant change in the dynamics of public
spending. While government spending was positively
correlated with GDP fluctuations during the 1990s,
it has become much more countercyclical during the
2000s, especially by providing fiscal stimulus during
downturns (Figure 4.7, panel 2).

the czech republic
After a rocky start in the 1990s, when strong capital
flows, a weak financial sector, and a fixed exchange rate
regime contributed to a large recession in 1998, the Czech
Republic has developed into a stable advanced market
economy. This followed the adoption of credible fiscal and
monetary policies that contributed to lower sovereign and
corporate interest rate premiums, which, unlike in some
other central and eastern European nations, minimized
incentives for destabilizing inflows and outflows.
Capital flows into the Czech economy started right
after the change of the political regime in the early
1990s. The Czech Republic’s membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) from 1996, and the associated commitment
to phase out capital controls, meant that capital controls were generally unavailable, necessitating different
policy approaches than those used in Chile and Malaysia.19 Capital inflows put the currency under appreciation pressure and facilitated growing imbalances on
the current account, which the Czech National Bank
(CNB) attempted to deal with by pegging the currency
against an effective exchange rate basket and sterilizing inflows. In 1995, with the pressure intensifying,
the CNB introduced a surcharge on foreign exchange
transactions and a limit on short-term borrowing by
banks. It also broadened the exchange rate band to
±7.5 percent in 1996. Notwithstanding these actions,
imbalances grew and were magnified by fiscal expansion and strong wage growth. The framework was challenged in May 1997 with a speculative attack on the
currency triggered by a combination of political uncertainty and contagion from southeast Asia. The defense
of the currency saw interest rates rise substantially as
monetary policy was forced to operate procyclically
(Figure 4.8, panel 2).

19See Ötker-Robe and others (2007) for a more detailed discussion of the Czech Republic’s experiences.

A recession ensued and was exacerbated by weakness in the financial sector, which was a holdover
from the previous regime of inefficient governmentcontrolled financial institutions. While lending was
not well managed and inefficiently allocated due to
government control, there was a lack of infrastructure
to support large-scale foreign exchange lending, and
so, somewhat by accident, the Czech Republic did not
experience the sort of disruption that foreign currency borrowing induced in a number of central and
eastern European economies over the past decade or
so. During the global financial crisis, many local banks
suffered large losses, and most were eventually sold to
foreign investors, significantly improving the financial
infrastructure.
With the fixed exchange rate regime unsustainable
in the face of speculative attacks, and capital controls
ruled out by membership in the OECD, the CNB
decided to adopt inflation targeting and a freely floating exchange rate regime in 1998. Monetary policy
quickly gained a large degree of credibility, albeit at a
relatively large real cost, as inflation was reduced by
means of a tight monetary policy. The CNB also stayed
clear of the foreign exchange market, exposing households and firms to a freely floating currency. Fiscal
policies were also rather conservative during the 1990s
and 2000s, generating deficits between 2 and 4 percent
of GDP, with the extra benefit of a very favorable starting point (gross government debt started at less than
20 percent of GDP in the early 1990s): gross government debt has never exceeded 50 percent of GDP. On
average, as measured by the correlation between the
cyclical deviations of primary government spending
and GDP, fiscal policy was slightly countercyclical during this period.
As a result of the credible monetary policy regime
and sustainable fiscal debt, the interest rate differential
vis-à-vis world currencies disappeared (with the nominal
three-month interbank rate dropping below the threemonth euro interbank offered rate early in 2002; see
Figure 4.8, panel 2). A noticeable consequence was that
the vast majority of the net increases in foreign liabilities
over this time were private foreign direct investment
flows. Because of the small interest rate differentials,
there were very few “hot money” private nondirect
investment inflows and, similarly, few incentives for
domestic residents to borrow in foreign currencies.
This situation is rather uncommon in the context of
emerging market economies but highlights some of the
benefits of strong fundamentals that are expressed in low

Figure 4.8. The Czech Republic
After a recession in 1997, the Czech Republic adopted a policy mix of inﬂation targeting,
ﬂoating exchange rates, free capital ﬂows, and credible ﬁscal policy. The interest rate
differentials, which had previously been very high, declined to practically zero. Consequently,
and in contrast with a number of other central and eastern European countries, there were
few incentives for foreign currency borrowing, and most capital inﬂows were foreign direct
investment. As a result, the Czech economy was much more resilient to capital inﬂow
ﬂuctuations. The drop in capital inﬂows associated with the global ﬁnancial crisis was
matched by a reduction in outﬂows, which lent stability to net ﬂows.

interest rate differentials.20 Furthermore, reflecting better
prudential management, domestic credit expansion was
very moderate compared with similar central and eastern
European countries during this period. Domestic credit
rose from about 30 percent of GDP in 2001 to about
50 percent of GDP in 2008, and almost all the lending
was in domestic currency.
When the global financial crisis hit, these policy
settings and institutional features meant that the effects
on financial stability and the current account were
relatively muted and much smaller than during the
earlier episode at the end of the 1990s. The nominal
exchange rate was allowed to depreciate (which it did
by about 15 percent), but it quickly returned to its
precrisis levels. The CNB was free to run countercyclical monetary policy and cut rates from 3.5 percent in
August 2008 to 1.0 percent by the end of 2009, and
then further to 0.05 percent in 2012. Fiscal policy was
also countercyclical, facilitated by contained gross debt
levels and limited changes in long-term government
bond yields. A large reduction in gross inflows was
offset by a corresponding reduction in gross outflows
(Figure 4.8, panel 3). There were no reversals on the
current or financial accounts, and the performance of
Czech banks remained strong.

Overall analysis
This chapter began by showing that emerging market economies differ with respect to how changes in
gross inflows are absorbed through financial versus real
adjustment and that this difference was reflected in their
level of resilience during the global financial crisis. The
empirical section documented the country characteristics
associated with higher financial adjustment, and the
case studies told how Chile, the Czech Republic, and
Malaysia reformed their economies and moved toward
a regime with more financial adjustment that buffered
capital inflows. This section brings together the accumulated evidence to address a few key questions. First, how
has financial adjustment operated in these economies
and, particularly, to what extent was financial adjustment driven by government intervention or private
behavior? Second, what policy reforms (and their ordering) might assist policymakers in other emerging market
20Box 4.1 presents a series of simulations that illustrate these
benefits. The simulated economy with no foreign currency borrowing is much more resilient to international financial market volatility
than the simulated economy with 50 percent of borrowing in foreign
currency.

economies in strengthening resilience and encouraging
more buffering through financial adjustment?

how Did Financial adjustment Operate in the case
Studies?
The empirical and case study evidence underlines that
the majority of financial adjustment in more resilient
economies was undertaken by private agents. And an
important element underlying the buffering behavior
of private agents was a relatively flexible exchange
rate regime. When country authorities try to resist
fundamental changes in the exchange rate, they create
incentives for both foreigners and residents to take the
opposite position. As the case of Chile demonstrates,
when depreciation can be anticipated, as it usually can
with managed exchange rate regimes during periods
of pressure, there is a tendency toward destabilizing
capital outflows from both domestic residents and
nonresidents. Conversely, during the global financial
crisis, when the exchange rates of both Chile and the
Czech Republic were allowed to adjust and depreciate,
gross capital outflows served to stabilize the net flows
because domestic residents either slowed their normal
outflows or repatriated foreign funds.
Although reserves management can contribute to
financial adjustment, the case studies and evidence from
the global financial crisis show that private agents can
themselves manage their foreign assets in a stabilizing
way. This analysis has already reviewed several reasons
private agents may have strong incentives to reduce
outflows when inflows dry up. The case studies provide
some concrete examples. In Chile, for example, the primary actors are the private pension funds, which invest
the pension savings of Chileans and hold approximately
40 percent of their assets abroad. During the global
financial crisis, multiple incentives combined to encourage a significant rebalancing: pension funds repatriated
foreign assets and, thereby, offset the reduction in foreign investors’ inflows.21 In particular, the freely floating
exchange rate combined with limited capital controls
and well-developed financial markets to quickly and
efficiently encourage and facilitate financial adjustment
that buffered volatile gross inflows.
The case of Malaysia shows a larger use of foreign
reserves to offset private inflows, particularly during
the early stages of Malaysia’s recovery from the Asian
crisis. However, during the global financial crisis

changes in nonofficial outflows also contributed greatly
to buffering. In particular, bond markets remained
stable thanks to purchases by the Employees Provident
Fund and other well-capitalized institutional investors.
These operations may have been somewhat influenced
by public officials given the higher level of government
involvement in the Malaysian economy, but these
purchases mirrored the behavior of the private pension
funds in Chile, suggesting that simple market incentives played an important role.
Finally, it is worth noting that, even though the private sector may undertake the majority of the financial
adjustment in response to shocks in the cases studied,
this does not rule out a role for the official sector. In
both Chile and Malaysia, the central banks intervened
in the foreign exchange market from time to time to
smooth fluctuations or to address a temporary overshooting of the equilibrium exchange rate.

how can emerging Market economies encourage
Stabilizing Financial adjustment and Increase their
resilience?
Each of the countries studied has increased its resilience to volatile capital inflows by improving prudential regulation, fostering financial development,
strengthening the credibility and countercyclical use
of fiscal and monetary policy, moving toward more
flexible exchange rate regimes, and allowing for greater
openness in the financial account—in particular with
respect to capital outflows. The net effect has been that
highly volatile gross capital inflows now have much less
influence on the current account and economic stability than in the past.
An important question is whether these policy
changes led to resilience or vice versa. The evidence
points to the former conclusion. In each case, reforms
that improved financial supervision and relaxed
restrictions on capital flows and exchange rates were
the result of conscious policy choices rather than the
outcome of resilience to capital flows obtained through
other propitious events. Indeed, most of these policy
changes were implemented during times of weakness
and crisis after previous policy mixes were found to be
inadequate in dealing with capital flow reversals. That
said, reforms were sequenced in all three countries, and
not all reforms were implemented at the same time.
For example, measures to strengthen domestic financial
development typically preceded steps toward more
exchange rate flexibility.

Much can also be learned from the previous regimes,
which failed to ensure macroeconomic stability and
steady economic growth in the face of volatile capital
inflows. Policy mixes that contained some but not all
of the elements of resilience were found lacking. For
example, the case of the Czech Republic demonstrates
how open financial accounts alone, without appropriate institutional backing, can be destabilizing. Weak
financial systems also exacerbated downturns after
capital flow reversals. And speculative attacks on managed currencies required procyclical monetary policy
responses that destabilized the domestic economy even
when other elements of resilience were in place.
The empirical and case study analysis also shows a
much higher incidence of countercyclical fiscal policy in
resilient economies. Previous research, for example, by
Cardarelli, Elekdag, and Kose (2009) highlights the beneficial effects of countercyclical fiscal policy. However,
what is less clear is whether resilience allows countries
to adopt countercyclical fiscal policies or vice versa.
Frankel, Végh, and Vuletin (2011) find that over the
past decade, about one-third of their sample of emerging market economies was able to escape fiscal policy
procyclicality and become countercyclical. Importantly,
they attribute this critical shift in fiscal policy to an
improvement in the quality of institutions. The evidence from the case studies suggests that the adoption
of sound fiscal policies tends to precede resilience. Thus,
it seems that countercyclical fiscal policy (or a general
improvement in institutions) contributes to resilience.
Furthermore, when surpluses are saved in a sovereign
wealth fund that is invested abroad, as in Chile, this
can directly contribute to financial adjustment during
a downturn because the repatriation of such funds can
buffer falls in capital inflows and support fiscal stimulus.

conclusions
Emerging markets have faced unprecedented volatility in capital inflows during the past decade. In 2011
policymakers worried that excessive inflows might
cause overheating, but more recently concerns have
shifted to the disruption that might result from sudden
stops as interest rates in the United States normalize.
A key question for many policymakers is how best to
respond to the challenges such volatile capital inflows
present. As illustrated in Box 4.1 and discussed in
other research from the IMF, capital flow management measures and foreign exchange intervention can
be useful in moderating the volatility of capital flows

and exchange rates in less resilient emerging market
economies in some circumstances.22 But policymakers
are not limited to these tools.
Policymakers can implement important reforms that
can help increase the resilience of their economies to
swings in gross inflows by encouraging stabilizing financial adjustment. Such adjustment means that swings in
gross inflows need not necessarily translate into disruptive fluctuations in the current account. Rather, when
gross capital inflows increase, residents will tend to offset
these flows by accumulating foreign assets that are later
repatriated when foreign inflows decline. And this chapter documents how countries with such greater financial
adjustment better withstood the sharp contraction in
gross inflows during the global financial crisis, experiencing a smaller fall in both GDP and consumption.
The particular reforms and characteristics that
appear to have supported stabilizing financial adjustment are highlighted in the empirical analysis and
case studies. A first important characteristic is the
strength of their institutional frameworks.23 In
particular, resilient emerging market economies have
more credible fiscal and monetary policies that are
used countercyclically. In this regard, it is important to
note that countercyclical fiscal measures should not be
used only in downturns, when some emerging market
economies may actually be limited in their ability to
finance a fiscal stimulus. It is equally important to
tighten fiscal policy during episodes of strong growth,
when capital inflows tend to contribute to overheating.
In fact, investing such fiscal savings abroad, as Chile
does through its sovereign wealth fund, can help buffer
gross inflow surges. Furthermore, as the case of the
Czech Republic demonstrates, prudent fiscal and monetary management can reduce the interest rate differential with the rest of the world and limit the incentives
for both hot money inflows and the domestic accumulation of foreign currency debt.
Second, resilient emerging market economies are
characterized by improved prudential regulation and
22As discussed in IMF (2012), pp. 35–36, “a key role needs to be
played by macroeconomic policies, including monetary, fiscal, and
exchange rate management, as well as by sound financial supervision and regulation and strong institutions. CFMs [capital flow
management measures] should not be used to substitute for or avoid
warranted macroeconomic adjustment.”
23The benefits of such strong frameworks are not limited to dealing with capital flows. IMF (2012) finds that recent improvements
in policies and institutional frameworks are associated with significant improvements in the general resilience of emerging market and
developing economies over the past decade.

128

supervision that limit excessive risk taking without
preventing the development of the domestic financial
sector. Third, stabilizing financial adjustment obviously
requires a relatively open capital account that allows
residents to both accumulate a stock of gross foreign
assets and efficiently move money in and out of the
country as necessary to buffer gross inflows. Furthermore, as Figure 4.3 suggests and the case of Chile
demonstrates, more flexible exchange rate regimes have
encouraged such buffering behavior in recent years.
A heavily managed exchange rate, on the other hand,
may undermine residents’ incentives to reduce outflows
during sudden stops, because an anticipated depreciation creates very strong incentives to send assets
offshore, thereby exacerbating capital flow volatility.
A caveat is that these findings reflect the responses to
global shocks that have been very much in evidence
over recent years. Domestic shocks may encourage different capital flow behavior.24
The case studies also provide important insights
about the appropriate sequencing of reforms. Reforms
to strengthen the domestic financial system typically
preceded other policy measures, while steps toward
greater openness to capital flows and exchange rate
flexibility came toward the end. For example, the
experience of the Czech Republic in the late 1990s
demonstrates that merely opening up the financial
account without other policies in place does not lead
to resilience. Rather, the case studies suggest that countries that improved prudential policies and adopted
credible monetary and fiscal policy regimes (such as
inflation targeting in the cases of Chile and the Czech
Republic) were then able to relax remaining restrictions on capital flows or the exchange rate and thereby
benefit from the stabilizing role played by fluctuations
in the exchange rate and capital outflows. The role
of reserves in contributing to this adjustment is less
clear. While they are used in Malaysia, there is also a
growing stock of private gross assets that played a more
significant role in stabilizing net flows in recent years.
At any rate, both Chile and the Czech Republic (and
advanced economies more generally) demonstrate that
a large stock of official reserves is not a prerequisite for
net capital flow stability.
A possible concern with these findings is that the
ability to improve institutions and run countercyclical
24 Although the evidence from Broner and others (2013) suggests
that, even in the case of domestic shocks, residents may still act to
buffer changes in gross capital inflows.

macroeconomic policies may be a benefit of resilience, rather than a direct cause of it. The case studies,
however, suggest that this is not the case. A common
element in all three cases is that neither increased resilience to capital flows nor benign economic conditions
were a precondition for reform. Instead, policy reforms
tended to be implemented in response to a crisis or

recession. That is, these policies can be, and have been,
implemented by less resilient economies at times of
weakness as a way to build their resilience.
In sum, the countries that have demonstrated greater
resilience to the yin of capital inflows are those that have
encouraged the balancing yang of capital outflows.

Box 4.1. Simulating Vulnerability to International capital Market conditions
Sudden changes in international capital market
conditions can create significant problems for domestic
banking systems, capital formation, and growth. This
box presents simulated scenarios of such boom-bust
credit cycles and studies how outcomes depend on
the composition of bank balance sheets and the policy
environment. Three scenarios are considered: (1) a
baseline in which all lending is in domestic currency;
(2) an alternative in which half of all lending is in
foreign currency; and (3) a variation of (2) in which
half of all lending is in foreign currency and controls
on capital outflows are implemented at the beginning
of the bust phase of the credit cycle.
The simulations are based on the model of small
open economies outlined in Benes, Kumhof, and
Laxton (2013). In this model, bank loans are essential
because they create the purchasing power needed by
households and firms for all their economic transactions. In the model, changes in lending interest rates
are asymmetrically large following negative shocks,
because borrowers’ loan-to-value ratios rise into highrisk territory and banks’ capital adequacy ratios move
closer to their legal minimum.
All simulations consist of two episodes characterized
by the behavior of the interest rate risk premium faced
by the country. During an initial three-year boom
period, which is misperceived as being permanent,
the risk premium drops by 200 basis points. At the
reversal, the risk premium suddenly increases by 300
basis points, followed by a gradual decline back to its
original level.
The initial shock reduces domestic real interest rates
and appreciates the currency (Figure 4.1.1, panel 3).
This increases income and wealth, and because wealth
represents collateral to banks, domestic lending and
therefore creation of purchasing power increases by
about 4 to 5 percent, depending on the scenario. The
effects are much stronger in the scenario in which
half of all lending is in foreign currency, because the
domestic currency value of existing debt declines on
impact. Real GDP expands by almost 2.5 percent by
the end of year three in all scenarios. Inflation declines
due to the currency appreciation, despite the additional demand. The trade balance deteriorates by 1 to
2 percent of GDP depending on the scenario, leading

Kumhof.

to the accumulation of significant claims on the
domestic economy by foreigners.
The foreign capital inflow is therefore a consequence
of increased domestic bank lending, not vice versa.
This must invariably be true, because foreign residents
cannot deposit their goods in a domestic bank in
exchange for a deposit, and domestic residents can
purchase additional imports only if banks have first
created the necessary additional purchasing power
for them. The fact that the boom is not created by a
capital inflow, but by increased domestic lending in
response to lower interest rates and lower perceived
risk, is critical for formulating policy advice on how to
deal with such episodes.

Box 4.1 (continued)
The reversal of the boom leaves banks exposed to a
loan book that is much riskier than anticipated when
it was first made. Banks respond by reducing lending
and raising lending spreads, which reduces purchasing
power throughout the economy. This, together with
the negative income and wealth effects of the reversal,
reduces domestic demand. The exchange rate depreciates, which helps to unwind the previously accumulated foreign debt positions.
In the baseline scenario without foreign currency
lending (Figure 4.1.1, blue line), the contraction is
moderate and gradual. The riskiness of bank loans
remains satisfactory, as seen in the very modest
changes in asset prices, lending spreads, and bank capital buffers. GDP declines smoothly without negative
output gaps, and inflation quickly returns to its target,
facilitated by the depreciating exchange rate.
In the alternative scenario with 50 percent foreign
currency lending (Figure 4.1.1, red line), the contraction is large and sudden. The exchange rate depreciation sharply increases the local currency values of
domestic agents’ liabilities. This reduces borrowers’

wealth and increases banks’ loan losses and lending
risk. Lending contracts faster than in the baseline, and
spreads increase steeply, by about 450 basis points. The
lending rate therefore increases, despite further cuts to
the policy rate. Domestic demand contracts by over
6 percent in two quarters, GDP by over 4 percent,
and real incomes and asset prices decline by far more
than in the baseline. Because this makes lending
even riskier, a vicious cycle ensues that keeps spreads
elevated for several years. Because of the strong real
contraction, inflation remains subdued for a number
of years, despite the sizable depreciation.
In the alternative scenario with a postreversal
imposition of capital controls (Figure 4.1.1, yellow
line), the real contraction is significantly less deep.
Capital controls reduce the interest rate premium,
which lowers the increase in lending spreads by about
200 basis points and limits the size of the exchange
rate depreciation. Because borrowers benefit, banks’
lending losses are significantly reduced, lending terms
tighten less severely, and real GDP contracts by almost
50 percent less than in the baseline.

IMF executIve BoArd dIscussIon oF the outlook,
septeMBer 2013

The following remarks were made by the Acting Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the World
Economic Outlook, Global Financial Stability Report, and Fiscal Monitor on September 23, 2013.

E

xecutive Directors broadly shared the staff’s
assessment of the state of the global economy
and financial markets, risks, and key policy
recommendations. They observed, in particular,
that global growth remains subdued and that uncertainty
and downside risks dominate the outlook. The recovery
in the United States and Japan has gained ground and
the euro area is pulling out of recession, while growth in
many emerging market economies has slowed. Directors
underscored that policymakers in all economies have a
shared responsibility to sustain balanced growth while
continuing to build resilience.
Directors stressed that changing growth dynamics,
combined with the anticipation of the start of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, pose new policy
challenges, particularly in emerging market economies.
Many of these countries have recently experienced
increased capital outflows, currency depreciation, lower
equity prices, and higher sovereign risk premiums. In
addition, external financial conditions have generally
tightened and the fiscal space has narrowed, while risks
of interest rate and exchange rate overshooting have
increased. In this regard, Directors took note of the
U.S. Federal Reserve’s guidance that monetary policy
normalization will occur in the context of stronger
U.S. growth and employment that, in turn, should be
beneficial for global growth.
Directors noted that global growth is expected
to improve modestly in the near term. Activity in
advanced economies is accelerating as fiscal consolidation eases and monetary conditions remain accommodative. In the euro area, policy actions have reduced
tail risks and stabilized financial markets, but growth
remains fragile, given persistently high unemployment,
financial fragmentation, and weak credit developments. Growth in emerging market economies, which
continues to account for the bulk of global growth,
remains driven by solid consumption and, in a historical perspective, still supportive fiscal, monetary,

and financial conditions. However, lingering supply
side bottlenecks in infrastructure, labor markets, and
regulatory and financial systems could have lowered
potential output for many of these economies. Growth
in low-income countries remains robust, supported by
enhanced policy frameworks, although less favorable
commodity prices and external financing may weaken
their fiscal positions.
Directors expressed concern that multiple vulnerabilities may have raised the risk of a prolonged period
of lower global growth. They noted that important
legacy risks are still present in advanced economies.
These include unfinished financial sector reforms in
the euro area, impaired monetary policy transmission
and corporate debt overhang in some of its economies,
and high levels of government debt and related fiscal
and financial risks in many other advanced economies,
including Japan and the United States.
Directors noted that downside risks to growth
in emerging market economies have become more
prominent, reflecting risks of further asset repricing
in anticipation of the normalization of U.S. monetary
policy as well as rising domestic vulnerabilities in some
countries. Fiscal vulnerabilities are increasing as policy
buffers are used, potential output declines, and public
contingent liabilities build up. Nevertheless, Directors noted that, in general, these economies are in a
stronger position now than in the past to withstand
the looming turbulence, with improved fundamentals
and policy frameworks, more flexible exchange rates,
and higher international reserve buffers.
Directors underscored the need for credible policy
actions to forestall downside risks and address old challenges decisively. In the euro area, priorities continue
to be—building on recent progress—bank balance
sheet repair, a comprehensive assessment of, and
measures to reduce, corporate debt overhang in some
countries, and completion of a full-fledged banking
union, with an effective common backstop. Directors

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

underscored that, while the fiscal adjustment path is
currently appropriate for the euro area as a whole,
the speed and composition of fiscal consolidation in
each country would need to take into account cyclical
considerations, debt levels, and financing conditions.
In Japan and the United States, Directors emphasized the importance of carefully pacing fiscal adjustment and placing government debt on a sustainable
track, anchored in a medium-term plan that includes
durable tax and entitlement reforms. Promptly lifting the debt ceiling is also a priority in the United
States. More generally, Directors agreed that there is
scope for broader tax reforms to improve efficiency
and fairness, and for strengthening cooperation on
international taxation. In most advanced economies, a
sustained focus on structural reforms over the medium
term remains crucial to reduce rigidities in labor and
product markets, enhance competitiveness, and boost
potential output.
Directors agreed that monetary conditions need to
stay accommodative in major advanced economies. In
the United States, it is important that monetary policy
respond gradually to changing prospects for growth,
inflation, and financial stability, accompanied by clear,
well-timed communication about the policy direction
and strategy. Directors also emphasized the need to
address structural liquidity weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the shadow banking system, which would help
reduce financial market volatility during the transition
to higher interest rates.
Directors noted that policy priorities and options
differ across emerging market economies, depending
on the degree of economic slack, the nature of vulnerabilities, and available policy buffers. They pointed
to the role of exchange rates as a shock absorber and
the need to guard against excessive volatility, while
macroprudential measures should be used to mitigate
financial stability risks. A few Directors took the view
that exploring policy options beyond the traditional

134

toolkit could be useful, anchored in credible monetary
policy frameworks. Directors emphasized the importance of prudential oversight and regulation to contain
any further buildup of foreign currency mismatches
and risks stemming from shadow banking activities in
key emerging markets.
Directors noted that, in emerging market economies where inflation is low and expectations are firmly
anchored, monetary policy should be used as the first
line of defense if downside risks materialize. They
stressed the need to rebuild fiscal buffers, unless growth
deteriorates significantly. In countries with high debt,
fiscal consolidation remains a high priority, taking
advantage of still favorable cyclical conditions. Further
structural reforms are also essential to boost potential
growth, including improving infrastructure, productivity, and the investment climate. Low-income countries
need to step up revenue mobilization, including from
natural resources, to rebuild their fiscal buffers and
support higher priority public spending.
Directors concurred that a further narrowing of
global imbalances would help maintain more sustainable and stable global growth. They observed that the
recent exchange rate depreciations have facilitated
some rebalancing in many deficit emerging market
economies. However, further efforts are needed to
increase national saving and boost productivity and
competitiveness in many countries, including Brazil,
India, Russia, and South Africa. For the United States,
gradual progress on fiscal deficit reduction through a
comprehensive plan for medium-term consolidation
would help support global rebalancing. In surplus
countries, priorities include measures to promote more
consumption-based growth in China and structural
reforms and medium-term fiscal consolidation in
Japan. Directors were of the view that further external rebalancing within the euro area requires deeper
structural reforms, including sustained efforts to raise
investment in Germany.

StatiStical appendix

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises
six sections: Assumptions, What’s New,
Data and Conventions, Classification of
Countries, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical
Tables.
The assumptions underlying the estimates and
projections for 2013–14 and the medium-term scenario for 2015–18 are summarized in the first section.
The second section presents a brief description of the
changes to the database and statistical tables since
the April 2013 issue of the World Economic Outlook.
The third section provides a general description of the
data and the conventions used for calculating country
group composites. The classification of countries in
the various groups presented in the World Economic
Outlook is summarized in the fourth section. The fifth
section provides information on methods and reporting standards for the member countries’ national
account and government finance indicators included
in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical
tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included here; Statistical Appendix B is available online.) Data in these
tables have been compiled on the basis of information
available through September 23, 2013. The figures
for 2013 and beyond are shown with the same degree
of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree
of accuracy is not to be inferred.

assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels during the period between July 29 and August
26, 2013. For 2013 and 2014, these assumptions
imply average U.S. dollar/SDR conversion rates of
1.514 and 1.527, U.S. dollar/euro conversion rates of
1.326 and 1.349, and yen/U.S. dollar conversion rates
of 96.5 and 95.6, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $104.49
a barrel in 2013 and $101.35 a barrel in 2014.

Established policies of national authorities are
assumed to be maintained. The more specific policy
assumptions underlying the projections for selected
economies are described in Box A1.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on six-month
U.S. dollar deposits will average 0.4 percent in 2013
and 0.6 percent in 2014, that three-month euro deposits will average 0.2 percent in 2013 and 0.5 percent in
2014, and that six-month yen deposits will average 0.2
percent in 2013 and 0.3 percent in 2014.
With respect to introduction of the euro, on December 31, 1998, the Council of the European Union
decided that, effective January 1, 1999, the irrevocably
fixed conversion rates between the euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are as
follows.

world economic outlook: transitions and tensions

What’s new

data and conventions

Although national statistical agencies are the ultimate
providers of historical data and definitions, international
organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with
the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the
compilation of national statistics, including analytical
frameworks, concepts, definitions, classifications, and
valuation procedures used in the production of economic statistics. The WEO database reflects information
from both national source agencies and international
organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data presented in
the WEO conform broadly to the 1993 version of the
System of National Accounts (SNA). The IMF’s sector statistical standards—the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition
(BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM 2000), and the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)—have been or are being
aligned with the 2008 SNA.1 These standards reflect
the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external positions, financial sector stability, and public sector fiscal
positions. The process of adapting country data to the
new standards begins in earnest when the manuals are
released. However, full concordance with the manuals is
ultimately dependent on the provision by national statistical compilers of revised country data; hence, the WEO
estimates are only partially adapted to these manuals.
Nonetheless, for many countries the impact of conversion to the updated standards will be small on major
balances and aggregates. Many other countries have
partially adopted the latest standards and will continue
implementation over a period of years.
Consistent with the recommendations of the 1993
SNA, several countries have phased out their traditional fixed-base-year method of calculating real macroeconomic variable levels and growth by switching
to a chain-weighted method of computing aggregate
growth. The chain-weighted method frequently updates
the weights of price and volume indicators. It allows
countries to measure GDP growth more accurately by
reducing or eliminating the downward biases in volume
series built on index numbers that average volume
components using weights from a year in the moder-

Data and projections for 189 economies form the statistical basis of the World Economic Outlook (the WEO
database). The data are maintained jointly by the IMF’s
Research Department and regional departments, with
the latter regularly updating country projections based
on consistent global assumptions.

1Many other countries are implementing the 2008 SNA and will
release national accounts data based on the new standard in 2014.
A few countries use versions of the SNA older than 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6. Although the conceptual
standards use the BPM6, the WEO will continue to use the BPM5
presentation until a representative number of countries have moved
their balance of payments accounts into the BPM6 framework.

• On July 31, 2013, the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis released the Comprehensive Revision
of the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA). The revision includes improvements in
methodology and data sources as well as significant
changes in definitions and classifications. With this
update, the accounts more accurately portray the
evolution of the economy. Most notably, expenditures on research and development activities and
for the creation of entertainment, literary, and
artistic originals are now treated as capital expenditures. Furthermore, the treatment of definedbenefit pension plans is switched from a cash basis
to an accrual basis. The revisions increase the level
of GDP by 3.4 percent and boost the personal
savings rate. The revised data also show that the
Great Recession was shallower and the recovery was
stronger through the first half of 2012, but also
that cyclical weakness was greater during the past
year. Overall, the revision does not significantly
change the IMF staff’s broad view on the U.S.
economic outlook.
• Starting with the July 2013 WEO Update, India’s data
and forecasts are presented on a fiscal year basis.
• On July 1, 2013, Croatia became the 28th member
state of the European Union.
• Projections for Cyprus, which were excluded from
the April 2013 WEO due to the crisis, are once
again included.
• As in the April 2013 WEO, data for Syria are
excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain
political situation.
• Data for Palau are included in the Developing Asia
region.
• Zambia redenominated its currency by replacing 1,000
old Zambian kwacha notes with 1 new Zambian kwacha note. Local currency data for Zambia are expressed
in the new currency starting with the October 2013
WEO database.

ately distant past. Table F indicates which countries use
a chain-weighted method.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group except inflation and money growth,
for which geometric averages are used. The following
conventions apply.
• Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to U.S. dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years)
as a share of group GDP.
• Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a
share of total world or group GDP.3
• Composites for data relating to the domestic economy
for the euro area (17 member countries throughout the
entire period unless noted otherwise) are aggregates of
national source data using GDP weights. Annual data
are not adjusted for calendar-day effects. For data prior
to 1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
• Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual country data after conversion to U.S. dollars at the average
market exchange rates in the years indicated.
• Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
• Composites relating to external sector statistics are sums
of individual country data after conversion to U.S.
dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years
indicated for balance of payments data and at end-ofyear market exchange rates for debt denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars.
2Averages

for real GDP and its components, employment, GDP
per capita, inflation, factor productivity, trade, and commodity
prices, are calculated based on the compound annual rate of change,
except for the unemployment rate, which is based on the simple
arithmetic average.
3See Box A2 of the April 2004 World Economic Outlook for a
summary of the revised PPP-based weights and Annex IV of the
May 1993 World Economic Outlook. See also Anne-Marie Gulde
and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based
Weights for the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the
World Economic Outlook (Washington: International Monetary Fund,
December 1993), pp. 106–23.

• Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and
prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the U.S.
dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total
world or group exports or imports (in the preceding
year).
• Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed
if 90 percent or more of the share of group weights is
represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except for a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F, which
lists the reference periods for each country.

classification of countries
Summary of the country classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.4 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative
size (GDP valued by PPP, total exports of goods and
services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis.
Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea, and Montserrat are examples of countries that
are not IMF members, and their economies therefore
are not monitored by the IMF. Somalia is omitted
from the emerging market and developing economies
group composites because of data limitations.

Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom,
4As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

and Canada—constitute the subgroup of major
advanced economies often referred to as the Group of
Seven (G7). The members of the euro area are also
distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in
the tables for the euro area cover the current members for all years, even though the membership has
increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the World Economic Outlook.

emerging Market and developing economies
The group of emerging market and developing economies (154) includes all those that are not classified as
advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are central and eastern Europe (CEE,
sometimes also referred to as emerging Europe); Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); developing Asia,
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); Middle East,
North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP); and
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria. The analytical criteria reflect the composition of export earnings
and other income from abroad; a distinction between
net creditor and net debtor economies; and, for the net
debtors, financial criteria based on external financing
sources and experience with external debt servicing. The
detailed composition of emerging market and developing
economies in the regional and analytical groups is shown
in Tables D and E.
The analytical criterion by source of export earnings
distinguishes between categories: fuel (Standard Interna-

138

tional Trade Classification—SITC 3) and nonfuel and
then focuses on nonfuel primary products (SITCs 0, 1, 2,
4, and 68). Economies are categorized into one of these
groups when their main source of export earnings exceeds
50 percent of total exports on average between 2007 and
2011.
The financial criteria focus on net creditor economies,
net debtor economies, and heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCs). Economies are categorized as net debtors when
their current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest data available) to 2011 are negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis of
two additional financial criteria: official external financing
and experience with debt servicing.5 Net debtors are placed
in the official external financing category when 66 percent
or more of their total debt, on average between 2007 and
2011, was financed by official creditors.
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are or
have been considered by the IMF and the World Bank
for participation in their debt initiative known as the
HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external debt
burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level
in a reasonably short period of time.6 Many of these
countries have already benefited from debt relief and have
graduated from the initiative.

5During 2007–11, 39 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2007–11.
6See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and Sukwinder Singh, Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The Enhanced
HIPC Initiative, IMF Pamphlet Series No. 51 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

Box a1. economic policy assumptions Underlying the projections for Selected economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) are based on officially
announced budgets, adjusted for differences between
the national authorities and the IMF staff regarding
macroeconomic assumptions and projected fiscal outturns. The medium-term fiscal projections incorporate
policy measures that are judged likely to be implemented. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used
in some of the advanced economies follow. (See also
Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the Statistical
Appendix for data on fiscal net lending/borrowing and
structural balances.1)
Argentina: The 2012 estimates are based on actual
data on outturns and IMF staff estimates. For the
outer years, the fiscal balance is projected to remain
roughly at the current level.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on the 2013
Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Australian
Bureau of Statistics, and IMF staff projections.
Austria: Projections take into account the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework as well as associated further implementation needs and risks.
Belgium: IMF staff projections for 2013 and beyond
are based on unchanged policies.
Brazil: For 2013, the projections are based on the
budget approved in March 2013, subsequent revisions
to the budget (the last of which was in July 2013),
and fiscal outturns until July 2013. Projections for
2014 take into account the draft budget submitted in
1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a percent
of potential output. Structural balances are expressed as a percent
of potential output. The structural balance is the actual net
lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from
potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such
as asset and commodity prices and output composition effects.
Changes in the structural balance consequently include effects of
temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in
net lending/borrowing. The computations of structural balances
are based on IMF staff estimates of potential GDP and revenue
and expenditure elasticities. (See the October 1993 World Economic Outlook, Annex I.) Net debt is defined as gross debt minus
financial assets of the general government, which include assets
held by the social security insurance system. Estimates of the
output gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant
margins of uncertainty.

August 2013. In outer years, the IMF staff assumes
adherence to the announced primary target.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts in
the Economic Action Plan 2013 “Jobs, Growth, and
Long-Term Prosperity,” March 21, 2013 (the fiscal
year 2013/14 budget). The IMF staff makes some
adjustments to this forecast for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff forecast also
incorporates the most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s Canadian System of National Economic
Accounts, including federal, provincial, and territorial
budgetary outturns through the end of the second
quarter of 2013.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s
projections for GDP and copper prices.
China: The fiscal impulse is likely to be mildly
expansionary during 2013.
Denmark: Projections for 2012–14 are aligned with
the latest official budget estimates and the underlying economic projections, adjusted where appropriate
for the IMF staff’s macroeconomic assumptions. For
2015–18, the projections incorporate key features
of the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ 2013 Convergence Program submitted to
the European Union.
France: Projections for 2014 and beyond reflect the
authorities’ 2012–17 multiyear budget and the April
2013 stability plan, adjusted for fiscal packages and
differences in assumptions on macro and financial
variables, and revenue projections. The fiscal data for
2011 were revised following a May 15, 2013, revision
by the statistical institute of both national accounts
and fiscal accounts. Fiscal data for 2012 reflect the
preliminary outturn published by the statistical institute in May 2013. The underlying assumptions for
2013 remain unchanged as the 2013 budget has not
been revised, and thus there is no new fiscal measure
announced for 2013. However, projections for 2013
reflect discussion with the authorities on monthly
developments on spending and revenue.
Germany: The estimates for 2012 are preliminary estimates from the Federal Statistical Office of
Germany. The IMF staff’s projections for 2013 and
beyond reflect the authorities’ adopted core federal
government budget plan, adjusted for the differences
in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic framework and
assumptions about fiscal developments in state and
local governments, the social insurance system, and

special funds. The estimate of gross debt includes
portfolios of impaired assets and noncore business
transferred to institutions that are winding up as well
as other financial sector and EU support operations.
Greece: Fiscal projections for 2013 and the medium
term are consistent with the policies discussed between
the IMF staff and the authorities in the context of
the Extended Fund Facility. Public debt projections
assume an additional haircut (official sector involvement) to bring the debt ratio to 124 percent of GDP
by 2020.
Hong Kong SAR: Projections are based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal projections.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include IMF staff projections of the macroeconomic framework and of the
impact of recent legislative measures as well as fiscal
policy plans announced as of June 30, 2013.
India: Historical data are based on budgetary
execution data. Projections are based on available
information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with
adjustments for IMF staff assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to two years;
general government data are thus finalized well after
central government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding divestment and
license auction proceeds, net versus gross recording of
revenues in certain minor categories, and some public
sector lending.
Indonesia: IMF projections for 2013–18 are based
on a gradual increase in administrative fuel prices, the
introduction beginning in 2014 of new social protections, and moderate tax policy and administration
reforms.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the 2013
budget and the “Medium-Term Fiscal Statement”
(published in November 2012), which commits to
an €8.6 billion consolidation over 2013–15. It also
includes the estimated fiscal impact of the February
2013 promissory note transaction. The fiscal projections are adjusted for differences between the IMF
staff’s macroeconomic projections and those of the
Irish authorities.
Italy: Fiscal projections incorporate the government’s
announced fiscal policy, as outlined in the April 2013
update to the government’s “Economic and Financial
Document,” adjusted for different growth outlooks.
The 2013 deficit also incorporates the impact of
repealing the December property tax payment, a
measure which has been announced but not yet

funded. After 2014, the IMF staff projects a constant
structural balance in line with Italy’s fiscal rule, which
implies small corrective measures in some years, as
yet unidentified in the government’s “Economic and
Financial Document.”
Japan: The projections include fiscal measures
already announced by the government, including
consumption tax increases, earthquake reconstruction
spending, and the stimulus package. The mediumterm projections assume that expenditure and revenue
of the general government are adjusted in line with
current underlying demographic and economic trends
and recent fiscal stimulus.
Korea: Fiscal projections assume that fiscal policies
will be implemented in 2013 in line with the budget.
The medium-term projections assume that the government will continue with its consolidation plans and
balance the budget (excluding social security funds)
toward the end of the medium term.
Mexico: Fiscal projections for 2013 are broadly in
line with the approved budget; projections for 2014
onward assume compliance with the balanced budget
rule.
Netherlands: Fiscal projections for the period 2012–
18 are based on the authorities’ Bureau for Economic
Policy Analysis budget projections, after adjusting for
differences in macroeconomic assumptions.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2013 budget and on IMF staff estimates.
Portugal: Projections for 2013–14 reflect the
authorities’ commitments under the EU- and IMFsupported program; projections thereafter are based on
IMF staff estimates.
Russia: Projections for 2013–18 are based on the
oil-price-based fiscal price rule introduced in December 2012, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s revenue
forecast and for public spending already budgeted for
2013–15.
Saudi Arabia: The authorities base their budget on
a conservative assumption for oil prices with adjustments to expenditure allocations considered in the
event that revenues exceed budgeted amounts. IMF
staff projections of oil revenues are based on WEO
baseline oil prices. On the expenditure side, wage bill
estimates incorporate 13th-month pay awards every
three years in accordance with the lunar calendar;
capital spending estimates over the medium term are
in line with the authorities’ priorities established in the
National Development Plans.

Box a1. (continued)
Singapore: For fiscal year 2013/14, projections are
based on budget numbers. For the remainder of the
projection period, the IMF staff assumes unchanged
policies.
South Africa: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ 2013 budget review, released on February
27, 2013.
Spain: For 2013 and beyond, fiscal projections are
based on the measures specified in the Stability Program Update 2013–16, the revised fiscal policy recommendations by the European Council in June 2013,
and the 2013 budget, approved in December 2012.
Sweden: Fiscal projections are broadly in line with
the authorities’ projections based on the 2014 Budget
Bill. The impact of cyclical developments on the
fiscal accounts is calculated using the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development’s latest
semi-elasticity.
Switzerland: Projections for 2012–18 are based on
IMF staff calculations, which incorporate measures to
restore balance in the federal accounts and strengthen
social security finances.
Turkey: Fiscal projections assume that both current
and capital spending will be in line with the authorities’ 2013–15 Medium-Term Program based on current trends and policies.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based
on the U.K. Treasury’s 2013 budget, published in
March 2013. The authorities’ revenue projections are
adjusted for differences between IMF staff forecasts of
macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth). In
addition, IMF staff projections exclude the temporary
effects of financial sector interventions and the effect
on public sector net investment during 2012–13 of
transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan
to the public sector. Real government consumption
and investment are part of the real GDP path, which,
according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the
same as projected by the U.K. Office for Budget
Responsibility. Transfers of profits from the Bank
of England’s Asset Purchases Facility affect general
government net interest payments. The timing of these
payments can create differences between fiscal year
primary balances published by the authorities and
calendar year balances shown in the WEO.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the May
2013 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for
the IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions.

150

This baseline incorporates the provisions of the American Taxpayer Relief Act, signed into law on January 2,
2013. The key near-term policy assumptions include
replacement of automatic spending cuts (“sequester”)
with back-loaded consolidation measures in fiscal year
2015 and onward. (The sequester is assumed to be
in full effect from March 1, 2013, to September 30,
2014.) Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes
that Congress will continue to make regular adjustments to Medicare payments (“DocFix”) and will
extend certain traditional programs (such as the research
and development tax credit). The fiscal projections
are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts of key
macroeconomic and financial variables and different
accounting treatment of financial sector support and are
converted to a general government basis.

Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country. In most
cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance over
the business cycle: official interest rates will increase
when economic indicators suggest that inflation
will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they will
decrease when indicators suggest that inflation will
not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output growth is below its potential rate, and that the
margin of slack in the economy is significant. On this
basis, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) on
six-month U.S. dollar deposits is assumed to average 0.4 percent in 2013 and 0.6 percent in 2014 (see
Table 1.1 in Chapter 1). The rate on three-month
euro deposits is assumed to average 0.2 percent
in 2013 and 0.5 percent in 2014. The interest rate on
six-month Japanese yen deposits is assumed to average
0.2 percent in 2013 and 0.3 percent in 2014.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent
with gradual convergence of inflation toward the
middle of the target range over the relevant horizon.
Canada: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
China: The IMF staff assumes M2 growth of 13
percent in 2013, consistent with the authorities’ target.
Monetary policy is likely to remain steady.
Denmark: The monetary policy is to maintain the
peg to the euro.

StatiStical appendix

Box a1. (concluded)
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are in line with market
expectations.
Hong Kong SAR: The IMF staff assumes that the
Currency Board system remains intact and projects
broad money growth based on the past relationship
with nominal GDP.
India: The policy (interest) rate assumption is based
on the average of market forecasts.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations and reduction of inflation by
2014 to within the central bank’s targeted band.
Japan: The current monetary policy conditions are
maintained for the projection period, and no further
tightening or loosening is assumed.
Korea: Monetary policy assumptions incorporate
maintenance of the current accommodative stance
over the course of 2013.
Mexico: Monetary assumptions are consistent with
attaining the inflation target.
Russia: Monetary projections assume unchanged
policies, as indicated in recent statements by the
Central Bank of Russia. Specifically, policy rates are
assumed to remain at the current levels, with limited
interventions in the foreign exchange markets.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are based
on the continuation of the exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar.

Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in line
with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary projections are consistent
with South Africa’s 3 to 6 percent inflation target
range.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: Monetary policy variables reflect
historical data from the national authorities and the
market.
Turkey: Broad money and the long-term bond yield
are based on IMF staff projections. The short-term
deposit rate is projected to evolve with a constant
spread against the interest rate of a similar U.S.
instrument.
United Kingdom: On monetary policy, the projections assume no changes to the policy rate or the level
of asset purchases through 2014.
United States: Given the outlook for sluggish
growth and inflation, the IMF staff expects the federal
funds target to remain near zero until late 2014.
This assumption is consistent with the Federal Open
Market Committee’s statement following its January
2013 meeting (and reaffirmed in subsequent meetings) that economic conditions are likely to warrant
an exceptionally low federal funds rate at least through
late 2014.

1Data

for some countries refer to real net material product (NMP) or are estimates based on NMP. The figures should be interpreted only as indicative of broad orders of
magnitude because reliable, comparable data are not generally available. In particular, the growth of output of new private enterprises of the informal economy is not fully
reflected in the recent figures.
2Georgia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
3Moldova projections are based on data available for the first quarter of 2013.
4In this table only, the data for Timor-Leste are based on non-oil GDP.
5The data for Argentina are officially reported data. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address
the quality of the official GDP data. Alternative data sources have shown significantly lower real growth than the official data since 2008. In this context, the IMF is also using
alternative estimates of GDP growth for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.
6Iran’s real GDP growth for 2012 and beyond has not been significantly updated from the April 2013 WEO in light of the pending publication of national accounts by the central
bank and the new authorities’ plans.
7Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
8Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
9The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of
U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities’ estimates. Real GDP is in constant 2009 prices.

in consumer prices are shown as annual averages.
year-over-year changes and for several countries, on quarterly basis.
3For many countries, inflation for the earlier years is measured on the basis of a retail price index. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation data with broader and more up-to-date
coverage are typically used for more recent years.
4Georgia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
5Moldova projections are based on data available for the first quarter of 2013.
6The data for Argentina are officially reported data. The IMF has, however, issued a declaration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the
quality of the official CPI-GBA data. Alternative data sources have shown considerably higher inflation rates than the official data since 2007. In this context, the IMF is also
using alternative estimates of CPI inflation for the surveillance of macroeconomic developments in Argentina.
7Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
8Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
9The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of
U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities’ estimates.

1Georgia,

which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
projections are based on data available for the first quarter of 2013.
3Calculations are based on Argentina’s official GDP data. See footnote to Table A4.
4Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9. Data for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
5Data for Syria are excluded for 2011 onward due to the uncertain political situation.
6The Zimbabwe dollar ceased circulating in early 2009. Data are based on IMF staff estimates of price and exchange rate developments in U.S. dollars. IMF staff estimates of
U.S. dollar values may differ from authorities’ estimates.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the
sum of the U.S. dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, where
the composites were weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. For many countries, the estimates of national savings are built up
from national accounts data on gross domestic investment and from balance-of-payments-based data on net foreign investment. The latter, which is equivalent to the current
account balance, comprises three components: current transfers, net factor income, and the resource balance. The mixing of data sources, which is dictated by availability,
implies that the estimates for national savings that are derived incorporate the statistical discrepancies. Furthermore, errors, omissions, and asymmetries in balance of
payments statistics affect the estimates for net lending; at the global level, net lending, which in theory would be zero, equals the world current account discrepancy. Despite
these statistical shortcomings, flow of funds estimates, such as those presented in these tables, provide a useful framework for analyzing development in savings and
investment, both over time and across regions and countries.
1Calculated from the data of individual Euro Area countries.
2Georgia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.

Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons
and Implications

The Global Financial Stability
Report provides expert
and up-to-date analysis of
global capital ﬂows that
play a critical role in world
economic growth and
ﬁnancial stability.

Energy subsidies have wide-ranging
economic consequences. This book
provides the most comprehensive
estimates of energy subsidies
currently available for 176 countries.
It also presents an analysis of “how to
do” energy subsidy reform, drawing
on insights from 22 country case
studies undertaken by the IMF staﬀ
and analyses carried out by other institutions.

Fiscal Monitor
The Fiscal Monitor, published twice a year, surveys
and analyzes developments in public
ﬁnance, updates medium-term ﬁscal
projections, and assesses policies to
put public ﬁnances on a sustainable
footing. The Monitor’s projections are
based on the same database used for
the World Economic Outlook.

China’s Economy in
Transition: From External to
Internal Rebalancing
This volume looks at various aspects of
the rebalancing under way in China. It
focuses on three themes: the reasons
for the decline in China’s current
account and signs of growing domestic
imbalances; the implications for
trading partners; and policy lessons to
achieve a stable, sustainable, and more inclusive
transformation of China’s growth model.

1On a national income accounts basis except as indicated in footnotes. See Box A1 for a summary of the policy assumptions underlying the projections.
2Adjusted for valuation changes of the foreign exchange stabilization fund.
3Based on ESA95 methodology, according to which swap income is not included.
4The general government balances between 2009 and 2014 reflect the impact of banking support. The fiscal balance estimates excluding these measures are
–11.3 percent of GDP for 2009, –10.6 percent of GDP for 2010, –8.9 percent of GDP for 2011, –7.6 percent of GDP for 2012, –7.5 percent of GDP for 2013
(including exchequer outlays for guarantees paid out under the ELG scheme in the context of the liquidation of IBRC), and –4.9 percent of GDP for 2014.
5Data cover the central government and social security funds and are on a cash basis. The 2011 fiscal balance includes 0.7 percent of GDP in recapitalization
costs of the largest state bank, which were treated as state aid.
6Data cover the consolidated central government, including social security funds but excluding privatization.
7Data exclude total social contributions and payments, not only social security.
8Data are on a budget basis.
9Data are on an administrative basis and exclude social security transactions.
10Data are on a national income basis and exclude social security transactions.
11In this table, Other Advanced Economies means advanced economies excluding the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States)
and Euro Area countries.

1On a national income accounts basis. The structural balance position is defined as actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output from potential
output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and output composition effects. Because of the margin of uncertainty that
attaches to estimates of cyclical gaps and to tax and expenditure elasticities with respect to national income, indicators of structural budget positions should be
interpreted as broad orders of magnitude. Moreover, it is important to note that changes in structural balances are not necessarily attributable to policy changes
but may reflect the built-in momentum of existing expenditure programs. In the period beyond that for which specific consolidation programs exist, it is assumed
that the structural deficit remains unchanged.
2Excludes sizable one-time receipts from the sale of assets, including licenses.
3Excludes one-time measures based on authorities’ data and, in the absence of the latter, receipts from the sale of assets.
4In this table, Other Advanced Economies means advanced economies excluding the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States)
and Euro Area countries.
5Excludes oil and income on the Government Pension Fund-Global.

capital transfers including debt forgiveness and acquisition/disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets.
3Private financial flows comprise direct investment, portfolio investment, and other long- and short-term investment flows. Because of limitations on the data coverage
for net official flows, the residually derived data for net private flows may include some official flows.
4As defined in the World Economic Outlook (see footnote 5). It should be noted that there is no generally accepted standard definition of external financing.
5Defined as the sum, with opposite sign, of the goods and services balance, net income and current transfers, direct investment abroad, change in reserve assets, net
acquisition of other assets (such as recorded private portfolio assets, export credit, and the collateral for debt-reduction operations), and net errors and omissions. Thus,
net external financing, according to the definition adopted in the World Economic Outlook, measures the total amount required to finance the current account, direct
investment outflows, net reserve transactions (often at the discretion of the monetary authorities), net acquisition of nonreserve external assets, and net transactions
underlying the errors and omissions (not infrequently reflecting capital flight).
6Including other transactions on the capital account.
7Debt-creating foreign direct investment liabilities are not included.
8Net disbursement of long- and short-term credits, including exceptional financing, by both official and private creditors.
9Changes in liabilities.
10Credit and loans from the IMF can be found at www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extrep1.aspx.
11This is often referred to as the resource balance and, with opposite sign, the net resource transfer.
12Net external financing plus amortization due to external debt.
13Net external borrowing plus amortization due to external debt.

1Georgia,

which is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, is included in this group for reasons of geography and similarity in economic structure.
2Apart from interest, debt service for a particular year includes amortization of short-term debt on an original maturity basis outstanding at the end of the previous
year, plus the portion of long-term debt outstanding at the end of the previous year maturing during the current year. The projections incorporate the impact of
exceptional financing items.
3Total debt at the end of the year in percent of exports of goods and services in the year indicated.
