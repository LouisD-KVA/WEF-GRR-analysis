6 The COVID-19 scenario projects a decrease in
global hunger to around 670 million in 2030, far from

which the pandemic had not occurred

13 Inequality analyses using the latest available data
per country (2015 to 2021) indicate that globally,
stunted children under five years of age are more
likely to be residing in rural settings, in poorer
households, with mothers who received no formal
education, and to be male while obesity among
women is most common in urban settings and
wealthier households

breastfeeding among infants under six months of age
(37.1 to 43.8 percent) and stunting among children
under five years of age (26.2 to 22.0 percent) have
notably improved since 2012, yet even these
indicators will require accelerated progress to meet
the 2030 targets

FOREWORD
prospects for 2022 have been revised downward
significantly; hence, more limited financial
resources are available to invest in agrifood
systems. Public-private partnerships will be
extremely important for investments in agrifood
systems. Robust governance will also be important
to ensure that such partnerships ultimately benefit
communities and people in greatest need, not
powerful industry players.

The challenges to ending hunger, food insecurity
and all forms of malnutrition keep growing.
The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted
the fragilities in our agrifood systems and the
inequalities in our societies, driving further
increases in world hunger and severe food
insecurity. Despite global progress, trends in child
undernutrition – including stunting and wasting,
deficiencies in essential micronutrients and
overweight and obesity in children, continue to be
of great concern. Further, maternal anaemia and
obesity among adults continue to be alarming.

This report shows that governments can invest
in agrifood systems equitably and sustainably,
even with the same level of public resources.
Governments’ support to food and agriculture
accounts for almost USD 630 billion per year
globally. However, a significant proportion of this
support distorts market prices, is environmentally
destructive, and hurts small-scale producers
and Indigenous Peoples, while failing to deliver
healthy diets to children and others who need
them the most.

The most recent evidence available suggests that
the number of people unable to afford a healthy
diet around the world rose by 112 million to
almost 3.1 billion, reflecting the impacts of rising
consumer food prices during the pandemic.
This number could even be greater once data are
available to account for income losses in 2020.
The ongoing war in Ukraine is disrupting supply
chains and further affecting prices of grain,
fertilizer and energy. In the first half of 2022, this
resulted in further food price increases. At the
same time, more frequent and severe extreme
climate events are disrupting supply chains,
especially in low-income countries.

Food-importing countries have often provided
stronger policy support, especially for cereals,
with the aim of shielding their farming sector from
international competition. In doing so, they may
have been disproportionately fostering production
of cereals relative to production of pulses, seeds,
fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods.
These policies have contributed to food security
in terms of sufficient quantity of calories, but they
are not effective in improving nutrition and health
outcomes, including among children.

Looking forward, the gains we made in reducing
the prevalence of child stunting by one-third in the
previous two decades – translating into 55 million
fewer children with stunting – are under threat
by the triple crises of climate, conflict and the
COVID-19 pandemic. Without intensified efforts,
the number of children with wasting will only
increase.

The evidence suggests that if governments
repurpose the resources to prioritize food
consumers, and to incentivize sustainable
production, supply and consumption of nutritious
foods, they will help make healthy diets less costly
and more affordable for all.

This report repeatedly highlights the
intensification of these major drivers of food
insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate
extremes and economic shocks, combined with
growing inequalities. The issue at stake is not
whether adversities will continue to occur or
not, but how we must take bolder action to build
resilience against future shocks.

Governments must take this important
transformational step, but the multilateral
architecture under the United Nations Decade
of Action on Nutrition must support it. As well,
the repurposing of trade measures and fiscal
subsidies will have to consider countries’
commitments and flexibilities under the rules of
the World Trade Organization.

While last year’s report highlighted the pathways
to transform agrifood systems, the reality is that it
is easier said than done. Global economic growth
| vi |

In all contexts, reforms to repurpose support to
food and agriculture must also be accompanied
by policies that promote shifts in consumer
behaviours along with social protection policies
to mitigate unintended consequences of reforms
for vulnerable populations. Finally, these reforms
must be multisectoral, encompassing health,
environment, transport and energy policies.

This evidence-based report builds on the
momentum of last year’s United Nations Food
Systems Summit and the Tokyo Nutrition for
Growth Summit, as well as the expected outcomes
from the COP26 negotiations for building climate
resilience for food security and nutrition.
We recognize that countries with lower incomes
will have scarce public resources and need
international development finance support.
These are countries where agriculture is key to the
economy, jobs and rural livelihoods, and where
millions of people are hungry, food insecure, or
malnourished. We are committed to working with
these countries to find avenues for increasing the
provision of public services that supports agrifood
systems’ actors collectively, with the involvement
of local institutions and civil society, while forging
public-private partnerships.

Our organizations stand firmly committed
and ready to support governments and bring
additional allies to achieve such policy coherence
at the global and national levels. Everyone has a
right to access safe nutritious foods and affordable
healthy diets. Investing in healthy and sustainable
agrifood systems is an investment in the future,
and in future generations.

METHODOLOGY
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022 has been prepared by the FAO Agrifood Economics
Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the Economic and Social Development Stream and
a team of technical experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
A senior advisory team consisting of designated senior managers of the five UN publishing partners
guided the production of the report. Led by FAO, this team decided on the outline of the report and
defined its thematic focus. Further, it gave oversight to the technical writing team composed of experts
from each of the five co-publishing agencies. Background technical papers were prepared to support the
research and data analysis undertaken by the members of the writing team.
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs, including an annotated outline, first draft
and final draft of the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by the senior advisory team at
each stage in the preparation process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review by senior
management and technical experts from different divisions and departments within each of the five UN
agencies, both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the report underwent executive review
and clearance by the heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

KEY MESSAGES

è Despite hopes that the world would emerge from
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and food security
would begin to improve, world hunger rose further in
2021. The increase in global hunger in 2021 reflects
exacerbated inequalities across and within countries
due to an unequal pattern of economic recovery among
countries and unrecovered income losses among those
most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

è Steady progress has been made on exclusive
breastfeeding, with 43.8 percent of infants under six
months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in 2020,
up from 37.1 percent in 2012, but improvement must be
accelerated to meet the 2030 target. Infants residing in
rural areas, in poorer households, who are female and
whose mothers received no formal education are more
likely to be breastfed.

è After remaining relatively unchanged since 2015,
the prevalence of undernourishment jumped from
8.0 to 9.3 percent from 2019 to 2020 and rose at a
slower pace in 2021 to 9.8 percent. Between 702 and
828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.
The number has grown by about 150 million since the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic – 103 million more
people between 2019 and 2020 and 46 million more
in 2021.

è Globally in 2019, nearly one in three women aged
15 to 49 years (571 million) were affected by anaemia,
with no progress since 2012. Anaemia affects more
women in rural settings, in poorer households and who
have received no formal education.
è Almost 3.1 billion people could not afford a
healthy diet in 2020. This is 112 million more than in
2019, reflecting the inflation in consumer food prices
stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it.

è Projections are that nearly 670 million people will
still be facing hunger in 2030 – 8 percent of the world
population, which is the same as in 2015 when the
2030 Agenda was launched.

è The recent setbacks indicate that policies are
no longer delivering increasing marginal returns in
reducing hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all
its forms. Governments where the economy is fragile
are also facing fiscal constraints to transform agrifood
systems. This is the time for governments to start
examining their current support to food and agriculture.

è After increasing sharply in 2020, the global
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
remained mostly unchanged in 2021, but severe
food insecurity rose higher, reflecting a deteriorating
situation for people already facing serious hardships.
Around 2.3 billion people in the world were moderately
or severely food insecure in 2021, and 11.7 percent
of the global population faced food insecurity at
severe levels.

è Worldwide support to food and agriculture
accounted for almost USD 630 billion per year
on average over 2013–2018. The lion share of it
is targeted to farmers individually, through trade
and market policies and fiscal subsidies largely
tied to production or unconstrained use of variable
production inputs. Not only is much of this support
market distorting, but it is not reaching many farmers,
hurts the environment and does not promote the
production of nutritious foods.

è Globally in 2020, an estimated 22 percent of children
under five years of age were stunted, 6.7 percent were
wasted, and 5.7 percent were overweight. Children in
rural settings and poorer households, whose mothers
received no formal education, were more vulnerable
to stunting and wasting. Children in urban areas and
wealthier households were at higher risk of overweight.

| xiv |

è Support to agricultural production largely
concentrates on staple foods, dairy and other
animal source protein-rich foods, especially in
high- and upper-middle-income countries. Rice,
sugar and meats of various types are the foods most
incentivized worldwide, while fruits and vegetables
are less supported overall, or even penalized in some
low-income countries.

è In low-income countries but also in some
lower-middle-income countries where agriculture is
key for the economy, jobs and livelihoods, governments
need to increase and prioritize expenditure for the
provision of services that support food and agriculture
more collectively. This is crucial to bridge productivity
gaps in the production of nutritious foods and enable
income generation to improve the affordability of
healthy diets, although it will require significant
development financing.

è Trade and market interventions can act as trade
barriers for nutritious foods undermining the availability
and affordability of healthy diets. In many countries,
fiscal subsidies have increased the availability and
reduced the price of staple foods and their derivatives,
discouraging and making relatively more expensive
the consumption of unsubsidized or less subsidized
commodities such as fruits, vegetables and pulses.

è Repurposing current public support to
food and agriculture will not be enough alone.
Healthy food environments and empowering
consumers to choose healthy diets must be promoted
through complementing agrifood systems policies.
Social protection and health system policies will
be needed to mitigate unintended consequences
of repurposing support on the most vulnerable,
particularly women and children. Environmental,
health, transportation and energy systems policies
will be needed to enhance the positive outcomes
of repurposing support in the realms of efficiency,
equality, nutrition, health, climate mitigation and
the environment.

è Done smartly and informed by evidence, involving
all stakeholders, keeping in mind countries’ political
economies and institutional capabilities, and considering
commitments and flexibilities under World Trade
Organization rules, repurposing existing public support
can help increase the availability of nutritious foods
to the consumer. It can contribute to making healthy
diets less costly and more affordable all over the world,
a necessary – albeit insufficient – for condition for
healthy diets to be consumed.

è The success of repurposing efforts will also
be influenced by the political and social context,
governance, (im)balances of power, and differences
in interests, ideas and influence of stakeholders.
Given the diversity of each country’s context,
repurposing efforts will need strong institutions on a
local, national and global level, as well as engaging and
incentivizing stakeholders from the public sector, the
private sector and international organizations.

è When repurposing public support to make healthy
diets less costly, policymakers have to avoid potential
inequality trade-offs that may emerge if farmers are
not in a position to specialize in the production of
nutritious foods due to resource constraints. To avoid
trade-offs in terms of greenhouse gas emissions,
low-emission intensity technologies have to be adopted
to produce nutritious foods, and overproduction and
overconsumption of emission-intensive commodities
need to be reduced in high- and upper-middle-income
countries in line with dietary guidelines.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION
AROUND THE WORLD

With eight years remaining to end hunger,
food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition
(Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs]
Targets 2.1 and 2.2), the world is moving in
the wrong direction. As argued in the last two
editions of this report, to meet the targets of
SDG 2 by 2030, healthy diets must be delivered
at lower cost to contribute to people’s ability to
afford them. This implies both an expansion in
the supply of the nutritious foods that constitute
a healthy diet and a shift in consumption
towards them.

Food security indicators – latest updates
and progress towards ending hunger and
ensuring food security
Despite hopes that the world would emerge more
quickly from the crisis and food security would
begin to recover from the pandemic in 2021,
world hunger rose further in 2021, following
a sharp upturn in 2020 in the midst of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in the impact
of the pandemic and the recovery, together
with the limited coverage and duration of the
social protection measures, led to widening
inequalities that have contributed to further
setbacks in 2021 towards achievement of the
Zero Hunger target by 2030.

Most of the food and agricultural policy
support currently implemented is not aligned
with the objective of promoting healthy diets
and in many cases is actually inadvertently
undermining food security and nutrition
outcomes. Furthermore, much of the support is
not equitably distributed, is market distortive
and environmentally harmful.

After remaining relatively unchanged since
2015, the prevalence of undernourishment
(SDG Indicator 2.1.1) jumped from 8.0 in 2019 to
around 9.3 percent in 2020 and continued to rise
in 2021 – though at a slower pace – to around
9.8 percent. It is estimated that between 702 and
828 million people in the world (corresponding
to 8.9 and 10.5 percent of the world population,
respectively) faced hunger in 2021. Considering the
middle points of the projected ranges (which
reflect the added uncertainty induced by
the lingering consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic), hunger affected 46 million more
people in 2021 compared to 2020, and a total of
150 million more people since 2019, prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

It is possible to allocate public budgets more
cost-effectively and efficiently to help reduce
the cost of healthy diets, thus improving their
affordability, sustainably and inclusively,
ensuring no one is left behind.
This year’s report first presents the latest
updates of the food security and nutrition
situation around the world, including updated
estimates on the cost and affordability of a
healthy diet. The report then takes a deep dive
into “repurposing food and agricultural policy
support to make healthy diets more affordable”
through reducing the cost of nutritious foods
relative to other foods and people’s income,
which, in turn, helps countries make more
efficient and effective use of – in many cases –
limited public resources.

The numbers show persistent regional disparities,
with Africa bearing the heaviest burden.
One in five people in Africa (20.2 percent of the
population) was facing hunger in 2021, compared
to 9.1 percent in Asia, 8.6 percent in Latin America
and the Caribbean, 5.8 percent in Oceania, and
less than 2.5 percent in Northern America and
Europe. After increasing from 2019 to 2020 in
| xvi |

There is also a growing gender gap in food
insecurity. In 2021, 31.9 percent of women in
the world were moderately or severely food
insecure compared to 27.6 percent of men –
a gap of more than 4 percentage points,
compared with 3 percentage points in 2020.

most of Africa, Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean, the PoU continued to rise in 2021 in
most subregions, but more slowly.
Updated projections of the number of
undernourished people suggest that nearly
670 million people will still be undernourished in
2030 – 78 million more than in a scenario in which
the pandemic had not occurred. Another crisis
now looms that is likely to impact the trajectory
of food security globally. The war in Ukraine will
have multiple implications for global agricultural
markets through the channels of trade, production
and prices, casting a shadow over the state of food
security and nutrition for many countries in the
near future.

The state of nutrition: progress towards
global nutrition targets
This report also assesses global and regional
levels and trends for the seven global nutrition
targets. The estimates presented are based
primarily on data collected prior to 2020 and
do not fully account for the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

SDG Target 2.1 challenges the world to go beyond
ending hunger by ensuring access for all to safe,
nutritious and sufficient food all year round.
SDG Indicator 2.1.2 – the prevalence of moderate
or severe food insecurity in the population, based
on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale – is used
to monitor progress towards the ambitious goal of
ensuring access to adequate food for all.

The latest estimate for low birthweight revealed
that 14.6 percent of newborns (20.5 million) were
born with a low birthweight in 2015, a modest
decrease from the 17.5 percent (22.9 million)
in 2000. Optimal breastfeeding practices,
including exclusive breastfeeding for the first
six months of life, are critical for child survival
and the promotion of health and cognitive
development. Globally, the prevalence has
risen from 37.1 percent (49.9 million) in 2012 to
43.8 percent (59.4 million) in 2020. Still, more
than half of all infants under six months of age
globally did not receive the protective benefits
of exclusive breastfeeding.

Moderate or severe food insecurity at the global
level has been increasing since FAO first started
collecting Food Insecurity Experience Scale
data in 2014. In 2020, the year the COVID-19
pandemic spread across the globe, it rose nearly
as much as in the previous five years combined.
New estimates for 2021 suggest that the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
has remained relatively unchanged compared
with 2020, whereas that of severe food insecurity
has increased, providing further evidence of a
deteriorating situation mainly for those already
facing serious hardships. In 2021, an estimated
29.3 percent of the global population – 2.3 billion
people – were moderately or severely food
insecure, and 11.7 percent (923.7 million people)
faced severe food insecurity.

Stunting, the condition of being too short for
one’s age, undermines the physical and cognitive
development of children, increases their risk of
dying from common infections and predisposes
them to overweight and non-communicable
diseases later in life. Globally, the prevalence
of stunting among children under five years of
age has declined steadily, from an estimated
33.1 percent (201.6 million) in 2000 to 22.0 percent
(149.2 million) in 2020.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Although progress is being made in some
regions, malnutrition persists in many forms
across all regions and may in fact be worse
than these findings suggest as the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on nutritional outcomes is
still unfolding. Reaching the 2030 global nutrition
targets will require immense efforts to counteract
severe global setbacks. Global trends in anaemia
among women aged 15 to 49 years, overweight
in children, and obesity among adults especially,
will need to be reversed to achieve the progress
needed to reach the SDGs.

Child wasting is a life-threatening condition
caused by insufficient nutrient intake, poor
nutrient absorption, and/or frequent or prolonged
illness. Affected children are dangerously thin
with weakened immunity and a higher risk of
mortality. The prevalence of wasting among
children under five years of age was 6.7 percent
(45.4 million) in 2020.
Children who are overweight or obese face
both immediate and potentially long-term
health impacts, including a higher risk of
non-communicable diseases later in life.
Globally, the prevalence of overweight among
children under five years of age increased
slightly from 5.4 percent (33.3 million) in 2000 to
5.7 percent (38.9 million) in 2020. Rising trends are
seen in around half of the countries worldwide.

Cost and affordability of a healthy diet:
an update
The 2020 edition of this report included, for
the first time, global estimates of the cost
and affordability of a healthy diet. These are
useful indicators of people’s economic access to
nutritious foods and healthy diets.

The prevalence of anaemia among women aged
15 to 49 years was estimated to be 29.9 percent
in 2019. The absolute number of women with
anaemia has risen steadily from 493 million
in 2000 to 570.8 million in 2019, which has
implications for female morbidity and mortality
and can lead to adverse pregnancy and newborn
outcomes. Globally, adult obesity nearly doubled
in absolute value from 8.7 percent (343.1 million)
in 2000 to 13.1 percent (675.7 million) in 2016.
Updated global estimates are poised to be
released before the end of 2022.

The effects of inflation in consumer food prices
stemming from the economic impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the measures put in
place to contain it, are clear and significant.
Global consumer food prices were higher by the
end of 2020 than they were during any month in
the previous six years. This translated directly
into an increased average cost of a healthy diet in
2020 for all regions and almost all subregions in
the world.

Children in rural settings and poorer households
are more vulnerable to stunting and wasting.
Children and adults, particularly women,
in urban areas and wealthier households
are at higher risk of overweight and obesity,
respectively. Infants residing in rural areas, in
poorer households, with mothers who received
no formal education and female infants are more
likely to be breastfed. Women with no formal
education are more vulnerable to anaemia
and their children to stunting and wasting.
Addressing inequalities will be essential to
achieving the 2030 targets.

The affordability of a healthy diet measures
the average cost of the diet relative to income;
therefore, changes over time can be the result of
changes in the cost of the diet, people’s income, or
both. In 2020, the measures put in place to contain
COVID-19 sent the world and most countries
into economic recession, with per capita incomes
contracting in more countries than at any time
in the recent past. However, while affordability
estimates in 2020 reflect food price shocks, the
income shocks are not yet captured due to the
unavailability of 2020 income distribution data.
The estimated number of people who could not

yearly by governments for the provision of general
services to the sector, while food consumers
received USD 72 billion on average every year.

afford a healthy diet, therefore, might increase
further once income distribution data become
available that will allow to account for the
combined effects of inflation in consumer food
prices and income losses.

Policy support to food and agriculture differs
across country income groups and across time.
Overall, price incentive measures and fiscal
subsidies have been the most widely used
in high-income countries and are becoming
increasingly popular across some middle-income
countries, in particular those at the upper level of
income. Low-income countries have historically
implemented policies that generate price
disincentives for farmers to facilitate consumers’
access to food at a lower price. These countries
have limited resources to provide fiscal subsidies
to producers and consumers as well as to fund
general services that benefit the whole of the food
and agricultural sector.

It is estimated that the number of people who
could not afford a healthy diet in 2020 increased
globally and in every region in the world.
Almost 3.1 billion people could not afford a
healthy diet in 2020, an increase of 112 million
more people than in 2019. This increase was
mainly driven by Asia, where 78 million more
people were unable to afford this diet in 2020,
followed by Africa (25 million more people), while
Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern
America and Europe had 8 and 1 million more
people, respectively.

FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY
SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH
DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

In middle-income countries, fiscal subsidies
to agricultural producers accounted for just
5 percent of total value of production – versus
almost 13 percent in high-income countries.
General services support, expressed as share
of value of production, is lower in low-income
countries (2 percent) compared to high-income
countries (4 percent). Two-thirds of the world’s
fiscal subsidies to consumers (either final or
intermediary, such as processors) were disbursed
in high-income countries.

Stocktaking: What policy support is
currently provided to food and
agriculture?

Governments support food and agriculture
through various policies, including trade and
market interventions (e.g. border measures
and market price control) that generate price
incentives or disincentives, fiscal subsidies to
producers and consumers, and general services
support. These policies impact all stakeholders,
part of the food environment and can affect the
availability and affordability of healthy diets.

Policy support differs across food groups and
commodities. Countries with higher levels of
income provide support to all food groups, and
particularly to staple foods, including cereals,
roots and tubers, followed by dairy and other
protein-rich foods. In high-income countries,
support within these three food groups is equally
provided in the form of price incentives and fiscal
subsidies to producers. On the contrary, for fruits
and vegetables, and fats and oils, fiscal subsidies
(accounting for about 11 percent of the value of
production) were substantially larger than price
incentives on average during 2013–2018.

Worldwide support for the food and agricultural
sector accounted for almost USD 630 billion a
year on average over 2013–2018. Support targeting
agricultural producers individually averaged
almost USD 446 billion a year in net terms
(i.e. accounting for both price incentives and
disincentives for farmers), which corresponds to
about 70 percent of the total sector support and
about 13 percent of the global value of production,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

farm incomes and indirectly supported the
development and use of better technology and
of new agricultural inputs. On the other hand,
these subsidies have de facto created (relative)
disincentives towards producing nutritious foods,
encouraged monocultures in some countries,
ceased the farming of certain nutritious products,
and discouraged the production of some foods
that do not receive the same level of support.

Lower-middle-income countries consistently
penalized production of most products through
policies that depress farm gate prices, but these
countries provided fiscal subsidies to farmers,
especially for staple foods, fruits and vegetables,
as well as fats and oils. Price incentives were
negative for most food groups in low-income
countries, ranging from a minus 7 percent on
staple foods (mainly cereals) to 1 percent for
other crops (e.g. sugar, tea, coffee).

Public support through the funding and provision
of general services benefits actors of the food
and agricultural sector collectively, which
is in principle good for small-scale farmers,
women and youth. But this type of support is
significantly lower than the support provided to
individual producers through price incentives
and fiscal subsidies, and it is more widely funded
in high-income countries. In some cases, services
such as research and development are biased
towards producers of staple foods.

How are food and agricultural policies
affecting diets?
In many countries, the amount of public support
is significant and depending on how it is
allocated, it can either support or hinder efforts
to lower the cost of nutritious foods and make
healthy diets affordable for everyone.
Border measures affect the availability,
diversity and prices of food in domestic
markets. While some of these measures target
important policy objectives including food
safety, governments could do more to reduce
trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits,
vegetables and pulses, in order to increase the
availability and affordability of such foods to
reduce the cost of healthy diets.

POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE
POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE FOR IMPROVING
AFFORDABILITY OF A HEALTHY DIET

What are the potential impacts of
reallocating food and agricultural policy
support differently to reduce the cost of
nutritious foods?

In low- and middle-income countries, market
price controls such as minimum or fixed price
policy overwhelmingly target commodities like
wheat, maize, rice, as well as sugar, with the
objective of stabilizing or raising farm incomes
while ensuring supplies of staple foods for food
security purposes. However, these policies could
be contributing to the unhealthy diets that one
observes all over the world.

A new analysis of model-based scenarios of
repurposed food and agricultural policy support,
specially developed for this report, points to
potential options by which all countries in the
world can repurpose existing public support to
food and agriculture to increase the affordability
of a healthy diet.

Fiscal subsidies allocated to some specific
commodities or factors of production have
significantly contributed to growing production
and reducing the prices of cereals (especially
maize, wheat and rice), but also beef and milk.
This has positively impacted food security,

These scenarios simulate the reallocation of
current budgets supporting agricultural producers
using different policy instruments. This is done
for all countries from all geographical regions,
in order to reduce the cost and increase the

are offset by declines in the other income groups.

affordability of a healthy diet. This reallocation is
implemented linearly between 2023 and 2028, and
impacts are examined for 2030.
In these scenarios, the reallocation of budgets
targets “high-priority” foods for a healthy diet.
These are food groups whose level of current per
capita consumption in each country/region does
not yet match the recommended levels for that
country/region, as defined by the food-based
dietary guidelines used for the computation of the
cost of a healthy diet.

On the other hand, the simulated repurposing
of fiscal subsidies to producers increases the
affordability of a healthy diet more than the
simulated repurposing of border measures and
market price controls (by 0.81 vs 0.64 percentage
point). It also reduces the percent of the global
population in extreme poverty and experiencing
undernourishment. However, an important
trade-off – not seen in the previous repurposing
scenario – is that total greenhouse gas emissions
from agriculture increase (by 1.5 percent)
reflecting the higher agricultural production,
including protein-rich foods such as dairy
products whose consumption increases to meet
the recommended dietary levels particularly in
lower-middle-income countries.

A general empirically grounded observation is that
repurposing existing public support to agriculture
in all regions of the world, with the objective of
promoting the production of nutritious foods
(whose consumption is low relative to the dietary
requirements) would contribute to make a healthy
diet less costly and more affordable, globally and
particularly in middle-income countries.
Removing or reducing border support and market
price controls for commodities that are priorities
for a healthy diet reduces their prices, particularly
in markets with high border protection. As a
result, the percent of the global population for
which a healthy diet is affordable increases
(by 0.64 percentage point in 2030 compared with
the baseline), while the cost of a healthy diet falls
relatively more than that of the average diet
(by 1.7 vs 0.4 percent, respectively).

Instead, with fiscal subsidies going to consumers
albeit still targeting “high-priority” foods, the
cost of a healthy diet falls more notably than in
the two previous repurposing scenarios, both in
absolute terms (by 3.34 percent in 2030 compared
with the baseline) and relative to the average diet.
The percent of the population that can afford a
healthy diet increases (by almost 0.8 percentage
point), but slightly less than in the fiscal subsidies
to producers' scenario due to the income effect.

The move towards a less costly and more
affordable healthy diet is accompanied by a decline
in global agricultural production that, in turn,
is reflected in lower greenhouse gas emissions
in agriculture. Greenhouse gas emissions fall in
all income groups, except for the high-income
countries (where agricultural production is found
to increase).

Important positive synergies in this scenario
include a reduction in extreme poverty and
undernourishment levels, due in part to
increased farm income in low-income countries.
Moreover, world greenhouse gas emissions fall
due to a reduction in agricultural production.
In contrast, this scenario is found to hit
producers hard in the absence of their subsidies.
Globally, farm income and agricultural production
fall (respectively, by 3.7 and 0.2 percent in 2030
relative to the baseline).

Other effects include a small increase of global
farm income (up 0.03 percent), although for lowand lower-middle-income countries, where border
measures and market price controls account for a

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Complementing policies within and
outside agrifood systems that are
needed to ensure repurposing efforts
are impactful

Whether through border measures and market
controls or fiscal subsidies, policymakers will
have to repurpose their support considering the
potential inequality trade-offs that may emerge if
small-scale farmers (including women and youth)
are not in a position to specialize in the production
of nutritious foods due to resource constraints.

For repurposing to be most effective, contributing
to making healthy diets less costly and more
affordable, other agrifood systems policies, and
policies and incentives outside agrifood systems,
will be needed. If aligned and put in place, these
complementing policies can offer support in
two ways.

A key challenge for policymakers in low-income
countries, and perhaps some lower-middle-income
countries, will not only be to reach compromises
in repurposing food and agricultural support
to achieve several inclusive agricultural
transformation objectives that are well aligned
with reducing the cost of nutritious foods.
Considering their low budgets, governments
of these countries will also have to mobilize
significant financing to step up the provision
of: i) general services support where it has to
be prioritized to effectively bridge productivity
gaps in the production of nutritious foods with
inclusivity and sustainability; and ii) fiscal
subsidies to consumers to increase affordability.
In this regard, international public investment
support will be key to ease the transition towards
higher general services support, especially in
low-income countries.

First, they can provide incentives (or disincentives)
that can support shifts in food supply chains,
food environments and consumer behaviour
towards healthy eating patterns. Second, they can
ease or mitigate the unintended consequences or
trade-offs from repurposing support, particularly
if these include a reduction in the access to
nutritious foods and healthy diets for vulnerable
and disadvantaged population groups.
Making nutritious foods more widely accessible
and affordable is a necessary, albeit insufficient
condition, for consumers to be able to choose, prefer
and consume healthy diets. Thus, complementary
policies that promote shifts in food environments
and consumer behaviour towards healthy eating
patterns will be critical. These could include
implementing mandatory limits or voluntary
targets to improve the nutritional quality of
processed foods and drink products, enacting
legislation on food marketing, and implementing
nutrition labelling policies and healthy
procurement policies. Combining land- use policies
with other complementing policies to address food
deserts and swamps can also be very important.

To take advantage of the opportunities that
repurposing support offers, countries will
have to get together at the multilateral table.
The repurposing of border measures, market price
controls and fiscal subsidies will have to consider
countries’ commitments and flexibilities under
current World Trade Organization rules, as well
as issues in the ongoing negotiations.
In sum, repurposing support that targets the
“high-priority” foods for a healthy diet would
support economic recovery globally, provided
this is realized through the reduction of border
measures and market price controls or the
shifting of fiscal subsidies from producers to
consumers, but there are potential trade-offs to
consider. Therefore, the results will differ by
country income group and geographical region.

Given repurposing can lead to trade-offs that
may negatively affect some stakeholders, in
these cases, social protection policies may
be necessary to mitigate possible trade-offs,
particularly short-term income losses or negative
effects on livelihoods, especially among the most
vulnerable populations.

repurposing support efforts. The dynamics and
the mechanisms for managing these elements are
explored in detail in the report.

Environmental, health, transportation and
energy systems policies will be absolutely
necessary to enhance the positive outcomes of
repurposing support in the realms of efficiency,
equality, nutrition, health, climate mitigation
and the environment. Health services that
protect poor and vulnerable groups whose diets
do not provide all the nutrients are particularly
relevant. Not adequately addressing
inefficiencies and problems in transportation
would also undermine and render ineffective
repurposing efforts.

Given the diversity of each country’s political
context, strong institutions on a local, national
and global level will be crucial, as well as
engaging and incentivizing stakeholders from the
public sector, the private sector and international
organizations to support the repurposing support
efforts. For many countries, agrifood systems
transformation pathways provide a framework
through which to channel the repurposing efforts.
The engagement of small- and medium-sized
enterprises and civil society groups – as well
as transparent governance and safeguards to
prevent and manage conflicts of interest – will
be key to balancing out unequal powers within
agrifood systems.

The political economy and governance
dynamics that influence repurposing
policy support
The extent to which efforts to repurpose food
and agricultural support will be successful will
depend on the political economy, governance
and the incentives of relevant stakeholders
in a local, national and global context.
Broadly speaking, the political economy refers
to the social, economic, cultural and political
factors that structure, sustain and transform
constellations of public and private actors,
and their interests and relations, over time.
This includes institutional set-ups, “the rules of
the game” that affect the everyday policymaking
agenda and its structuring. Institutions, interests
and ideas are dynamic factors at play that
influence agricultural and food policy support.
Governance refers to formal and informal rules,
organizations and processes through which
public and private actors articulate their interests
and make and implement decisions.

CONCLUSION
This year’s report should dispel any lingering
doubts that the world is moving backwards in
its efforts to end hunger, food insecurity and
malnutrition in all its forms. We are now only
eight years away from 2030, the SDG target year.
The distance to reach many of the SDG 2 targets
is growing wider each year, while the time to
2030 is narrowing. There are efforts to make
progress towards SDG 2, yet they are proving
insufficient in the face of a more challenging and
uncertain context.
The current recessionary context makes it even
more challenging for many governments to
increase their budgets to invest in agrifood
systems transformation. At the same time, much
can and needs to be done with existing resources.
A key recommendation of this report is that
governments start rethinking how they can
reallocate their existing public budgets to make
them more cost-effective and efficient in reducing
the cost of nutritious foods and increasing the
availability and affordability of healthy diets,
with sustainability and leaving no one behind. n

There are three broad political economy
elements that need to be considered and
effectively managed when repurposing food
and agricultural policy support: i) political
context, stakeholder perspectives and the will of
governments; ii) power relations, interests and the
influence of different actors; and iii) governance
mechanisms and regulatory frameworks needed
for the facilitation and implementation of

INTRODUCTION

2030. The unequal pattern of economic recovery
in 2021 among countries and the unrecovered
income losses among those most affected by the
pandemic have exacerbated existing inequalities
and have worsened the food security situation
for the populations already struggling the most
to feed their families. Food prices have also
increased in the past year due to bottlenecks in
supply chains, soaring transport costs and other
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, the war in Ukraine, involving
two of the biggest producers in agriculture and
staple cereals globally, is disrupting supply
chains and further affecting global grain,
fertilizer and energy prices, leading to shortages
and fuelling even higher food price inflation.
On top of this, the growing frequency and
intensity of extreme climate events are proving
to be a major disrupter of supply chains,
especially in low-income countries (LICs).

ith eight years remaining to
end hunger, food insecurity and
all forms of malnutrition
(SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2), the world is moving
in the wrong direction. As this report reveals,
food insecurity further deteriorated in 2021, and
the only progress made towards the 2030 global
nutrition targets was for exclusive breastfeeding
among infants under six months of age and
child stunting, while anaemia among women
and adult obesity are actually worsening.
To help prevent rising levels of malnutrition
and realize the human right to food, everyone
must have access to healthy diets, but updated
estimates suggest they are unaffordable for
almost 3.1 billion people around the world.
The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
and their consequences continue to impede
progress towards the achievement of SDG 2 by

more conducive for private investment that helps
accelerate recovery with improved food security
and nutrition of their inhabitants.

Altogether, the intensification of the major drivers
of food insecurity and malnutrition – conflict,
climate extremes, economic shocks, combined
with growing inequality – often occurring in
combination, continues to challenge the quantity
and quality of foods people can access, while
making the fiscal situation of many countries
more challenging for governments trying to
mitigate the effects of these drivers.

Repurposing policy support to make
healthy diets more affordable,
sustainably and inclusively
Against this backdrop, allocating existing
public budgets and price incentives in a
different manner becomes more an urgent
necessity; it must indeed be the primary step,
even for countries that need and can increase
these budgets. It is possible to allocate public
budgets more cost-effectively and efficiently
for achieving development objectives,
including reducing the cost of healthy diets,
thus improving affordability, sustainably and
inclusively, ensuring no one is left behind. a
In this regard, many countries can repurpose
their food and agricultural policies towards
these objectives, while ensuring that other
agrifood systems policies and complementing
policies in other sectors – such as health, social
protection and the environment – are there to
create incentives that are coherent to this end
(see Box 1 for definitions of repurposing, and food
and agricultural policy support).

As emphasized in the last two editions of this
report, to meet the targets of SDG 2 by 2030,
agrifood systems must be transformed in ways
that ensure they deliver lower cost and safe
nutritious foods that make healthy diets more
affordable for all, sustainably and inclusively.
In this report, it is argued that healthy diets
must be delivered at lower costs to contribute to
people’s ability to afford them, which implies
both an expansion in the supply of the nutritious
and safe foods that constitute a healthy diet
and a shift in consumption towards them.
From both a policy and advocacy perspective,
this also implies that healthy diets need to be
more affordable relative to unhealthy diets.
There are several entry points to do this, but the
current context of economic recession, reduced
household income (at least for the lowest deciles
of the income distribution), erratic tax revenues,
and inflation pressures is not one in which many
countries – certainly not many middle-income
countries (MICs) and LICs – could massively
invest in agrifood systems to enable a recovery
with improved food security and nutrition of
their inhabitants.

Unfortunately, very little food and agricultural
policy support has been explicitly designed to
meet the objectives related to all dimensions of
food security and nutrition, and environmental
objectives, simultaneously and coherently.
Furthermore, the majority of the policy support
measures have been designed and implemented
in isolation, for a specific purpose, without
considering the unintended consequences that
they might generate in other dimensions.

Thus, the options available to transform agrifood
systems need to be carefully considered, aiming
at the most cost-effective and efficient use of
limited resources in ways that contribute to
making healthy diets more affordable for all.
In the current recessionary context, public
spending and investments become particularly
important, because many private investors
(including agrifood systems actors) are more
risk averse in terms of investments within the
agrifood systems sphere as they tend to be
more on the high‑risk, low-reward spectrum
in terms of monetary reward, especially in the
short term. To this end, governments must wield
public policy to support delivery of affordable
healthy diets in order to create an environment

As a result, existing policies have provided
incentives for modern agrifood systems to
evolve in such a way where the cost of a healthy
diet is five times greater than the cost of diets
a The ICN2 Framework for Action enumerates recommended actions
for sustainable agrifood systems promoting healthy diets, including to
review national policies and investments and integrate nutrition
objectives into food and agriculture policy, programme design and
implementation (Recommendation 8). The work programme of the UN
Decade of Action for Nutrition, which includes related action under
Action Area 1: Sustainable, resilient agrifood systems for healthy diets,
is based on the recommendations of the ICN2 Framework for Action.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

BOX 1 DEFINITIONS OF REPURPOSING, AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT
 Food policy support is generally broader in scope
covering not only how food is produced but also
how it is processed, distributed, purchased, or
provided, and how these policies are designed
to ensure human health and nutrition needs.
Unfortunately, the availability of globally
comparable data on this support to the food part
of the agrifood system as a whole is limited, as
opposed to the policy support to agriculture only,
which is less limited.

Repurposing policy support – as defined recently in
a joint report published by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2021),1 is
the reduction of support measures that are inefficient,
unsustainable and/or inequitable, to replace them with
support measures that are the opposite. In other words,
support is not eliminated but reconfigured. In this way,
repurposing will always imply reforming.*
Policy support to food and agriculture, in this report,
refers to any form of government financial support to
these sectors or government policy that directly or
indirectly impacts the production and trade of food and
agriculture goods throughout the food value chain.

Governments use policies to create either incentives
and/or disincentives to induce a behavioural change
among agrifood systems actors, the population and
agrifood sector outcomes.*** Governments are also
subject to policies of other countries; as such, it is
not only countries’ own policies that matter.
Because this report’s theme focuses on
repurposing both food and agricultural policies, the
term “agrifood systems” is used instead of the term
“food systems” used in previous editions. The reason
is that the term “agrifood systems” is increasingly
used in the context of transforming food systems
for sustainability and inclusivity and is broader in its
definition as it encompasses both food and agricultural
systems and focuses on both food and non-food
agricultural products, with clear overlaps.****

 Agricultural policy support typically consists
of various types of measures that implicitly or
explicitly affect farm gate prices or profitability or
provide monetary transfers to farmers or public
expenditure and investment in general services and
public goods** that benefit the agricultural sector.
This includes, for example, price (dis)incentives
(mainly border measures and domestic price
interventions), which implicitly represent transfers
from consumers and taxpayers to farmers (or
vice versa).

* The definition of policy reform adopted in this report is aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition.
Accordingly, policy reform is a process in which changes are made to the “rules of the game” – including laws, regulations and institutions – to address a
problem or achieve a goal. 2 ** This refers to general services and support to public goods such as public investments to research and development (R&D),
marketing services and infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, roads and electrification). *** Incentives (or disincentives) in this context are the result of policies
that influence change in behaviour for a desired sector outcome. They are broader than (but include) more specific technical definitions of price incentives
that reflect the effect of agricultural trade and market policy measures. **** See Annex 7 Glossary for the definition of the agrifood systems and the
difference between this term and food systems.

natural resource systems. The diet-related social
costs of GHG emissions associated with current
agrifood systems and the dietary patterns they
support are projected to exceed USD 1.7 trillion
per year by 2030. Switching to plant-based
dietary patterns would reduce the social costs of
GHG emissions by 41–74 percent by 2030. 3

that meet dietary energy requirements only
through a staple cereal. 3 These policies have
also triggered the rise of low-priced foods of
high energy density and minimal nutritional
value. The health costs of unhealthy diets are
also high – with diet-related health costs linked
to mortality and non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) projected to exceed USD 1.3 trillion
per year by 2030. 3 At the same time, agrifood
systems have become a major source of global
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and are placing
excessive pressures on land, water and other

incomes and/or ensure national food security. 4
Historically, national food security policies were
designed with the aim of ensuring national
food availability, particularly for cereals
(e.g. maize, wheat or rice). As a result, agrifood
systems worldwide have been successful in
supplying foods that provide dietary energy
in the form of low-cost cereals. The majority
of the poor in every region and country
around the world can afford cereals to meet
their daily dietary energy requirement. 3 This,
however, is insufficient for meeting other
dietary requirements, including adequate
macronutrients and micronutrients and a diverse
intake of foods that help prevent malnutrition
in all its forms, as well as diet-related (NCDs). 3
The share of the total cost of staple foods in a
healthy diet is, on average, only 15 percent of its
total cost.

distortive in terms of the absence of free and
open competition, and as is particularly the
case of coupled support, tends to benefit larger
producers who can meet requirements to access
it (i.e. production volumes for specific products,
inputs use, etc.).
For these reasons, rethinking the allocation
of public spending in order to repurpose food
and agricultural policies is urgently needed.
Repurposing options need to be looked at
carefully, not only in terms of agricultural
production (both its quantity and its diversity),
but also all along the food supply chains,
in food environments, as well as with regard
to consumer behaviour. This rethinking is
crucial because the factors driving the high
cost of nutritious foods are found throughout
agrifood systems, as shown in the 2020 edition
of this report. b In addition, possible trade-offs
triggered by repurposing food and agricultural
support need to be carefully evaluated.
For example, rice is a high emission-intensive
commodity that provides calories but few
micronutrients, and yet it receives significant
support worldwide as it is also the staple food
for more than 3 billion people (Section 3.1).
Environmental sustainability considerations,
nutrition outcomes and affordability of healthy
diets need all be part of a carefully considered
strategy to repurpose rice support.

Most of the agricultural policy support that
is currently implemented is not aligned
with the national objective of promoting
healthy diets and in many cases is actually
inadvertently undermining food security and
nutrition outcomes and contributing to the
rise in overweight and obesity and diet-related
NCDs. For example, as shown in Section 3.1,
sugar or emission-intensive commodities (e.g.
beef, milk) receive the most support worldwide
despite the potentially negative impacts on
health of high sugar intakes, and on climate
change adaptation and mitigation due to the
high carbon emissions from the livestock
sector. This support also creates (relative)
disincentives towards producing higher
amounts of nutritious foods, such as fruits,
vegetables and leguminous crops. The detailed
evidence on what the impact of these policies
means in terms of the cost of nutritious foods
and the affordability of healthy diets remains
scarce, nonetheless.

These considerations highlight how an agrifood
systems approach is essential for repurposing
food and agricultural policy support (Figure 1).
This approach will entail considering the nexus
between policies and the availability and cost
of nutritious foods relative to the foods of high
energy density and minimal nutritional value,
which are often low priced, people’s incomes,
and the nutritional and environmental impact
of agrifood systems. This consideration implies
both an expansion of the supply of nutritious
foods that constitute a healthy diet while
reducing their absolute cost, and a reduction in
the relative cost of healthy diets. To shift current

Furthermore, much of the current food and
agricultural policy support is not equitably
distributed, particularly support that is
conditional (or coupled) to specific volumes
of production for some commodities or to
the use of certain inputs, requirements that
some small farmers in particular cannot meet.
In other words, much of the existing food
and agricultural policy support is market

drivers are found across agrifood systems in realms of production, food
supply chains, consumer behaviour, and the food environment. Note
that in FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO (2020), 3 the term "food
systems" is used while the term "agrifood systems" is used in this report
to emphasize the need for repurposing food and agricultural policies.

recommendations. While the broader issue of
how to increase people’s incomes is at the core
of economic development, this topic is beyond
the scope of this year’s report; instead, the focus
is on repurposing policy support to lower the
cost of healthy diets. However, in repurposing
food and agricultural policy support to lower
the cost of healthy diets, it is important to
consider the impact of different mixes of
repurposed policies on income, including farm
income, and the trade-offs these create, and the
need to carefully consider and manage both.

all forms of malnutrition will require both the
implementation of policies and advocacy.
Affordability of healthy diets is not only
determined by the cost of the nutritious foods
that constitute such diets, but also by the cost of
such diets relative to people’s incomes, and the
cost of nutritious foods relative to foods high
in fats, sugars and/or salt that may be widely
available and heavily promoted. Past editions
of this report have shown how poverty and
inequality reduction is critical to improving
people’s capacities to access sufficient
nutritious food, pointing to concrete policy

At the same time, it is important to recognize
that while food and agricultural policy support
|5|

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Links between food and agricultural
policy support and the cost of
nutritious foods

may eventually create the right incentives and
leading to the intended effects within agrifood
systems, what happens elsewhere may be
resulting in the opposite. Thus, complementing
policies within agrifood systems and in other
sectors outside agrifood systems need to be
considered in the interim and in terms of
synergies and trade-offs to achieve the policy
coherence that will be needed to make the most
of available resources, including those in the
health and environmental sectors.

Repurposing food and agricultural policy
support with an objective to lower the cost of
nutritious foods to make healthy diets more
affordable for all will be a critical move for
many countries to reach the SDG 2 targets
by 2030, including those targets related to
sustainable agriculture, as well as other SDGs.
Currently, almost 3.1 billion people (Section 2.3)
in the world cannot afford even the cheapest
healthy diet even though this diet is essential to
good health and well-being. Therefore, making
healthy diets more economically accessible for
everyone will also contribute to the achievement
of SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and will
create more equitable access to nutritious foods
and enhance health, food security and nutrition,
contributing to the achievement of SDG 10
(Reduced Inequalities). Furthermore, shifting
to healthy diets can contribute to reductions in
GHG emissions as shown in previous editions
of this report; 3 therefore, they are not only
good for the health of the population, but also
for the health of the planet and thus can be a
win-win solution contributing to both SDG 12
(Responsible Consumption and Production) and
SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Nonetheless, repurposing food and agricultural
policy support may take time to bear fruit
in terms of reducing the cost of nutritious
foods or could lead to short-term livelihood
insecurity and loss of income. In other
words, it will not be fully free of trade-offs;
therefore, mitigation measures such as social
protection may be needed to avoid unintended
consequences, especially for those most
vulnerable to the changes during the transition.
Repurposing food and agricultural policy
support, and complementing policies within
and outside agrifood systems, will need to be
devised differently depending on the structural
characteristics of the countries including their
income status, production structure, natural
resource endowments, net trade position, and
food security and nutrition situation, as well as
political economy considerations.

This year’s report first presents the latest
updates of the food security and nutrition
situation around the world, including updated
estimates on the cost and affordability of
a healthy diet (Chapter 2). The report then
takes a deep dive into “repurposing food and
agricultural policy support to make healthy
diets more affordable” through reducing the cost
of nutritious foods relative to other foods and
people’s incomes, which, in turn, helps countries
make more efficient and effective use of –
in many cases – limited public resources.

Repurposing existing food and agricultural
policy support is a critical first step on which
this report provides evidence and policy
guidance. However, for many countries,
this alone will not be enough to ensure the
affordability of healthy diets for all, and they
will need to scale up investments in the food
and agriculture sectors. Some countries will
actually not be in a position to repurpose
anything, given the limited amounts of public
resources they currently devote to food and
agricultural policy support. For these countries
in particular, it will be necessary to scale
up spending, both public expenditure and
private investment, including through blended
financing options. Identifying these countries is
another key contribution of this report.

First, a stocktaking exercise is undertaken
to explore the most predominant food and
agricultural policy support currently in place
around the world, the amount of support
provided, the activities and actors mostly
supported (or, on the contrary, penalized), and
the pathways through which this support is
pushing up the relative cost of nutritious foods

more efficient, but also more sustainable and
inclusive. Lastly, the report takes a close look
at complementing policies, within and outside
agrifood systems that are important to support
repurposing efforts and at the political economy
factors and dynamics that hamper or facilitate
repurposing efforts (Chapter 4). n

and promoting unhealthy diets (Chapter 3).
Second, guidance – grounded in analysis and
evidence – is provided on alternative food and
agricultural policy support mixes that help
reduce the cost of nutritious foods, as well as on
how the resulting trade-offs need to be managed
to ensure agrifood systems are not only

2.1 and 2.2: ending hunger and ensuring access

Another crisis is unfolding as this report is being
written with potentially sobering implications
for global food security and nutrition: the war in
Ukraine. Although the statistics presented in this
report represent the state of food security and
nutrition up until 2021, the direct and indirect
effects of the conflict in 2022 will have multiple
implications for global agricultural markets
through the channels of trade, production and
prices. Ultimately, this casts a shadow over the
state of food security and nutrition for many
countries, in particular those that are already
facing hunger and food crisis situations, and
poses an additional challenge for achieving the
SDG 2 targets of ending hunger and ensuring
access to adequate food for all (SDG Target 2.1)
and of eliminating all forms of malnutrition
(SDG Target 2.2).

The assessment in last year’s report of the
situation in 2020 – the year the COVID-19
pandemic spread rapidly across the globe –
revealed major setbacks, with growing numbers
of people facing hunger and food insecurity as
the unprecedented crisis exacerbated inequalities
that were already stalling progress prior to the
pandemic. It also highlighted that malnutrition
in all its forms remains a challenge and that child
malnutrition, in particular, is expected to be
higher due to the effects of the pandemic.
Despite hopes that the world would emerge
more quickly from the crisis and food security
would begin to recover from the pandemic
in 2021, the pandemic held its grip and even
tightened it in some parts of the world.
The rebound of gross domestic product (GDP)
growth observed in most countries in 2021 did
not translate into gains in food security in the
same year. Enormous challenges are still faced
by those who continue to be the most affected:
those with less wealth, lower and more unstable
incomes and poorer access to critical basic
services. The COVID-19 pandemic increased
inequalities between countries and within

Section 2.1 of this chapter presents an updated
assessment of the state of food security and
progress towards achieving the hunger and food
insecurity targets (SDG 2.1). It includes global,
regional and subregional assessments of the
two SDG Target 2.1 indicators: the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU) and the prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity based on the
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), revised
up to 2021 based on the most recent data available
to FAO at the time of closing the production of
this report. Updated projections of what the PoU
may be in 2030 are also provided.

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD

Section 2.2 presents analyses of the state of
nutrition and progress towards the global
nutrition targets defined by the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in 2012 and the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development (SDG 2.2).
While the COVID-19 pandemic interfered with
the collection of data needed to update most of
the nutrition indicators, the section sheds new
light on the unequal distribution of malnutrition
in the population and the groups most affected,
based on the most recent estimates available.
An analytical framework showing the pathways
through which the COVID-19 pandemic
may impact various forms of malnutrition is
described, with two country-level analyses
that provide clues as to what the new nutrition
data may reveal about the consequences of the
pandemic when they become available.

the COVID-19 pandemic – 103 million more people
between 2019 and 2020 and 46 million more in 2021,
considering the middle of the projected range.

Section 2.3 presents updated estimates of the cost
and affordability of a healthy diet, based on an
improved methodology. These indicators shed
light on one critical aspect of achieving healthy
diets: access to diverse, nutritious foods. n

è After increasing from 2019 to 2020 in most of Africa,
Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, hunger
continued to rise in most subregions in 2021, but at a
slower pace. Compared with 2019, the largest increase
was observed in Africa, both in terms of percentage and
number of people.

è The further increase in global hunger in 2021 reflects
exacerbated inequalities across and within countries
due to an unequal pattern of economic recovery among
countries and unrecovered income losses among those
most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, all in a
context of diminishing social protection measures that
had been implemented in 2020.
è In 2021, hunger affected 278 million people
in Africa, 425 million in Asia and 56.5 million in
Latin America and the Caribbean – 20.2, 9.1 and
8.6 percent of the population, respectively. While most
of the world’s undernourished people live in Asia,
Africa is the region where the prevalence is highest.

FOOD SECURITY

è It is estimated that nearly 670 million people will still
be undernourished in 2030 – 8 percent of the world
population, which is the same percentage as in 2015
when the 2030 Agenda was launched. This is 78 million
more undernourished people in 2030 compared to a
scenario in which the pandemic had not occurred.
è After increasing sharply in 2020, the global
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
remained mostly unchanged in 2021, whereas that of
severe food insecurity rose higher, providing additional
evidence of a deteriorating situation mainly for people
already facing serious hardships.

KEY MESSAGES

è Around 2.3 billion people in the world were
moderately or severely food insecure in 2021, or
nearly 30 percent of the global population – more
than 350 million more people than in 2019, the year
before the COVID‑19 pandemic unfolded.

è Despite hopes that the world would emerge from
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and food security
would begin to improve, world hunger rose further
in 2021. After remaining relatively unchanged since
2015, the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU)
jumped from 8.0 to 9.3 percent from 2019 to 2020
and rose at a slower pace in 2021 to 9.8 percent.

è Close to 40 percent of people affected by
moderate or severe food insecurity in the world were
facing food insecurity at severe levels. The prevalence
of severe food insecurity increased from 9.3 percent
in 2019 to 11.7 percent in 2021 – the equivalent of
207 million more people in two years.

è It is estimated that between 702 and 828 million
people were affected by hunger in 2021. The number
has grown by about 150 million since the outbreak of

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

è In the last year, moderate or severe food
insecurity increased the most in Africa, the region
with the highest prevalence at both levels of severity.
Food security also continued to worsen in Latin
America and the Caribbean, although at a slower pace
compared to the year before. In Asia, the prevalence
of moderate or severe food insecurity showed a slight
decrease between 2020 and 2021, in spite of a small
increase in severe food insecurity.

by countries. Rather, they are obtained by
nowcasting the parameters needed to estimate
the PoU (Annex 2A). Parameters were updated
using the most recent information available to
FAO regarding the food supply and reasonable
assumptions on the extent of inequality in access
to food (Box 2). For the 63 countries with the
highest numbers of undernourished people, PoU
estimates for 2020 have been substantially revised
compared to last year’s assessment, benefiting
from official data on food production, trade and
utilization reported by these countries. For the
rest of the countries, the 2020 food supply values
used to estimate the PoU are still nowcasts.
Most importantly, uncertainty remains on the
extent of inequality in access to food in both 2020
and 2021 due to the lack of up-to-date household
food consumption data for all countries.

è The gender gap in food insecurity – which had
grown in 2020 under the shadow of the COVID-19
pandemic – widened even further in 2021, driven
largely by the widening differences in Latin America
and the Caribbean, as well as in Asia. In 2021, the gap
reached 4.3 percentage points, with 31.9 percent of
women in the world being moderately or severely food
insecure compared to 27.6 percent of men.
è Although this report profiles the state of food
security and nutrition up to 2021, the ongoing war in
Ukraine poses an additional challenge for achieving the
SDG 2 targets of ending hunger and casts a shadow
over the state of food security and nutrition for many
countries, in particular those that are already facing
hunger and food crisis situations.

The assessments of the prevalence of moderate
or severe food insecurity based on the FIES
(SDG Indicator 2.1.2), also presented in this
section, are informed by survey data collected
annually by FAO mainly through the Gallup ©
World Poll (GWP) in over 140 different
countries. Contrary to 2020, when data were
collected mostly via telephone interviews due
to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic,
face-to-face interviews resumed in 2021 in most
of the countries, making the assessment for 2021
somewhat more reliable (Annex 1B).

Persisting uncertainty
The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in
2020, and its continuing impacts in 2021, pose a
significant challenge for the assessment of the
state of food insecurity in the world. The physical
distancing measures taken to contain the spread
of the pandemic disrupted normal data collection
activities in 2020. Although some activities were
resumed in 2021, resurgent waves of the pandemic
continued to impede normal statistical operations
around the world. As a result, the uncertainty
that always characterizes estimates of how many
people are suffering from hunger and food
insecurity has been further amplified.

SDG Indicator 2.1.1
Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU)
World hunger rose further in 2021, following a
sharp upturn in 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic. The persistence of the pandemic and
its enduring consequences, which exacerbated
existing inequalities, have contributed to further
setbacks in 2021 towards achievement of the
Zero Hunger target by 2030. After remaining
relatively unchanged since 2015, the PoU jumped
from 8.0 in 2019 to around 9.3 percent in 2020 and
continued to rise in 2021 – though at a slower pace
– to around 9.8 percent (Figure 2). It is estimated
that between 702 and 828 million people in the
world (corresponding to 8.9 and 10.5 percent of
the world population, respectively) faced hunger
in 2021. Considering the middle points of the
projected ranges (722 and 768 million), hunger
affected 46 million more people in 2021 compared

For this reason, in this edition of the report,
the 2020 and 2021 estimates of the global PoU
(SDG Indicator 2.1.1) are presented as ranges
to reflect the added uncertainty induced by
the lingering consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic. It is important to note that, as
usual, the PoU estimates corresponding to
the most recent year reported (i.e. 2021 in this
edition) are not based on data reported directly

several years, up to 2018–2019. The impact of the
revision is detectable in the lower level of the whole series
of the PoU and NoU for South-eastern Asia.

The entire series of PoU values is carefully revised with
each new edition of this report to reflect new data and
information that FAO has obtained since the release of the
previous edition. As this process usually implies backward
revisions of the entire PoU series, readers are advised to
refrain from comparing series across different editions of
this report and should always refer to the current edition
of the report, including for values in past years.

NOWCAST OF THE PoU IN 2020 AND 2021
As already noted in last year’s edition of this report, the
exceptional nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes
it particularly challenging to produce reliable nowcasts
of key parameters, which cannot be based on observed
historical trends. This continues to be true this year, as
information on actual food availability and consumption
in 2020 and 2021 remains scarce and imprecise. For this
reason, the values of the PoU and NoU in 2020 and 2021
are presented as ranges.
The following specific data and procedures were used
to project DEC and CV parameters for 2020 and 2021:

ROUTINE REVISIONS OF SERIES UP TO 2019
AND 2020
All new information obtained by FAO is used to conduct
careful revisions of the series of the three parameters that
inform the calculation of the PoU: the average dietary
energy consumption (DEC), the measure of inequality in
dietary energy consumption (CV), and the minimum dietary
energy requirement (MDER) for the national population, in
each of the covered countries (see Annex 1B for details on
the methodology). This year, important revisions have been
made in the DEC and CV series.
First, in preparation for this edition of the report,
the Food Balance Sheets (FBS) series produced by
FAO with the new methodology launched in 2020 have
been updated for all monitored countries. This entailed
a revision of the series from 2010 up to 2019 for all
countries, and up to 2020 for the 63 countries with
the largest number of undernourished people (NoU).
The revision reflects a backward revision of the FBS for
the period 2010–2019, using the same method to treat
stocks and non-food utilization that was introduced last
year and benefiting from additional new data on food
commodity stocks obtained from external sources. This is
part of a continuing effort to revise the historical series
of FBS in order to increase their consistency over time.
These new FBS series were used to revise the series
of the average DEC at country level, implying revisions
of the full series of PoU estimates. Of particular note is
the upward correction of the estimated average DEC in
Iraq, needed to reflect the fact that the total food supply
reported in the FBS for Iraq does not include production
and trade for the Iraqi Kurdistan region. The correction
implies a significantly lower estimate of the PoU and NoU
for Iraq and, consequently, for the entire Western Asia
subregion, compared with past reports.
Second, micro data from 18 household consumption
and expenditure surveys covering 15 countries and
various years* that became available to FAO last year
were used to revise the parameter referring to inequality
in dietary energy consumption due to income (CV|y).
As the values of CV|y are interpolated between the years
of available surveys, this new information induced a
revision of the entire series for the involved countries.
For some of them, such as Myanmar, the Philippines
and Sri Lanka, this has meant a significant, downward
reduction of the CV|y – and hence of the PoU – over

 Current estimates of per capita, average dietary
energy supply (DES), compiled on the basis of the
short-run market outlook exercises conducted by
FAO to inform the World Food Situation,5 were used
to nowcast the value of the DEC for each country,
starting from the last available year in the FBS series.
This meant nowcasting values of DEC for 2021 for the
63 countries that contribute the most to the global
NoU, and for both 2020 and 2021 for the rest of the
countries in the world.
 FIES data collected by FAO (see section on SDG
2.1.2 below) were used to nowcast the values of CV|y
up to 2021. As in previous editions of this report,
FIES data collected by FAO from 2014 to 2019 were
used to project the changes in the CV|y either from
2015 or from the year of the last food consumption
survey available, and up to 2019. Normally, the
projections would be based on a smoothed (three-year
moving average) trend in severe food insecurity.
However, recognizing that reliance on three-year
moving averages would very likely underestimate the
actual change in CV|y in 2020 and 2021, nowcasts
for these last two years were based on the actual,
unsmoothed change in the prevalence of severe food
insecurity from 2019 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021.
In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic may have
exacerbated inequalities in the ability of people to
access food, it may no longer be appropriate to refer
to the historically observed contribution of the change
in CV|y to the change in PoU (one of the parameters
used in the projections). For this reason, ranges of
values for the nowcasted 2020 and 2021 CV|y are
obtained by varying the corresponding parameter from
one-third to 100 percent of the observed change in
the prevalence of severe food insecurity captured by
FIES data. Further details and the ranges of the PoU
at the regional and subregional levels can be found in
Annex 2.

to 2020 and a total of 150 million more people
since 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Considering the upper bound of the range, the
number could be as high as almost 210 million
more people in two years.

Looking more closely at the past two years,
in Africa, a jump of more than 2 percentage
points occurred from 2019 to 2020, under the
shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed
by a 0.6 percentage point increase from 2020
to 2021. Similar trends were seen in Latin
America and the Caribbean and in Asia, which
experienced increases of more than 1 percentage
point from 2019 to 2020 followed by a further
0.5 percentage-point increase in 2021 (Table 1).

The numbers show persistent regional
disparities, with Africa bearing the heaviest
burden. One in five people in Africa
(20.2 percent of the population) was facing
hunger in 2021, compared to 9.1 percent in Asia,
8.6 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean,
5.8 percent in Oceania, and less than 2.5 percent
in Northern America and Europe. Africa is
also the region where the proportion of the
population affected by hunger has increased
the most. Since the launch of the Sustainable
Development Agenda in 2015, the PoU for Africa
has risen 4.4 percentage points, compared to 2.8
and 1.1 percentage points in Latin America and
the Caribbean and Asia, respectively (Table 1).

While the regional prevalence estimates reveal
the magnitude of the burden of hunger in each
region, translating them into numbers of people
gives a sense of where most of the people facing
hunger in the world live (Table 2 and Figure 3). Of the
total number of undernourished people in 2021
(768 million), more than half (425 million) live
in Asia and more than one-third (278 million) in
Africa, while Latin America and the Caribbean
accounts for close to 8 percent (57 million).

In Africa, 35 million more people were affected
by hunger in 2020 compared with 2019, prior
to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
with an additional 15 million in 2021, for a
total of 50 million more people in two years.
Similarly, 9 million more people were hungry in
Latin America and the Caribbean in 2020 than
in 2019, and an additional 4 million were thrust
into hunger between 2020 and 2021. In Asia,
the increases were of 58 million in 2020 and
26 million in 2021.

the proportion of the population affected by
hunger in Northern Africa in 2021 (6.9 percent)
is much smaller than in almost all subregions
of sub-Saharan Africa and somewhat smaller
compared to Southern Africa (9.2 percent).
In the other subregions of Africa, the PoU
in 2021 ranges from 13.9 percent in Western
Africa to 32.8 percent in Middle Africa.
Following increases in hunger in all subregions
in 2020, most have shown a further increase
in 2021. The PoU increased by more than
2 percentage points in Middle Africa for two
years in a row. In Eastern Africa, the subregion

to Southern Asia (16.9 percent), which is the
subregion in the world with the highest NoU –
more than 330 million. The general trend across
most subregions was of a steady decrease in
hunger between 2015 and 2019 with upturns
beginning in 2020. Southern Asia saw a small
upturn already in 2019 followed by a jump
from 13.2 to 15.9 percent between 2019 and 2020
in the context of the pandemic, and a further
increase to 16.9 in 2021. Relatively smaller

Inequalities persist despite the economic rebound

in 2021. Levels have remained around 10 percent
in Western Asia and 3 percent in Central Asia
for the past five years and below 2.5 percent in
Eastern Asia for more than a decade.

The further increase in global hunger in 2021
following the sharp upturn in 2020 is consistent
with existing evidence of the persisting economic
hardships induced by the COVID-19 crisis that
have widened inequalities in access to food.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the
Caribbean presents the highest proportion of
the population affected by hunger (slightly over
16 percent), compared with about 8 percent
in Central America and in South America.
However, in the Caribbean, after a general
upward trend in hunger since 2015, and a notable
increase from 2019 to 2020, the PoU remained
unchanged from 2020 to 2021, albeit still above
pre‑pandemic levels. In contrast, hunger rose
further in South America and Central America
from 2020 to 2021. The PoU has nearly doubled
in South America since 2015, where increases of
1.7 and 0.8 percentage points were registered in
2020 and 2021, respectively. In Central America,
the PoU has increased little since 2015, although
it rose 0.4 percentage point per year for the last
two years.

In 2021, the recovery in terms of GDP growth
has been highly uneven across countries, mainly
in detriment to LICs and lower-middle-income
countries (LMICs). While high-income countries
(HICs) are recovering at a solid pace with a good
prospect of regaining their pre-pandemic real
per capita income levels in 2022, LICs and LMICs
are experiencing a much slower pace of economic
growth, and most are not expected to return to
their pre-pandemic levels by 2022.6
Disadvantaged groups of the population, such as
women, youth, low-skilled workers and workers
in the informal sector, were disproportionately
impacted by the economic crisis that was triggered
by the COVID‑19 pandemic and by the measures
implemented to contain it. These groups were

in previous editions of this report, inequalities
are among the root causes of food insecurity;
thus, it is likely that growing inequalities in 2020
weakened the capacity of the economic recovery
to translate into increased food security, as is
reflected in the growing number of people facing
difficulties in accessing food.

larger in the absence of the observed surge in
social protection interventions. Between March
2020 and May 2021, as many as 222 countries
or territories had planned or implemented
social protection measures in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.12 Nevertheless, the coverage,
inclusiveness and adequacy of these measures
varied. Over 40 percent of the social protection
measures identified in the review consisted of
one-time payments, and nearly three-fourths
lasted three months or less – far less than the

scenario calibrated to reflect the situation of the
world economy in 2018/19 before the COVID-19
pandemic, and long-term prospects as captured
in the October 2019 edition of World Economic
Outlook (Figure 6).

Using the methods introduced last year (see
Annex 2), the projections of the NoU in 2025 and
2030 have been updated to reflect the current
assessment of the situation in 2021 (see Table 1).
Two scenarios are presented: a reference scenario
(hereby referred to as the COVID-19 scenario)
aimed at capturing the macroeconomic impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic as reflected in the April
2022 update of the International Monetary Fund’s
(IMF) World Economic Outlook, and a no‑COVID-19

The new projections depict a somewhat worse
situation compared to last year’s. The conjecture
that hunger would begin to decline as early as
2021, driven by the expected economic recovery,
did not come to pass. As discussed above, the
lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
consequent increase in inequalities, prevented
this expectation from materializing.

GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY16,17

The Russian Federation and Ukraine are among the
most important producers of agricultural commodities
in the world. Before the crisis, the two countries
together supplied 30 percent and 20 percent of global
wheat and maize exports, respectively. They also
accounted for close to 80 percent of global exports of
sunflower seed products. Furthermore, the Russian
Federation is a world leading exporter of nitrogen,
potassium and phosphorous fertilizers, whose prices
have been increasing since late 2020 because of rising
energy prices as well as rising transportation costs in
the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions
to agricultural exports caused by the war in Ukraine
have exposed global food and fertilizer markets
to heightened risks of tighter availabilities, unmet
import demand and higher international prices.
Many countries that are highly dependent on imported
foodstuffs and fertilizers, including numerous that fall
into the groups of least developed countries (LDCs)
and low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs),
rely on Ukrainian and Russian food supplies to meet
their consumption needs. Many of these countries,
already prior to the conflict, had been grappling with
the negative effects of high international food and
fertilizer prices.
In Ukraine, the escalation of the conflict raises
concerns over whether crops will be harvested
and products exported. There is also uncertainty
surrounding Russian export prospects, because of sales
difficulties that may arise as a result of financial and
shipping constraints. Such export shortfalls are likely to
elevate already high world food commodity prices even
further. FAO simulations gauging the potential impacts
of a sudden and steep reduction in grain and sunflower
seed exports by the two countries indicate that these

shortfalls may be only partially compensated by the
release of stocks during the 2022/23 marketing season.
Due to this high degree of uncertainty, simulations are
presented using two scenarios. In a moderate scenario,
which assumes an export shortfall in grains and oilseeds
totalling 24 million tonnes in 2022/23 and a crude
oil price of USD 100/barrel, world wheat price would
increase by 8.7 percent. In the case of a more severe
shock to global grain and oilseed markets (58 million
tonnes total export shortfall), the increase in the
international wheat price is estimated at 21.5 percent,
compared to the already high baseline level. Prices of
the other cereals and oilseeds would also increase, but
to a lesser extent.
Such export shortfalls may also result from damage
to inland transport infrastructure and seaports, as
well as to storage and processing infrastructure in
Ukraine. The impact is further compounded by limited
alternatives, such as moving goods by rail instead of
ship or switching to smaller processing facilities from
modern oilseed crushing plants, in the case of damage
to key facilities. Further increasing costs of maritime
transportation would compound the effects on the final
costs of internationally sourced food products paid
by importers.
A conflict affecting these important global
agricultural commodity market players, at a time of
already high and increasingly volatile international
food and input prices, raises significant concerns over
the potential negative impact on global food security.
FAO simulations suggest that under the moderate
shock scenario, the global NoU in 2022 would increase
by 7.6 million people, while this rise would amount to
13.1 million people above baseline estimates under the
more severe shock setting (Figure A).

SEVERE SCENARIO

BOX 3 (Continued)

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

A third scenario simulating the severe export shortfall from
Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 2022 and 2023,
and assuming no global production response, suggests an
increase in the NoU by close to 19 million people in 2023.
From a regional perspective, vulnerable
populations in sub-Saharan Africa and the Near East
and North Africa are the most at risk of increased
undernourishment due to the conflict (Figure B).
The low-income level, associated with the high shares
of food expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa, and the
particularly high dependency of the Near East and
North Africa diets on imported wheat, especially
from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, make poor
consumers extremely vulnerable to wheat, maize and
vegetable oil price shocks.
Besides the direct impact on global food supplies,
the conflict poses a number of additional risks that
will also impact agricultural production and trade.
As a highly energy-intensive industry, especially in
industrialized regions, agriculture will inevitably be
affected by the sharp increase in energy prices. With the
prices of fertilizers and other energy-intensive products
rising as a consequence of the conflict, overall input
prices are expected to experience a considerable hike.
The higher prices of these inputs will first translate into
higher production costs and eventually into higher food
prices. They could also lead to lower input use levels,
reducing global crop production, thus giving further
upside risk to the state of global food security in the
coming years.

The conflict and the subsequent economic
sanctions against the Russian Federation are also
likely to impact exchange rates, debt levels and overall
economic growth prospects. In April 2022, the IMF
released its World Economic Outlook, with global growth
projected to slow down from an estimated 6.1 percent
in 2021 to 3.6 percent in 2022 and 2023 because of
the war. This represents 0.8 and 0.2 percentage point
lower for 2022 and 2023, respectively, than projected
in January 2022. The IMF expects a severe double-digit
drop in GDP for Ukraine and a large contraction in the
Russian Federation, which can have worldwide spillover
effects through commodity markets, trade, remittance
flows and financial channels. Reduced GDP growth in
several parts of the world will affect global demand for
agrifood products. Furthermore, a lasting appreciation
of the USD, especially in the context of rising interest
rates in the United States of America, may have
significant economic consequences for developing
regions and increase their debt burdens. While the
full impact of the ongoing war on the global economy
remains uncertain at this stage and will depend on
several factors, the poor and most vulnerable countries
and populations are expected to be the hardest hit
by slower economic growth and high inflation, with
consequent increases in hunger and malnutrition (see
Box 5), as well as in the cost of a healthy diet. All of this
comes at a time when the world is still attempting
to recover from the recession triggered by the
COVID-19 pandemic.

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD

in Figure 6. While it is still premature to try to
quantify the impact of the conflict, given the
many different pathways through which it could
impact global food insecurity, Box 3 presents
simulations of the potential impact of the war
in 2022 that take into account two of the risks
induced by the conflict: the trade risk (reflected
in interrupted wheat and maize exports from
Ukraine) and the price risk (reflected in the rise
in prices of commodities and energy).

It is projected that nearly 670 million people will
still be undernourished in 2030 – 8 percent of the
world population, which is the same proportion
as in 2015 when the 2030 Agenda was launched.
This is 78 million more undernourished people
in 2030 compared to a scenario in which the
pandemic had not occurred. The projected
gradual reduction in global hunger by 2030 is
largely due to the significant improvements
foreseen for Asia, where the NoU is projected
to fall from the current 425 million to around
295 million (equivalent to about 6 percent of the
population), and to a simultaneous worsening
in Africa, where the NoU is projected to grow
from almost 280 to more than 310 million
(corresponding to slightly above 18 percent
of the population). For Latin America and the
Caribbean, the number of people affected by
undernourishment is projected to remain stable
until 2030 at around 56 million (which correspond
to about 8 percent of the population).

SDG Indicator 2.1.2
Prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in the population, based on
the FIES
Ending hunger is an urgent imperative for
the preservation of life and human dignity.
SDG Target 2.1 challenges the world to go further
by ensuring access for all to safe, nutritious and
sufficient food all year round. SDG Indicator 2.1.2
– the prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in the population, based on the FIES –
is used to monitor progress towards the ambitious
goal of ensuring access to adequate food for all.

At the time of writing this report, another crisis
looms that is likely to impact the trajectory of food
security globally: the war in Ukraine. As explained
in more detail in Box 3, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine are prominent players in the global trade
of food and agricultural products, in particular
of wheat, maize, sunflower, sunflower oils and
fertilizers in markets characterized by exportable
supplies concentrated in a handful of countries.
This concentration makes these markets, in
particular, vulnerable to shocks such as the one
that the current war represents. Several risks
emanate from the conflict that will directly and
indirectly impact global supply. Among them,
the risk of disruptions in trade flows, and the
resulting risk of soaring prices, are among the
first to consider. In addition, the potential risk
of reduced production levels of the next harvest
and logistical risks like those posed by damage of
transport, storage and processing infrastructure
are also to be considered. Taken together, they
cast a looming shadow over the prospect of
food insecurity in the short and medium term,
especially in impoverished countries, and
constitute a challenge to the achievement of the
SDG 2 target of Zero Hunger.

The FIES also enables the estimation of the
prevalence of food insecurity at severe levels
only, which provides a supplementary lens for
monitoring hunger. Although obtained using very
different data and methods (see Annex 1B), the
prevalence of severe food insecurity is expected
to correlate with the PoU across populations.
This is because people experiencing severe food
insecurity are unlikely to be able to acquire enough
food to continuously fulfil their dietary energy
requirements, which is the concept of chronic
undernourishment measured by the PoU.3,18
FIES data are increasingly available from
official national sources as a growing number of
countries have adopted the FIES as a standard
food security assessment tool. FIES or equivalent
experience-based food security data collected
by national institutions were used to inform the
estimates in this year’s edition of this report
for more than 59 countries, covering more
than a quarter of the world population. For the
remaining countries, estimates are based on FIES
data collected by FAO, mainly through the GWP
(see Annex 1B). Additionally, this year’s report
is also informed by FIES data collected by FAO

The unfolding crisis adds additional uncertainty
to the projections of global hunger levels in 2030,
which may well affect the projected scenarios

in 2021 for 20 LDCs, land locked developing
countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing
States (SIDS), all for which food security data
are scarce.19 In this sense, data collected for the
very first time in island nations of the Caribbean,
Africa and Asia, c for example, help to broaden our
understanding of the status of food insecurity in
vulnerable countries.

The prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity at the global level has been increasing
since FAO first started collecting FIES data in
2014 (Figure 7 and Table 3). In 2020, the year the
COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, it
rose nearly as much as in the previous five years
combined. New estimates for 2021 suggest that the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
has remained relatively unchanged compared
with 2020, whereas severe food insecurity has
increased, providing further evidence of a

points in one year to 57.9 percent, and severe
food insecurity increased 1 percentage point,
affecting nearly one in four people in the region
in 2021. An estimated 322 million Africans were
facing severe food insecurity – 21.5 million
more than in 2020 and 58 million more than
in 2019 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Globally, more than one-third of the total
number of people facing severe food insecurity
in 2021 live in Africa.

deteriorating situation mainly for those already
facing serious hardships.
In 2021, an estimated 29.3 percent of the
global population – 2.3 billion people – were
moderately or severely food insecure, meaning
they did not have access to adequate food (Table 3
and Table 4). Although the number remained
relatively stable between 2020 and 2021, more
than 350 million more people were affected
by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2021
compared to 2019, the year before the COVID-19
pandemic unfolded.

Differences at the subregional level in Africa are
noteworthy. The prevalence of food insecurity
in Northern Africa is roughly half that of
sub‑Saharan Africa; however, the food security
situation appeared to worsen more in Northern
Africa from 2020 to 2021. Within sub-Saharan
Africa, Middle Africa is the subregion facing
the highest levels of food insecurity and is also
where the largest increases occurred from 2020
to 2021.

Of those people affected by moderate or severe
food insecurity, close to 40 percent of them
were facing food insecurity at severe levels,
indicating they had run out of food and, at
worst, gone a day without eating. The global
prevalence of severe food insecurity rose from
9.3 to 10.9 percent between 2019 and 2020, and to
11.7 percent in 2021. An estimated 923.7 million
people faced severe food insecurity in 2021 –
73.6 million more than in 2020 and 207 million
more people compared to 2019.

Food security also continued to worsen in
Latin America and the Caribbean, although the
deterioration has slowed following a relatively
sharp rise in food insecurity in 2020. In 2021,
40.6 percent of the population was facing
moderate or severe food insecurity – an increase
of 1.1 percentage points since 2020, which
is within the margins of error. Severe food
insecurity rose 1.4 percentage points to reach
14.2 percent – an increase of nearly 10 million
more people in one year and almost 30 million
more when compared with 2019. The prevalence
of severe food insecurity in the region has nearly
doubled since FIES data were first collected
in 2014.

The estimated numbers of severely food insecure
people presented in Table 4 and of undernourished
people presented in Table 2 show similar trends.
However, the number of severely food insecure
people in the world in 2021, as well as the
increase in the number of severely food insecure
people from 2020 to 2021, are somewhat greater
compared to the estimates of undernourished
people presented in the preceding section, based
on the middle range estimate in Table 2. This is
because the indicators are based on very different
methodologies and sources of data. As explained,
the FIES data were collected directly from
respondents in surveys, providing timely and
robust estimates, while the 2021 PoU estimates
are nowcasts based on data on food availability
and access to food at the country level.

The rise in food insecurity in Latin America and
the Caribbean is driven largely by an increase
in South America. The prevalence of moderate
or severe food insecurity in South America
increased sharply from 2019 to 2020 (nearly
9 percentage points) and then rose at a slower
pace from 2020 to 2021 to about 41 percent.
However, there was a more notable rise in severe
food insecurity in South America from 2020
to 2021, bringing the level to over 15 percent.
In Central America, food insecurity levels have
remained relatively stable since 2020 following a
sharp increase from 2019 to 2020. The estimated
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity

While levels of moderate or severe food
insecurity remained stable at the global level,
differing trends were seen at the regional level.
The largest increase in moderate or severe food
insecurity between 2020 and 2021 was seen in
Africa, which also has the highest prevalence
at both levels of severity. Moderate or severe
food insecurity increased 1.9 percentage

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

in 2020 and 2021 for this subregion was slightly
over 34 percent. The Caribbean is the subregion
with the highest prevalence of food insecurity
(64 percent moderate or severe food insecurity
and 30.5 percent severe food insecurity), but
an encouraging downward trend was observed
from 2020 to 2021.d

Eastern Asia is the subregion with the lowest
levels of food insecurity and also appears to be
one of the few subregions in the world where
progress was made and food insecurity fell below
pre-pandemic levels in 2021. The prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity decreased
1.6 percentage points to 6.2 percent, and severe
food insecurity fell by half to 1.0 percent, levels
similar to many subregions of Northern America
and Europe.

The food insecurity situation was comparatively
better in Asia, where the combined prevalence of
moderate and severe food insecurity decreased
slightly from 25.8 percent in 2020 to 24.6 percent
in 2021. Nevertheless, given the size of its
population, Asia accounts for half the people
facing moderate or severe food insecurity in the
world – more than 1.15 billion. Furthermore, the
prevalence of severe food insecurity actually
increased to 10.5 percent. An estimated
37.5 million more people faced severe food
insecurity in Asia in 2021 compared to 2020 – a
larger increase in terms of absolute numbers than
in Africa. When compared with 2019, 112.3 million
more people were facing food insecurity at severe
levels in 2021.

In Northern America and Europe, the region
where the lowest rates of food insecurity are
found, the prevalence of severe food insecurity
increased for the second consecutive year since
the beginning of FIES data collection in 2014.
In 2021, 8.0 percent of the population of Northern
America and Europe was moderately or severely
food insecure, and 1.5 percent was severely
food insecure. The rates were slightly higher in
Oceania: 13.0 and 4.5 percent, respectively.
Small increases in food insecurity in Northern
America and Europe from 2020 to 2021
were driven mainly by increases in Europe.
Within Europe, a rise in food insecurity was
observed in almost all subregions, at both levels
of severity. The exception is Southern Europe,
where the combined prevalence of moderate and
severe food insecurity appears to have decreased
slightly, even as severe food insecurity increased.

The subregion of Asia with the highest levels
of food insecurity is Southern Asia, where
40.6 percent of the population was moderately or
severely food insecure in 2021. This represents an
increase of about 6 percentage points since 2019
and more than 13 percentage points in five years,
despite a 2.6 point decrease from 2020 to 2021.
Of the people affected by moderate or severe food
insecurity, half were facing severe food insecurity
(21 percent of the population). In Western Asia,
more than one-third of the population faced
moderate or severe food insecurity in 2021
(an increase of 1.9 percentage points in one year,
5.9 points in two years and 7.5 points in five
years), and nearly one in ten suffered from severe
food insecurity. Central Asia and South-eastern
Asia show similar trends and levels of food
insecurity, although the increases have been
steeper in Central Asia in recent years.

Figure 8 shows that, of a total of 2.3 billion suffering

from food insecurity in 2021, half (1.15 billion) are
in Asia; more than one-third (795 million) are in
Africa; about 12 percent (268 million) live in Latin
America and the Caribbean; and nearly 4 percent
(89 million) are in Northern America and Europe.
The figure also illustrates the difference across
regions in the distribution of the population by
food-insecurity severity level. Africa and Asia
are the regions where severe levels represent the
largest share of the combined total of moderate
plus severe food insecurity – 41.0 percent
and 42.5 percent, respectively – compared to
35 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean
and 19 percent in Northern America and Europe.

d Estimates are available for this subregion only for 2020 and 2021
when data became available for Caribbean countries whose combined
populations represent around 60 and 65 percent, respectively, of the
subregional population. The countries included in the 2021 estimate for
the Caribbean subregion are: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas,
Barbados, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica,
Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
and Trinidad and Tobago.

Different patterns in food-insecurity severity
also emerge when countries are grouped by
income level. Figure 9 shows that, as the income
level falls, not only does the prevalence of food

insecurity increase, but so does the proportion
of severe food insecurity over the combined
total of moderate or severe.
LMICs, which compose the largest portion of the
global population, account for more than half the
food-insecure people in the world. However, as
can be seen in Figure 9, LICs suffer a much higher
burden. With a combined population of only
683 million, LICs were home to 437 million
food-insecure people in 2021 – 64 percent of
the population of that country income group.
A large proportion of these – 44 percent, or
193 million – were severely food insecure.
In contrast, HICs were home to 93 million

Gender differences in food insecurity
There is also a growing gender gap in food
insecurity. Historically, women tend to be
disproportionally affected by health and
economic crises in a number of ways, including
but not limited to food security and nutrition,
health, time burden, and productive and
economic dimensions. As mentioned earlier
in this section, the COVID-19 pandemic had a

opportunities and access to nutritious foods. 20

long term, including more women affected by
anaemia, more babies born with low birthweight
and, consequently, more malnourished children.
Food security and nutrition targets will not be
met without addressing gender inequalities. n

Figure 10 shows that the gender gap in the
global prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity – which had grown in 2020 under the
shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic – widened
even further from 2020 to 2021. In fact, in every
region except Africa, food security among men
actually improved while it worsened among
women in every region except Asia. The increase
in the gender gap globally from 2020 to 2021 was
driven largely by the widening differences in Latin
America and the Caribbean, as well as in Asia.

2.2
THE STATE OF NUTRITION:
PROGRESS TOWARDS
GLOBAL NUTRITION
TARGETS

In 2021, 31.9 percent of women in the world were
moderately or severely food insecure compared
to 27.6 percent of men – a gap of more than
4 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage
points in 2020 and 1.7 percentage points in 2019.
The growing gap is most evident in Latin America
and the Caribbean, where the difference between
men and women was 11.3 percentage points in
2021 compared to 9.4 percentage points in 2020,
and in Asia (4.4 percentage points in 2021 versus
2.7 percentage points a year earlier). The widening
of the gap from 2020 to 2021 was similar for
severe food insecurity. In 2021, the prevalence of
severe food insecurity was 14.1 percent among
women compared to 11.6 percent among men
– 2.5 percentage points higher among women,
compared with 1.3 percentage points in 2020.

KEY MESSAGES
è Globally in 2020, among children under five
years of age, an estimated 149 million (22 percent)
were stunted, 45 million (6.7 percent) were wasted,
and 39 million (5.7 percent) were overweight.
Progress was made towards 2030 targets on stunting,
while childhood overweight was worsening.
è Stunted children were more likely to live in low- or
lower-middle-income countries (89 percent of the
global burden in 2020), reside in rural areas and have
mothers with no formal education. Nearly 30 percent
of countries representing each of the subregions
of Northern Africa, Oceania and the Caribbean are
experiencing an increase in stunting prevalence and
therefore are not making progress towards the 2030
target of reducing the number of stunted children by
50 percent.

This widening of the gender gap in food security
two years in a row reflects the disproportionate
impact on women of the economic crisis that was
triggered by the COVID‑19 pandemic and the
measures implemented to contain it, mentioned
earlier in this section. In addition to being
more affected by job and income losses during
the pandemic, women have also borne a larger
burden of the additional unpaid, unrecognized
caregiving, looking after sick family members and
children out of school. 21 Women are also often
more vulnerable to food shortages and scarcity
conditions in crisis situations like the pandemic
because they have less access to resources,
opportunities and information.

è Wasted children were more likely to live in low- or
lower-middle-income countries (93 percent of the global
burden) and reside in poorer households. Wasting levels
continue to be above the 2030 target of less than
3 percent in numerous countries, especially those in
Southern and South-eastern Asia.
è Overweight children were more likely to live in
lower-middle- or upper-middle-income countries
(77 percent of the global burden in 2020), reside in
wealthier households and have mothers with at least
a secondary school education. In terms of progress
towards the 2030 target of less than 3 percent, more
than half of the countries analysed in Western Africa
and Southern Asia have achieved at least 75 percent
progress, while overweight prevalence is increasing in

and impede the progress in achieving the 2030 global
nutrition targets. This calls for concerted efforts to
mitigate the effects on malnutrition.

the majority of countries analysed in Southern Africa,
Oceania, South-eastern Asia, South America and
the Caribbean.

è Globally, low birthweight decreased from
17.5 percent in 2000 to 14.6 percent in 2015, with
progress made in most regions. However, data gaps
are a challenge to global monitoring of this indicator,
as nearly one in three newborns in the world are not
weighed at birth.

Nutrition is central to the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. This report assesses
global and regional levels and trends for the
seven global nutrition targets. These include
the six nutrition targets endorsed by the WHA
in 2012 to be achieved by 2025, for which
extended 2030 targets 22 were subsequently
proposed by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF). Four out of the six indicators
were also selected to monitor progress towards
SDG Target 2.2, namely stunting, wasting and
overweight in children under 5 years of age and
anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years. 23 The
seventh target is to halt the rise in adult obesity,
which the WHA adopted as part of the Global
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of
Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) in 2013. 24

è Steady progress has been made on exclusive
breastfeeding, with 43.8 percent of infants under six
months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in
2020, up from 37.1 percent in 2012. Infants who are
exclusively breastfed are more likely to live in low- or
lower-middle-income countries (84 percent of the global
number of exclusively breastfed infants in 2020), in
rural areas, in poorer households, with mothers who had
no formal education, and are more likely to be female.
Most regions have achieved between 25 and 50 percent
of the progress needed to reach the 2030 exclusive
breastfeeding target of at least 70 percent.
è Globally in 2019, nearly one in three women
aged 15 to 49 years (29.9 percent) were affected
by anaemia, with stagnant, if not slightly reversed,
progress since 2012 (28.5 percent). This translates
into 571 million anaemic women worldwide, who
were more likely to reside in rural settings, in poorer
households and to have received no formal education.
Progress towards the 2030 target for anaemia of a
30 percent reduction is worsening across the great
majority of countries in almost all regions, particularly
in Northern America, Europe, Australia and New
Zealand, Oceania and South‑eastern Asia.

This edition innovates on previous reports by
providing a more detailed characterization
of the population groups most affected by
malnutrition. The global burden of malnutrition
is disaggregated by World Bank income groups.
Additionally, the inequality analysis examines
disparities across urban and rural residence,
household wealth, maternal and women’s
education, and gender. In this way, this report
unmasks inequalities that exist within and
between countries and sociodemographic
groups. These analyses and disaggregations aim
to shed light on the question: What population
groups are most affected by malnutrition?
This is a key aspect to inform the targeting of
interventions for inequalities that seem to persist
in the face of policies and programmes that are
ineffective or too small for the challenge.

è Adult obesity is on the rise in all regions, having
increased worldwide from 11.8 percent in 2012 to
13.1 percent in 2016 – the last year for which data
are available. Adults affected by obesity are more
likely to live in upper-middle- or high-income countries
(73 percent of the global burden in 2016), and the
prevalence is higher among women. Women with
obesity are more likely to reside in urban areas and
in wealthier households. More efficient efforts are
needed to reverse this trend.

Progress towards the 2030 targets will be
presented by looking into the summary of
progress made by countries or territories,
henceforth referred to as “countries”, for which
estimates are available within regions and
subregions up to the latest year.

and other emergencies such as the war in Ukraine
threaten progress towards ending all forms of
malnutrition. The number of malnourished people,

37.1 percent (49.9 million) in 2012 to 43.8 percent
(59.4 million) in 2020. Still, more than half of
all infants under six months of age globally did
not receive the protective benefits of exclusive
breastfeeding. There is some concern that
misconceptions around COVID-19 transmission
via breastmilk may have influenced breastfeeding
practices, but the full impact on trends is still
unclear. 27

presented below do not fully account for the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to
challenges in updating the nutrition indicators.
These estimates are based primarily on data
collected prior to 2020, as the collection of child
height and weight at household level was limited
not only in 2020 but also in 2021 due to movement
restrictions and physical distancing imposed to
contain the spread of the pandemic. Even where
nutrition data were collected during this time,
evaluating the full impact is not possible for
several of the outcomes. For this same reason,
estimates of childhood stunting, wasting and
overweight, as well as anaemia in women aged
15 to 49 years, have not been updated since the
last edition of this report, as available data during
this period do not provide sufficient regional
and global coverage, and thus results would
be misleading. Only estimates for exclusive
breastfeeding were updated. However, recent data
from 32 national nutrition surveys carried out
since 2019, including 16 conducted between 2020
and 2021, are reflected in the descriptive analysis
of the impact of inequalities on malnutrition,
presented later in this section, considering urban
and rural residence, household wealth, maternal
education and gender.

Stunting, the condition of being too short for
one’s age, is a marker for several impacts of
undernutrition and is caused by a combination of
nutritional and other factors that simultaneously
undermines the physical and cognitive
development of children and increases their risk
of dying from common infections. Stunting and
other forms of undernutrition early in life may
also predispose children to overweight and
NCDs later in life. 3 Globally, the prevalence of
stunting among children under five years of
age has declined steadily, from an estimated
33.1 percent (201.6 million) in 2000 to 22.0 percent
(149.2 million) in 2020.
Child wasting is a life-threatening condition
caused by insufficient nutrient intake, poor
nutrient absorption, and/or frequent or prolonged
illness. Affected children are dangerously thin
with weakened immunity and a higher risk of
mortality. 28 The prevalence of wasting among
children under five years of age was 6.7 percent
(45.4 million) in 2020, more than double the 2030
global target of less than 3 percent. Wasting is
an acute condition that can change rapidly and
is affected by seasonality in many contexts.
This makes reliable trends over time challenging
to present and interpret. For this reason, only the
most recent available estimates are presented in
this report.

Global trends
Trends in prevalence and absolute numbers for
the seven nutrition indicators are summarized in
Figure 11. The latest estimate for low birthweight
revealed that 14.6 percent of newborns
(20.5 million) were born with a low birthweight
(less than 2 500 g) in 2015, a modest decrease from
the 17.5 percent (22.9 million) in 2000. Infants born
weighing less than 2 500 g are approximately
20 times more likely to die than those with
adequate birthweight, 25 and those who survive
face long-term consequences, including a higher
risk of stunting, diminished intelligence quotient,
and increased likelihood of developing obesity
and diabetes as adults. 26 Updated low birthweight
estimates will be released later this year (2022).

Children who are overweight or obese face
both immediate and potentially long-term
health impacts. Immediate impacts include
respiratory difficulties, increased risk of fractures,
hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular
disease, insulin resistance and psychological
effects. 29 Long term, they have a higher risk of
NCDs later in life. Overweight has been on the
rise in many countries, hastened by increasingly
inadequate levels of physical activity and access
to highly processed foods, which tend to be high

Optimal breastfeeding practices, including
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months
of life, are critical for child survival and the
promotion of health and cognitive development.
Globally, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
among infants under six months has risen from

NOTES: 1. Wasting is an acute condition that can change frequently and rapidly over the course of a calendar year. This makes it difficult to generate
reliable trends over time with the input data available; as such, this report provides only the most recent global and regional estimates. 2. The potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not reflected in the estimates. 3. There has been a slight update to the exclusive breastfeeding indicator since The
State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021, based on the latest available UNICEF database. 4. Although 2010 is the WHO baseline for adult
obesity, to ensure consistency throughout this report, the year 2012 is used as the baseline.

distribution in 2012 and in the year for which the
most recent data are available are presented to
show changes over time.

in energy, fats, free sugars and/or salt. 30 Globally,
the prevalence of overweight among children
under five years of age increased slightly from
5.4 percent (33.3 million) in 2000 to 5.7 percent
(38.9 million) in 2020. Although not statistically
significant, rising trends are seen in around
half of the countries worldwide. Based on this,
and given the associated risks, this should be
interpreted with concern.

LICs and LMICs together carried the brunt of the
low birthweight burden among newborns both in
2012 and in 2015 (83 percent of the global burden
in 2020). Overall, the distribution of the burden
remained similar between the two years.

The prevalence of anaemia among women
aged 15 to 49 years, which was estimated to be
31.2 percent in 2000, signalled a slight downward
trend until around 2012, but then rose again to
29.9 percent in 2019. Meanwhile, the absolute
number of women with anaemia has risen
steadily from 493 million in 2000 to 570.8 million
in 2019, which has implications for female
morbidity and mortality and can lead to adverse
pregnancy and newborn outcomes. 31

Globally, most exclusively breastfed infants lived
in LICs or LMICs, with the combined portion of
the global number increasing from 78 percent
in 2012 to 84 percent in 2020. However, there
were insufficient data to examine the portion
of exclusively breastfed infants in HICs, and
therefore this group is not represented in Figure 12
for this indicator.
Part of the burden of stunting among children
under five years of age shifted from LMICs
to LICs between 2012 and 2020; namely,
from 21 percent to 24 percent in the latter.
Overall, stunted children are more likely to
reside in LICs or LMICs.

Globally, adult obesity nearly doubled in
absolute value from 8.7 percent (343.1 million)
in 2000 to 13.1 percent (675.7 million) in 2016.
Updated global estimates are poised to be
released before the end of 2022. However, it is not
yet clear if there will be sufficient data to reflect
how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted this
outcome. It is possible that movement restrictions
imposed to contain the spread of the virus may
have increased physical inactivity and sedentary
behaviours, which together with shifting dietary
practices towards unhealthy eating habits, may
have resulted in increased adult body mass index
(BMI) globally. 32

LICs and LMICs bear the greatest burden of
wasting among children under five years of
age, totalling 93 percent of children affected by
wasting globally.
The distribution across income groups of
the burden of overweight among children
under five years of age remained unchanged
between 2012 and 2020, with a similar number
of overweight children residing in LMICs and
upper-middle-income countries (UMICs).

The global burden of malnutrition varies
across country income groups, 33 and in some
cases, over time. The burden per income group
depends on the prevalence of the nutrition
outcome as well as the population size of that
income group; thus, both aspects are key to
interpret disparities. Although the income group
classification for a given country can shift over
time, the analysis presented here considers
the distribution of burden based on the latest
classification, looking at shifts that happened
across countries as per the income group they
are currently classified under.

There were no significant shifts in the
distribution of the global burden of anaemia
among women aged 15 to 49 years between
2012 and 2019 across income groups. In 2019,
74 percent of women suffering from anaemia
resided in LICs or LMICs, while one in five
resided in UMICs.
The distribution of the global burden of obesity
among adults across country income groups
remained largely unchanged between 2012 and
2016, with the largest proportion (73 percent)
residing in UMICs and HICs.

seven nutrition indicators by income group are

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD

This analysis highlights that LICs and LMICs
combined bear the greatest burden of low
birthweight newborns, stunted and wasted
children, and women with anaemia, keeping in
mind the fact that these countries are home to a
greater proportion of the global population.

determinant has an overall theme with various
subcategories. Enabling determinants include
subcategories for governance, resource and
sociocultural context; underlying determinants
include subcategories for food, health, social
protection, education, water and sanitation,
while immediate determinants include ten
subcategories of behavioural and nutritional
status. The framework’s left-to-right axis enables
users to identify, explore and assess numerous
context‑specific public-health pathways and
consider inequalities at all levels.

Potential impacts of current crises on
global nutrition
Global trends will likely be affected by recent
and ongoing crises, especially those with
global implications. Although the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic on malnutrition
are not fully revealed yet, either due to
data sparsity or the long-term impact for
some of the nutritional outcomes, negative
impacts on various forms of malnutrition are
expected at the global level. More recently,
the war in Ukraine has the potential to impact
malnutrition on a global scale. 34

Two country case studies attempt to illustrate
potential context-specific pathways of the impact
of the pandemic on child malnutrition, specifically
in Chad for wasting and Peru for overweight
(Box 4). Although data to provide evidence of this
impact is very limited, the exercise is useful to
explore the different pathways through which the
COVID-19 pandemic can impact nutrition.

Despite uncertainty around the impact of
COVID-19 on global nutrition, there have been
some simulation exercises based on different
scenarios to evaluate the impact of the pandemic
on child malnutrition using a limited set of
covariates and estimates based on historical
data. 35 The 2021 edition of this report provided
some projections based on these simulations
for child stunting and wasting.15 It showed that
between 11.2 and 16.3 million more children
under five years of age in LICs and MICs may
be affected by wasting from 2020 to 2022 as
a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
compared to a scenario in which the pandemic
had not occurred. For child stunting, it was
predicted that between 3.4 and 4.5 million more
children may be stunted in 2022 due to the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ongoing war in Ukraine risks increasing
the number of malnourished people, especially
women and children globally. This conflict
is intrinsically related to the impact on the
global food supply and hunger as mentioned
in Section 2.1 (Box 3). A recent article published
in Nature aims to raise awareness about these
potential risks and makes a global call for
urgent action. 34 A summary of this work is
presented in Box 5.

Spotlight on inequalities
In this section, we explore six nutrition
indicators through the lens of inequalities.
This is an important addition, as global and
regional patterns in malnutrition can mask
disparities that exist within and between
countries, including characteristics such as
urban and rural residence, household wealth,
education and gender. In an inequality analysis,
these are the population groups that are most
commonly analysed for comparisons between
countries and regions, due to their strong
associations with nutrition outcomes. The results
from these analyses help to identify the most
vulnerable population groups, contributing
to evidence that can inform decision-making
and effective action through the appropriate
targeting and design of policies and

More recently, a comprehensive analytical
framework 36 was developed by the
UNICEF-USAID-WHO Agile Core Team for
Nutrition Monitoring (ACT-NM) which focuses
on public-health pathways linking the pandemic
to nutrition outcomes related to the six nutrition
targets endorsed by the WHA. The framework is
built around five categories of factors relevant to
the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and
nutrition: i) enabling determinants, ii) underlying
determinants, iii) immediate determinants,
iv) outcomes and v) impact. Each category of

likely mitigating a higher impact on child wasting in
Chad.41 Nevertheless, wasting among children under
five years of age at national level appeared to be
on a downward trend from 13.5 (95% confidence
interval [CI]; 12.6–14.5) percent in 2018 to 12.0
(95% CI; 11.3–12.7) percent in 2019 to 9.5 (95%
CI; 8.9–10.1) percent in 2020 before reversing and
increasing slightly to 10.2 (95% CI; 9.5–10.8) percent
in 2021.42 The observed dip in wasting in 2020 was
likely influenced by efforts to mitigate the COVID-19
impact as well as the fact that the data collection
period was outside of the lean season (unlike the
other surveys). However, the observed reversal of the
downward trend in 2021 may indicate the degradation
of the nutrition-related environment.

Based on the ACT-NM comprehensive analytical
framework, the case studies below trace potential
pathways connecting multiple determinants and
factors that may impact wasting and overweight
among children under five years of age.
However, interpretations of potential impact should be
made with caution due to information gaps resulting
from the stringency measures implemented by
countries to control the pandemic.
A PATHWAY TO CHILDHOOD WASTING –
AN EXAMPLE
Chad* began implementing COVID-19 measures
in March of 2020, with its strictest in place from
April to May 2020 (Stringency Index [SI] = 88.9**).
In May and June 2020, 58 percent of communities
reported a deterioration in their ability to meet
basic needs – 11 percent of households reported a
loss of income, and 13 percent of households were
unable to perform farming activities due to COVID-19
measures.37 Meanwhile, the increased prices of major
food items impacted 68.7 percent of households, and
many relied on coping strategies including reduced
food consumption (35 percent), reliance on savings
(22 percent), the sale of assets (13.8 percent), or
reliance on less preferred foods (10.8 percent).37,38
An estimated 2.4 million people had insufficient
food consumption in early November 2020.39
Among infants under six months of age, exclusive
breastfeeding rates declined from the already very low
16.4 percent (2020) to 11.4 percent (2021), possibly
influenced by the fear of mother-to-child transmission
of SARSCoV-2.40 Many households were unable to
access necessary medical treatment in 2020 due
to lack of money, fear of transmission, and the lack
of available health workers.37,40 Wasting treatment
programmes were scaled up in late 2020 with a
10–24 percent increase in admissions observed from
the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021,

A PATHWAY TO CHILDHOOD OVERWEIGHT –
AN EXAMPLE
Peru implemented some of the strictest COVID-19
measures in Latin America with the most stringent
from May to October 2020 (SI = 96.3). These were
not substantially eased until December 2020
(SI = 59.3). The measures led to an increase in
online food purchases and delivery services of
pre-packaged foods as well as greater exposure to
the marketing of highly processed foods. This shifted
consumption patterns, notably towards an increased
reliance on unhealthy diets, often containing
processed foods high in energy, fat, free sugars and
salt. This negatively affected the quantity, quality
and diversity of diets in Peru. At the same time, the
stringent measures may have contributed to reduced
physical activity and increased sedentary lifestyle
practices including excessive time spent viewing
mobile phone, computer and television screens.
Nationally, overweight among children under five
years of age increased from 8.1 (95% CI; 7.6–8.6)
percent in 2019 to 10.6 (95% CI; 9.8–11.5) percent
in 2020.42

* In 2020, Chad was classified as a LIFDC by the World Bank, but the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation as evidenced by the INSEED and World Bank
National Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19 studies at the household level. ** Stringency index (SI) from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT). The stringency index is a composite measure based on the mean score of nine response indicators (i.e. school closures, workplace
closures, cancellation of public events, restrictions on public gatherings, closures of public transport, stay-at-home requirements, public information
campaigns, restrictions on internal movements, and international travel controls) rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest).

BOX 5 THE WAR IN UKRAINE THREATENS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MALNOURISHED PEOPLE,

ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN GLOBALLY

Call to six urgent actions to safeguard access to
nutrition services and safe, nutritious foods for women
and children:

The Russian Federation and Ukraine are among the
most important producers of key agricultural products
and inputs (fertilizers and crude oil). The bearings
of the war in Ukraine are uncertain, but its threat to
global food security is quickly surfacing. The number of
malnourished people, especially women and children,
is poised to increase steeply if concerted efforts are not
made to mitigate the conflict’s effects on malnutrition.
A recent comment published in Nature outlines
potential risks and also includes a list of urgent actions
to mitigate its impact.34 They are described below.

1. Support call to minimize restrictions on global food
and fertilizer trade, and disruptions to supply chains
to mitigate food price crisis.
2. Shield access to nutritious food for the most
vulnerable with nutrition-sensitive social safety
net measures.
3. Mobilize needed resources for humanitarian
assistance.
4. Follow through on Tokyo Nutrition for Growth
Summit (N4G) financing commitments to scale up
nutrition services for the poor.
5. Protect nutrition budgets and continue services of
proven nutrition interventions for women and children.
6. Invest in timely standardized nutrition data to guide
policy and funding.

Potential risks imposed by the crisis:
1. Direct impacts on food security and quality
of the diet through increased food prices and
reduced food availability and access.
2. Reduced reach of humanitarian assistance
and services for prevention and treatment of
acute malnutrition.
3. Reallocations of nutrition budgets to
other priorities.

The effect of this crisis has the potential to be long
term, affecting a generation of women and children
who are already vulnerable to malnutrition – with
implications for the human capital of communities and
nations spanning generations.

important gaps between population groups so
that no one is left behind.

availability for countries within each region.
Unweighted analysis was applied using the latest
available data from national surveys between
2015 and 2021. The list of countries contributing
to each region is presented in Annex 2C (Table A2.3).
Despite the limitations regarding lack of data
in many countries, as highlighted in the figure,
this inequality analysis presents important
information aiming to answer the question,
“Who is most affected by malnutrition?”

An inequality analysis according to urban and
rural residence, household wealth, education
level and gender as applied to six nutrition
indicators is presented using Equiplots in
Figure 13. Equiplots depict mean prevalences
for subpopulations within each category
of the respective inequity dimension (i.e.
type of residence, wealth, maternal education,
gender). They allow visual interpretation
of prevalence levels and distance between
groups, which represents absolute inequality.
The analysis was performed across United
Nations regional classification based on data

Inequality analyses for low birthweight are not
presented in this section due to data limitations.
Globally, a large proportion of newborns are
not weighed at birth, and there are disparities
across regions. In 2020, for example, more than
one quarter (27.2 percent) of newborns were

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

In Africa, the wealthiest quintile presents a
substantially lower prevalence compared with
the other four quintiles. In contrast, in Latin
America and the Caribbean, the poorest quintile
is lagging behind compared to the other four
quintiles, which means that interventions must
be targeted to this specific subgroup. Analyses by
maternal education showed a clear pattern across
all regions, with the prevalence of stunting being
highest among children whose mothers had no
formal education and lowest among children
whose mothers received a secondary or higher
education. Boys were more affected by stunting
than girls in most regions. Overall, stunted
children under five years of age are more likely to
be residing in rural settings, in poorer households,
with mothers who received no formal education,
and to be male.

not weighed globally, while 61.9 percent of
low birthweight data were missing in Western
Africa compared to just 1.4 percent in Europe. 42
Furthermore, low birthweight estimates
disaggregated by background characteristics
such as wealth, mother’s education and
gender are not currently available in global
databases. This is due to many factors, including
discrepancies in the availability and quality of
data among groups. For example, in LICs and
MICs, in most cases, a much lower percentage of
newborns in the poorest quintile are weighed at
birth, and birthweight data are often recorded
in multiples of 100 g and 500 g (data heaping),
leading to less reliable estimates and potentially
biased and misleading comparisons between
these groups. Lastly, more research is needed to
evaluate whether the current non-sex-specific
cut-off for low birthweight (<2 500 g) will bias
results for gender inequality analyses.

The prevalence of wasting among children
under five years of age does not vary greatly
based on urban or rural setting, household
wealth or gender, with the exception of Oceania
where children of mothers who received no
formal education are more likely to be wasted.
Overall, wasted children under five years of
age may be more likely to be living in a poorer
household and have a mother who received no
formal education.

The proportion of infants under six months of
age benefiting from exclusive breastfeeding is
higher in rural areas across most regions, with
the exception of Northern America, Europe,
Australia and New Zealand, where the practice
is more common in urban areas. It also tends to
be higher among infants whose mothers were
less educated, especially in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Although exclusive breastfeeding
was generally higher among households in
lower wealth quintiles, Oceania excluding
Australia and New Zealand (henceforth referred
to as “Oceania”) had the highest prevalence
among the second and fifth wealth quintiles.
Northern America, Europe, Australia and
New Zealand also lacked a clear pattern.
Slightly more girls than boys were breastfed
across most regions. Overall, infants under six
months of age who are benefiting from exclusive
breastfeeding are more likely to be residing in
rural areas, in poorer households, have mothers
who received no formal education and to be
female (Figure 13A).

Comparisons of overweight among children
under five years of age living in rural versus
urban areas do not reveal a clear pattern across
regions, while the wealthiest households have
a higher prevalence of overweight in most
regions. Children whose mothers received at
least a secondary education seem to be more
affected by overweight, with the exception
of the more developed regions – Northern
America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand
– where children with mothers who received
only primary education have the highest
prevalence. Boys may be more affected by
overweight than girls. Overall, overweight
children under five years of age are more likely
to be living in wealthier households and with
mothers who received at least a secondary
school education.

In most regions presented, the prevalence of
stunting among children under five years of age
is highest in rural residences, with the exception
of Northern America, Europe, Australia and
New Zealand. This difference is most pronounced
in Africa. The highest prevalence was among
households of the lowest wealth quintile.

The prevalence of anaemia among women
aged 15 to 49 years by place of residence
varies by region. In Africa, the prevalence is

higher among women in rural areas, while in
Latin America and the Caribbean, it appears
to be higher among women in urban areas.
Lower wealth quintiles and having either no
education or only up to a primary education
are associated with anaemia in most regions.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, however,
the highest prevalence of anaemia was among
women with secondary education or higher and
among households in higher wealth quintiles.
Overall, women suffering from anaemia are

more likely to be residing in rural settings,
in poorer households and to have received no
formal education.
Globally, mean BMI among adults is higher
in urban areas than in rural areas and higher
among women than men. 43 This suggests that
urbanization may contribute to a rise in the
prevalence of obesity globally, as the proportion
of the world’s population living in urban areas is
projected to increase. On the other hand, there is
| 41 |

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD

evidence that the obesity prevalence has increased
faster in rural than in urban areas, likely due to
the lack of access to healthy foods in LICs and
MICs. 44 Figure 13B presents results of inequality
analyses of the prevalence of obesity exclusively
among women due to the lack of primary data
at individual level for men with same coverage,
which would allow similar analysis. Of the
28 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
conducted since 2015 included in this analysis,
only 10 surveys also collected anthropometric
data for men (a men-to-women data availability
ratio of approximately 1:4). Based on this analysis,
more women 15–49 years of age suffer from
obesity in urban than in rural settings across
regions. The relationship between level of
education and obesity varies greatly, with women
with no formal education having the highest
prevalence of obesity in Northern America,
Europe, Australia and New Zealand, while in
Africa, substantially more women with obesity
had a secondary or higher education. In most
regions, obesity was higher among women from
wealthier households. Overall, women with
obesity are more likely to reside in urban areas and
in wealthier households.

with stunted child) was higher among richer
households in the poorer countries, while in
the richer countries, the risk was higher among
poorer households. 46 Effective double-duty
actions to address these burdens will be those
that are context-specific and that target those
subpopulations most affected.
In summary, this spotlight on inequalities
reveals that children in rural settings and poorer
households are more vulnerable to stunting
and wasting, while boys may be more affected
by stunting. Children and adults, particularly
women, in urban areas and wealthier households
are at higher risk of overweight and obesity,
respectively. Infants residing in rural areas, in
poorer households, with mothers who received
no formal education and female infants are more
likely to be breastfed. Women with no formal
education are more vulnerable to anaemia and
their children to stunting and wasting. The aim
of such analyses is to highlight how global
progress is hindered by the specific challenges of
different groups. Stakeholders can then identify
more contextualized inequalities to redesign
and target national policies and programmes
aimed at reaching the most vulnerable groups.
Addressing inequalities will be essential to
achieving the 2030 targets.

A subanalysis was conducted using the 10 DHS
surveys with data for men and women 20–49
years of age, highlighting substantial differences
in the prevalence of obesity between men and
women. Among the 10 countries located primarily
in Africa and Asia, e the mean prevalence of
obesity was 13.8 percent among women and
4.9 percent among men. The prevalence of
obesity was higher for women in all countries,
regardless of urban or rural setting or household
wealth quintile.

Progress towards ending all forms
of malnutrition by 2030
This section presents an assessment of the
progress towards the 2030 global nutrition
targets. Like the projections for hunger, estimates
regarding levels of malnutrition towards the
2030 targets are characterized by a high level of
uncertainty. The same approach applied in the
last two editions of this report was used to assess
the progress of the nutritional indicators, which
is based on the rate of change observed from
trends before the pandemic. Hence, this analysis
does not reflect the potential effect of COVID-19
on malnutrition, which will likely affect progress
assessment towards the 2030 targets, as already
indicated through projection exercises in the 2021
edition of this report showing potential effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic on stunting and
wasting.15

Many regions and countries are increasingly
facing multiple forms of malnutrition
simultaneously at the population, household
and individual levels, 45 and this double burden
of malnutrition can be associated with the
inequalities described above. For example,
results of one recent analysis in LMICs showed
that the double burden of malnutrition at the
household level (in this case, overweight mother

Global progress

increased slightly from 5.6 percent in 2012 to
5.7 percent in 2020, albeit without statistical
significance. A reversal in this trend will be
required to achieve the 2030 target. As with
obesity among all age groups, this will require
increased investments into effective interventions
to improve diet and nutrition as well as other
lifestyle factors such as physical activity.

Global progress towards each of the seven
nutrition 2030 targets is summarized in Figure 14.
Although the 2015 prevalence of 14.6 percent
among newborns suffering from low birthweight
was not far from the 14.1 percent required to
be on track for the 2030 target of a 30 percent
reduction since the baseline of 2012, available
data suffer from the limitations discussed earlier
in this chapter. Improvements in low birthweight
data quality and representativeness are needed
to reliably assess the severity and magnitude of
the problem.

The prevalence of anaemia among women aged
15 to 49 years increased from 28.5 percent in
2012 to 29.9 percent in 2019. Thus, the world is
moving further away from reaching the 2030
target of a 50 percent reduction in the number
of women with anaemia, which would translate
into a prevalence of 14.3 percent. Reversing this
trend will require an integrated, multisectoral
approach to determine and address all causes
and risk factors of anaemia in women, including
but not limited to those related to poor
nutritional status, gynaecological conditions,
malaria and other parasitic infections, and low
socioeconomic status. Increased awareness and
support are needed at the global, regional and
national levels to facilitate these comprehensive
approaches, in contrast with isolated
interventions which may not have a sufficient
impact on trends.

The proportion of exclusively breastfed infants
under six months of age increased from 37.1 percent
in 2012 to 43.8 percent in 2020; however, this falls
well below the 54.7 percent that would indicate the
world was on track to achieving the 2030 target
of at least 70 percent globally. Achieving this
target will require investments in effective and
context-specific interventions that promote
the adoption and sustained implementation
of exclusive breastfeeding. Enactment and
enforcement of the International Code of Marketing
of Breast-milk Substitutes, institutionalization
of the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative, and
scaling-up of antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding
counselling are critically needed.

Adult obesity continued on the rise from
11.8 percent in 2012 to 13.1 percent in 2016.
This trend will need to be reversed in order to
return to the 11.8 percent prevalence of 2012, in
alignment with the 2025 target to halt the rise in
obesity. In addition to improved diet and nutrition,
investments will be required to support public
health actions that promote healthier lifestyles.

Although stunting among children under five
years of age has decreased from 26.2 percent in
2012 to 22.0 percent in 2020, it would need to
have been reduced to 19.1 percent in 2020 to be
on track to reach the 50 percent reduction in the
number of stunted children by the 2030 target,
which translates to a prevalence of 12.8 percent.
Larger investments in both nutrition-specific
and nutrition-sensitive actions will be
required to ensure greater strides are made in
stunting reduction.

Regional progress
The progress achieved since the baseline
year of 2012 up to the latest year for which
estimates are available were compared with the
progress required using the Average Annual
Rate of Reduction (AARR) 47,f for countries
with sufficient data and summarized within
regions they belong to (Figure 15). This level of
granularity is useful to show that countries are
in a different status of progress within regions,
as within each region and subregion we can

The prevalence of wasting among children under
five years of age was estimated to be 6.7 percent in
2020, more than double the 2030 target of less than
3 percent. This estimate signals that investments
in the prevention, early detection and treatment of
wasting must be increased substantially.
While the 2030 target calls for a substantial
reduction in overweight among children under
five years to just 3 percent, the prevalence has

reliable trends over time with the input data available – as such, this report provides only the most recent global and regional estimates. 2. The potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not reflected in the estimates. 3. Although 2010 is the WHO baseline for adult obesity, to ensure consistency
throughout this report, the year 2012 is used as the baseline. The global target for adult obesity is for 2025.

target. However, nearly half of the countries
representing Southern Asia and South-eastern
Asia are experiencing a worsening situation.
Progress in lowering the prevalence of
overweight to meet the 2030 target varies
by region, with more than half of countries
representing Western Africa and Southern
Asia achieving at least 75 percent progress.
In turn, overweight is notably worsening among
most countries representing Southern Africa,
Oceania, South-eastern Asia, South America
and the Caribbean.

The great majority of countries across
most regions have made modest progress
(0–24.9 percent of the progress required)
towards the goal of a 30 percent reduction in the
prevalence of low birthweight by 2030 among
newborns. In contrast, approximately half of
countries representing Northern America, Europe,
Australia and New Zealand are experiencing a
worsening situation.

Progress towards the 2030 target for anaemia is
worsening across the great majority of countries
in almost all regions, particularly in Northern
America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand,
Oceania and South-eastern Asia. Meanwhile,
all 9 countries representing Middle Africa in this
analysis have achieved up to 25 percent of the
progress required.

Notable progress has been made towards
increasing the percentage of exclusively breastfed
infants under six months of age. In the majority
of regions, between 20 and 70 percent of countries
fall into the ≥75 percent category, that is, reaching
at least 75 percent of the total progress required.
In contrast, the situation is worsening in Oceania
excluding Australia and New Zealand, followed
by South America, the Caribbean, Central Asia
and Eastern Asia.

The progress in curbing the rise of obesity
among adults is not presented in this figure, as
the situation is worsening across all countries
where data are available. No progress is
being made.
In summary, although progress is being made
in some regions, malnutrition persists in many
forms across all regions and may in fact be
worse than these findings suggest as the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on nutritional
outcomes is still unfolding, and the full impact
is yet to be revealed. Reaching the 2030 global
nutrition targets will require immense efforts to
counteract severe global setbacks. Global trends
in anaemia among women aged 15 to 49 years,
overweight in children, and obesity among
adults especially, will need to be reversed
to achieve the progress needed to reach the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The majority of regions are making progress
in the reduction of stunting among children
under five years of age. Progress is notable in
Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Northern America,
Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and South
America, where more than 50 percent of the
countries included in this analysis had achieved
at least 50 percent of the progress required to
reach the 2030 target. However, nearly 30 percent
of countries in Northern Africa, Oceania and
the Caribbean are worsening, experiencing an
increase in stunting prevalence.
All countries representing Northern Africa,
Southern Africa, Eastern Asia, Central
America, Oceania, Northern America, Europe,
Australia and New Zealand have achieved
at least 75 percent progress in reducing
the prevalence of wasting to meet the 2030

Two high-level events took place in 2021 for
advancing the global nutrition agenda, the

aimed at delivering healthy diets for all

2.3
COST AND AFFORDABILITY
OF A HEALTHY DIET:
AN UPDATE

The key outcomes of the UNFSS include
national food system pathways developed
by more than 100 countries, which detail a
roadmap for transformative action and within
which the number one priority echoed by many
Member States is the need to deliver healthy
diets from sustainable agrifood systems. 48
This is also supported by the Coalitions of
Action such as those focused on healthy diets
from sustainable agrifood systems, blue foods
and school meals which unite global actors and
countries behind common visions.

KEY MESSAGES
è Diet quality is a critical link between food security
and nutrition. Poor diet quality can lead to different
forms of malnutrition, including undernutrition and
micronutrient deficiencies, as well as overweight
and obesity.

Moreover, the N4G outcomes support this
action through pledges to enhance political and
financial commitments that address food, health
and social protection system drivers to enable
healthy diets and end malnutrition in all its
forms. 49 More than half of the 396 commitments
made by 181 stakeholders across 78 countries
address food (63 percent). The commitments
recognize the need for coherent multisectoral
policies, linking the food and health sectors, and
for an increase in actions and investment, for
agrifood systems to support the shift to dietary
patterns that benefit nutrition, human health
and the environment. Integrating nutrition
into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) was
one pillar, where country governments and
multiple stakeholders committed to take actions
aiming at strengthening health systems with
a view to providing quality and affordable
nutrition services.

è The effects of inflation in consumer food prices
stemming from the economic impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic and the measures put in place to contain it,
have increased the costs and the unaffordability of a
healthy diet around the world.
è In 2020, the sharp increase in global consumer food
prices in the second half of the year translated directly
into an increased average cost of a healthy diet at the
global level, and for all regions and almost all subregions
in the world. The average cost of a healthy diet globally
in 2020 was USD 3.54 per person per day; 3.3 and
6.7 percent more than in 2019 and 2017, respectively.
è Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest
cost of a healthy diet compared to other regions, at
USD 3.89 per person per day in 2020, followed by Asia
(USD 3.72), Africa (USD 3.46), Northern America and
Europe (USD 3.19) and Oceania (USD 3.07).

Now it is important that Member States
implement their nutrition-related commitments
made at the United Nations Food Systems
Summit and the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth
Summit 2021 by intensifying their efforts and
scaling up their activities as appropriate under
the Nutrition Decade’s work programme. 50 n

è Between 2019 and 2020, Asia witnessed the highest
surge in the cost of a healthy diet (4.0 percent), followed
by Oceania (3.6 percent), Latin America and the
Caribbean (3.4 percent), Northern America and Europe
(3.2 percent) and Africa (2.5 percent).
è Almost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy
diet in 2020 – an increase of 112 million more people
than in 2019, reflecting the higher costs of a healthy
diet in 2020. This was mainly driven by Asia, where
78 million more people were unable to afford this diet,
followed by Africa (25 million more people), and to a
lesser extent by Latin America and the Caribbean and
Northern America and Europe (8 and 1 million more
people, respectively).

è The cost of a healthy diet will likely continue to rise
as food prices have surged in 2021, and into 2022, but
data are not fully available to provide updated estimates
in this regard. The likely trend in the affordability of a
healthy diet in 2021 and into 2022 is less clear due to
differences in income growth.

advance, as is common practice for all the food
security and nutrition indicators regularly
monitored in this report. Revision to the cost
and affordability of the healthy diet data series
this year includes the updates to account for new
income distributions, revised average percentage
of income that can be credibly reserved for food,
and a methodological refinement in the average
cost of the diet that is more robust, provides
greater transparency, and supports long-term
monitoring utilizing annually reported price
data. Box 6 provides a brief summary of these
revisions and implications (see Herforth et al.
[forthcoming] 54 for a full description of data
sources and methodology).

Diet quality is a critical link between food
security and nutrition. Poor diet quality can lead
to different forms of malnutrition, including
undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies,
overweight and obesity. 3,15 The 2020 edition
of this report included, for the first time,
global estimates of the cost and affordability
of a healthy diet. These are useful indicators
of economic access to nutritious foods and
healthy diets, which is one of the core principles
embedded in the definition of food security.

The cost and affordability of a healthy
diet in 2020
Table 5 presents the latest estimates of the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet updated to 2020,
representing the first global assessment since
the year the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly
across the globe. However, while affordability
estimates in 2020 reflect food price shocks induced
by COVID-19, the income shocks are not yet
captured due to the unavailability of 2020 income
distribution data in the World Bank's Poverty and
Inequality Platform (PIP). Therefore, the estimated
number of people who could not afford a healthy
diet might increase further once the availability of
2020 income distributions will allow accounting
for the combined effects of inflation in consumer
food prices and income losses, stemming from the
economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the measures put in place to contain it.

Reporting on the cost and affordability of a
healthy diet has brought global attention to the
fact that, in countries both rich and poor, low
disposable income relative to the high cost of
food is one of the most serious impediments to
accessing nutritious foods essential for a healthy,
active life. In the 2020 edition of this report,
the analysis showed that more than 3 billion
people cannot afford even the average cost of the
cheapest healthy diet. 3
The cost and affordability of a healthy diet
(CoAHD) indicators provide useful information
for national governments, international
agencies, civil society and the private sector
to work together towards improving people’s
economic access to a healthy diet and achieving
longstanding goals for global food security and
good nutrition. As mentioned in Section 2.2,
attention to ensuring access to healthy diets has
been increasing over the last decade, in particular
after the Second International Conference
on Nutrition (ICN2) in 2014 and during the
United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition
(2016–2025).

While global consumer food prices only began to
increase in May 2020, by the end of the year they
were higher than in any month in the previous six
years. This sharp increase in the second half of
2020 translated directly into an increased average
cost of a healthy diet in 2020 for all regions and
almost all subregions in the world (Table 5). At the
global level, the average cost of a healthy diet
in 2020 was USD 3.54 per person per day, which
represents a 3.3 percent increase from 2019, and a
6.7 percent increase from 2017.

FAO is continuing to systematically monitor and
report on these new indicators annually in this
report. Estimates in this year’s report are updated
up to year 2020 (see Annex 2E). In addition,
periodic revisions to the entire data series will be
carried out to refine and improve its accuracy as
new data become available and as methodologies

Between 2019 and 2020, Asia had the highest
increase in the cost of a healthy diet at
4.0 percent, followed by Oceania at 3.6 percent

GLOBAL ESTIMATES OF THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY OF A HEALTHY DIET54

apparent that this database will not be updated on
a regular basis. The best alternative is the national
accounts expenditure data from the World Bank
International Comparison Programme (ICP) database.53
The ICP reports each country’s expenditure aggregates
alongside the item prices used for other CoAHD
calculations in a way that readily allows computing
the national-average share of household income
that is spent on food. Based on this database, the
average percent of income spent on food in LICs is now
estimated at 52 percent.54

The CoAHD series are updated this year to account
for new information that FAO has received since the
release of the previous editions, as well as a refinement
in the methodological approach that supports long-term
monitoring objectives. These updates apply to the entire
CoAHD series, replacing the data reported in previous
editions of this report; therefore, readers are advised to
refrain from comparing series across different editions of
this report. Readers should always refer to the most current
edition of the report, including for values in the previous
years to the most recent year for which data are being
presented. See Annex 3 (Table A3.1) for the updated data
series of the CoAHD indicators by country for 2017–2020.

REFINEMENT IN METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
FOR MORE ROBUST ANNUAL MONITORING
A new methodological refinement is applied in the
estimation of the average cost of a healthy diet that
is more robust, provides greater transparency and
supports long-term systematic monitoring utilizing
annually updated price data.54 In the 2020 and 2021
edition of this report, the cost of a healthy diet indicator
was calculated based on the cost of meeting each of ten
country food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) in diverse
regions, representing a majority of the world population,
taking the median cost across all ten healthy diets.3,54
This method was employed to ensure that diet cost
calculations were directly based on FBDGs adopted by
national governments, incorporating countries’ individual
characteristics, cultural context, locally available foods
and dietary customs. This method resulted in an average
cost, but not a tangible basket of food groups and items.
Clarification of the amounts and types of food
represented in the cost of a healthy diet indicator is
important for transparency and better comprehension
of the indicator by users and is important for simplifying
the task of monitoring the cost of a healthy diet over
time. As an update to the original method, therefore,
rather than calculating the average cost of each
guideline, the cost of the average food group quantities
recommended in each guideline is calculated.54 This
refinement in the method of the cost calculation is
important because it is more transparent and tangible
as to what the cost of the diet contains (i.e. which food
groups and the amounts of foods in each), simplifies the
calculation while making it more robust (approximating
a larger range of FBDGs rather than only ten) and
minimizes the price data needs for monitoring the
indicator over time.

REVISIONS BASED ON NEW UPDATED DATA
The new data used to conduct the revisions to the
data series are reflected in two variables that inform
the affordability of a healthy diet: the country-specific
income distributions and the percentage of income
that can be credibly reserved for food.
For this edition of the report, updated
country-specific income distributions that are derived
from the World Bank’s PIP were used to revise the
2017 affordability of a healthy diet indicator.51 This
affordability indicator compares the average least cost
of a healthy diet with the estimated income distribution
in a given country, using income distributions from the
World Bank’s PIP. It is used to count the number of
people with insufficient income to purchase a healthy
diet and also non-food items. Income distributions
for 2017 are now available for all countries and were
used to update the 2017 estimate of the number and
percentage of people who cannot afford a healthy diet
in each country. As the affordability of a healthy diet
indicators were first presented in the 2020 edition of
this report, specifically for the year 2017, this year
naturally became the first (or base) year of the series.
The 2017 to 2020 series are also revised with
updated data for the percentage of income that can
be credibly reserved for food, considering that people
must be able to afford food as well as non-food items.
In the 2020 edition of this report, using the data from
the World Bank Global Consumption Database,52
this was estimated at 63 percent based on the
observation that this is the average percent of income
the poorest quintile of people in LICs spend on food.
In consultation with the World Bank, it has become

IMPLICATIONS OF THREE UPDATES ON THE
DATA SERIES
When only the updated cost method is applied, the
number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet
declines. However, the two other updates affecting
income have the opposite effect, pushing up the
number of people who cannot afford a healthy diet.
Applying both the new cost method and the updated
income distribution and household expenditure share
data from national accounts, the revised estimate for

2017 is that 3.05 billion people were unable to afford a
healthy diet, which is only slightly higher than the 2017
estimate reported in the 2020 edition of this report
(3.02 billion people in 2017).
Ranges of the affordability indicators shown in
Table 5, with lower and upper bounds that reflect
different assumptions about the share of income
reserved for food by country income group, are
presented in Annex 3 (Table A3.2).

(Figure 16a). In Asia, this surge pushed up the
average cost of a healthy diet to USD 3.72 per
person per day. Two subregions in Asia had
even higher single-year increases between
2019 and 2020: Eastern Asia (6.0 percent), and
South-eastern Asia (4.2 percent).

In 2020, the number of people who could not
afford a healthy diet in 2020 increased globally
and in every region in the world (Table 5).
Similarly, the number increased in all subregions,
with the exception of Northern Africa and
Western Asia.

Latin America and the Caribbean had the third
highest increase (3.4 percent) in the average cost
of a healthy diet in the same period, reporting
the highest cost in 2020 (USD 3.89 per person
per day). Northern America and Europe saw a
cost increase of 3.2 percent and an average cost
of a healthy diet at USD 3.19 per person per day.
Africa had the lowest increase in the cost of a
healthy diet between 2019 and 2020 (2.5 percent),
reaching an average cost of USD 3.46 per person
per day in 2020. The increase was highest in two
subregions of sub-Saharan Africa: Eastern Africa
and Southern Africa (3.4 and 3.3 percent increase,
respectively).

Between 2019 and 2020, the number of people in
the world who could not afford a healthy diet
increased by 3.8 percent (Table 5). Two regions
registered the highest increases: Latin America
and the Caribbean (6.5 percent) and Northern
America and Europe (5.4 percent). However, the
percent of the population who could not afford
a healthy diet was around 22 percent for
the former, and only 2 percent for the latter.
This compares to 80 percent in Africa and almost
44 percent in Asia (Table 5).
As a result of the single-year increases in 2020,
almost 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy
diet, an increase of 112 million more people than
in 2019 (Figure 16b). Asia, where improvements in
the affordability are observed between 2017 and
2019 (Figure 16b), accounts for the highest increase in
the absolute number of people for whom a healthy
diet is out of reach (78 million). All subregions
except Western Asia show an increase: Southern
Asia (35 million), Eastern Asia (27 million), h
South-eastern Asia (16 million), and Central

The affordability of a healthy diet measures
the average cost of the diet relative to income;
therefore, changes over time can be the result of
changes in the cost of the diet, people’s income, or
both. Rising food costs, if not matched by rising
income, will render more people unable to afford
a healthy diet. If food costs rise at the same time
incomes fall, this has a compounding effect that
can result in even more people finding healthy
diets unaffordable.

h This increase is largely attributable to China, which had a 7 percent
increase in the cost of a healthy diet between 2019 and 2020.

regional differences in consumer food price
surges are expected due to their different
production and trade structures, as well as the
speed of economic recovery. For example, the
Latin America and the Caribbean food CPI shows
the highest increase, at 23.5 percent between
December 2020 and December 2021, while in
Africa it was 15.5 percent and 14.8 percent in Asia.
In contrast, it was 6.4 percent in North America,
4.4 percent in Europe and 2.5 percent in Oceania.

Asia (0.5 million). In Western Asia, the number
decreased by 0.4 million. An average of 25 million
more people in Africa could not afford a healthy
diet in 2020. Specifically, this diet was out of
reach for 27 million more people in sub-Saharan
Africa – of which 21 million live in Eastern and
Western Africa – while improvements occurred in
Northern Africa with 1 million more people able
to afford a healthy diet. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, where 8 million more people could
not afford a healthy diet in 2020, the increase
was almost entirely driven by Latin American
countries compared to Caribbean countries that
reported a 0.5 million increase. The affordability
remained stable in Oceania while it worsened in
Northern America and Europe where 1 million
more people were unable to afford a healthy diet.

The likely trend in the affordability of a healthy
diet is relatively less clear, as this depends
not only on the cost of a healthy diet, but also
on changes in incomes. While the economic
recession that started in 2020 extended into
early 2021 for many countries, others turned
their economies around. As described in
Section 2.1, the economic recovery has been
highly uneven across countries, with LMICs
and LICs experiencing a much slower pace of
economic growth than HICs. For vulnerable
populations within countries, the COVID-19
pandemic has had deeper and more protracted
effects, aggravating existing inequalities
within countries. Global extreme poverty has
increased,11 as well as global income inequality.9
Among those populations who were already
unable to afford a healthy diet, increased prices,
together with reductions of income, will have
deepened their affordability gap, putting a
healthy diet, and among many even just meeting
basic food needs, further out of reach.

Affordability of a healthy diet in 2021
and 2022
The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
continue to exert inflationary pressure on
foods and are contributing to a mixed picture
of economic recovery among countries. At the
same time, the war in Ukraine is now adding
pressure by disrupting supply chains and
affecting global grain, fertilizer and energy
prices leading to shortages and fuelling even
higher rates of inflation. Global food and energy
prices are soaring and have reached levels that
have not been seen in decades. Global economic
growth prospects in 2022 have already
been slashed.

The comparison of cost and affordability over
time points to the important roles of changes
in income as well as prices in determining
affordability. The rise or fall of the number of
people who can afford a healthy diet in 2021 and
2022 will depend largely on the magnitude of the
increases in the average cost of a healthy diet,
whether incomes improve or decline and by how
much, and whether income inequalities increase
or fall. However, it is worth remembering that
many other factors can contribute to improving
access to healthy diets. There is much that
governments can do to promote better, more
stable incomes, protect non-market sources of
food provisioning, and decrease the effective cost
of nutritious foods. n

While it is not possible to update estimates
beyond 2020 at this time given that the core
data required are not yet available, the cost of a
healthy diet is likely to have continued to rise
as food prices continued to increase in 2021 and
are increasing into 2022. By December 2021,
the latest available global consumer food price
index (food CPI), which is the most relevant
food price measure for the cost of a diet, was
11 percent higher compared to December 2020.
Assuming the prices of nutritious foods follow
the same general trend as food prices overall,
a healthy diet may have already been pushed
further out of reach for many.
It is expected that the upward inflationary trend
will continue through 2022. However, notable

FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL

WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES
IT COST AND AFFECT
DIETS?

KEY MESSAGES

subsidies increasingly decoupled from production.
In contrast, in LMICs and LICs, fiscal space to provide
subsidies is more limited; moreover, these countries
commonly use trade policies to protect consumers
rather than producers.

è Given the setbacks in hunger, food security
and nutrition, and given the economic, health and
environmental challenges that the world is facing,
making healthy diets more economically accessible for
everyone is critical. To move towards this target, it is
important to examine the current policy support to the
food and agriculture sector in order to identify the most
needed policy reforms.

è Overall, support to agricultural production
largely concentrates on staple foods, dairy and other
protein-rich foods, especially in HICs and UMICs.
Rice, sugar and meats of various types are the foods
most incentivized worldwide, while producers of fruits
and vegetables are less supported overall or are even
penalized in some LICs.

è Governments support food and agriculture through
various policies, including trade and market interventions
(e.g. border measures and market price controls)
that generate price incentives or disincentives, fiscal
subsidies to producers and consumers, and general
services support (GSS). These policies may impact every
stakeholder within the food environment and, hence, can
affect the availability and affordability of healthy diets.

è Border measures affect the availability, diversity
and prices of foods in domestic markets. While some
of these measures target important policy objectives
(e.g. public revenue generation or ensuring food safety),
they can sometimes act as trade barriers for nutritious
foods undermining the availability and affordability of
healthy diets.

è Worldwide support to food and agriculture
accounted for almost USD 630 billion per year on
average over 2013–2018. About 70 percent of this
support targeted farmers individually through trade
and market policies and fiscal subsidies largely tied
(i.e. coupled) to production or unconstrained use of
variable inputs.

è Market price controls (e.g. minimum or administered
prices) mostly target staple foods like wheat, maize,
rice, as well as sugar. While their key objective is to
stabilize or raise farm income and ensure enough
supplies of staple foods, they may also implicitly
discourage the production of other foods that are
necessary for healthy diets.

è HICs and UMICs largely support agricultural
producers both through border measures and fiscal
| 55 |

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

è In many countries, fiscal subsidies to agricultural
producers have increased the availability and reduced
the price of staple foods and their derivates (e.g.
low-cost foods of minimal or no nutritional value). As a
result, the consumption and diversity of unsubsidized or
less subsidized commodities such as fruits, vegetables
and pulses, have been discouraged as they are relatively
more expensive.

In the specific case of SDG 2, it is important that
public support to food and agriculture starts
showing increasing marginal returns, including
in reducing the cost of nutritious foods and
increasing the availability and affordability of
healthy diets, sustainably and inclusively. n

3.1
STOCKTAKING: WHAT
POLICY SUPPORT IS
CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE?

è General services are public goods that can boost
productivity in the long term and could contribute to
food safety and food availability, and to lower food
prices, including for nutritious foods. Unfortunately,
expenditures on general services are just a small share
of the total support to food and agriculture. These are
still lagging behind the actual needs of the sector,
especially in LICs and LMICs and are often biased
towards staple foods.

How do governments support food and
agriculture?

è While subsidies to consumers take a very small
share of public support to food and agriculture,
nutrition-sensitive policies and programmes supporting
consumers have the potential to contribute to
increasing consumption of nutritious foods, especially
when they target the poorest or the most nutritionally
vulnerable people and are accompanied by food and
nutrition education.

Governments support food and agriculture in
different forms and using different types of
instruments that affect agrifood systems, as
presented in Figure 1 in Chapter 1. This third
chapter takes stock of this support, using
indicators available for some of the most
common policies, which are summarized in
Figure 17. These indicators reflect whether the
support provided is influencing domestic
prices or actors of agrifood systems are
benefiting from a direct public budgetary
transfer. Other policies explored further below
(Section 4.2), including land regulations, food
standards and labelling policies, can be part of
a government’s policy toolkit for repurposing
food and agricultural support to deliver
affordable healthy diets.

As shown in the previous chapter, the world is
facing major setbacks, with growing numbers
of people facing hunger and food insecurity
and increasing challenges to malnutrition in all
its forms. Many countries are not on track or
are even moving further away from reaching
their SDG 2 targets. Governments must take
actions to reverse this situation. There are
many policy options available to this end,
but the current recessionary context makes it
even more challenging for many governments
to increase their budgets and support to the
sector. Even under such a tough economic
context, however, much can and needs to
be done.

Trade and market interventions in this chapter
include mainly: i) border measures on
imports (e.g. tariffs, tariff-rate quotas and
non-tariff measures [NTMs]) and exports
(e.g. export taxes, bans or licensing, or export
subsidies or credits) and ii) market price
control measures, such as administered prices
(at which governments procure food from
farmers) and minimum producer price policies.
These interventions increase or depress
domestic prices relative to the border price;
as such, they can generate price incentives (or
disincentives) for farmers. In this report, price
incentives are quantified through the nominal
rate of protection (NRP) indicator (Box 7).

Governments will need to be ingenious and start
by looking at the current food and agricultural
support they provide to evaluate whether this
money can be reallocated more cost-effectively
and efficiently to achieve development
objectives. For governments all over the world,
the starting point is to take stock of their
support and then assess its cost-effectiveness.

Fiscal subsidies to producers are budgetary transfers
essentially from taxpayers to individual farmers
and can be granted depending on i) output
(i.e. transfers made according to the level of the
production quantity of a specific agricultural
commodity), ii) input use (i.e. transfers made to
lower the cost of variable inputs, such as seeds
and fertilizers), iii) the use of other factors of
production (e.g. capital, labour or land), or iv)
non-commodity criteria for which production is
not required (e.g. subsidies tied to environmental
or landscape outcomes or lump-sum payments
to all farmers subject to cross-compliance
conditions). When tied to the volume or type of
production or to the use of certain inputs, these
subsidies are defined as coupled subsidies. On the

contrary, subsidies are decoupled when farmers
are not required to produce a specific commodity
(or amount of it) or use certain inputs to become
eligible for the subsidy. The nominal rate of
assistance (NRA) indicator captures the effects of
these producer subsidies by adding them to the
price incentives provided by trade and market
measures (Box 7).

General services support (GSS) refers to public
expenditure (or budget transfers) for the provision
of public or collective goods. As such, these
expenditures are not directed to individual
agents, such as producers, processors, traders
or consumers, but they may benefit production,
processing, trade and consumption of agricultural

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

BOX 7 STANDARD INDICATORS OF SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
The nominal rate of protection (NRP) and the
nominal rate of assistance (NRA) are the indicators
most widely adopted to estimate agricultural
support. Their building follows a consistent and
consolidated methodology for policy measurement
originally developed by OECD,55 that is broadly
used by FAO and other international organizations
for food and agricultural policy monitoring around
the world.56
The NRP quantifies the extent to which
trade and market policies raise or lower the
producer price of a commodity above or below
the international reference price. As such, it
measures how these policies incentivize (i.e.
protect) or disincentivize (i.e. penalize) producers
and provides an estimate of price incentives for a
single commodity, a group of products or for the
whole agricultural sector.
Fiscal subsidies are budget transfers made by
governments in the context of policy measures,
projects and programmes to individual actors of
the food and agriculture sector, such as farmers
(fiscal subsidies to producers) or consumers (fiscal
subsidies to consumers).
The NRA measures transfers exclusively made
to farmers arising from price incentives generated
by trade and market policies (measured by the
NRP) and fiscal subsidies. In other words, the price
gap at the farm gate (i.e. the difference between the
producer price and the undistorted international
reference price) and fiscal subsidies to producers
(usually commodity specific) are summed up.

The NRP and NRA indicators do not capture
policies affecting the price of intermediate inputs.
The effective rate of protection or of assistance
(ERP/ERA) would be a more comprehensive measure
of policy support to farmers, as it also considers the
impact of policies that affect the cost of intermediate
inputs, and thus quantifies the net or “effective”
level of support to farmers in terms of returns.56 The
ERP/ERA are not presented here: their computation
is a very data-intensive exercise, and the indicator is
not available at large scale but rather used to assess
commodity specific policies and recommendations.
The main source of data for the NRP and NRA
indicators is the Ag-Incentives Consortium database
for the 2005–2018 period, which aggregates
estimates of agricultural support indicators produced
by OECD, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
World Bank and FAO for 63 countries (considering
European Union as a single “country”).
On the other hand, for the GSS indicator – which
measures public expenditures to fund the provision
of public goods to agriculture – and fiscal subsidies
to consumers, which are also analysed in this
chapter, data are not present in the Ag-Incentives
database. However, the data are derived from the
indicators produced by member organizations of
the Ag-Incentives Consortium, for the countries
they monitor.
Annex 4 provides the detailed list of countries
covered in the stocktaking of support presented in
this chapter and the methodological details on the
computation of the indicators analysed.

commodities in the longer term. This form of
fiscal support can target:

 infrastructure development and maintenance,
such as roads, irrigation and storage facilities;
 public stockholding, including the costs of
maintaining and managing reserves through
market purchase interventions, such as
government procurement from farmers, as well
as strategic reserves built for food security
purposes; i and

 agricultural research and development
(R&D) and knowledge transfer services (e.g.
training, technical assistance and other
extension services);
 inspection and control concerning agricultural

that food products conform to regulations and
product safety norms;

i This general service category does not, however, include public
expenditure for buying/procuring food for the stock.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

How does support to food and agriculture
affect agrifood systems?

 food and agricultural marketing services
and promotion, including collective schemes
for post‑production facilities and other
services designed to improve the marketing
environment for agriculture, promote as
well as reduce post-harvest losses and to
promote market exchange and trade (e.g.
promotional campaigns, participation in
international fairs). The food and agricultural
marketing discussed in this chapter is different
from “marketing” that promotes branded
products to consumers as defined by the WHA;
the latter is part of what is referred to in this
chapter as “promotion”.j

Governments may support food and agriculture
through the policy instruments introduced above
to pursue multifaceted objectives of agrifood
systems in the economic, social and health
realms. Among these, food and agricultural
support has the potential to affect the cost
and affordability of healthy diets, by shaping
production and consumption choices as well
as affecting food supply chain dynamics and
food environments, as summarized in Figure 1 in
Chapter 1. Both its objectives and the ultimate
impact of this policy support will largely depend
on the country-specific context, i.e. income and
development level, production structure and
volume, agricultural sector performance and
relevance for the economy, consumption patterns,
political economy considerations, impact of
climate change on agriculture, and the occurrence
of emergencies (e.g. humanitarian crises,
conflicts) that can affect safety and livelihood of
the population.

The GSS indicator accounts for all the public
expenditures funding public goods in the food
and agricultural sector (Box 7).

Fiscal subsidies to consumers are budgetary
transfers from the government (and more
specifically taxpayers) to intermediary (e.g.
processors, traders, etc.) or final consumers of
food. These transfers are meant to lower the cost
of acquiring food (food subsidies), to increase
consumer income (e.g. cash transfers) or to
provide direct access to food (e.g. in-kind food
transfers and school feeding programmes).

Trade and market interventions, for instance, are
usually adopted in a bid to support producer
prices and thus farm income (e.g. import tariffs),
or to keep prices low for consumers (e.g. export
bans). LICs and MICs often use some of these
measures to protect their farming sector against
import competition, or to influence domestic
prices for ensuring adequate supplies and
access to foods for consumers. However, border
measures, beyond affecting trade flows, also
influence domestic food production practices
and diversity of available foods (or lack thereof)
and can therefore imply important trade-offs.
By generating a gap between the domestic
producer price and the border price of a specific
agricultural commodity, these measures can,
for example, favour producers of certain crops
and potentially discourage production of others.
Measures such as tariffs also affect consumption
decisions as they raise the price of imported
foods, as well as their domestic substitutes
to consumers.

Some of the policy instruments described above,
particularly border measures and subsidies
on output and inputs, have the potential to
distort trade. For this reason, multilateral trade
rules play a crucial role in setting the global
framework that determines the policy space for
national agricultural policies. The World Trade
Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture
(AoA), which resulted from the Uruguay Round
of multilateral trade negotiations, produced a
comprehensive set of disciplines on member
countries’ trade and agricultural policies, seeking
to reduce distortions in agricultural markets.
The AoA contains binding commitments that
place limits on the use of tariffs and subsidies to
agricultural producers (Box 8).
j The 2010 WHA set of recommendations on the marketing of foods
and non-alcoholic beverages to children states that marketing refers to
“any form of commercial communication or message that is designed to
increase, or has the effect of increasing, the recognition, appeal and/or
consumption of particular products and services. It comprises anything
that acts to advertise or otherwise promote a product or service“ (WHO
[2010], p. 94). 201

Fiscal subsidies to producers are generally provided
to boost agricultural production and productivity
and support farm income by reducing production
costs. In MICs and LICs, these transfers are often »

minimal, trade-distorting effects or effects on
production, and must also conform to general
and measure-specific criteria as stipulated in
the Annex. These include public expenditures
on general services (such as research, pest
and disease control, marketing and promotion
services), government spending on public
stockholding for food security purposes and
on domestic food aid, and direct payments
to producers (for instance, income support
that is decoupled from production, payments
under environmental programmes and regional
assistance programmes).
 In addition, there are no limits on direct
payments under production-limiting programmes
(the so-called “Blue Box”, used by very few
countries).**
 Finally, some specific instruments can be used
without limits by developing countries only
(outlined in Article 6.2 of the AoA, the so-called
“Development Box”), for example, agricultural
input subsidies generally available to low-income
or resource-poor producers.

With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations in 1995, the WTO was established, and
the AoA entered into force. The primary objective of
the AoA is to discipline agricultural policies that create
distortions to production and trade, including tariffs
and certain types of subsidies. The AoA constitutes
the only legally binding multilateral treaty regulating
agricultural trade.
One hundred sixty-four members of the WTO
commit to not restricting imports of agricultural
products by any means other than tariffs and to
keeping their rates within set thresholds determined for
each country. These rates are known as bound tariffs.
The WTO also sets rules for the application of NTMs
that affect imports, such as sanitary and phytosanitary
measures (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT).
WTO rules also concern export competition.
Adopted in 2015 in Nairobi, the Ministerial Decision on
export competition essentially foresees the elimination
of export subsidies by all members by 2018, with some
exceptions remaining in place until the end of 2022.
An extended deadline to 2023 (for members holding
a “developing country” status at the WTO) and 2030
(for LDCs and the Net Food-Importing Developing
Countries) was provided to phase out subsidies for
marketing and transport costs for agriculture exports.
Agricultural subsidies are also regulated by WTO
rules. The AoA classifies “domestic support”* that
includes subsidies and other types of transfers to
producers into two broad categories: those that can be
provided without any limit, and those that are subject
to limits.

Measures that do not meet the criteria for these
three “Boxes” (referred to as “Amber Box”
measures) are subject to limits that apply to
the calculated Total Aggregate Measurements
of Support (AMS). “Amber Box” measures
are largely considered to distort production
and trade.
It should also be noted that apart from input
and output subsidies, market price controls
implemented through government programmes
that purchase from farmers at administered
prices may form part of domestic support
commitments and would therefore be included in
the calculations of the AMS.

 Transfers that are not subject to any limits are
outlined in Annex 2 of the AoA and cover types
of support known as “Green Box” measures.
Such measures must meet the fundamental
requirement that they have no, or at most

* In agriculture, this is any domestic subsidy or other measure which acts to maintain producer prices at levels above those prevailing in international
trade; direct payments to producers, including deficiency payments, and input and marketing cost reduction measures available only for agricultural
production. 57

and consumers and can contribute to food
security and improved nutrition in the longer
term. They may also affect farm revenues or
consumption expenditure indirectly. Though the
positive impacts of many general services take
longer to materialize compared to, for example,
border measures, price control policies or input
subsidies, returns of general services investments
on agricultural growth and poverty reduction are
recognized to be higher.63,64,65 Properly designed,
inclusive and sustainable investments in R&D,
marketing services and infrastructure can also
be effective in lowering the cost of nutritious
foods and improving access to healthy diets, as
discussed in detail in Section 3.2.66

as the limited availability of inputs, capital,
or credit. However, when these subsidies are
coupled to the use of inputs or to the volume of
production, like border measures, they can greatly
influence which commodities are produced and
marketed and/or the type and use of inputs with
important implications beyond the farm sector for
the climate, food security and nutrition, equity
and efficiency.
If provided without any condition, input
subsidies may, for example, lead to overuse
of agrochemicals and natural resources,
and promote monoculture, with negative
consequences on the environment and the
sustainability of agrifood systems. 58,59 As
discussed in more detail in Section 3.2, such
subsidies can also hinder positive nutritional
outcomes, in some cases by disproportionately
fostering the production of cereals in the long
term at the expense of other foods that contribute
to healthy diets, such as fruits and vegetables. 3
Moreover, these subsidies can be regressive if
larger farms are more capable than smallholders
of meeting requirements necessary to accessing
them. These potentially negative implications are
aggravated by the fact that, since these policies
bring about immediate and often very tangible
effects, they are politically difficult to remove,
once in place.

Subsidies to consumers, including food subsidies to
processors or traders, and those provided through
social protection programmes that include
cash transfers, food vouchers and in-kind food
transfers including school feeding programmes,
can have positive effects on different outcomes.k
These subsidies, if carefully designed, can
increase total household food consumption,
improve dietary diversity and nutritional
outcomes, as well as decrease poverty rates
(see Section 3.2 for more analysis).67 They can
also affect agricultural performance, since they
have the potential to alleviate liquidity and credit
constraints affecting investment and production
decisions.67,68

Policy support to food and agriculture is
significant but differs by policy instrument

Contrary to most types of border measures, fiscal
subsidies can also drain public resources that
could instead be invested in areas where returns
may be higher and benefits are longer lasting,
for example, in general services such as R&D,
infrastructure, or marketing facilities – thus
hindering efficient and more sustainable use of
often-limited public funds. 60,61 However, it should
be recognized that if designed with sustainability
objectives in mind, fiscal subsidies may contribute
to better production and livelihoods.62

Worldwide support for the food and agricultural
sector accounted for almost USD 630 billion a
year on average over 2013–2018.l Support targeting
agricultural producers individually averaged
almost USD 446 billion a year in net terms
(i.e. accounting for both price incentives and
disincentives for farmers), which corresponds to
about 70 percent of the total sector support and

These forms of support can promote production

Policy support to food and agriculture
differs across country income groups and
across time

about 13 percent of the global value of production,
on average. m About USD 111 billion were
spent yearly by governments for the provision
of general services to the sector, while food
consumers received USD 72 billion on average
every year (Figure 18).

The analysis of support by policy instrument
indicates that, overall, price incentive measures
and fiscal subsidies have been most widely used
in HICs and are becoming increasingly popular
across some MICs, in particular those at the
upper level of income. LICs have historically
implemented policies that generate price
disincentives for farmers to facilitate consumers’
access to food at a lower price. These countries
have limited resources to provide fiscal subsidies
to producers and consumers as well as to fund
general services that benefit the whole of the food
and agricultural sector.

Half of the support provided to farmers
individually were price incentives (USD 202 billion
net), while the rest (USD 245 billion) was
in the form of fiscal subsidies, the majority
(USD 175 billion) being linked to production or
unconstrained use of variable inputs. Less than
one-third of fiscal subsidies to producers
(USD 69 billion) were decoupled from production
(Figure 18).
m About USD 135 billion are implicit taxation on farmers, in the form
of price disincentives. This negative support or penalization arises from
trade and market policies that keep producer prices low (below the
international reference) in favour of consumers. Price incentives in
absolute terms are lower than the level presented in previous reports,
such as FAO, UNDP and UNEP (2021),1 due to the revision of indicators
provided by Ag-Incentives as well as the revision of the metadata used
for the computation of these indicators, in particular data for value of
production in countries that account for a large share of this segment of
support (e.g. Japan and South Korea).

Producer support
Despite wide variations within this group,
HICs have always accounted for the bulk of
support to agricultural producers around
the world. Seen through the NRA, in 2005
this support accounted for about 40 percent
of these countries’ total production value,

but the rate has significantly decreased since
then, to 24 percent in 2018 (Figure 19). The level
of producer support in HICs has mainly been
driven by decreasing price incentives (i.e.
as captured through the NRP) as part of a
long-term trend that started in the 1990s and in
particular, since the conclusion of the Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade negotiations that
led to a reduction in tariffs applied by WTO
members. Moreover, from a political economy
perspective, technology improvements with
reduction in production and labour costs
in agriculture may have also contributed
to making public support less necessary in
these countries. Despite the declining rate of
assistance and despite providing a not negligible
share (6 percent) of subsidies decoupled from

production, most support to farmers in HICs still
consists of trade measures that distort prices and
subsidies coupled to production.
In MICs, the profile of producer support is
quite different between the UMICs and LMICs
subgroups. In the former group, especially since
the late 1990s, agricultural support has increased
significantly, particularly in the form of price
incentives generated mainly by import tariffs or
other trade restrictions. In the most recent years,
this support, measured by the NRA, accounted
for about 16 percent of agricultural production
value (Figure 19). Out of this, fiscal subsidies to
agricultural producers accounted for just 5 percent
of total value of production – versus almost
13 percent in high‑income countries (Table 6).

China largely influences the aggregate support
estimates in this subgroup, given that seen as
a share of value of production, the country’s
support is not only rather high in its own right but
also relative to the other countries. China’s rate of
assistance turned positive in the early 1990s and
has followed an upward trend since then, driven
by increasing price incentives, especially for
cereals, to attain the country’s self‑sufficiency and
food security goals.1 Historically, fiscal subsidies
to farmers have been small relative to price
incentives, but these have expanded since 2005
and now account for about 5 percent of the
country’s total value of production.

farmers have constantly faced price disincentives
in aggregate terms (i.e. negative NRPs).
Input subsidies and expenditure on general
services such as in R&D and infrastructure have
been widely used as a means of compensating
them for the price disincentives generated by
trade and market measures, and for boosting
production and self-sufficiency in the country.
A similar policy support pattern is seen in most
LICs. Price disincentives have been narrowing
also in these countries, from -17 percent on
average in 2005–2012 to -9 percent in 2013–2018
(Figure 19). Policies supporting prices and
production of cereals, as a staple food, largely
drove this trend, in a bid to ensure food security
in the framework of self-sufficiency strategies
launched in the aftermath of the 2007/08 food
price crisis. Staple food production is also the
target of the few fiscal subsidies, usually on
inputs, provided to farmers in these countries.

LMICs and LICs have historically protected poor
consumers using trade and market policies that
keep domestic prices low, implicitly penalizing
the farming sector. Farmers in LMICs have
consistently faced price disincentives
(as reflected in a negative NRP) but have been in
some cases supported through input subsidies.
Other fiscal subsidies are barely used in these
countries (Figure 19). The magnitude of the negative
rate of assistance in LMICs has diminished
recently, averaging -4 percent in the latest
2013–2018 period, up from the -10 percent in
2005–2012.

LICs overall devote small shares of their total
public budgets to food and agriculture, compared
with the other country income groups, even
though agriculture remains an essential sector for
economic growth and job creation. Fiscal support
accounts for a small share of total support to
the sector: on average, subsidies to agricultural
producers accounted for just 0.6 percent of the
total value of production against 4 to 5 percent in
MICs and 12.6 percent in HICs (Table 6). A similar
trend is also evident in the expenditure for
general services, as analysed below, despite
commitments by African countries, for example,
to allocate at least 10 percent of their total
public expenditure to agriculture under the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development

The most prominent example of a LMIC is India,
where the food and agricultural policy has
historically focused on protecting consumers by
ensuring affordable food prices, through export
restrictions (on wheat, non-basmati rice, and milk,
among others) and through marketing regulations
around pricing and public procurement, public
food stockholding and distribution of a vast
range of agricultural commodities.69 As such,

Programme.70 Reasons for the limited fiscal
support to farmers in LICs are: i) their very
narrow fiscal space – which is largely determined
by limited revenue growth, substantial debt
burden and multiple sectors competing for scarce
resources, but also ii) the low budget execution
rates (one fifth of budgets on food and agriculture
are left unspent), especially for donor-funded
expenditures, where the share of unspent funds
is substantially high (around 40 percent). n 70 As
such, policy repurposing might not be a viable
or effective solution in LICs. However, future

research could identify additional measures
(e.g. international transfers financed by fiscal
measures in high‑income countries) to support
LICs in addressing challenges related to public
investments in food and agriculture.

General services support
Aligned with the trend described so far, also
GSS support, expressed as a share of value of
production, is lower in LICs (2 percent) compared
to HICs (4 percent) (Table 6). The composition of
expenditure on general services is also quite
diversified across income groups (Figure 20).
Services mostly funded by governments in
HICs are infrastructure, R&D and knowledge
transfer services; yet, inspection and marketing
promotion activities are also important areas
targeted by public investments. In MICs, a
sizeable amount of public spending covers

n Despite these challenges, a recent review of public spending on food
and agriculture in selected sub-Saharan Africa countries indicates that
following recent reforms, some large input subsidy programmes have
been downsized, increasing the fiscal space to allocate more funds to
general services and public goods, such as extension and R&D that
depict relatively high returns in terms of productivity and poverty
reduction, and generate more sustainable and broad-based impacts.70

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

costs of public stockholding programmes.
These are very common in Asia and the Pacific
(e.g. China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and the
Philippines) and, though their implementation
mechanisms may differ, they are overall aimed
at providing remunerative prices to farmers,
stabilizing markets, and ensuring food security
for consumers.71 Amounts spent in GSS are
relatively lower in LICs; support is concentrated
on funding agricultural infrastructure
construction and maintenance (with a special
focus on irrigation), on R&D services, as well as
on expenditures earmarked for forestry, land
management and environmental protection
(mapped in the miscellaneous category)
(Figure 20).70

Policy support differs across food groups
and commodities

Consumer support

The persistence of the staple cereals focus
in the food and agricultural policy in most
countries around the world is not a new trend.
Policies that promoted staple crop productivity,
including price incentives, crop specific input
subsidies, and grain procurement for food
security stocks, have been common since the
Green Revolution period.72 Historically, these
measures have contributed to hampering
farmer incentives for the diversification of their
production systems, as analysed more in detail
in Section 3.2.73,74

In line with the discussion above, countries
with higher levels of income provide support
to all food groups, and particularly to staple
foods, including cereals, roots and tubers,
followed by dairy and other protein-rich foods.o
In HICs, support within these three food
groups is equally provided in the form of price
incentives and fiscal subsidies to producers.
On the contrary, for fruits and vegetables and
fats and oils, fiscal subsidies (accounting for
about 11 percent of the value of production)
were substantially larger than price incentives,
on average, during 2013–2018 (Figure 21). p

In line with the fiscal support described above,
two-thirds of the world’s fiscal subsidies to
consumers (either final or intermediary, such
as that of processors) were disbursed in HICs.
On average in 2013–2018, these accounted for
4.6 percent of the value of production in HICs,
while in LICs they were less than 1 percent of
the total value of production (Table 6). Again, this
is an indication that HICs have more means
and resources to financially support agrifood
systems actors than LICs do. On the contrary,
LICs tend to opt more for trade and market
interventions to keep domestic prices low
in favour of consumers, as discussed above.
Subsidies to intermediary consumers are usually
provided only in HICs and UMICs, notably in
Norway, Iceland, the United States of America
and Kazakhstan.
Subsidies to consumers provided in LICs and
MICs most often take the form of in-kind or cash
transfers under social protection programmes.
India and Indonesia, for example, provide
substantial subsidies to final consumers
under the Targeted Public Distribution System
for grains in India, and the food assistance
programme (BPNT) based on electronic vouchers
for rice, in Indonesia. In some sub‑Saharan
Africa countries, subsidies to consumers have
recently increased, in some cases to the detriment
of producers, who have received less financial
support under existing budget constraints; cash
transfers, in-kind transfers and school meal
programmes have instead been expanded.70

o For the specific analyses done for Figure 21 and Box 11, “staple foods”
refer to cereals (rice, maize, wheat, sorghum, millet, etc.) and roots and
tubers such as cassava and potatoes of different types. The “dairy”
food group mainly includes milk, while “protein-rich foods” include
other animal source food such as meat of various types (bovine, pig,
poultry, sheep, etc.) and eggs, as well as pulses (e.g. beans and peas).
“Fruits and vegetables” include commonly grown fresh products like
onion, tomato, avocado, banana, pineapple, mango, among many
others. In the “fats and oils” group, soybean, palm oil and the most
common oilseeds are included. The “other” food group contains
important food crops such as sugar, tea, cocoa and coffee, as well as
non-food crops such as cotton, wool and tobacco.
p Based on data availability, the NRA indicator is analysed only for
these food groups in this report. However, it is recognized that further
data and disaggregation within these food groups (for example for
protein-rich foods and fats and oils) would be essential to strengthen
findings and recommendations around food and agriculture policy
support related to healthy diets.

such as all crops or livestock products; these were apportioned to the various food groups based on the product’s share in the value of production in the
relevant aggregate.

A deeper scrutiny can be done by looking at
support that targets single food products. q

LMICs consistently penalize production of most
products through policies that depress farm
gate prices, but these countries provide fiscal
subsidies to farmers, especially for staple foods,
fruits and vegetables as well as fats and oils.
Price incentives are negative for most food groups
in LICs, ranging from minus 7 percent on staple
foods (mainly cereals) to 1 percent for other crops
(e.g. sugar, tea, coffee) (Figure 21). These countries
have little space to support farmers through fiscal
subsidies, as discussed above.

q Products analysed in this section and included in Figure 22 are the
most targeted food products (therefore excluding cotton, for example)
with relevant policy support data coverage, i.e. NRA data are available
for at least 90 percent of the total production value of that specific crop
in each income group for the HICs and MICs, and at least 55 percent of
total production value in LICs. This is to minimize sample biases, as
products like fruits and vegetables and milk, for example, are
sometimes monitored just in a few countries (especially in LICs), and
therefore the single-commodity NRA indicator may not properly
represent the level of support of the entire country group.

Rice, sugar and meats of different types are
among the most supported commodities
worldwide (Figure 22). The main measures used
to support these products are trade and market
policies that alter prices and generate price
incentives for farmers. As already anticipated,
these measures are not always aligned with
healthy diets and can potentially generate
(relative) disincentives towards producing more
fruits and vegetables, for example, as farmers
are prompted to produce crops that face lower
competition and fetch higher prices. Moreover,
in LICs and LMICs, some fruits and vegetables,
such as bananas, mango and onions fetched
price disincentives on average over the 2013–2018
period (Figure 22). While this may raise a concern

on the supply side, it should be recognized that
in a scenario of relatively low domestic prices (i.e.
lower than the international reference, as defined
by the NRP), these products may result more
affordable for consumers.
Rice production receives significant support
worldwide: farmers enjoy relatively high price
incentives across all the income groups (Figure 22).
These incentives represent over 70 percent of
value of production in HICs, mainly driven
by some Asian countries (e.g. Japan and South
Korea) that largely support production of this
key commodity through border and domestic
price control measures. Rice tends to be a high
emission-intensive commodity, which provides

BOX 9 THE IMPORTANCE OF FISH AND FISHERY PRODUCTS FOR HEALTHY DIETS AND THE ROLE OF
FISHERIES SUBSIDIES IN POLICY REPURPOSING EFFORTS
changes in how, by whom and for whom fish and
fishery products are produced, processed and
distributed – with positive ripple effects felt throughout
the global food system. The International Year of
Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture 2022 will be a
unique opportunity to showcase the implementation
of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable
Small-Scale Fisheries in the context of Food and Poverty
Eradication.81

Fish and other aquatic foods are a unique source of
essential omega-3 fatty acids, as well as being rich in
vitamins, minerals and animal high-quality proteins.
Moreover, consumption of aquatic animals with
plant-source foods increases the absorption of nutrients
such as zinc and iron.75,76 Despite reductions in the use
of small fish in animal feeds, there is still competing use
of these fish for fishmeal and fish oil, which may in some
regions impact nutritionally vulnerable populations.
In many areas of the world, small indigenous fish
species are consumed entirely (including head, eyes,
bones and viscera) and are an essential source of
micronutrients. In comparison, species such as tilapia,
tuna or salmon, are often consumed only for their
fillets, which represent from 30–70 percent of the
fish, with the remainder being discarded.77,78 Simple
processing technologies can convert heads and bones
into nutritious and delicious products, for example, tuna
frame powder, which was found to be highly acceptable
to schoolchildren in Ghana when added to traditional
recipes in school meals.79

FISHERIES SUBSIDIES NEGOTIATIONS AT THE
WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO)
Overfishing is a pressing challenge for sustainable
development, as it can harm the aquatic environment
through, for example, species’ extinctions and
variations in oceans’ biomass levels and can prejudice
vulnerable communities who depend on fish and fish
products for nutrition, food security and livelihoods.
Fisheries’ subsidies that increase fishing capacity
and potentially incentivize overfishing contribute
significantly to this problem. These may also fuel
unfair competition between large fleets and individual
artisanal fishermen, fostering inequality.
Fisheries’ subsidies discipline has been the subject
of the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules since the
Doha Development Agenda in 2001, with an agreed
negotiating mandate in 2005, during the WTO Hong
Kong Ministerial Conference. This mandate calls
to eliminate subsidies for illegal, unreported and
unregulated (IUU) fishing and prohibit certain forms
of fisheries’ subsidies that contribute to overcapacity
and overfishing, stating that special and differential
treatment for developing and LDCs is an integral
part of the negotiations. After the WTO mandate was
established, the global call on the 2030 Agenda set
the SDGs, with SDG 14.6 targeting prohibition and
elimination of fisheries’ subsidies, based on the same
pillars negotiated at the WTO and even reinforcing
its mandate.
The associated benefits of having multilateral
rules on fisheries’ subsidies dealing with IUU fishing,
overcapacity and overfishing go beyond trade and the
environment. Repurposing fisheries’ subsidies through
a holistic approach based on scientific evidence can
increase the availability of sustainable and nutritious
food, as well as reduce the unfair competition that
some small-scale fisheries often face.

SMALL IN SCALE, BUT BIG IN VALUE: SMALL-SCALE
FISHERIES CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTHY AGRIFOOD
SYSTEMS
At least 40 percent of global fisheries catch is estimated
to originate from small-scale fisheries, and about
one-third of this comes from inland fisheries.80 Small
pelagics, such as sardines, herrings and anchovies,
and other pelagic fish such as mackerels, scads and
tunas account for almost 50 percent of the total marine
small-scale fisheries catch. Small-scale fisheries play
a critical role in the realization of the right to adequate
food: over 95 percent of all small-scale landings are
destined for local consumption.81 Consumption of
fish from small-scale fisheries landings could provide
50 percent of the recommended daily intake of
omega-3 fatty acids to 150 million women in Africa and
773 million women in Asia.*80
The livelihood of about 492 million people in the
world depends – at least partially – on small-scale
fisheries. Small-scale fisheries account for 90 percent
of all of those employed in capture fisheries along
the value chain, and 53 million people engage in
subsistence fishing with a significant share being
women. As such, small-scale fishers and fish workers
hold enormous potential to promote transformative

* The Global Action Network on Sustainable Food from the Oceans and Inland Waters for Food Security and Nutrition has been convened under the UN

AGRICULTURAL POLICIES
AFFECTING DIETS?

» calories but few micronutrients. However, being
a staple food for more than 3 billion people
in the world, it requires careful and special
consideration when policymakers assess the
most appropriate policy reform and repurposing
options, in order to avert trade-offs with food
security. The same consideration applies to
animal source foods products like milk and
beef, which can contribute to improving the diet
quality and nutrition in some LICs and LMICs
contexts but are often overconsumed in HICs
with negative health implications. It is precisely
in HICs and UMICs that production of these
livestock-derived products is relatively more
supported, as indicated by an average NRA of
about 11 percent across these two income groups
during 2013–2018.

Towards an understanding of the
differences between healthy diets and
unhealthy diets

To understand how existing food and agricultural
policy support is affecting diets, it is first
necessary to understand the differences between
what is meant by healthy diets and unhealthy
diets. The 2020 edition of this report looked
closely at what constitutes a healthy diet through
its examination of the evolving view of diet in
the food security and nutrition debate, which is
summarized in this section.

Some LICs have provided price incentives to
selected staple foods, i.e. wheat and rice but
disincentives for others, like maize (Figure 22).
In some cases, input subsidies schemes were
also implemented, notably for maize (mostly
in Malawi) and wheat (in Rwanda) production.
Price incentives for rice were particularly high in
Eastern African countries (e.g. Burundi, Rwanda
and Uganda) in the 2013–2018 period. Milk,
cashew nut and bananas were instead among the
most penalized products (Figure 22).

The exact make-up of a healthy diet varies
depending on individual characteristics, cultural
context, local availability of food, climatic
and ecological conditions, dietary customs
and preferences. The basic principles of what
constitutes a healthy diet, however, are common
across context and are clearly agreed upon
and outlined (Box 10). One key element of diet
quality is dietary diversity, or the variety of
foods from different food groups that make up
the diet. Eating a larger variety of foods across
food groups is associated with decreased risk
of insufficient intake of several micronutrients
and related deficiencies. 30 Consuming a healthy
diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent
against all forms of malnutrition, favours child
growth and development, and protects against
diet-related NCDs such as diabetes, heart disease,
stroke and cancer. 30 Prevention of all forms of
malnutrition is linked with adult productivity
and is vital, therefore, for the development of
nations. 82

Other commodities of critical importance for the
livelihoods, food security and nutrition of billions
of people around the world are fishery and
aquaculture products, for which, unfortunately,
there are no consistent policy support indicators.
Fish and other aquatic foods play a pivotal role
in healthy diets; in many countries, indeed, they
provide the animal protein required to consume
the least costly healthy diet. Small-scale artisanal
fishers and fish workers produce a large portion
of these foods and represent a large proportion
of the workforce in many countries ( Box 9).
Overfishing is a pressing challenge for agrifood
systems and the environment. Fishery subsidies
could exacerbate overfishing as well as illegal
and unequal practices. There is an urgent need
for gathering and developing data to understand
the level and type of public support directed to
these products important for healthy diets, as
repurposing strategies in many countries must
account for these considerations ( Box 9). n

Unhealthy diets – those that do not meet the basic
principles outlined in Box 10 – tend to be low in a
variety of essential nutrients and often high in fat
(especially trans or saturated fats), sugars and/or
salt. Consumption of unhealthy diets may be due
to constrained access to a variety of nutritious
foods due to economic or other factors, and/or to
knowledge, preferences, motivations, traditions

In this report, nutritious foods are referred to as
safe foods that contribute essential nutrients such
as vitamins and minerals (micronutrients), fibre
and other components to healthy diets that are
beneficial for growth, and health and development,
guarding against malnutrition. In nutritious foods,
the presence of nutrients of public health concern
including saturated fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium
is minimized, industrially produced transfats are
eliminated, and salt is iodized.83

 include wholegrains, legumes, nuts and an

According to WHO, healthy diets include less than
30 percent of total energy intake from fats, with a
shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats
to unsaturated fats and the elimination of industrial
transfats; less than 10 percent of total energy intake
from free sugars (preferably less than 5 percent);
consumption of at least 400 g of fruits and
vegetables per day; and not more than 5 g per day of
salt (to be iodized).30

* Food processing can be beneficial for the promotion of high-quality diets; it can make food more available as well as safer. However, highly processed
foods can contain very high densities of salt, free sugars and saturated or transfats, and these products, when consumed in high amounts, can undermine
diet quality. Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey,
syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. 30 ** Potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy roots are not classified as fruits or vegetables.

and similar factors. Progressing from unhealthy
to healthy diets, therefore, requires concerted
and simultaneous efforts to address supply and
access considerations, enabling healthy food
environments as well as the promotion of healthy
diets through education, behaviour change and
enabling healthy food environments.

of foods, producer’s incomes, and consumption
decisions, among others. Hence, any support to
food and agriculture through these policies can
potentially trigger shifts in the availability of
different foods and in the affordability of healthy
diets, which in turn can affect dietary patterns. 3,15
The empirical literature reveals that policy
support to food and agricultural production,
e.g. in the form of fiscal subsidies or border and
market measures to protect producers from price
volatility or competition, may bring positive
effects on beneficiary producers, such as on their
incomes. 85 These policies, however, may have
negative implications on the ability of consumers,
in particular the poor, to access healthy diets and »

COST OF A HEALTHY DIET

they might penalize consumers who pay higher
prices to acquire the tariff-protected foods and put
them at risk of not affording a healthy diet. If higher
protection goes to producers of the most expensive
components of a healthy diet, namely fruits and
vegetables and protein-rich foods that account for
46 and 35 percent of the cost, respectively,
consumers may decide to switch consumption to
relatively cheaper food groups.
Government support to general services that
include R&D of new technologies, infrastructure and
institutional reforms, could lower the cost and improve
the affordability of foods.66,86 For example, investments
in improved infrastructures to decrease transport
costs may help lower food prices and diet costs more
effectively than trade restrictions.ii Furthermore,
investing more in the general services while also
reorienting agricultural subsidies could benefit
producers and increase the affordability of a healthy
diet for consumers (see Section 4.1).

Trade and market policies, measured by NRP, that raise
the price of a commodity relative to the international
one, are associated with a higher cost of a healthy
diet for consumers.* This is shown by the positive and
significant correlation coefficient (30 percent) between
the NRP and the cost of a healthy diet (Table A, column
1).** When the NRP is calculated by different food
groups that contribute to a healthy diet, higher rates of
protection (or price incentives) to producers of fruits
and vegetables and staple foods (mainly cereals) are
associated with a higher cost for these specific items
for consumers and with a higher cost for a healthy diet
as a whole
(Table A, columns 3-4).***
Although the NRP indicator captures a variety
of policies, results in Table A suggest that a specific
group of policies designed to protect domestic
producers may ultimately translate into a higher cost
of foods for consumers at the marketplace. As an
example, while policies like import tariffs protect
producer prices from international competition,

» dietary diversity, since they affect the relative

more diversified diets, including the access
to fresh foods. 89 For example, countries like
Denmark, the Maldives and Mauritania imported
more than three-quarters of the quantity of fruits
and vegetables available for domestic consumption
in 2019.90 At the same time, food trade is often also
associated with increased availability of highly
processed, energy-dense foods that are high in
fats, sugars and/or salt. 89 Similarly, while trade
can help with climate adaptation by stabilizing
markets and reallocating food from surplus
to deficit regions, 91 production for exports can
generate negative environmental externalities,
such as unsustainable freshwater withdrawals,
pollution, biodiversity loss, deforestation and
GHG emissions (including from shipment of
food). Trade policies in food and agriculture
should therefore tackle the trade-offs between
economic, environmental and social objectives and
strengthen the resilience of the global agrifood
system to shocks.

prices of different foods. For example, increasing
price incentives to farmers, as measured by the
NRP, is associated with a higher cost of a healthy
diet (Box 11).
Repurposing food and agricultural policy support
across the food supply chain, if carefully designed
and targeted to achieve better nutrition outcomes
(see Figure 1), has the potential to help reduce the
cost and increase the access of foods that form
a healthy diet, hence, contributing to improving
their relative affordability and availability.
This entails increasing incentives (and
decreasing disincentives) for the production and
consumption of diverse, nutritious and safe foods
through environmentally sustainable practices
at all stages of the food supply chain (Figure 1). 87
This also implies taking due consideration of all
stakeholders, including women and youth, as they
often find themselves in a disadvantaged position
compared to their adult male counterparts when
it comes to the access to, and use of, food and
agricultural resources and markets. For example,
access to subsidies, inputs, storage facilities,
technology, extension services, all would improve
the efficiency of women and youth’s activities,
food safety and the reduction of post-harvest
losses. 88 It is also important to keep in mind that
inclusive and healthy environmental systems are
needed to ensure the sustained and long-term
supply of sufficient nutritious food,15 thus
contributing to address the trends of and prevent
all forms of malnutrition (see Chapter 2), and
support all other efforts to ensure food security
and good nutrition for all.

Border measures, as defined in Section 3.1, affect
the availability and relative prices of food and
can therefore impact consumer choices, dietary
patterns and diet-related health outcomes.
Import tariffs are the most commonly used border
measure, often employed to shield domestic
producers from competition, with tariffs typically
varying for different products and across
countries (Box 12).
Besides tariffs, NTMs can impact agrifood trade
and diet affordability and diversity, because
producers and traders may have to comply with
standards and other regulatory requirements
that increase trade costs. r 3 Crucially – and while
tariffs in agrifood trade have declined since the
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations – NTMs are
widespread. 3,99,100

Before examining potential policy paths for
repurposing food and agricultural policy support,
the next sections briefly discuss the nexus
between food and agricultural policy support
(Figure 17) and the availability and affordability
of healthy diets. For the purpose of clarity, the
discussion hereafter follows the categorization of
policies presented in Section 3.1.

To illustrate, recent results on the prevalence
of NTMs by product group show that in 2019
close to 80 percent of the total import value of
100 countries with available data were subject
to NTMs, with agrifood trade being impacted
disproportionally.100 Additionally, estimates of

than ordinary customs tariffs, that can potentially have an economic

prices or both”.434

affordability of different foods, thereby
broadening consumer choices and supporting

AND VEGETABLES*

group and increased domestic availability of these
products.93 As for foods of high energy density
and minimal nutritional value, several studies
document that tariff reductions for such foods are
associated with an increase in their supply as well
as consumption and health-related indicators such
as prevalence of obesity. These findings hold for
countries at different development stages.94,95,96,97
However, domestic taxes instead of tariffs would
be preferable to curb consumption of such foods
since they discourage their aggregate consumption
regardless of origin and have been found effective in
improving diets (see Section 4.2).89,98
Lastly, it is important to note that taxes and tariffs
affect overall food consumption and raising them
could undermine sufficient intake of food in some
contexts if not accompanied by other measures
that support access to nutritious food. For example,
higher differences in tariffs on highly processed
foods versus minimally processed and unprocessed
foods in sub-Saharan Africa have been found to be
associated with lower levels of obesity but also with
a higher prevalence of underweight.97 This suggests
that an integrated approach, using multiple policy
instruments – such as using revenue from taxes on
highly processed foods for well-targeted programmes
to reduce undernutrition – may be needed, along
with research to identify food groups that can be
taxed to combat obesity without detrimental effects
on undernutrition.

Effectively applied tariffs on imported foods vary
considerably by country income level and food
group, such as highly processed foods, sugar and
confectionary, fruits and vegetables or food and
beverages overall (Table A).**
Import tariffs on foods are generally higher in
LICs. This raises consumer prices for imported and
import-competing foods and may disproportionally
affect poor households that spend a larger share
of their incomes on food.92 Conversely, HICs, on
average, charge lower tariffs on imported foods.***
With respect to import tariffs on foods with
different nutritional value, the data show that both
highly processed foods and sugar and confectionery
generally attract higher tariffs than food and
beverages overall, in all but the HICs. For example,
LMICs levy an average tariff of 14.7 percent on
imported highly processed foods, compared to
8.5 percent on food and beverages as an aggregate
benchmark. Crucially, in all countries but those in
the high-income bracket, fruits and vegetables are
also charged high import tariffs, with LICs on average
collecting close to 19 percent duty on imported foods
in this group.
These findings are important because tariff
changes can shape the domestic availability and
consumption of foods with different nutritional
value. For example, evidence from Fiji suggests
that reductions of high tariffs levied on fruits
and vegetables led to higher imports of this food

* Results obtained from analysing import tariffs cannot be compared directly to results obtained from the analysis of the aggregate NRP indicator in
Section 3.1, due to the range of policy instruments considered in the computation of the NRP. The NRP captures the overall net-effect of tariffs, NTMs,
export restrictions (and subsidies), and market price control measures (like administered prices or minimum producer prices). Additionally, due to the
heavy data requirements for the computation of the NRP, coverage for some country/commodity combinations in the NRP dataset is very low, especially
for LICs and for fruits and vegetables, as opposed to tariff data, which are more comprehensive. ** Annex 5 provides a description of the tariff indicator
employed and describes the identification of food groups. Highly processed foods are those identified by Monteiro et al. (2019) 417 as “ultra-processed”
(NOVA classification 4). *** It should be noted that presented averages mask differences within country groups. For example, lower-middle-income
Solomon Islands levies an import tariff of around 10 percent on highly processed foods compared to an average of 14.7 percent in LMICs overall.

Kazakhstan first banned exports of different

of making staple foods more affordable, export
restrictions could lead to lower relative prices of

are often found to be higher than import tariffs.
The global average of the tariff equivalent
of SPS and TBT – key measures affecting
agrifood imports – is estimated at around
15 percent.101,102,103 As for individual food groups
of interest in the context of healthy diets, tariff
equivalents for SPS and TBT measures combined
have been estimated at about 8 percent for
broadly defined vegetable products and at almost
14 percent for processed foods (including sugar
and confectionary).103

Trade and market interventions:
market price controls

Taken together, these results suggest that
NTMs are likely to increase the cost of food to
consumers, but it is not clear whether nutritious
foods are more severely affected. Additionally,
SPS measures are in place for the protection of
human, animal, or plant life or health.104 Food
safety measures, for example, are implemented
to ensure that traded food is safe for consumers,
for instance, by imposing maximum residue
levels for pesticides or veterinary drugs. 3,102
It has also been documented that some NTMs
can expand agrifood trade, for example,
by boosting consumer confidence through
labelling and packaging requirements.102,103
Maintaining and strengthening measures to
protect human, animal and plant health, while
making their application transparent and
based on evidence, is therefore important for
safety and predictability of agrifood trade and
healthy diets.

As outlined in Section 3.1, market price controls
include policies such as administered prices used
for direct government procurement from farmers.
If interventions through public food procurement
increase or reduce domestic prices relative to
the border price, these generate incentives or
disincentives for producers.
Often governments procure food directly
from farmers at administered prices for public
food stockholding purposes, social protection
programmes or meals served in public
institutions (see Box 16 in Section 4.2). Policies that
establish administered prices are common in
LICs and MICs, including major agricultural
producers like China and India, but have been
largely abandoned by HICs such as the United
States of America and the European Union
member states.69,110 In the past, public support
provided through high guaranteed prices, for
example in the European Union, led to excessive
public stocks and friction with the European
Union’s main trading partners.111

Export restrictions mostly target staple
foods that are considered important for food
security, such as rice, wheat, maize or pulses,
and are only seldom applied to fruits or
vegetables. For example, in the context of the
war in Ukraine and unprecedented high food
prices, in mid-March of 2022, Egypt banned
the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans
amid growing concerns over food reserves.105
Among 33 countries that implemented export
restrictions over 2007–2011, only Jordan imposed
an export ban on “fresh vegetables and eggs,”106
with another exemption being Uzbekistan,
which introduced an export ban on fruits
and vegetables in 2015, but lifted it in 2016.107
Few countries also implemented short-lived
export restrictions during the first wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic, with Türkiye putting an

Price controls are frequently accompanied
by border measures to sustain prices above
world market prices for domestic producers.
For example, the price support programme for
rice farmers in the Dominican Republic entails
maintaining a floor price paid to producers,
implemented through a combination of market
regulation and tariff rate quotas, with high
out-of-quota tariffs.112

production decisions. As such, they can impact
the quantity, diversity and price of commodities
– whether these are for final consumption or
are inputs to the food processing and livestock
farming industry. Over the past decades, the
application of these subsidies has been different
across countries; however, in most countries
the focus has been – and continues to be – on a
handful of commodities (Section 3.1). In fact, the
most subsidized commodities, since the 1970s,
include staple foods – especially maize, wheat and
rice – followed by beef and milk. s

to farmers to produce larger quantities than
they otherwise would. In many LICs and MICs
governments use this instrument with the policy
objective of ensuring sufficient supplies of
strategic commodities, for food security purposes,
and to improve incomes of poor farmers. At the
same time, as other trade and market measures
that generate price incentives, they distort
domestic markets and potentially global trade,
affecting the cost of foods. As price controls
are predominantly implemented on grains, in
particular rice, maize and wheat,71 and also on
sugar,110 they often result in a higher supply of
these products relative to foods such as fruits,
vegetables or legumes.

These subsidies have significantly contributed to
increasing production and lowering prices of the
subsidized staple foods, mainly cereals. 85,114 The
most significant positive impact of these subsidies
has been their contribution to improving food
security through higher caloric intake across the
world.73,115 Further, by supporting farm incomes,
output subsidies and factors of production
indirectly supported the development and use
of better technology and of new agricultural
inputs which enhanced the productivity of the
subsidized commodities.116

In many LICs and MICs, these measures are still
widespread. Some evidence suggests this may
have detrimental effects on dietary diversity.
For example, in Egypt, the high domestic wheat
procurement price provides strong incentives
to farmers to cultivate wheat. This, combined
with bread subsidies to bakeries and consumers
led to a significant increase in per capita
consumption of bread and a higher share
of wheat-based products in the overall food
supply.113 Similar to other Northern African
countries, Egypt’s per capita food supply of
wheat products is among the highest in the
world: at 146 kg per capita annually, it is more
than double the world average, constituting
roughly one-third of the overall food supply in
calorie terms.90

These subsidies, however, also caused
important market distortions t within and across
borders.62,117,118 Market distortions affected
production, trade and prices of subsidized
commodities in ways that would have not usually
existed in a competitive market, and have created
(relative) disincentives towards producing
nutritious foods.74,119 Output subsidies and factors
of production have encouraged monocultures
in some countries, ceased the farming of
certain nutritious products, u and have reduced
production of some foods that do not receive the
same level of government support (commodities
and its derivates v).73,120,121 These changes in
production have direct implications on the
price and availability of unsubsidized or less
subsidized commodities and their derivatives,

Fiscal subsidies to producers
The mix of products that is supported through
different types of fiscal subsidies to producers
(Figure 17), and the process by which policies are
implemented, can directly and/or indirectly
affect the diversity and quantity of food
produced, trade flows and the relative prices that
consumers face. These will, therefore, affect the
access and affordability of healthy diets (Box 10).
The specific impact of a fiscal subsidies is country
(context) specific. However, each of these policy
instruments have some common positive and
negative impacts on healthy diets.

For more on this, see Section 3.1 and OECD (2022).451

t Market distortions in this context refers to government policies that
significantly affects prices or market behaviour in magnitudes that
would not usually exist in a competitive market.439,440
u For example, intensive rice monoculture systems led to the loss of
wild leafy vegetables and fish that the poor had previously harvested
from rice paddies in the Philippines.118

Subsidies on output and (on) factors of production
Subsidies on output and based on factors of
production have a direct bearing on farmers’

input or ingredient, for example, high-fructose corn (maize) syrup.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

their benefits, and that the policy instrument
is difficult to phase out, and in some cases, it
may have inhibited the development of input
markets.128,131 The underpinning reasons for
these outcomes are related to the process by
which these subsidies are provided.132 In certain
countries – often in LMICs – input subsidies’
objectives regarding productivity and diversity
were not met when the process by which input
subsidies were implemented was deficient
(e.g. subsidies did not reach the intended
beneficiaries or were not accompanied with
extension services),131 or when input subsidies had
suboptimal funding, encouraged monocultures,
or were not nutrition-sensitive.96,130

which in turn can create negative incentives
for people to diversify their diets – especially
for the most economically vulnerable.120 The
production levels and lower prices of subsidized
commodities have also impacted the food
industry, which has developed the low-cost,
unhealthy inputs that it widely uses (e.g.
high-fructose corn [maize] syrup, oils containing
saturated fats, etc.).96,122
The most subsidized crops are highly prevalent
in most countries’ food supply, are low-priced,
and in some countries are consumed at rates
well above recommendations (Box 10).123,124,125
When the share of these subsidized commodities,
along with food ingredients derived from
them, are considered in individuals’ total food
consumption, these represent an important
portion of people’s diets – especially among
the most vulnerable people, including in
HICs.120,126,127 For example, a study assessing the
impact of the United States of America’s output
subsidies and factors of production (covering
maize, wheat, soy, rice, sorghum, dairy and
livestock) on its population’s consumption found
that 56 percent of calories consumed were from
the subsidized food commodities, with the share
being between 66 percent and 100 percent among
those who are less educated, poorer and less food
secure.122

As for countries where the costs of input
subsidies exceeded benefits – notably in
MICs and HICs – the mechanism for their
implementation (e.g. subsidy coupled to level
of production that covers a limited number
of products) together with the high amount
subsidized, were not only costly and difficult to
phase out but also distorted markets or gave an
“unfair” advantage to some commodities
(e.g. cereals).62,133,134 In this case, the negative
impact on diets are similar to those discussed
above with regard to output subsidies and factors
of production.
The negative impacts of input subsidies may
also outweigh their benefits when these
subsidies compete for scarce government funds
that could be directed to other investments
(e.g. infrastructure, R&D, and so on) that, in
the long term, may enable rural households to
diversify their livelihoods from staple foods
and move towards a more diversified healthy
diet,120,135 may contribute to boost productivity,
and reduce the price and increase the
availability of nutritious foods.69

Input subsidies
Input subsidies usually aim to fill the gaps of
underdeveloped or poorly functioning markets,
to increase profitability of farming and to
diversify and/or to increase the production and
consumption of agricultural commodities.128,129
Input subsidies could, therefore, contribute to
the availability and affordability of healthy
diets, enhancing food security and nutrition.126
Empirical studies show, however, mixed results.
On the one hand, some country case studies
disclose that large input subsidies for some
commodities – e.g. for rice seeds and fertilizer
purchases – encouraged higher production,
consumption and private investment, which in
turn played an important role in transforming the
value chain.130

On a positive note, recent studies found that
countries that move towards hybrid policies
that support market creation for inputs131 have
been able to reach a greater number of farmers,
while developing a sustainable inputs market,
which could facilitate access to quality inputs
for all agricultural produce.136,137 This is the
case, for example, of input subsidies that use
vouchers and private traders,128 or hybrid
policies using cash transfers.96

On the other hand, other country case studies
show that input subsidies’ policy objectives are
not always met, and/or their cost outweighs

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

General services support

Other subsidies for which non-commodity
criteria or production applies

GSS are public expenditures for the provision
of public goods and services that can be
designed to create enabling and environmentally
sustainable conditions for the food and
agricultural sector (Section 3.1). These services
connect all economic actors of agrifood systems
(Figure 1), support the nexus between producers
and consumers, and can be an excellent
booster of productivity where levels are low
and productivity gaps are significant, which is
the case in many LICs. These services include
R&D and knowledge transfer, inspection
services, agricultural related infrastructure,
public stockholding, and food and agricultural
marketing and promotion. GSS is critical for
the well-functioning of agrifood systems,
essential for ensuring food safety and food
availability, and can significantly contribute to
food price reduction – including for nutritious
foods.69 It is important to remember that due
to the inadequacy and poor interest given to
some nutritious foods over several decades (e.g.
indigenous commodities, legumes in France),
private sector investment in those foods has been
low.144 As for the impact of GSS on production,
it is different across services, is highly context
specific (Section 3.1), and may present trade-offs.
For instance, a service (e.g. inspection) can have
a positive impact on food security and food
safety, but it might imply a higher food price (e.g.
oversight fees) that could threaten affordability
of healthy diets, or vice versa. Because of the
importance of each of the general services for
healthy diets, and for clarity purpose, these are
discussed separately hereafter.

In addition to the subsidies discussed above
are lump-sum payments to all farmers, which
may include subsidies tied to environmental
or landscape outcomes. These subsidies are
usually subject to cross‑compliance conditions
but not linked to the production of specific
commodities or livestock numbers or the use
of specific factors of production; these are
known as decoupled subsidies (Section 3.1).
These subsidies can include transfers that
contribute to soil regeneration, whose impact on
healthy diets will depend on how the subsidy is
implemented.138 For example, it can encourage
the planting of native species,139 but, in the short
to medium term, it may reduce production of
some commodities and hence increase their
price.140 The impact on healthy diets will also
depend on later land-use decisions and the
existing agricultural production structure –
outcomes will therefore be country specific.141
Decoupled subsidies may also include support
to producers to overcome challenges such
as compliance with new regulations and
to encourage environmentally sustainable
production. Empirical studies show that these
subsidies increase the level of production but
do not significantly change the variety of foods
produced by a country.142 In what concerns a
healthy diet, the studies gathered suggest that
countries that have adopted decoupled subsidies
have not been able to meet the demand of
nutritious food. For example, in Southern Asia,
the movement towards high value fruit and
vegetable production systems has been slow
relative to the growth in demand.143 In France,
despite increase in decoupled subsidies in
2005 and 2014, the performance of the legumes
sector has not significantly changed.144 In both
cases, lack of infrastructure investments and
high transaction costs associated with fruit
and vegetable value chains are cited among the
primary reasons for the slow supply response.
Subsidies with sustainability objectives have,
however, contributed to positive environmental
outcomes and the availability of safer food.
Discussion on policy repurposing towards
nutritious and sustainable agrifood systems are
part of Chapter 4.

Research and development (R&D) and
knowledge transfers
Public investment in food and agricultural R&D
is essential for global food security, improved
nutrition, delivery of affordable healthy diets
and environmental sustainability. R&D is one
of the drivers of productivity gains, declining
commodity prices and the related fall of
retail food prices achieved since 1950.145,146
For example, in the case of fruits and vegetables,
a study found that without the knowledge
acquired through public R&D, the consumption
of this food group would have been reduced
by more than 27 percent due to higher prices.145
Furthermore, R&D has significantly contributed
| 78 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

to the development of farm inputs, new food
products, farm technology, improved product
information among traders, processors and
retailers, and product traceability from
farm-to-fork (e.g. block chain technology
operated by value chain agents), which increased
transparency and trust.147,148,149

to scale up production, which have proven
to reduce micronutrient deficiencies
(e.g. vitamin A) while increasing household
incomes.120,130 These developments, however, are
not reaching all producers due to still important
gaps in funds, knowledge, technology, means
of implementation, coordination of R&D and
knowledge transfer service providers, and
limited partnerships across stakeholders.159
For example, in the case of fortification,
technology gaps are too wide to be effectively
applied in small-scale industrial processing.160,161

Although the benefits of R&D are many, w
the impact of R&D on diets depends on the
conditionalities that apply to R&D support,
the means of implementation and the targeted
commodity.150 R&D is generally a joint effort
of the private and public sectors, x 151 provided
to long-established institutions, most of which
are highly concentrated in industries related
to cereals (including the most subsidized
commodities discussed above under fiscal
subsidies to producers).150,152 For example, the
World Vegetable Center (covering a wide basket
of crops) has a budget of about USD 20 million,153
while the International Rice Research Institute
has a grant portfolio of USD 67.5 million.154

Inspection service
Inspection service is the enforcement arm of
Food Safety Risk Management. This includes
ensuring that food products conform to
regulations and product safety and quality
norms of the entire food chain (inputs and
outputs).162 Inspection service is fundamental
for healthy diets (Box 10), for food security and
food safety, i.e. to reduce the risks of food
contamination by, for example, harmful toxins,
chemicals, bacteria and other pathogens.
Furthermore, inspection can contribute to
enhancing the quality of food (including the
nutritional value of products), productivity
(e.g. rules affecting production losses), and to
enhancing consumer trust and awareness.163
In recent years, countries have been investing
in tools for communication of good practices,
in digital risk-based approaches to improve
control for food safety, and in cooperation
and collaboration among competent
authorities.164,165

Closely associated with R&D are knowledge
transfers that are core services for increasing
productivity, food safety and the nutritional
value of products – specially needed in contexts
where it is challenging to meet populations’
micronutrient requirements.146 Knowledge
transfer services are critical for the diffusion
and adoption of R&D products (e.g. new seeds)
and technologies (e.g. satellite data to monitor
crop growth).148,155,156 They can also be key
to providing generic training and extension
advice to farmers (e.g. on sustainable farming
techniques, post-harvest loss management,
nutrition-sensitive agriculture) and high
education on agricultural programmes
(e.g. market-oriented services).148,157 For example,
in the case of nutrition-sensitive agriculture,
these services increasingly involve
multiple types of interventions, such as the
adoption of biofortified crops along with
agriculture-nutrition education,158 fortification
of cereals and products together with training

That said, significant gaps exist in the adoption
of new technologies and in investment of
inspection equipment required to access quality
scientific services (e.g. capacity to monitor,
sample and analyse food products for specific
contaminants, and process data for the purpose
of risk analysis). Also, in many countries
inspection procedures remain cumbersome,
costly, and their implementation lack
transparency and coherence between different
government bodies (e.g. different requirements
made by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Ministry of Health).164,165 Moreover, in some
countries the private sector’s food safety
systems are weak,166 and some countries
privilege official control of food for export while

w Public R&D expenditure is estimated to yield a return on
investments between 6.5 percent and 15.2 percent in Europe 441 and a
return of 42.3 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.442
x For example, in Argentina, soybean seeds were developed by the
plant breeding industry and public institutions to increase country
exports.150

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

food for domestic markets is neglected (e.g.
food sold in East Africa local markets contained
aflatoxin).167

Infrastructure is particularly important in
countries that depend on access to markets, as
well as for countries where the diversity of their
food supply depends on their own production,
and where post‑harvest losses are very
high.126,155,171 For example, in the case of food loss
and waste, while in sub‑Saharan Africa fruits and
vegetables loss and waste during post-harvest,
processing and distribution have been estimated
at 35 percent, in Europe the same figure was
estimated at 15 percent.173

It is important to bear in mind that lack of
trust in inspection for local products, or lack
of trust in the private sector’s food safety
management systems, can deter consumption
of nutritious and less expensive local products
in favour of imported products (this was the
case, for example, of infant foods in Western
Africa).168 Coping with those challenges may
not come without trade-offs. Compliance with
new rules or processes may mean that the food
industry will need to bear additional costs for
ensuring the safety of their products, which
will be passed on to consumer prices. This can
reduce the affordability of nutritious foods –
affecting poor producers and poor consumers
disproportionately. Governments are, therefore,
challenged to find the right balance between
these two concurrent objectives. A first step to
meeting those challenges could be to implement
instruments such as FAO-WHO’s Food Control
System Assessment Tool, which helps assess
the effectiveness of, and better targets limited
resources to strengthen, national food control
systems – including modernization of inspection
service.169

Investing in irrigation, roads, technology for
storage, low-input food preservation (such as
solar drying) and sustainable cooling and
electricity have proven to contribute to
addressing those challenges and are becoming
increasingly necessary due to erratic rain
patterns and increasing temperatures.120,135,174
These investments, however, do not necessarily
guarantee success in improving dietary
diversity, affordability or access to healthy diets.
For example, small-scale irrigation in Ethiopia
and Tanzania did not improve nutrition,151 and
although support to the fruit and vegetable value
chains in seven African and Asian countries z
increased exports of those produce, it did not
expand fruit and vegetable supply in informal
markets.175

Infrastructure
Infrastructure is essential to fostering dietary
diversity, food availability, affordability and
food safety. Appropriate infrastructure can
increase both the quantity and quality of foods
available in markets – especially for perishable
foods such as fruits144 and fresh fish.170 This
is needed to diminish food loss and waste, to
reduce economic losses and pressure on the
environment, and to build resilience in the face
of climate change.y 75,171 Increasing infrastructure
at all stages of the value chain also plays a
central role in food safety. For example, proper
and reliable drying and storage infrastructure
is key to reducing carcinogenic mycotoxins
(e.g. aflatoxins) in grain, nuts and related dry
staple foods; capital-intensive cold chains that
meet food safety standards are needed for the
distribution of perishable aquatic food.172

Therefore, infrastructure investment needs to be
designed to reach rural and remote areas,155,156
growing urban areas, and needs to be adapted
to the commodity and the context. For example,
food loss and waste varies across products –
especially perishable and non-perishable food
(e.g. in Africa, losses for non-perishable crops
typically range between 1.3 and 7.3 percent,
while post-harvest losses for tomatoes, in Kenya,
were around 28 percent).176 In terms of products,
aquatic food may need the most attention
in relation to reducing food loss, as about
35 percent of global harvest in capture fisheries
and aquaculture is either lost or wasted every
year.78 Furthermore, infrastructure investment
may need to be accompanied by other measures
such as extension services, support for food
and agricultural marketing and promotion of
nutritious foods, for rural financial services

y It has been estimated that LICs and MICs have a USD 1 trillion gap
between current and needed investments in infrastructure.443

United Republic of Tanzania.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

Food and agricultural marketing and promotion

and, in some countries, subsidies to consumers
to increase consumption of healthy diets.135,151
For example, interventions not only require
infrastructure and advocacy about the benefits of
reducing food loss and waste, but they should be
accompanied by investments along food supply
chains to ensure behavioural change.177

Food and agricultural marketing (as defined
in Section 3.1) aa includes services that are
at the core of food environments (Figure 1),
encompassing public and private participants
involved in all the stages of a product value
chain – from supply of inputs of farms to retail
markets.181,182,183 For example, these services
may include commodity grading schemes or
agricultural machinery services. They may
be services related to post-harvest losses,
lowering transaction costs, facilitating market
exchange and trade, and strengthening or
expanding supply networks.151,183 Moreover,
they can include services to facilitate the sale of
nutritious foods in underserved areas,184 or the
conservation, processing and other determinant
factors for the profitability of products with
special requirements such as perishable,
bulky or indigenous commodities, among
many others.

Public stockholding
Public stockholding programmes include the
costs of maintaining and managing reserves
resulting from market purchase interventions,
such as public procurement from farmers
and reserves built for food security purposes
(Section 3.1). This category does not, however,
include public expenditure for buying food
stocks. In some countries, these services are part
of national food reserves for coping with food
emergencies (e.g. food crises in 2007/08) and are
considered by some an essential element of a
prudent national security policy – particularly
in countries facing famines or frequent exposure
to shocks (e.g. droughts, floods and conflicts).71
These programmes, however, in some countries
are also used to target price behaviour.178
Furthermore, product coverage has largely
focused on staple foods, notably rice, wheat, or
maize,179 which may skew production away from
higher-value products and could be detrimental
to diversifying domestic diets towards foods
with higher nutritional value.71

Food and agricultural marketing services
can have an impact on healthy diets through
several channels. These can enhance efficiency
across the value chain and increase the
number of suppliers but also the demand, a
combined effect that can trigger competition
without decreasing suppliers’ incomes, while
providing lower prices for consumers.153,185 For
instance, over the past decades cooperatives
and producers’ organizations have been
cornerstones on the production and sales of
farm products.182,186 This has been the case for
milk processing through farmers’ cooperatives
in Nepal and Uganda which improved milk
processing capacity and safety.187,188 In Ecuador,
a platform of cooperation helped farmers to
achieve higher yields and gross margins, while
reducing the use of toxic pesticides, hence
increasing supply of sustainably produced
food.189

Public stockholding success, on ensuring a
country’s food security, has been found to
rely on programme design. This includes
organizational structure and reserve
management, the procurement and release of
food so it has minimal disruption to regular
market functioning,178 and adoption of healthy
public food procurement and services policies
which support increasing the availability of
nutritious foods and developing standards
related to foods (e.g. regarding food high in
fat, salt and/or sugar, etc.) 180 (see Section 4.2).
Some countries are also looking into alternative
market-neutral instruments to meet national
food security objectives while being less costly
and enabling diet diversity. For example, by
developing the value chain of indigenous crops
such as roots and tubers,178 or by providing cash
to the food insecure.71

More recently, the food and agricultural sector
has witnessed the rise of innovative channels of
support adapted to the commodity, the systems
of production, the culture and traditions of
aa “Food and agricultural marketing” services as discussed in this
chapter is different from commercial “marketing” as referred to in
Section 4.2; commercial “marketing” is part of what is referred to in this
chapter as promotion. Refer to Section 3.1 for comprehensive
information about the differences between the two terms.

CHAPTER 3 FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY SUPPORT IN THE WORLD: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND AFFECT DIETS?

the producers, and the level of development of
the country and the sector.189,190 For example,
governments are enabling producers (including
small farmers) to meet demand by funding
digital innovations that help farmers find
vehicles to move their fruits and vegetables to
markets (India), and that help farmers add value
to products otherwise lost, e.g. tomatoes into
tomato paste in Malawi.191 In the European
Union, producer organizations channel
government support to fruits and vegetables and
enable the development of short-food supply
chains which, by easing the relation between
producers, processors and consumers, are
increasing food availability and reducing the
price for consumers.192,193

harmful impact of such promotion, countries at
the WHA agreed, in 2010, on recommendations
to restrict the commercial marketing of foods
and beverages of high energy density and
minimal nutritional value to children. 201 Policies
that can create healthy food environments and
help achieve healthy consumption patterns are
discussed in Section 4.2.

Fiscal subsidies to consumers
Fiscal subsidies to consumers to enable access
to food include instruments under social
protection programmes (for end consumers)
and food subsidies to lower the cost of food
(provided to intermediaries). The latter
includes transfers to commercial buyers
(e.g. millers, processors) and other food value
chain actors (e.g. transporters, storage service
providers). 202 Depending on their design and
implementation, these transfers can contribute
to food security and nutrition, and have
the potential to improve access to healthy
diets. These policy instruments are often
implemented in the face of crises, economic
shocks, policy reforms (e.g. repurposing), and
can be part of the broader food and agricultural
policy setting.

Complementing these services is promotion,
which includes activities to inform and
reach consumers (e.g. promotion campaigns,
participation in international fairs, activities
promoting food quality). Services that
promote nutritious food, including those that
empower consumers to choose healthy diets,
are important because the intake of foods that
make up a healthy diet (Box 10), or changing
consumption patterns, not only depends on
price, physical accessibility and availability.
Consumption decisions also depend on
consumers’ preferences, on their knowledge
about nutritious foods and the impact of
unhealthy diets on long-term health, and on
trust of products in the market 194,195 (not least,
trust in the quality [food safety] of traditional/
indigenous products). Empirical studies show
a strong link between knowledge of nutrition
and health (e.g. food-based information
through social mass media) and nutritional
outcomes.126,130 Furthermore, studies have found
a strong association between an individual’s
health status and the product promoted.196

Food subsidies, unlike the output or input subsidies
discussed in the sections above, have the primary
objective of making food more affordable and
available to consumers. These usually target
certain population groups and comprise specific
food items. 203 For instance, Canada provides
food subsidies to wholesale distributors sending
perishable foods by air to remote communities,
which has reduced the cost and increased the
availability of nutritious foods for families in the
beneficiary communities. 204
Evidence shows that food subsidies that target
specific nutrients and nutritious foods in
HICs can improve the nutritional status of
beneficiaries, but only during the period the
subsidy is implemented and the beneficiaries
are effectively receiving the subsidy. 204 The same
study suggests that if the subsidy is designed to
have long-term impacts (e.g. by implementing
this over long periods), it would allow for
sustained changes in dietary patterns and
could potentially reduce the prevalence of

For example, promotion of energy-dense foods
high in fats, sugars and/or salt significantly
increases consumption of these products,
and this could led to deteriorating health.197
Although most studies about the effect of the
promotion of products’ role in unhealthy diets
on consumption have been conducted in HICs
and MICs, similar results are predicted for
LICs where the consumption of these foods
is growing.198,199,200 In fact, in response to the
| 82 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

of a population as it can improve the nutrition
of those who may only have access to healthy
diets through social protection programmes,
and thus expand the number of individuals
with adequate nutritional status. 208,212 Thus,
targeting subsidies can contribute to reducing
fundamental social inequities between lowand high-income consumers which often
prevent families from adopting healthy diets
and accessing basic services such as health.
On the contrary, subsidies to everyone can
leave behind the most in need and widen health
inequality gaps.129,208 Furthermore, transfers
with the specific objective of increasing
access to nutritious food (e.g. equivalent to a
price reduction of 10–30 percent in fruits and
vegetables),180 and especially when accompanied
by a food tax (e.g. for sugar-sweetened
beverages), 213 are expected to bring health
benefits such as reduction of deaths from
cardiovascular diseases and cancer. 214

NCDs in adults.126 In the case of LICs and MICs,
studies find that in most countries large-scale
food subsidies are directed towards staple
foods; 96,205,206 this is the case, for example, of
the food subsidy that targets rice consumption
in India. 207 The same studies also revealed that
these subsidies have a limited contribution, or no
contribution, to improving access to nutritious
foods and healthy diets.

Transfers under social protection programmes,
which are intended and designed to improve
the affordability of food, include in-kind food
transfers, food vouchers and cash transfers,
and are implemented alone or through a mixed
modality. While the impact of these transfers in
reducing malnutrition and increasing access to
healthy diets are context specific, an increasing
amount of evidence reveals several common
patterns, namely:

Transfers to consumers that are explicitly designed
to have nutritional impacts – i.e. through

The implementation of these transfers can be
challenging. This is the case when the subsidy

nutrition-sensitive social protection
programmes 208 – can increase the consumption
of nutritious foods. 209 Hence, nutrition
considerations must be at the core of the design
of any transfer aimed for food security and
improved nutrition. This can be accomplished,
for example, by ensuring that in‑kind food
transfers – or other transfers – include
nutritious foods and/or fortified staple foods. 210
Transfers could also be accompanied with food
and nutrition education 129,211 which has been the
common success factor that helped increase the
consumption of nutritious food. For example,
Cabo Verde’s in-kind transfer part of its school
feeding programme includes diverse nutritious
foods (fruits, vegetables, beans and fish) for
schoolchildren, and nutrition education for
teachers, school staff and cooks. 208

households outside the criteria for inclusion,

the programme is affected by corruption (e.g.
public officials charged with distributing
subsidized grain sell it instead).130,165,215 Tackling
these issues is not only important to meet the
objectives and ensure sustainability and cost
effectiveness of social protection programmes,
but also to ensure that these programmes are
strong enough to be expanded or adapted – in
a timely manner – in the face of shocks and
crises. 208

Appraisals on the impact and cost of social protection
instruments suggest that in areas where there is

transfers could. 202,211 Evidence also shows that
household savings resulting from in-kind

in-kind transfers cost nearly three times more
to implement than other programmes. 211,216

well, have proven to have positive impacts on
children’s nutrition through school-feeding
programmes, and can also be designed to fill
a population’s existing nutrient gaps through,
for example, delivery of nutritious foods or of
fortified foods. 217 For these reasons, in many
cases, a mixed approach may bring better
outcomes. 202 For example, Pakistan’s programme
for pregnant and breastfeeding women and
children 6–23 months of age provides cash
transfer and nutritious foods conditional
on their utilization of health and nutrition
services. 218

replace harmful inputs such as transfats with
nutritious inputs, it is necessary to increase
the supply of nutritious foods, to lower their
costs to competitive levels, and to implement
nutrition-sensitive strategies targeted at
both consumers and producers. Thus, fiscal
subsidies, trade and market interventions,
and GSS need to be analysed for their effects
on food supply, prices and consumer choices,
and to be tailored to country-specific contexts
in order to inform necessary reforms and to
ensure well-coordinated multilateral actions (see
Chapter 4).

Countries are currently exploring multifaceted
and innovative approaches in order to enhance
the efficiency of subsidies. Specifically, they
seek to increase access to nutritious foods and
improve dietary diversity in combination with:
i) enhancing knowledge, skills and practices;
ii) facilitating access to services (health,
nutrition, water, etc.); and iii) linking the
intervention with an economic activity. 219 For
instance, in Chile the government developed
a digital application to facilitate access to
nutritious foods for vulnerable populations,
while supporting small local producers and
markets. 220 These and other new approaches
need to be considered in repurposing food and
agricultural policy support strategies as further
discussed in Section 4.2.

Over the past decades, to improve national food
security and support farmers, public support
has been highly concentrated on the production
of and access to the world’s most consumed
staple foods, like rice and wheat, but also sugar,
oil, meat and milk (Figure 22). Less support has
been provided to foods with higher nutritional
value, such as vegetables, fruits and pulses, or
indigenous commodities providing the much
needed nutrients particularly important in
underserved areas. In terms of border measures,
governments should strive to reduce barriers
and facilitate trade in order to foster the
diversity and affordability of nutritious foods,
while ensuring that safety of traded food is not
undermined. Such changes in border measures
could be accompanied by fiscal measures, such
as domestic taxes on products high in fats,
sugars and/or salt, which are preferable to
import tariffs because they affect the overall
consumption of a food, not only imported
food, and are consistent with WTO rules.
Similarly, some forms of market price controls
are subject to multilateral trade rules and
their implications for affordability of healthy
diets need to be analysed carefully before
undertaking any policy changes, considering
country specificity.

In summary – the challenges and
potential policy pathways
Food and agricultural policies affect consumer
and food-industry decisions by affecting the
availability and affordability of food across
all stages of the value chain, from primary
production to final consumption, and are
interlinked with other systems, such as the
health system and the environmental system
(see Figure 1). Policies can lead to unbalanced diets
that contribute to NCDs when they directly or
indirectly encourage production of energy-dense,
nutrient-poor monocultures, discourage
consumption of nutritious foods (Box 10) or make
energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or
salt more affordable.199,221

Fiscal subsidies to producers and GSS must
include carefully designed mechanisms for
implementation and targeting if these are to
enhance greater diversity and increase supply of
nutritious foods, especially in LICs and LMICs
where productivity is still lagging behind and
where important gaps exist in the provision
of such services. These mechanisms must
also ensure that nutritious foods and inputs

international markets – can reach all population

which are women (Chapter 2). For example,

POTENTIAL OPTIONS
TO REPURPOSE POLICY
SUPPORT TO FOOD
AND AGRICULTURE
FOR IMPROVING
AFFORDABILITY OF
A HEALTHY DIET

KEY MESSAGES

è To take advantage of the opportunities that a
global repurposing of border measures, market price
controls and fiscal subsidies may offer in practice,
countries will have to consider their commitments and
flexibilities under WTO rules.

è Repurposing current public support to food and
agriculture to increase the availability of nutritious
foods to the consumer can contribute to the objective
of making a healthy diet less costly and more
affordable, globally and particularly in MICs.

è Where agriculture is still a key sector for the
economy, jobs and livelihoods, mainly in LICs but
also in some LMICs, it will be crucial to increase and
prioritize public expenditure for the provision of GSS.
This is an effective way to bridge productivity gaps
for producing nutritious foods and enabling income
generation to improve the affordability of a healthy
diet. However, stepping up this type of support in these
countries will require significant development financing.

è Repurposing existing fiscal subsides is found to
provide the largest improvement in the affordability
of a healthy diet, particularly if they are shifted from
producers to consumers. In this case, agriculture’s
GHG emissions are found to fall, but there are potential
trade-offs in poverty reduction, farm incomes, total
agricultural output and economic recovery.
è Shifting price incentives globally by repurposing
border measures and market price controls can also
make a healthy diet less costly and more affordable,
albeit less than when fiscal subsidies are shifted
from producers to consumers. With this option, GHG
emissions from agriculture would fall, while potential
trade-offs would also generally be avoided.

è Other key agrifood systems policies will be
needed to complement repurposing efforts to ensure
shifts in food supply chains, food environments
and consumer behaviour towards healthy eating
patterns. These include, for example, policies on food
reformulation and fortification, regulation of food
labelling and marketing, taxation of energy-dense foods
and healthy public food procurement.

è When repurposing public support to make a
healthy diet less costly, policymakers will have
to avoid potential inequality trade-offs that may
emerge if farmers are not in a position to specialize
in the production of nutritious foods due to resource
constraints. This could be particularly the case with
small-scale farmers, women and youth.

è In addition, social protection policies may be
necessary to mitigate possible trade-offs from
repurposing, particularly short-term income losses or
negative effects on livelihoods, especially among the
most vulnerable populations. Health system policies
will also be key to ensure access to essential nutrition
services for protecting the health of vulnerable groups,

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

and the food and agricultural workforce, as well as to
ensure food safety.

incentives to reduce GHG emissions, adapt to
climate change and manage natural resources
sustainably under planetary boundaries.

è Environmental, transportation and energy policies
will be absolutely necessary to enhance the positive
outcomes of the repurposing support efforts in the
realms of efficiency, equality, nutrition, health, climate
mitigation and the environment.

To take advantage of these possibilities, though,
a systems approach will be needed. In other words,
other policies and incentives, some of which may
pertain to other systems, will have to coherently
complement repurposing support efforts in food
and agriculture. Altogether, the policy mix will
succeed depending on country context where
food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result
of several drivers (i.e. conflict, climate extremes
and variability and economic swings), structural
characteristics (e.g. income status, degree of
inequality, natural resource endowments, net
trade position, and so forth) and political economy
considerations and feasibility. n

è The success of repurposing food and agricultural
policy will also be influenced by the political and
social context, governance, (im)balances of power,
differences in interests, ideas and influence of
stakeholders, market power concentration, and the
governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks
in place to facilitate the reform process and prevent
and manage conflicts.
è Given the diversity of each country’s political
context, the repurposing support efforts will need
strong institutions on a local, national and global level,
as well as engaging and incentivizing stakeholders from
the public sector, the private sector and international
organizations. The engagement of SMEs and civil
society groups will be key to balancing out unequal
powers within agrifood systems.

4.1
WHAT ARE THE
POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF
REALLOCATING FOOD AND
AGRICULTURAL POLICY
SUPPORT DIFFERENTLY
TO REDUCE THE COST OF
NUTRITIOUS FOODS?

è Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will be
particularly important to ensure accountability and
to identify areas of improvement in repurposing
support, provided they can be supported through
data development and maintenance as well as
model-based scrutiny.

Recent studies show that reallocating public
support to food and agriculture differently can
lead to improved outcomes, but with potential
trade-offs in several important domains for
sustainable development that need to be carefully
understood. 222 Due to the issues at stake, most
of these studies have relied on model-based
simulations and because most public support
is given to farmers, they focus mostly on
agricultural support rather than food and
agricultural support.

Deciding on what food and agricultural policy
support should be reformed and how, in order
to improve the affordability of healthy diets,
requires careful examination of the potential
effects and trade-offs implied by different policy
mixes. This is key to inform policy decisions and
strike a proper balance across all dimensions of
sustainable development.
Governments may find that repurposing some
of their support to food and agriculture can be a
means to: i) improve agrifood systems efficiency,
with fairness and inclusiveness for all agrifood
systems actors that want to benefit from such
reconfigured policies (equity); ii) increase the
availability and reduce the cost of nutritious
foods, thus increasing people’s affordability and
access to healthy diets; and iii) provide strong

Repurposing policy support implies an
understanding of what would happen if, for
example, this support were allocated differently,
which would trigger direct but also indirect
economy-wide effects. For example, a reallocation
of public expenditure into investments that boost
| 88 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

horticultural products for consumption decreased
in all regions, as did total energy intake.
Associated with these changes was a projected net
increase in diet-related mortality, most of which
was associated with the reductions in availability
of fruits and vegetables for consumption but
was slightly compensated for by reductions in
overweight and obesity. Further, the same study
points to the resulting increases in mortality
which would negatively affect the labour supply
and economic welfare.

productivity in agriculture sectors will have
effects on these sectors’ production directly.
Yet, it will also have indirect impacts through the
productive linkages between these sectors and
other sectors of the economy, not least the food
industry. Some agriculture sectors also trade
internationally. Farmers in sectors promoted by
such investments will also increase their demand
for agricultural inputs as well as their final
demand for food since they are also consumers.
These interlinkages justify analysing repurposing
food and agricultural support options using
simulations from computable general equilibrium
(CGE) models. 223

Allocating agricultural support differently
is an option

Most existing studies that rely on such models
have also focused on reforming or repurposing
agricultural support to achieve better
climate-related and environmental outcomes.
In these studies, global model‑based simulations
not only point to the link between agricultural
support and GHG emissions, but also find that
repurposing such support can lead to reductions
in GHG emissions. However, these global
model-based analyses also highlight important
trade-offs; for example, in terms of agriculture
production, farm income and economic
efficiency. Although these studies point to several
important insights on the affordability of healthy
diets, 4,224,225,226 this issue has not been at the core
of their analyses.

Another key finding from recent studies is that
changing the composition of agricultural support
with repurposing can ensure beneficial outcomes
while minimizing trade-offs. For example, one
study examines 4 the model-based scenario where
all countries concertedly repurpose current
coupled subsidies into conditional payments to
farmers who are achieving higher productivity
and adopting lower emission-intensity
technologies, while supplementing this with
additional government support for R&D in such
technologies and infrastructure improvements.
Not only would such a scenario significantly help
reduce GHG emissions from both agricultural
production and land-use change, but it would
also help increase yields globally, contribute to
reducing food prices, improve farm incomes in
developing countries, reduce poverty and hunger,
and incidentally, reduce the cost of a healthy diet
for poor people.

Eliminating agricultural support is not a
feasible option
Global model-based analyses warn that removing
all agricultural support alone is not an option.1,227
Such a drastic scenario could lead to some
reductions in GHG emissions from agriculture,
and efficiency and net-global economic gains, but
it would come at a high socioeconomic and human
cost to society. Trade‑offs may include significant
reductions in crop production, livestock farming
production and farm employment.

Another study, 227 using a similar modelling
framework, found that on a global scale, several
reform options could lead to reductions in GHGs
and improvements in population health without
reductions in economic welfare. Those reform
options include a repurposing of up to half of
those agricultural subsidies that support the
production of foods with beneficial health and
environmental characteristics, including fruits,
vegetables and other horticultural products.

One of the studies 227 analysed the ensuing impact
of globally removing support on consumption,
diet‑related mortality and overweight and obesity
by 2030. The changes in consumption followed the
changes in production but were also mediated by
changes in trade and commodity prices. The per
capita availability of fruits, vegetables and other

These findings show that smart repurposing of
current agricultural support has the potential to
contribute to the environmental sustainability of
agriculture, while also contributing (moderately)
to poverty reduction, food security and better

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

nutrition. The key to these outcomes is ensuring
that the reorientation of support leads to
significant efficiency improvements – both
in terms of higher yields and lower emission
intensities. It is also clear that reorienting
agricultural incentives in this way will not
address all agrifood system challenges in full.

synergies for other development goals. It is also
important for governments to understand ways
in which in times of economic sluggishness, as is
the case nowadays, public resources can be spent
wisely with the highest cost-effectiveness possible
to improve people’s lives while respecting
the planet.

Recent studies that also rely on modelling
find that repurposing domestic agricultural
subsidies – particularly those that are coupled to
production as defined in Chapter 3 – to pursue
better nutrition, health and environmental
outcomes, can be beneficial to transitions
towards healthy diets that include sustainability
considerations. 227,228

The remainder of this section presents new
analysis of model-based scenarios of repurposed
food and agricultural policy support specially
developed for this report, mostly at the global
level, but adding country examples. It tackles
a number of key questions: What could be the
impacts of allocating current public support to
food and agriculture differently on both food
production and consumption patterns, in ways
that affect the cost of nutritious foods (relative
to other foods and people’s incomes) and thus
change people’s affordability of healthy diets?
Are results from repurposing different for specific
groups of countries? What trade-offs could
arise between multiple sustainable development
objectives and mixes of policies, and what
alternative policy mixes exist to avoid them?

For example, positive gains could be made
in terms of human health through increased
consumption of nutritious foods, including
fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds and pulses. 228
Repurposing half or all subsidies to nutritious
foods is found to lead to hundreds of thousands
of fewer diet-related deaths and reductions in
GHG emissions. Modelling also shows that the
resulting shifts in resource demand for water,
land, nitrogen and phosphorus are generally
modest, and changes in management practices
may arguably be more effective in moderating
water and land use (e.g. subsidy reforms include
incentives for adopting sustainable management
practices, in addition to encouraging changes
in the mix of production). These studies focus
on subsidies, though, thus leaving out other
instruments of policy support.

Repurposing may not be feasible for some
countries, especially for LICs but also for some
LMICs that are barely spending on food and
agriculture while still undergoing agricultural
transformation. For these countries, the question
then becomes: “how far” could repurposing take
them? While there may be little potential for
repurposing (or reallocating) resources in these
countries, there is potential to reform policies
and to use these resources more efficiently and
effectively. How can these countries ensure
that agricultural transformation and increasing
access to healthy diets are synergic through
policy support?

Bridging current knowledge gaps in
understanding repurposing with a lens
on healthy diets
While the global model-based analyses described
above have provided important policy insights
for repurposing support efforts, they fall short
in helping us more thoroughly understand
what repurposing scenarios mean if they
were to include lowering the cost of nutritious
foods and increasing the affordability of
healthy diets for all as a key policy objective.
Bridging these knowledge gaps is critical to
inform decision-making in repurposing support
to ensure it contributes to ending hunger, food
insecurity and all forms of malnutrition with

Scenarios of repurposing support to lower
the cost and improve the affordability of a
healthy diet, sustainably and inclusively
Some of the studies discussed above used the
Modelling International Relations under Applied
General Equilibrium (MIRAGRODEP) model to
gauge the potential impacts of eliminating and

impacts on nature, climate, food availability for

Nutrition in the World 2022, 230 and more technical
details (including the model’s mathematical
statement) are found in Glauber and Laborde
(forthcoming). 230
The analysis takes as a reference a baseline
scenario from 2017 to 2030, which is aligned with
the United Nations’ demographic projections 231
and updated economic growth estimates from
the IMF. 232 Summary statistics for baseline
projections are presented in Glauber and
Laborde (forthcoming). 230 In essence, this is a
business-as-usual scenario because there are no
shifts in the way governments from all over the
world are supporting food and agriculture.

The MIRAGRODEP model has been further
expanded for this report to analyse potential
impacts of repurposing food and agricultural
policies to specifically reduce the cost and
increase the affordability of a healthy diet. It also
relies on the updated agricultural producer
support data presented in Chapter 3. As in
the case of any economic model, the results of
simulating policy changes using MIRAGRODEP
are highly dependent on the underlying
assumptions and the data used. For this reason,
the analysis of scenarios presented in this

magnitude of estimated effects, rather than on the
actual magnitude. The results are best interpreted
as indicative of the likely effects. A more detailed

percentage change from the baseline scenario in
2030 for farm income, agricultural production and
total GHG emissions from agriculture including
land-use changes.

Reinforcing the case for repurposing support
Results from the second and third scenarios
whereby, respectively, border support and market
price control or fiscal subsidies to producers are
removed from the baseline scenario help reinforce
the case that eliminating such support altogether
would not be a feasible option.

Following definitions in Glauber and Laborde
(forthcoming), 230 key food security, nutrition,
equity and climate variables for which results are
presented include:

When all border support and market price
control measures affecting agricultural products
– both positively and negatively – are removed
globally, agricultural imports increase, and
this lowers prices for consumers and producers
in food-importing countries, although food
prices go up for food exporting countries whose
products are in higher demand. In turn, an overall
reduction in agricultural prices help reduce
undernourishment, increase the affordability of a
healthy diet and shrink the income gap towards
affording a healthy diet, particularly in LMICs
(Table A6.2 in Annex 6).

 Affordability of a healthy diet – This measures
the percent of the population that can afford
a healthy diet as defined in this report
(see Section 2.3 and Annex 3).
 Income gap in the affordability of a healthy
diet – This measures the average gap
between the cost of a healthy diet and the
food expenditures of the population that
could not afford it.
 Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) –
This measures the percent of the population
that is undernourished (see Section 2.1 and
Annex 1B).
 Population in extreme poverty (less than
USD 1.90 per day) – This measures the percent
of the population living in extreme poverty.
 Farm income – This measures the real value
added of the farm sector.
 Agricultural production (volume) – This
measures agricultural production measured on
a volume basis.
 Total GHG emissions from agriculture
including land-use changes (cumulated during
the period 2025–2030) – This measures the total
value, both production and land emisssions
cumulated over five years 2025–2030. ab

Total GHG emissions from agriculture fall as
well, but these benefits are not free of trade‑offs.
Global extreme poverty essentially does not
change – and actually increases in LMICs.
There is a clear reduction in global agricultural
production in all but HICs, and farm income falls
in MICs and LICs where border support is more
typically provided than fiscal subsidies (Table A6.2
in Annex 6). The reduction in total GHG emissions
in agriculture results from less agricultural
production in MICs and LICs.
Trade-offs are even more apparent when all
fiscal subsidies given to producers individually
– mostly in HICs and UMICs – are removed,
keeping all other support including border
measures and market price controls in place
(Table A6.3 in Annex 6). Effects are particularly
adverse in terms of farm income and agricultural
production particularly in HICs, although global
food security and nutrition may also deteriorate.
The drop in global agricultural production pushes
agricultural prices up, which in the context of
LICs is somewhat favourable to agricultural

production, farm income and poverty reduction.
Even so, poverty increases globally, and both the
decline in farm income in some LMICs in Asia
and the aforementioned increased prices push
up the PoU and the cost of nutritious foods, thus
leaving a healthy diet less affordable, particularly
in LMICs. There is a reduction in GHG emissions
from agriculture given the decrease in global
agricultural production, but the trade-offs in food
security, nutrition and equity reinforce the case
that eliminating fiscal subsidies to producers is
not a feasible option.

deficiency earmarks them as “high‑priority”,
“medium-priority” or “low-priority” foods.
High-priority foods include fruits and vegetables,
fisheries and dairy products in most regions
(see Box 13).
In addition to the seven indicators introduced
earlier, six more indicators are added to examine
the impacts of repurposing on the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet and per capita
consumption of broad food groups adjusted for
food loss and waste (see Glauber and Laborde
[forthcoming]230 for definitions) – all expressed
as a percentage change relative to the baseline
in 2030:

On the basis of these results, policymakers
may see in repurposing support to food and
agriculture a better option than eliminating such
support. Policymakers will need to consider the
potential options to repurpose policy support to
food and agriculture for improving affordability
of healthy diets. This includes the consideration of
different scenarios that can inform decisions for
policy reforms.

 Cost of actual diet – which measures the cost of
the average diet based on the average national
food expenditure that is currently observed in
the data – and is thus reflected in the baseline

 Per capita consumption of dairy products
(i.e. raw milk, processed milk, cheese)
 Per capita consumption of animal fats and
vegetable oils
 Per capita consumption of sugar and sweeteners
 Per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables

Repurposing scenarios
These scenarios simulate the reallocation
of current budgets supporting agricultural
producers using different policy instruments.
This is done for all countries from all
geographical regions, in order to reduce the cost
and increase the affordability of a healthy diet
(see Table 7). This reallocation is implemented
linearly between 2023 and 2028, and impacts are
examined for 2030, a year by which sufficient time
will have elapsed for policy changes to have been
implemented and for markets and investments to
have adjusted.

Per capita consumption focuses on the food
groups whose level of current per capita
consumption in each country/region does not
yet match the recommended levels for that
country/region, as defined by the FBDGs used
for the computation of the cost of a healthy diet
(see Section 2.3, Box 13 and Annex 2E). In the
policy scenarios, any increase in the production
and availability of these food groups as a
result of a policy change will increase their
consumption so that markets clear. ac The
assumption is that consumers will be readily
available to fully absorb the increased food
availability. Of course, for this to occur in
practice, other policies that target consumer
behaviour will simultaneously be needed, as
further explained in Section 4.2.

The policy instruments under consideration
are price incentives through border measures
and market price controls, fiscal subsidies
given to producers individually, and fiscal
subsidies to consumers (as defined in
Section 3.1). Because the policy objective is to
reduce the cost and increase the affordability
of a healthy diet – sustainably and inclusively,
the repurposing scenarios are such that food
products whose current consumption levels are
low relative to recommended dietary levels are
subsidized at a higher rate than all other food
products. Food products are classified in terms
of such suboptimal intake, and the targeted
level of support is defined based on how this

BOX 13 CLASSIFICATION OF FOOD PRODUCTS AS LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH PRIORITY FOR INCREASING

THEIR AVAILABILITY AND CONSUMPTION TO MEET RECOMMENDED DIETARY LEVELS
Classifying food products for their contribution to a
healthy diet is critical in the scenario design. At the
same time, there are no unique and objective criteria
to define such classification. Moreover, regional
specificities, not only in terms of production practices,
but also in relation to dietary habits and cultural
preferences, can also impact the classification.
In the three repurposing scenarios analysed in this
section, agricultural products are classified based on
the level of current per capita consumption (adjusting
for food loss) in each country/region, relative to the
recommended levels for that country/region, as
defined by the FBDGs used for the computation of the
cost of a healthy diet (see Section 2.3 and Annex 2E).
A product is characterized as a “high-priority” food
if its current consumption level was on average less
than 80 percent of the recommended level to adhere
to a least cost healthy diet. A product is characterized
as a “medium-priority” food if its current per capita

consumption in the country/region falls between 80
and 120 percent of the recommended level. A product
is characterized as a “low-priority” food if its current
per capita consumption in the country/region exceeds
120 percent of the recommended level.
Figure A shows the percent of regions for which a
food group is classified as “high priority”, “medium
priority” or “low priority”. Vegetables and fruits
are identified in the first two categories in over
95 percent of the regions analysed. Dairy products
and fishery products are also identified as high- and
medium-priority food groups. “Low-priority” foods
include vegetable oils in some regions. Grains such
as rice, wheat and maize are classified most often as
“medium-priority” foods.
Table A presents the targeted support changes
for each of the repurposing scenarios, according
to whether foods are classified as “high priority”,
“medium priority” or “low priority”.

» Repurposing price incentives through border measures

Removing or reducing border support and
market price controls for commodities that
are priorities for a healthy diet reduces their
prices, particularly in markets with high border
protection. This presumably promotes the
consumption of these commodities in importing
countries; at the same time, though, exporting
countries face higher domestic prices due to
increased international demand (Table 8). As a
result, the percent of the global population for
which a healthy diet is affordable increases
(by 0.64 percentage point in 2030 compared with
the baseline), while the cost of a healthy diet
falls relatively more than that of the average diet
(by 1.7 vs 0.4 percent, respectively) (Table 9). ad To
accommodate the larger availability of fruits and
vegetables, dairy products and in particular fats
and oils, ae consumption for these food groups
presumably increases. The simulated repurposing
marginally lowers the percent of the global

and market price controls in support of healthy diets

Despite a decline over time, particularly in HICs,
a large share of public support to individual
producers is still provided through trade
measures that distort prices (see Chapter 3).
Border measures and market price controls
for some products result in incentives that can
directly affect both producers and consumers of
those products. Changing them can also have
impacts on fiscal revenues (e.g. lost tariff revenue
when they are reduced/removed).
In the fourth scenario, border measures and
market price controls are eliminated or reduced
for products whose current consumption levels
in each region are low relative to recommended
levels for that region. All agricultural producers
are affected, including those of crops,
livestock, fisheries and aquaculture products.
Targeted foods are designated as “high priority”
if their current consumption falls below
80 percent of recommended consumption levels
for that region. These “high-priority” foods
received a 100 percent reduction in border support
and market price controls in this scenario,
“medium-priority” foods received a 50 percent
reduction, whereas “low-priority” foods,
none (Box 13).

ad The cost of a healthy diet is measured at the consumer level, where
a number of additional costs along the value chain could eventually
offset the actual price reduction at the farm gate price. The effect of
shifting the producer support instrument could be more significant on
the farm gate price and producer costs than on consumer prices. This is
also the case for the next repurposing scenarios.
ae Further data and disaggregation within food groups are needed.
Specifically in relation to the types of fats and oils, further data would
be essential to determine the extent to which changes in consumption
of this food group contribute to a healthy diet in all contexts.

in LMICs are offset by declines in the other
income groups.

The move towards a less costly and more
affordable healthy diet is accompanied by a
decline in global agricultural production that,
in turn, is reflected in lower GHG emissions
in agriculture (Table 8). GHG emissions fall in
all income groups, except for the HICs (where
agricultural production is found to increase).
Other effects include a small increase of global
farm income (up 0.03 percent), although for LICs
and LMICs, where border measures and market
price controls account for a high share of total
food and agricultural support, the farm income
effects are negative and greater than the global
average change. The impact on extreme poverty
is minimal at the global level; small increases

Repurposing fiscal subsidies to producers in support
of healthy diets

The fifth scenario redistributes baseline fiscal
subsidies to individual producers (Table 7).
The latter refers to farmers in crop and livestock
farming; producers in fisheries and aquaculture
are not included due to data limitations, which
may affect the results given the importance
that these sectors’ production has for healthy
diets (recall Box 9). Because the policy objective
is to support healthy diets, producers of
“high‑priority” foods are subsidized at a higher
rate than producers of all other food products
(as defined in Box 13). Given this policy objective,
a scenario of repurposing fiscal subsidies to

producers that are decoupled from production is
not being considered, even if such subsidies could
potentially have some benefits on the production
and availability of nutritious foods.

for all country income groups and geographical
regions (Table 10). The cost of a healthy diet falls
more than the cost of current diets because fiscal
subsidies to producers target “high-priority”
foods – which reflects how shifting the producer
support instrument affects both the farm gate
price, producer costs and consumer prices
(Table 11). At the given increased production and
lower price, per capita consumption of fruits and
vegetables increases globally (by 1.5 percent) and
across all country income groups and regions.

Most of the direct impacts of redistributing
fiscal subsidies to producers on farm income
and production are expected to be felt in HICs
and UMICs who provide most fiscal subsidies.
When this redistribution is bias towards
“high-priority” foods, farm income falls globally
(by 0.94 percent in 2030 compared with the
baseline) whereas, in contrast, agricultural
production increases mildly (by 0.27 percent)
(Table 10).

The simulated repurposing of fiscal subsidies
to producers increases the affordability of a
healthy diet more than the simulated repurposing
of border measures and market price controls
(compare Table 10 and Table 8). It also reduces the
percent of the global population in extreme poverty
and experiencing undernourishment. However, an
important trade-off – not seen in the previous
repurposing scenario – is that total GHG emissions
from agriculture increase (by 1.5 percent) reflecting

The overall increase in the production of
“high-priority” foods reduces their prices,
benefiting nutritious food consumption and
resulting in an increase of the global population
who can afford a healthy diet (by 0.81 percentage
point in 2030). This is unambiguously the case

the higher agricultural production, including
high-protein-rich foods such as dairy products
whose consumption increases to meet dietary
levels particularly in LMICs (see Table 10).af

increases more, and agriculture emits fewer
GHG emissions because this scenario is not
primarily designed to increase the production and
availability of food groups (e.g. dairy products)
to meet dietary guidelines (compare Table 10 with
Table A6.4 in Annex 6).

Annex 6 shows results from a variant of this
scenario, which aims to distribute fiscal subsidies
to producers more fairly, so it implicitly removes
the current bias towards high-priority foods. ag
The results are similar to those presented for the
fifth scenario in terms of direction; in terms of
magnitude, the fact that there is no targeting for
“high-priority” foods means the affordability of
a healthy diet increases slightly less. Also, farm
incomes fall more, agricultural production

Shifting fiscal subsidies from producers to consumers
in support of healthy diets

The last repurposing scenario examines what
would happen if all countries from all regions
converted fiscal subsidies to producers into
fiscal subsidies to consumers of “high-priority”
foods (see Table 7). In this new scenario the fiscal
subsidies initially allocated to producers no
longer stay within the agriculture sector, although
they remain within the agrifood system.

af In practice – and not taken into account in the modelling results –
reduced consumption of dairy products is recommended to meet dietary
guidelines in many high-income contexts, and reduced dairy consumption
to meet those guidelines could offset the increased GHG emissions.

With fiscal subsidies going to consumers albeit
still targeting “high-priority” foods, the cost of
a healthy diet falls more notably than in the two
previous repurposing scenarios, both in absolute

ag In this case, production and consumption decisions are affected
only through income effects in the sense that their production and
consumption decisions are no longer linked to the subsidy itself.

terms (by 3.34 percent in 2030 compared with the
baseline) and relative to the average diet (Table 13).
The percent of the population that can afford a
healthy diet increases (by almost 0.8 percentage
point) but slightly less so than in the fiscal
subsidies to producer’s scenario due to the income
effect, as further explained below (Table 12).
Per capita consumption levels of dairy products,
fats and oils, and fruits and vegetables are all
estimated to rise at the global level, although
there are regional differences due to regional
diversities in determining “high-priority” foods
(Box 13). The estimated impacts are largest for per
capita consumption of fats and oils, particularly
in MICs and across regions in Asia.

and 0.2 percent in 2030 relative to the baseline)
(Table 12). Farm income exhibits the largest relative
drop in HICs (down 13.8 percent), but it also falls
in UMICs and LMICs. Let us recall that most
fiscal subsidies are provided in HICs and UMICs,
so most of the direct impacts of shifting them
from producers to consumers are expected to be
felt in countries of those income groups.
LICs are a particular case in this scenario as they
gain through increased demand for the nutritious
foods they produce from other countries where
consumers are now presumably eating more
healthily. Thus, farm income and agricultural
production increase in these countries (Table 12).
However, because fiscal subsidies are relatively
small in LICs, consumer subsidies are also
negligible to fully offset the rise in agricultural
prices resulting from increased demand for their
food from the rest of the world. Thus, the cost
of current and a healthy diet is estimated to rise
in LICs (by 0.44 and 0.20 percent, respectively),
particularly in Africa. Nonetheless, a healthy diet
is more affordable in these countries due to an
increase in consumers’ incomes – but, in practice,

Important positive synergies in this scenario
include a reduction in extreme poverty and
undernourishment levels, due in part to
increased farm income in LICs. Moreover, world
GHG emissions fall due to a reduction in
agricultural production. In contrast, this scenario
is found to hit producers hard in the absence
of their subsidies. Globally, farm income and
agricultural production fall (respectively, by 3.7

continues to be an increase, but it is significantly
lower compared with the previous scenario. ah

Compared with the previous scenario where
fiscal subsidies stay within agriculture, shifting
fiscal subsidies from producers to consumers
avoids the trade-off in terms of GHG emissions
in agriculture but triggers trade-offs in terms of
farm income and agricultural production in HICs,
UMICs and LMICs and in terms of the cost of
diets in LICs, particularly in Africa. Also, while
in the previous scenario per capita consumption
increased only for fruits and vegetables, globally,
in this last repurposing scenario changes in
relative prices are such that the per capita
consumption of dairy products and fats and
oils also goes up; for fruits and vegetables there

ah While both scenarios of repurposing fiscal subsidies assume the
same rate of subsidies across all targeted high-priority foods, the
consequences in terms of relative prices at the consumer level varies
significantly if the policy instrument is a consumer subsidy versus a
producer subsidy. Indeed, a given subsidy rate at the farm gate level will
lead to a higher reduction in consumer prices for fruits and vegetables,
compared with the same subsidy rate given to more processed products
such as vegetable oils and dairy products; therefore, consumption of
fruits and vegetables will increase more when the increase in the subsidy
is given to the producer rather than the consumer. Also, the relative
economic size of the fruits and vegetables sector, compared with that of
dairy and vegetable oils, will be larger when measured at farm gate than
at retail level. Therefore, when applying the same rate of support across
these products, the fruits and vegetable sector will receive a higher share
of support if this is given to the producer rather than the consumer.

Repurposing and economic recovery

The repurposing of support to food and
agriculture must also consider the possibility that,
while healthy diets become more affordable to
all, sustainably and equitably, economies can also
achieve a sustained economic recovery. This is
particularly important in the current world
economic context.

Reducing border measures and market price
support for agricultural products whose
consumption is low relative to dietary guidelines
increases GDP unambiguously across income
groups (Figure 23) and regions (not shown
here). Gains are largest in LMICs and LICs
where border measure support is often highly
distortive (see Section 3.1).

It is not obvious that targeting support to
“high-priority” foods – as defined and simulated
above – will limit or spur GDP growth. In fact,
targeting support to “high-priority” foods for
a healthy diet could imply specialization in
the production of commodities for which some
countries would have neither a comparative nor
a competitive advantage. The resulting evolution
of world prices and the trade position on specific
commodities could lead to GDP losses in some
countries/regions. In the end, we are confronted
with an empirical question.

Repurposing fiscal subsidies to producers
towards commodities where consumption
is low relative to recommended dietary
levels results in efficiency losses for UMICs
– particularly in Asia where large levels of
support are moved to less efficient production
outcomes. As a result, GDP falls in this
region. In LICs, efficiency loss is minimal
because there is little fiscal support to
repurpose; however, those countries see GDP
gains due to higher agricultural prices and
increased exports.

consumers. But the results differ by country
income group and geographical region.

Shifting fiscal subsidies from producers to
consumers of agricultural products whose
consumption is low relative to nutritional
guidelines tends to benefit most geographical
regions – and Latin America and the Caribbean
in particular (not shown here). Across income
groups, the exception is LICs (particularly in
Africa, which is not shown here) which lose
marginally because most of these countries
are net food‑importing countries facing
higher prices.

The case for general services support in LICs

In addition to supporting food and agriculture
differently through shifts in price incentives via
border measures and market price controls as
well as fiscal subsidies under the same budgets,
governments may also consider reallocating
part of their budgets to increase GSS, which
include public expenditure (or budget transfers)
for the provision of public or collective goods
(see Chapter 3). In principle, this type of public
expenditure could affect productivity in
agriculture more directly, of course, provided
that governments ensure it has high value and
quality at subnational levels where it is most
needed, which is often contingent on resource

In sum, repurposing support that targets the
higher priority foods for a healthy diet would
support economic recovery globally, provided
this is realized through the reduction of border
measures and market price controls or the
shifting of fiscal subsidies from producers to
| 102 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

transfers from central to provincial, district or
municipal levels and relevant capacities to carry
this out.

The study of Mexico, in particular, calls for
prioritizing public investments in agriculture
also taking nutrition into consideration. 223 A key
recommendation is to invest in the sugar cane
sector as it provides the highest output growth,
welfare and poverty reduction gains compared to
other agricultural sectors. Instead of using sugar
cane for producing sugar-sweetened beverages
and confectionery for final consumption
(which the study recommends taxing), the
recommendation of the study is to take advantage
of the sector potential as a major feedstock
for biofuel.

GSS has not been included in the global scenarios
analysed above for several reasons, an important
one being a lack of unambiguous evidence of
the extent to which different types of these
expenditures can actually affect productivity
across countries/regions. The effect of GSS on
productivity will be different across individual
countries, whereas in the global scenarios several
countries are aggregated together in a single
region, which makes any GSS-related scenario
and its impact on productivity more difficult to
interpret. In this regard, country-specific analysis
may be more meaningful.

The idea that GSS expenditures should be
prioritized to make the most economic and social
gains is key for countries at very low levels
of public support for agriculture but that still
exhibit significant productivity gaps. How to
optimize the low public budgets allocated to
agriculture in LICs becomes of upmost
importance to ensure that these countries’
agricultural transformation objectives are well
aligned with the objective of reducing the cost
and increasing the affordability of healthy diets.
It is not so obvious that these multiple objectives
can be met without trade-offs, unless budgets
for agriculture are repurposed very carefully to
ensure they can benefit all actors collectively,
including women and youth.

General government services will not benefit
producers all the time at country level, because,
inter alia, a large number of farmers already
benefit from their provision; they only affect
some aspects of the food value chain; they are
earmarked to programmes with design and
implementation problems; or because of political
economy considerations. In HICs, which have
generally reached the “frontier” on several
general government services expenditures,
adding new lab facilities or sanitary inspectors
or new rural infrastructure, for example, may
not result in significant productivity gains
compared to less advanced economies. On the
contrary, GSS expenditures could make a
difference in LICs that are pursuing agricultural
transformation but still exhibit a deficit of public
services and productivity gaps.

A study for Ethiopia confirms it is possible
to achieve policy coherence across multiple
objectives if the public budget allocated
for agriculture is repurposed optimally.
Optimality refers to reaching a compromise
in policymaking to reallocate the same budget
in a unique way whereby it is not possible to
improve in at least one policy objective without
worsening any of the other policy objectives
(Box 14).

Studies that rely on country-specific CGE models
for a LIC like Uganda, 233 or even a MIC like
Mexico, 223 have analysed the impacts of a modest
public investment to increase the provision
of GSS (e.g. improving rural roads, irrigation
systems, storage infrastructure, etc.), which is
targeted at agricultural sectors one at a time.
Results include total factor productivity gains
over time and private capital accumulation,
resulting in increases in GDP, agrifood output,
private consumption and rural poverty reduction.
However, these studies recommend that such
public investments should prioritize some sectors
over others to reap the highest economic and
social benefits.

Policy discussion and implications
The scenario analysis points to potential
options by which all countries in the world can
repurpose existing public support to food and
agriculture to increase the affordability of a
healthy diet, a necessary – albeit insufficient
– condition for healthy diets to be consumed.
Undernourishment and extreme poverty are
generally found to decrease (sometimes very
mildly) at the global level when the affordability

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

BOX 14 OPTIMIZING PUBLIC BUDGETS TO ALIGN AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND HEALTHY DIETS’

AFFORDABILITY OBJECTIVES: EVIDENCE FOR ETHIOPIA
FAO has developed an innovative policy optimization
tool to help policymakers address their most common
problem: i.e. to seek multiple objectives that can be
conflicting under a budget constraint. Sánchez and
Cicowiez (2022)234 proposed the approach and
applied it with data for Ethiopia. They show how
inclusive agricultural transformation objectives can be
simultaneously pursued while minimizing trade-offs
if a compromise is reached through optimal policies.*
The tool originally considered three policy objectives:
maximizing agrifood GDP, maximizing off-farm rural
employment and minimizing rural poverty. Sánchez and
Cicowiez (forthcoming)235 have expanded the tool to
include a fourth policy objective of upmost importance:
minimizing the cost of the nutritious foods that form
a least cost healthy diet in the context of Ethiopia, as
defined in this report (see Section 2.3 and Annex 2E).
It is thus now possible to understand what the
current budget allocated to all fiscal transfers to
producers (through subsidies and GSS) would look
like relative to an optimal budget that would allow
countries to move towards the four objectives.
The budget is much disaggregated as it considers
the type of expenditure and the commodities whose
production this expenditure is supposed to promote.
In order to facilitate the presentation of results, two
graphs instead of only one are presented.**
Two repurposing scenarios are compared with
a base scenario. The latter starts in fiscal year
2015/2016 and runs through a future year (e.g.

2025). It is a business-as-usual scenario as it shows
what the budget will look like by 2025 if its composition
remains unchanged. The two repurposing scenarios
pursue the inclusive agricultural transformation
objectives (i.e. maximizing agrifood GDP, maximizing
off-farm rural employment and minimizing rural
poverty) between 2022 and 2025. Only in one of these
scenarios is the objective of minimizing the cost of the
nutritious foods that form a least cost healthy diet (i.e.
healthy diets’ affordability objective) also pursued.
Figure A shows that improving on all of these
objectives will require prioritizing the budget differently.
When only inclusive agricultural transformation
objectives are pursued, for example, extension services
in both cereals and livestock farming, as well as
fertilizers – though to a lower extent – would receive a
relatively larger budget allocation at the cost of other
budget lines. When the healthy diets’ affordability
objective is added to the policymaking problem, it
becomes optimal to step up expenditures in irrigation,
for example, notably because there will be more
production and consumption of nutritious foods, such
as fruits and vegetables, which are relatively more water
intensive. In this case, irrigation expenditure can be
targeted to specific commodities (i.e. nutritious ones),
whereas investing in rural roads will have a positive
impact on all commodities.
Because the reallocation of the budget is
optimal, Figure B shows there is improvement on all
the objectives (relative to the base), indicating that

of healthy diets increases as a result of the
repurposing support options.

production, availability and consumption of
“high-priority” foods for healthy diets, on the
other hand, is found to be most effective amongst
the options for reducing undernourishment in
LICs, simply because these countries have very
little fiscal support to repurpose.

An important finding is that, among the
different policy instruments available to
provide public support, repurposing fiscal
subsidies to increase the availability of “priority
foods” for healthy diets globally may have the
largest impacts on the affordability of healthy
diets, particularly if it targets the consumer.
This option, however, also shows some potential
synergies but also trade-offs in the realms of
GHG emissions, farm income, total agricultural
output and global economic recovery.

Repurposing support towards healthy diets by
targeting “high-priority” foods, whether through
border measures and market price controls or
fiscal subsidies, introduces an element of equality
in supporting agricultural products compared
with the current support situation. However, it
could also introduce biases if some farmers –
especially small-scale ones as well as women
– who may be willing to take advantage of the
support, ultimately face resource constraints

to additionally create 25 950 jobs and get 23 429
people out of poverty is foregone.
Pursuing inclusive agricultural transformation
objectives alone is found to be quite favourable to
reducing the cost of a healthy diet. Policymakers in
LICs like Ethiopia may consider it preferable to
find a compromise along the lines of this scenario
should their objectives also include economic
recovery (for which output growth and employment
creation with poverty reduction are key), while
still ensuring that the repurposing of the budget
supports healthy diets. Of course, the optimal
policy mix will keep on changing over time as these
countries develop.

the initial budget allocation is inefficient; however,
there are some trade-offs to consider. When the
affordability of a healthy diet’s objective is added
to the policymaking problem, the cost of a healthy
diet falls the most, and 2 962 234 more people (vs
2 346 193 when the fourth objective is not added)
can now afford a healthy diet. This is the result
of optimizing the budget differently to support
the production of the nutritious foods making
up a healthy diet. However, this is at the cost of
not improving more on the inclusive agricultural
transformation objectives, because the budget is
now biased towards supporting the production of
the nutritious foods. As a result, the opportunity

» and are thus not in a position to specialize in

The results of the scenarios also suggest that
providing fiscal subsidies to consumers tends
to generate more diversified healthy food
consumption patterns with GHG emission
reduction, compared with providing fiscal
subsidies to producers, even if both policies
target the same nutritious foods. This is expected
because reducing the cost and increasing the
affordability of healthy diets is a consumer-side
objective, rather than a producer-side objective.
But then, again, the policy of subsidizing
consumers of “high-priority” foods for healthy
diets does not come free of trade-offs in farm
income, agricultural production and even the
cost of a healthy diet in the case of LICs, which
policymakers may like to avoid in practice.

the production of “high-priority” foods for
healthy diets.
The most important trade-offs are observed when
fiscal subsidies are repurposed, particularly
in terms of lower farm income across country
income groups (and more notably so in HICs) and
agricultural production. These trade-offs are more
pronounced when fiscal subsidies are shifted
from producers to consumers. The trade-off
between increasing the affordability of healthy
diets and GHG emissions in agriculture (and
even economic recovery) is seen globally when
fiscal subsidies are repurposed but continue to
be allocated to producers within agriculture,
particularly in LICs and MICs. On the other hand,
there are far fewer trade-offs when repurposing
support only makes its way through border
measures and market price controls.

In the case of LICs, for example, the cost of
healthy and current diets is found to increase
marginally when fiscal subsidies are shifted
from producers to consumers for two reasons:
i) increased import demand for LICs’ food in the
rest of the world raises food prices, and ii) there
are limited fiscal subsidies in LICs to reallocate
for meaningfully incentivizing the demand for
nutritious foods. This is an important trade‑off
to consider, particularly in the context of
Africa, where healthy diets are found to become
more affordable generally when consumers’
incomes increase, because reducing the cost of
healthy diets presents more challenges in these
countries. However, the poorer households with
low- or no-income generation capacity may
not be in a position to benefit under this type
of scenario.

Of course, it is important to understand
the limitations of model-based scenarios.
The scenarios discussed up until now do
not consider the fact that some production
technologies generate more or less GHG
emissions (or environmental damage) than
others. For example, changes in the pattern of
policy support in the scenarios, with more or
fewer fertilizers for instance, could change – at
the margins – the emission intensity of some
products. But the scenarios do not explicitly
consider a shift towards technologies that
are relatively lower in emission intensity (e.g.
new feed technologies for cattle, improved
bio-control approaches for pest managements,
new crop rotation practices for improving soil
health and reduce fertilizer uses, and so forth).
In practice, repurposing support need not be at
the cost of higher GHG emissions if, at the same
time, low-emission intensity technologies are
adopted to produce the nutritious foods, and if
current overproduction and overconsumption
of foods, including meat and dairy products, in
HICs and UMICs are reduced in line with healthy
eating guidelines. Another issue is the broad
nature of the food categories for the high-priority
foods used in the scenarios because, for example,
the extent to which increased consumption of fats
and oils contributes to healthy diets is not clear
in all contexts, at least not without more specific
data on the types of fats and oils.

To avoid trade-offs, policymakers may not try
to reduce the cost and increase the affordability
of healthy diets by shifting fiscal subsidies
from producers (agriculture) to consumers.
They may consider phasing out fiscal subsidies
to producers that are tied to the production of a
specific commodity and are proven distorting,
environmentally harmful and not promoting the
production of nutritious foods. In this case, the
resources may be redirected to fiscal subsidies
to producers that are decoupled from production
but whose design is nutrition-sensitive,
promotes the adoption of low-emission intensity
technologies and includes other environmental
conditionalities. At the same time, policymakers
may want to take advantage of the evidence

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

BOX 15 IMPLICATIONS OF REPURPOSING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES FOR COUNTRIES’ WTO

COMMITMENTS

nutritional value or which do not contribute to
healthy diets and introduce alternative measures
that include the expansion of public funding to
infrastructure services, research programmes for
nutritious foods, and agricultural extension services
without jeopardizing compliance with the WTO
rules. This means that repurposing does not need
to imply a reduction in the overall level of food and
agricultural support, but rather a shifting to less
trade-distorting measures.
Countries could also opt for a reduction of
border measures (including high tariffs and
in-quota tariffs) on nutritious foods such as
fruits and vegetables, while not changing or even
increasing trade protection for products high in
fats, sugars or salt. Under WTO rules, countries are
allowed to do so up to a certain limit (the bound
level of tariffs).**
Repurposing agricultural subsidies, if undertaken
by many countries, could even open a new chapter
for agricultural trade negotiations at the WTO.
Countries could find new ground for discussion on
how to discipline trade-distorting domestic support.
One option would be increasing the flexibility for
providing product-specific subsidies to producers
of nutritious foods. Likewise, in the context of the
negotiations on market access that includes tariffs,
countries could consider reducing the bound level
of tariffs on fruits, vegetables, legumes and other
products important to healthy diets, fostering trade
in such products.

Box 8 in Chapter 3 outlined how price incentives and
fiscal support measures are disciplined by the WTO
rules. In this context, it is important to consider
that repurposing agricultural subsidies would
have implications for countries’ commitments as
WTO members.
For example, if a country raises fiscal subsidies
to producers on nutritious foods with the objective of
lowering their final cost to consumers, these would
still be considered trade-distorting in the context
of the WTO AoA, as product-specific subsidies
are included in the Aggregate Measurement of
Support (AMS), which is subject to limits. All WTO
members have the right to provide subsidies to
specific products – regardless of their nutritional
value – if their AMS ceiling (which differs depending
on country-specific WTO commitments) is not
exceeded.* It would therefore be important to
consider these limits if a country opts for shifting
subsidies from one product to another.
If, on the other hand, countries choose to reduce
trade-distorting subsidies, they have the option of
providing direct income support to farmers instead.
Income support that is decoupled from production
levels can be used without any limits as part of
“Green Box” measures (Box 8). Likewise, countries
could increase GSS for which no limits are imposed
under the WTO rules, provided that the criteria set in
the AoA are met.
In essence, countries could reduce or eliminate
product-specific subsidies for products with lower

* In providing trade-distorting support, LICs and MICs enjoy additional flexibilities under the “Special and Differential Treatment” provisions of the WTO.
This includes agricultural input subsidies, which can be provided without any limits. ** Actual tariffs that the countries apply (applied tariffs) on
agricultural and food products can be at any level below or equal to the bound level for each product.

To take advantage of the opportunities that
repurposing support may offer in practice,
countries will have to get together at the
multilateral table; unilateral action may be
useful but insufficient in some cases, and in
others it could have damaging consequences.
The repurposing of border measures and
market price controls and fiscal subsidies will
have to consider countries’ commitments and

emerging from this report, which indicates that a
fiscal subsidy to commodities whose consumption
needs to increase to follow dietary guidelines is
a very efficient policy. Unfortunately, subsidies
to consumers form the tiniest share of all the
support being provided to food and agriculture
in the world (see Figure 18 in Chapter 3). To make
the most of such fiscal subsidies, it is important to
step up consumer support.

flexibilities under current WTO rules, as well as
issues in the ongoing negotiations (Box 15).

Organizations [IFIs], regional development
banks, the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Programme [GAFSP], and so forth) will be
key to ease the transition towards higher GSS,
especially in LICs. n

The issue of GSS to improve the affordability
of healthy diets is a special case. It is mostly
relevant for countries where the current level
of this type of support is low, agricultural
transformation is still underway, and existing
productivity gaps in agriculture remain large,
which is generally the case of LICs and LMICs.
In the context of healthy diets, GSS can be a
critical component of public support to address
issues such as, for example, Post-Harvest
handling and Post-Harvest Loss (PHL), which can
particularly affect perishable nutritious foods.
When in line with the provisions of the relevant
WTO agreements, this type of public expenditure
can be provided without limits (Box 15).

Moreover, by definition, GSS will collectively
support agriculture, without excluding small
farmers, women and youth. However, the way
in which GSS expenditures are repurposed or
scaled up in practice needs to take into account
that productivity gaps are larger for some of
these agrifood systems actors, particularly
women who generally exhibit limited access
to and control of productive resources and
livelihood assets such as land and credit,
inadequate agricultural extension and other
services and rural infrastructure. 236

For repurposing scenarios such as those
discussed in the preceding section to
materialize, thus effectively contributing to
making a healthy diet less costly and more
affordable, other agrifood systems policies,
and policies and incentives outside agrifood
systems, will be needed (see Figure 1 in
Chapter 1). If aligned and put in place, these
complementing policies can offer support in two
ways (Figure 24). First, they can provide incentives
(or disincentives) that can support shifts in
food supply chains, food environments and
consumer behaviour towards healthy eating
patterns. Second, they can ease or mitigate the
unintended consequences or trade-offs from
repurposing support, particularly if these
include a reduction in the access to nutritious
foods and healthy diets for vulnerable and
disadvantaged population groups.

A key challenge for policymakers in LICs,
and perhaps also some LMICs, will not only
be to reach compromises in repurposing food
and agricultural support to achieve several
inclusive agricultural transformation objectives
that are well aligned with reducing the cost of
nutritious foods. Considering their low budgets,
governments of these countries will also have
to mobilize significant financing to step up the
provision of: i) GSS where it has to be mostly
prioritized to effectively bridge productivity
gaps in the production of nutritious foods with
inclusivity and sustainability; and ii) fiscal
subsidies to consumers to increase affordability.
In this regard, international public investment
support (e.g. from International Financial

Attention must also be given to the private
sector, not just farmers but agribusiness and also
enterprises in other sectors that constitute the
food industry, as their actions can enable or go
against the intended objectives of repurposing
support in practice. Ignoring the interlinkages
between agrifood systems and other systems can
produce unintended and uncompensated costs
and consequences.

policies incentivize changes in the nutritional
quality of the food supply. A non-exhaustive
analysis of policies oriented to these objectives is
presented below.

The 2020 and 2021 editions of this report have
highlighted and examined in-depth several
agrifood systems policies that, while not designed
directly to increase the availability and reduce the
cost of nutritious foods, will support repurposing
efforts by promoting shifts in food supply
chains and enabling healthy food environments
and consumer behaviours that promote dietary
changes to healthy diets. 3,15 Shaping an enabling
food environment to enhance the demand for
healthy diets can affect consumer prices and the
incentives needed to reduce the relative price
of nutritious foods. In addition, some of the

Implementing mandatory limits or voluntary targets
for reformulating food and beverage products
Food standards and food reformulation
programmes, with mandatory limits or closely
monitored voluntary targets, aim to improve
the nutritional quality of processed food and
drink products, which is in turn a mechanism
to increase the availability of nutritious foods.
Such measures also incentivize changes in the
production of ingredients from agriculture for
food processing, such as fats, oils and sugars.
| 110 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

one or more essential micronutrients to improve
the nutritional quality of the food supply and
provide a public health benefit with minimal
risk to health. Biofortification, on the other hand,
adds those micronutrients through techniques
of crop cross-breeding with varieties of higher
concentration of desired micronutrient(s) or
genetic modification. 250 These are among the
most cost-effective measures to help prevent
micronutrient deficiencies, 251 as these can supply
essential micronutrients to large segments of the
population without requiring radical changes
in food consumption patterns nor individual
decision for compliance. 252,253,254

Although reformulation programmes promote
products with a healthier nutrition profile so
they can be well aligned with repurposing policy
support, reformulated foods should not replace
the consumption of fresh and home-prepared
nutritious foods.
A comprehensive policy approach to promote
reformulation includes regulatory action to
eliminate transfatty acids (TFA); government-led
reformulation programmes to progressively
reduce saturated fats, free sugars, salt/sodium
and energy covering all major categories of
highly processed food and beverages; and,
adoption of evidence-based nutrient profile
models to inform policies that encourage
reformulation. 237 Food product reformulation
programmes are now in place in 82 countries. 238
National or local policies to eliminate TFA have
succeeded in reducing TFA intakes and have
been followed by favourable changes in health
outcomes. 239,240,241,242,243 Countries that have been
able to shift their production towards crops
producing oils with higher levels of mono- or
polyunsaturated fatty acids achieved more easily
the transition to “healthier” oils than those that
rely heavily on imports and have been driven
to replace the supply of oils rich in TFA with
products with a high content of saturated fat. 244,245
By 2021, mandatory TFA policies were in effect for
3.2 billion people in 57 countries. 246

These are not aimed at replacing a balanced and
diverse diet, but at preventing the long-term
consequences and public health impacts of
micronutrient deficiencies, while efforts to
bring healthy diets within reach continue to
move forward, as might be the case of policy
support reform processes. Decisions on which
micronutrients to add, to which foods and in
what amounts should be based on evidence
of micronutrient intake gaps, consumption
patterns, feasibility of the selected food
vehicle to be fortified, and, if available,
biochemical indicators of micronutrient status
of the population. 252,253,254,255 To achieve policy
coherence, these decisions also need to consider
the foods promoted by the repurposing policy
support, as well as the resulting potential
changes in consumption patterns. In addition
to the micronutrient deficiencies, fortification
and biofortification policies need to consider
an alignment with policies for the reduction of
diet-related NCDs, e.g. salt iodization. 256,257

Similarly, well-designed reformulation targets
can lead to reductions in sodium levels in food
and population sodium intakes. Both voluntary
or mandatory sodium reduction policies have
shown to be effective in reducing salt levels in
processed foods, depending on the products
and the population. 247 The cooperation of the
food industry is vital to the success of such
interventions. 247,248 In order to help realize
the full potential of salt reduction, the WHO
global sodium benchmarks provide guidance to
countries and industries to reduce the sodium
content in a wide range of processed food
categories. 249

Enacting legislation on marketing of food and
beverages, and the implementation of nutrition
labelling policies
Repurposing support efforts can also be
supported by enacting legislation (or regulations,
standards and/or other legal instruments)
restricting marketing of food and beverages
and implementing nutrition labelling policies,
including interpretive front-of-pack nutrition
labelling. 258,259,260 Policies to protect people from
the harmful impacts of marketing of food and
beverages, 261 particularly children from birth
to 18 years of age, are designed to influence
consumer behaviour and help to shift demand

Improving nutritional value through fortification
and biofortification
Food fortification refers to the post-harvest
addition of micronutrients to food, through a
form of processing to increase the content of

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

towards nutritious foods. 262,263,264 Implementation
of policy action in this area is growing, with
52 countries having implemented restrictions
on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic
beverages to children 238 and 144 countries
having adopted legal measures on marketing of
breastmilk substitutes. 265

On the other hand, value-added tax (VAT)
reductions for nutritious foods may lead to a
reduction in their prices, but the transmission
of this change will depend on factors such as
market structure and the seasonality of fresh
foods, etc. For example, in Latvia, a reduction of
the VAT for several fruits and vegetables from
the standard rate of 21 percent to 5 percent led to
a considerable decrease of retail prices of these
foods. However, the retail price reduction only
corresponded to 88 percent of the reduction of
the VAT, which means that not the entire tax
reduction was passed on to consumers. 277

Nutrition labelling can also help increase demand
for nutritious foods. For example, research shows
that the use of nutrition labels is associated with
choosing healthy diets, 266,267,268,269,270 although
many people still do not read nutrient declarations
on the back of food packages – where such
declarations exist – and understanding of such
labels remains a challenge.266,267,271,272,273 Simplified
nutrition information in a prominent place on the
front of food packages (front-of-pack labelling)
can guide consumers towards healthier food
choices and can encourage food manufacturers
and retailers to reformulate their products, being
an important complement to the repurposing
support efforts. For instance, a recent systematic
review found that food labelling not only led
to changes in consumers choices, but also to
significant reductions of TFA and sodium content
in processed foods.269 Forty-two countries are now
implementing front-of-pack labelling initiatives.238

Combining land-use policies with other
complementing policies to address food deserts
and swamps
Physical access to affordable nutritious foods,
which any repurposing support strategy should
aim to increase, can be undermined because of
the absence or low density of food shops, markets
or outlets – particularly fresh foods of short
self-life or requiring refrigeration – within a
practical travelling distance (referred to as food
deserts)184 or in the case of shops and outlets
offering an overabundance of energy-dense foods
high in fats, sugars and/or salt and few nutritious
foods (food swamps).184 Food deserts and food
swamps are often found in LICs, underserved
areas in HICs and are an increasing problem in
LICs and MICs.184

Taxation of energy-dense foods high in fats,
sugars and/or salt
Taxation of energy-dense foods and foods high
in fats, sugars and/or salt can complement
repurposing support efforts towards subsidizing
and stimulating the supply and consumption
of nutritious foods. This type of taxation helps
to curb the demand for such foods and, by
influencing the relative affordability of healthier
food options, helps shift demand towards
nutritious foods. 274 Twenty-six countries have
now implemented taxes on foods typically
high in fats, sugars and/or salt. 238 There is
clear evidence from countries that this type
of taxation reduces purchases of these taxed
foods. 275 Individuals that prefer to continue
paying high prices for such taxed foods become
a source of revenues for the government that can
be effectively reinvested in agrifood systems,
or in health initiatives to help tackle the impact
of unhealthy diets (which can also build public
support for taxation measures). 276

To overcome the challenges of food deserts
or swamps, land-use policies – including
zoning, regulations and taxation – become very
important. National and local governments have,
for example, applied zoning laws and planning
regulations: i) to restrict food retail and food
service outlets which mainly offer energy‑dense
foods high in fats, sugars or salt in certain areas;
and ii) to introduce support and incentives
for the sale of nutritious foods.184,278 Similarly,
regulatory authorities can use licensing processes
to influence what types of food premises are
permitted or what types of food that outlets are
allowed to sell. Several authorities use these
powers to avoid food swamps around schools by
limiting, for example, hot food takeaway outlets
close to school premises. 278,279,280,281 Moreover, tax
credits and exemptions can be used to incentivize
retailers to sell more fresh produce and healthier
drink options. The use of a combination of zoning

laws and financial incentives has successfully
increased the availability of affordable, fresh
produce in some low-income neighbourhoods and
boosted the purchase of fruits and vegetables. 282

production of fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts
and other nutritious foods. Experience in other
countries or cities has shown that public food
procurement policies can prompt diversification
by both farmers and food manufacturers. 286

Implementing healthy public food procurement
and service policies

Healthy public procurement and service policies
are most commonly implemented in schools
(reported in 91 countries). 238 There remains a
great deal of scope to expand implementation into
other sectors including nurseries, universities,
hospitals, residential care facilities, prisons,
military, government offices and food aid
programmes. Only 16 countries have policies
covering other settings, of which only four
countries have policies covering all food procured
by the government. 238

One area of policy that has an untapped potential
to support repurposing of food and agricultural
policy support is the implementation of public
food procurement and service policies. ai By
setting nutrition and sustainability criteria for
meals or snacks and drinks sold or served in
public settings, or bought with public funds,
these policies can put nutritious foods on people’s
plates in the places where they study, work, or
live, while helping to shape eating habits and
shift demand towards healthier diets that include
sustainability considerations. They can also
stimulate increased production of perishable,
nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables and
dairy products, and help mitigate any unintended
consequences of repurposing, particularly
targeting those most vulnerable to these changes
during the transition.

In one example of procurement policies with
a wider scope, in the Philippines, in 2021, the
Quezon City Healthy Public Food Procurement
Policy introduced mandatory nutrition standards
for all food supplies in city-run hospitals, offices,
departments and institutions. A programme to
source nutritious foods and healthy ingredients
from micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises,
supports the policy. 287

The scale of institutional demand and the
structured nature of public sector purchasing
processes can create large-scale, predictable
demand for nutritious foods (both perishable
foods and foods that are low in unhealthy fats,
sugars and salt), thereby increasing the economic
viability of producing such foods, reducing the
risks and creating an accessible, guaranteed
market. The financial scale of government
buying – representing between 12 and 20 percent
of countries’ GDP with a significant proportion
of those funds being spent on food – shows the
potential of this policy measure to influence
wider agrifood systems.

Social protection system policies to
mitigate possible trade-offs
As analysed in the previous section, the
repurposing of food and agriculture policy
support can lead, in some scenarios, to trade-offs
that may negatively affect some population
groups: it includes reduction of farm incomes
and slower patterns in poverty reduction
and economic recovery. In this regard, social
protection policies can play a key role in
facilitating the transition of population segments
or stakeholders that may be negatively affected by
the repurposing of policy support.

The European cities of Copenhagen and
Vienna, for example, found that implementation
of procurement policies requiring a given
percentage of food to be organic stimulated
increased supply of organic fruits, vegetables
and other products. 283,284,285 In a similar way,
the introduction of nutrition or sustainability
criteria that increase the plant-based portion of
meals served in public settings could stimulate

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

BOX 16 SOCIAL PROTECTION IS ESSENTIAL IN THE FACE OF SHOCKS TO LIVELIHOODS
To mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the population, some governments set in motion
their shock-responsive social protection (SRSP)
systems, helping vulnerable households cope with
shocks through the vertical (i.e. value and duration
of benefits) and horizontal (i.e. adding more
beneficiaries) expansion of programmes or other
strategies. Examples are:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government
and WFP were able to ensure that learners
continued to have access to this support despite
school closures, by providing school meals in the
form of take-home rations. 296
 Mauritania, a country recurringly affected by
cycles of drought, established the Tekavoul social
assistance programme in 2015 to provide regular
support to the most vulnerable households, and the
Maouna programme in 2017, to provide seasonal
cash transfers to households affected by drought
and other shocks. Building on these platforms, in
May 2020 the Mauritanian government was able to
rapidly set up a vertical expansion of Tekavoul’s cash
transfer, as well as a rapid scale‑up of El Maouna’s
seasonal cash transfer as part of its national
response plan to address the socioeconomic
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 296

 In the Caribbean, a region affected by hurricanes
and other natural hazards, countries have
increasingly used SRSP systems to respond
to natural disasters. Leveraging on existing
programmes or introducing new ones, by mid-2020
all Caribbean countries had introduced measures
to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic. 296 The Dominican Republic,
for example, set up a temporary vertical and
horizontal expansion (called Quédate en Casa
or Stay Home) of its flagship social protection
programme. The explicit objective of this expansion
was to maintain the household’s food purchasing
power. In May 2021, leveraging on this expansion,
the Government launched the transformation and
expansion of the flagship programme into Supérate,
which aims to reach over 1 million households in
the country. 297
 The Government of Lesotho, with the support
of WFP, has a school feeding programme that
reached all schools throughout the country. 298

Capitalizing on these advances on social protection
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Universal Social
Protection 2030 (USP2030) Working Group on Social
Protection for Food Systems Transformation was
established. This Working Group, stemming from the
2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit, aims to
support countries and coordinate efforts to forge and
enhance linkages and synergies between national
social protection and agrifood systems for better
poverty reduction, food security, nutrition and decent
work outcomes.299

can be an effective way to mitigate potential
negative effects of the repurposing of food
and agriculture polices in countries where
the extension of social insurance schemes
have still not reached wide segments of the
population. During the current COVID-19
pandemic, for example, several countries
around the world have increased the value and
duration of benefits of existing programmes
(i.e. vertical expansion), as well as included new
beneficiaries into their social protection schemes
(i.e. horizontal expansion). 289,290 In Sierra Leone,
for example, the unconditional cash transfer
known as the Et Fet Po programme implemented

a top-up benefit for households with people with
disabilities and was expanded to add 65 000 new
recipients/households, mostly coming from
vulnerable rural areas 291,292 (see Box 16 for more
examples).
In addition to expanding existing programmes,
new social protection initiatives can be
created to support households’ livelihoods in
case of shocks, including from policy shifts.
The PROCAMPO (and later Proagro) programme
in Mexico, for example, was implemented after
the liberalization of trade due the implementation
of the North American Free Trade Agreement

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

of safe nutritious foods by limiting chemical
contamination and increasing availability of
pulses. Preliminary evidence suggests that forms
of regenerative agriculture, which improve
environmental sustainability, might increase the
nutritional content of produce. 302

(NAFTA) in 1994, as a compensatory income
transfer targeted to producers in front of the
anticipated decrease in domestic prices of basic
crop formerly protected by border prices. 293
After 25 years of operation (it was replaced by a
new initiative in 2019), the programme showed
mixed results: it had positive effects in reducing
poverty and inequality, but it also benefitted
more the richest and largest producers rather
than the poorest and smallest, as the transfer was
mostly linked to the production area owned by
beneficiaries. 294
While countries are strengthening their national
social protection systems (consisting in social
insurance, social assistance and labour market
interventions), the design of new programmes
or the expansion of existing programmes
with a shock-responsive approach might
be an important part of the complementary
interventions to address the possible trade-offs
of the repurposing of food and agricultural
policy support. Effective targeting and adequate
benefits of these complementing interventions
will be key for reducing the impact of possible
negative income effects due to policy reform. 295

Because of these synergies, environmental and
climate policies can provide incentives for the
production of nutritious foods that contribute to
healthy diets. Yet, trade-offs are pervasive and
can contribute to significantly undermining the
affordability of healthy diets. A clear example
is provided by policies that aim to address the
environmental externalities of unhealthy diets
(for instance, transportation, packaging, and
emissions of volatile organic compounds required
to produce and market highly processed food
items) – as those externalities are staggering. 3
Internalizing those costs through pricing (e.g.
carbon taxes, or cap and trade systems) could
contribute to significantly altering the relative
prices of nutritious foods and foods of high
energy density and minimal nutritional value,
but this is not easy to implement in practice and
might require global agreements.

Environmental and climate-related
policies and incentives

Health system policies to complement
repurposing

Promoting affordable healthy diets and pursuing
environmental and climate goals can offer
important synergies with the repurposing of food
and agricultural support. For example, supporting
adaptation and mitigation can help enhance the
production of a variety of nutritious foods that
constitute healthy diets while also improving the
livelihoods of farmers and employees operating
along the value chains (Box 17). Additionally,
the production of fruits and vegetables can
contribute to increasing biodiversity and
supporting environmental sustainability. 300
Investments promoting and marketing neglected
and underutilized species could ensure meeting
dietary requirements of the population,
particularly in LICs, while diversifying
production and supporting biodiversity. 301

Food and health systems are intrinsically
interconnected in multiple ways. 310 Effective
health systems are vital to provide needed care
including essential nutrition actions for the
treatment and prevention of different forms of
malnutrition and diet-related NCDs. 311 This will
continue to be the case until agrifood systems
are able to sustainably deliver affordable healthy
diets. Furthermore, accessible health services
are essential to face the potential trade-offs with
regard to income loss or reduction that can reduce
utilization of basic social services, including
health services, by the poor. Therefore, any
strategy to repurpose support to food and
agriculture to deliver affordable healthy diets will
have to look at the health system as well.
Health services that protect poor and vulnerable
groups whose diets do not provide all the
nutrients they need are particularly relevant
in the context of repurposing support efforts.
Examples include mother and child nutritional

Similarly, seeking to limit reliance on chemical
fertilizers by promoting intercropping or
rotations with legumes not only contributes
to soil health but also promotes production

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

BOX 17 INVESTMENT IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION PRACTICES TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HEALTHY DIETS

AND INCLUSIVE SUPPLY CHAINS

By placing increasing pressure on ecosystems, climate
change poses the greatest threat to rural small-scale
producers, particularly poor and most vulnerable
communities. This pressure comes through increasingly
frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts,
storms and floods, as well as gradual changes such
as shorter rainy seasons, delayed onset of rain, rising
sea levels and melting glaciers. Based on this, climate
adaptation is receiving increasing attention and
becoming central to the future of food.
Climate adaptation refers to changes in processes,
practices and structures to moderate potential damages
or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate
change. Investments in climate adaptation solutions
take many shapes and forms, depending on the unique
context of a community, business, organization,
country, or region. Interventions prioritizing the
adaptation needs of small-scale producers and micro-,
small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) along
food supply chains can help ensure the affordability
of healthy diets going forward, while bolstering the
resilience and inclusiveness of agrifood systems.
Innovative governance mechanisms give a real voice
and influence to poor rural people, including small-scale
producers.303
Small-scale producers remain underserved by
global climate finance. They bear the devastating
consequences of changing climate, degraded soils, food
insecurity and irregular migration. So far only about
1.7 percent of the money invested globally in climate
finance is reaching small-scale producers,304 and it
is mostly going to mitigation objectives compared to
adaptation. The Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture
Programme (ASAP) supports farmers to adapt to
climate change. Between 2019 and 2021, ASAP
invested about USD 897 million in climate finance
across LMICs. Most of this finance, around 91 percent,
went to climate adaptation interventions for small-scale
producers. Successful examples of such investments
include the following:

 Djibouti: The Programme to Reduce Vulnerability
in Coastal Fishing Areas, led by the Ministry of
Agriculture, aimed at reducing climate vulnerability
of small-scale fishers by promoting comanagement
of marine resources. While protecting marine
resources, the project was also able to increase
the value of fish sold by 25 percent, the share of
value of fish sold from total catch by 8 percent,
and productive assets including fishing gears
by 7 percent. Also, food security increased by
29 percent. 306
 Mozambique: The Pro-Poor Value Chain
Development in the Maputo and Limpopo Corridors
aimed at promoting production practices of
cassava, meat and horticulture while also investing
in inclusive agribusiness value chains and farmers’
organizations. Through sustainable practices
promoted by the project, cassava productivity
increased by 36 percent, and the number of meals
consumed also increased by 4 percent. The project
also helped to increase resilience by diversifying
incomes, thereby increasing the number of
beneficiaries’ income sources 15 percent. 307
 Tajikistan: The Livestock and Pasture Development
Project II aimed at enhancing livestock
productivity and rural livelihoods while reducing
the ecological footprint of livestock herds on
pastures. The project established rotational
pasture plans, water points, veterinary services,
breeding techniques and fodder production,
alongside capacity building and strengthening of
social capital implemented through Pasture Users’
Unions. The project increased livestock weight
by 30 percent, milk production by 99 percent,
and generated higher income from livestock by
110 percent. Meanwhile, through awareness
raising about the adverse effects of overgrazing
on productivity and the environment, the project
convinced the villagers to reduce their herd size on
average by 29 percent. 308
 Viet Nam: The Project for Adaption to Climate
Change in the Mekong Delta in Ben Tre and
Tra Vinh Provinces supported rural livelihoods
against salinity intrusion, strengthening the
adaptive capacity of target communities and
institutions to better contend with climate change.
The project successfully increased crop income
by 28 percent and productive asset accumulation
by 11 percent. 309 Food security increased by
14 percent, whereas shrimp, coconut and rice
producers who suffered salt intrusion had better
yields and revenues than their counterparts.

 Bolivia (Plurinational State of): The Economic
Inclusion Programme for Families and Rural
Communities in the Territory of the Plurinational
State of Bolivia promoted climate adaptation to
shocks such as droughts and floods and supported
the implementation of farming systems adapted
to the widely varying conditions of high plateau,
inter-Andean valleys and some lowland areas.
The project increased participants’ income by
13 percent and the ability to recover from climatic
shocks by 4 percent. 305

the United Republic of Tanzania). 315

services and the provision of vitamin or mineral
supplements in settings where micronutrient
deficiencies are prevalent. 311 Moreover, health
promotion and education activities of health
professionals, who are particularly trusted
sources of advice for promoting dietary behaviour
change, potentially increase demand for
affordable healthy diets.

To address food safety concerns, FAO and
WHO established the Codex Alimentarius, 316
an international food safety code that includes
guidelines, standards and regulations established
to protect the health of the consumers and to
ensure fair practices in the food trade for potential
food safety hazards. For example, for aquatic
food the Codex sets specific regulations on food
hygiene, sampling and analysis, inspection,
certification and labelling; however, for example
for aquatic food, the Codex tends to be applied, for
the most part, for international trade and rarely
used in domestic marketing, creating different
standards for food safety at local and international
levels.75 To fully support the repurposing agenda,
governments will need to harmonize national
legislations with these same standards for all
levels, including at local levels. ak

The health system has a critical role in protecting
and promoting the health of the food and
agricultural workforce. Agriculture employs
27 percent of the world’s labour force 312 and
workers along the entire food chain can be
exposed to different hazards in their workplace.
For example, an estimated 385 million agricultural
workers are affected every year by unintentional
acute pesticide poisoning. 313 Hazards can affect
the physical and mental health of workers,
and adequate health and safety standards are,
therefore, essential. 310
Important threats that cross the health and
agrifood system nexus include zoonoses,
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and food-borne
hazards. Healthier diets – such as those any
repurposing support strategy should promote –
often constitute fresh, more perishable foods, 30
which are more susceptible to contamination
and spoilage during production, transportation
and storage. Policies and systems must ensure
that these foods are safe to eat according to
their intended use. Food-borne diseases have
significant economic consequences for those
affected and for the health care system. Efforts by
just one sector cannot, therefore, fully address
these issues, and complementary actions within
the health sector are required.

Finally, robust health, food and nutrition
monitoring and surveillance systems are
needed to be able to track the impact, both
positive and negative, of repurposed food and
agricultural policies.

Other system policies and incentives:
transportation and energy
In the 2020 edition of this report, inefficiencies
along the food value chain were identified
as drivers of the cost of nutritious foods. 3
The efficiency of food transportation is an
important area that governments should
consider during the repurposing of food and
agricultural support. Targeted policies and
incentives to the transportation sectoral will be
important for reducing the costs of nutritious
foods. Even if food and agricultural policies are
repurposed, if the inefficiencies and problems in

A One Health approach helps multiple sectors
(including agrifood, environment and health
systems) communicate and work together to
achieve better outcomes for human, ecosystem
and animal health. 314 The COVID-19 pandemic
underlined the links between health and agrifood
systems, and the relevance of the One Health
approach. The Africa One Health University
Network (AFROHUN), for example, provided
a platform for learning and exchange among
stakeholders in diverse fields including public
health, veterinary medicine, pathobiology and
environmental health in eight African countries

ak The WHO Global Strategy for Food Safety, released in 2022, also
serves as a blueprint and guidance for Member States in their efforts to
strengthen their national food safety systems and promote regional and
global cooperation.445
al For the purpose of this section, the transportation sector refers to
the modes by which food is transported at the domestic and
international level, including four means of transport: water, rail, truck
and air.446

transportation am are not adequately addressed,
repurposing support efforts could be undermined
and may not be effective in reducing the cost of
healthy diets.

To this end, investments in renewable energy
sources at the farm level or the introduction
of freight truck fuel economy standards at the
transportation stage can be very coherent.323
In addition, the lack of cold chains is a key
determinant of food losses of perishable foods,
such as fruits and vegetables, and its availability
in LICs and LMICs is much lower than in HICs, 324
making more challenging the improvement of
the cold chains situation with environmental
considerations in LICs and LMICs. As cold
chains are energy intensive, reducing their
carbon footprint is a main topic of research, and
improvements in technology as well as in operation
and management of cold chains can play a key role
in increasing the availability of cold chains logistics
in LICs and LMICs while also taking into account
the environment.325 Taking advantage of the
potential efficiencies in sustainable energy use of
local agrifood systems, considering the restoration
of degraded forests and the establishment of
fast-growing tree plantations, improving the use
of residues from wood harvesting and processing,
and the recovery of post-consumer wood through
its cascading use within a more circular economic
framework 326 should also be considered as part
of a policy portfolio complementing the food and
agriculture policy reform. n

Many governments that implemented lockdowns
all over the world in the face of the COVID-19
pandemic considered the food and agriculture
sector as “essential” so as to be exempt from
those kinds of restrictions. This allowed food
value chains to continue working and supplying
food even in the hardest periods of lockdowns.
However, the lack of transportation was one of
the most serious threats to maintaining the food
supply active in several countries. 317 For example,
in Nigeria, harbours continued their operations,
while internal transportation by traders and
truckers faced limitations that affected the
regular supply of food or agricultural inputs.
To facilitate food transportation, governments
should not only invest in infrastructure but also
support the development of transportation and
logistics services for domestic traders, which
are in most cases SMEs, and are crucial for the
functioning of the food supply chain, though they
are not often recognized as part of it. 318
It is also important to consider the linkages with
energy systems. Agrifood systems are becoming
more energy intensive, and this has implications
for food prices, as well as for the environment.
On the one hand, several studies have highlighted
the relationship between energy and food
prices, 319 and the recent hikes in food prices
have been pushed also by increases in energy
prices. 320 On the other hand, it has been estimated
that almost a third of the emissions of the global
agrifood system comes from energy‑related
activities. 321 Moreover, about one-third of the
world population relied on traditional fuels such
as wood, charcoal and agricultural residues for
household cooking in 2019, with a demand that
in some areas exceeded the sustainable capacity
of forests and trees. 322 The environmental
outcomes of more sustainably boosting economic
activity in agrifood systems through better use
of policy support can be enhanced with policies
that support more efficient use of energy in
agrifood systems.

4.3
THE POLITICAL ECONOMY
AND GOVERNANCE
DYNAMICS THAT
INFLUENCE REPURPOSING
POLICY SUPPORT
The extent to which efforts to repurpose food
and agricultural support will be successful will
depend on the political economy, governance and
the incentives of relevant stakeholders in a local,
national and global context. Broadly speaking,
the political economy refers to the social, economic,
cultural and political factors that structure,
sustain and transform constellations of public and
private actors, and their interests and relations,
over time. This includes institutional set-ups,
“the rules of the game” that affect the everyday
policymaking agenda and its structuring. 327,328

am Please see the 2020 edition of this report for a more in-depth
analysis of the role of the transport sector in the cost of nutritious foods.

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

factors. For instance, the degree of agricultural
protection often depends on the level of political
and economic competition within a country. 334

Governance refers to formal and informal rules,
organizations and processes through which
public and private actors articulate their interests
and make and implement decisions. 329,330

Without political incentives and feasibility to
support this process, any policy change will
be challenging to implement and sustain in
practice. 335 Furthermore, in many country
contexts, bottlenecks within governance
structures can lead to a gap between policy
expectations and outcomes.

The political economy affects the type of political
and institutional reforms and the forms of
governance that are needed to enable and facilitate
the repurposing of food and agricultural policy
support. At the same time, the political economy
dynamics can hamper repurposing support
efforts and outcomes for improved affordability
of healthy diets. 331 It is, therefore, critical to
understand the political economy dynamics and
factors at play and to take action and put in place
mechanisms to ensure repurposing support
efforts achieve their intended purpose.

Recent global discussions, such as those under
the auspices of the United Nations Food Systems
Summit and the COP26 on climate change
in 2021, and the increased awareness of the
importance of public health and environmental
sustainability, provide a unique opportunity
for greater feasibility of repurposing support. 227
Recent discussions of agricultural policy reform
in the European Union (“Farm to Fork” strategy)
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland (new agriculture bill) have
stressed the importance of considering the
health and environmental sustainability of food
production as desirable public goods that are to
be supported. A “public money for public goods”
approach could render subsidies to nutritious
foods that are important for public health
and environmental sustainability politically
more feasible than past production-centred
approaches. 227

Governance, institutions, interests and ideas are
dynamic factors at play that influence food and
agricultural policy support. 332,333 There are three
broad elements that need to be considered and
effectively managed as part of repurposing food
and agricultural policy support:
i.

political context, stakeholder perspectives
and the will of governments;
ii. power relations, interests and the influence of
different actors; and
iii. the governance mechanisms and regulatory
frameworks needed for the facilitation
and implementation of repurposing
support efforts.

Of course, the political context differs among
countries. In HICs, food and agricultural support
has become high compared to the relatively small
proportions of the upstream agriculture sector in
their GDP and employment rates. For example,
the European Union’s Common Agricultural
Policy took up around 35 percent of the European
Union’s budget in 2020. 336 Many LICs often
lack the financial capacity to provide food and
agricultural support in the form of subsidies, thus,
producer support in these countries often entails
border and trade controls, which as explained in
Chapter 3, do not require government outlays.
On the contrary, reshaping border controls might
come at the cost of lost trade-related revenues
for governments. The differences in political
priorities and challenges in each context are likely
to affect whether governments will promote
repurposing efforts and their extents.

In addition, to ensure that the repurposed policy
has achieved its intended purposes, monitoring
and evaluation of the repurposed policy support is
key. It promotes transparency and accountability
throughout the process and can be a positive driver
for sustaining policy reforms in the long term.
The dynamics and the mechanisms for managing
these elements are presented in Figure 25 and are
explored in detail in the following sections.

Political context, stakeholder
perspectives and the will of governments
The extent to which food and agricultural support
can be repurposed depends on each country’s
local context, including its political regime,
interests, ideologies and incentives, among other

In addition, current budget constraints in
many countries of the world make repurposing
an important alternative to achieve these
development objectives without compromising
the economic recovery. Therefore, governments
have an important role to play in communicating
the win-win contents of the repurposing
support efforts, which may provide an
answer to the objectives and interests of all
involved stakeholders.

There are diverging perspectives in prioritizing
areas in the agrifood system that make
repurposing difficult. For instance, while in
Asia and the Pacific the nutritional quality of
food is seen as an important issue, in East and
Southern Africa the availability of food is viewed
as a major challenge to the agrifood system.337
LICs and MICs are in a different stage of the
nutrition transition than high‑income countries
– many LICs and MICs have been shifting from
traditional diets towards diets containing highly
processed foods fostered by global market
integration and aggressive marketing, whereas
in HICs, highly processed food consumption is
consolidated as part of the population’s dietary
patterns.196,338 These context differences and
inequalities affect each government’s incentives,
political decisions and the approaches needed to
repurpose policies.

Power relations, interests and the
influence of different actors
Food and agricultural policy support is the
result of a complex decision-making process
that is embedded and influenced by a range
of objectives and interests. These processes
include the formation of coalitions, bargaining
| 121 |

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

interfere in public policymaking or bias the
science that underpins this process, 342 as they
lobby policymakers, make political donations,
frame policy debates, adopt self-regulation to
pre-empt and delay government action (policy
substitution), implement public relations
campaigns, and so forth. 343

among interests, altering or preventing changes
to decision-making rules, finding ways and
means, or defeating policy choices by restricting
the means available, enabling or preventing
policy implementation, and ensuring voice
or discriminating among actors and groups.
Their success will thus depend on the relative
power of different groups of stakeholders in
favour of or against the reforms.

For example, the amount of money that the
United States of America’s beverage industry
has spent on lobbying activities increased to
USD 60 million in 2009, the same year when a
federal soda tax was proposed. The figure has
stayed continuously high ever since. 344 In South
Africa, there is evidence that the private sector
influences legal challenges or trade-related
complaints relating to nutrition and alcohol
regulation policies. 345

The data gaps on policy support that relates
to food processing, distribution and provision
often hinder the analysis of how the structure
of support itself may be contributing to
existing power structures along supply chains.
In addition, different sectors within a country
or region often have different priorities and
potential trade-offs. These differences between
the aims of different sectors could turn into a
lack of policy coherence that is needed to make
efficient use of available resources 339,340 and
achieve affordable healthy diets for all while at
the same time ensuring sustainable use of natural
resources and resilience to climate change.

Similarly in other countries, governments’
efforts to introduce regulatory measures
could face challenges on the grounds that
the proposed measures could conflict with
binding trade commitments. For example, 245
interventions were made at WTO by exporting
Member States between 1995 and 2019 for
the marketing of breastmilk substitutes. 346,347
In other cases, sometimes the food industry
partnered with other public agencies, as in the
case of Colombia during the discussion of the
food labelling regulation, when some ministries
and agencies argued in alignment with the
industry’s position during the discussion of the
initiative in the congress. 348 Such challenges
contribute to policy inertia and generate
a “regulatory chill” that impedes national
governments from taking action to repurpose
food and agricultural policies. 347,349

For example, a study in the Pacific Islands
shows that there are opposing views on policy
framing when addressing diet-related NCDs
due to conflicts of interest. Though governments
have identified policy intervention options,
implementation has been slow due to diverging
perceptions and priorities. For instance,
there are disagreements between the need to
prioritize public health and decrease imports
of highly processed foods versus support for
increased trade, 341 underlying the need for policy
coherence across sectors.
Repurposing support efforts towards an increase
in the production and trade of nutritious foods
can be challenged by the agrifood industry’s
dominance at the food supply chain level.
Companies and corporations play a significant
role in producing, processing and distributing
food commodities. For example, in the mid-2000s,
it was estimated that four large companies
dominated 70 to 90 percent of the global grain
trade. This concentration was observed jointly
with an increasing trend in the production of
major agricultural inputs for the food industry,
such as raw sugar and vegetable oil crops.196 In
fact, food industry actors often influence and

The influence of food industries extends to
global governance, for example, the setting
of international food standards by the Codex
Alimentarius Commission (Section 4.2).
Food industry actors exerted influence on the
Codex process on the front-of-pack nutrition
labelling 350 and on setting the Codex standard
for follow‑up formula. 347 Food industry
responses to WHO consultations on diet-related
NCD policies have tended to promote voluntary
or non-statutory approaches instead of
legislative measures. 351

of the rural municipality of Huehuetenango
and allowed them to implement innovative
climate-resilient development plans at the local
level. 369 Consumer associative initiatives, such as
community organizations or producer-consumer
partnerships, are currently important actors in
the transformation of local agrifood systems 370
and can also influence and support policy
reform processes.

Retail is another sector in which power can be
exerted and could affect the repurposing support
efforts. In many countries, highly concentrated
power in the retail sector is growing rapidly
in the form of large chains of supermarkets
and grocery stores. 352 These developments are
also driven by other structural factors such as
income growth, urbanization and foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows. 353

The governance mechanisms and
regulatory frameworks needed for the
facilitation and implementation of
repurposing support efforts

A review of studies regarding supermarket power
in Australia observed that supermarkets exerted
power by setting the terms of trade for suppliers,
shaping societal values regarding food through
discursive power, lobbying and establishing
relationships with policymakers. This can affect
several fields such as the governance of the
agrifood system, the availability and affordability
of healthy diets, public health and nutrition
outcomes. 354 Supermarket concentration within
limited geographical areas could also enable the
creation of food deserts, isolating populations
who reside outside the retailers’ locations and
limiting their access to nutritious foods. 355

Vested interests may hamper efforts to repurpose
food and agricultural policy support when not
managed properly. To this aim, the presence of
strong public institutions, 371 and particularly
participatory governance mechanisms, free
from conflict of interest, can positively influence
policy reform processes as they create a positive
enabling environment for reforms, as well as
increase their efficiency and effectiveness.
Similarly, policy reform processes can create and
reinforce governance mechanisms and improve
the capacities and social capital of involved
stakeholders, creating a two-way relationship
in which the institutions, and the reforms
themselves, are promoted and reinforced. 372

At the same time, supermarket chains have the
power to enforce certain food quality and safety
standards on their supply. 352 In many LICs and
MICs, the modern retail sector could become an
important driver of changes within the agrifood
system and could contribute to making healthy
diets more affordable and accessible. 356 The
engagement and actions of the private sector
includes also small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), and the provision of incentives to these
actors can be key to supporting repurposing
support efforts. SMEs can be empowered and
mobilized to the transformation and repurposing
support efforts by “equilibrating” the unequal
relations of the observed powers (see Box 18) if the
political climate facilitates responsible business
practices along the entire value chain. 357,358

Multistakeholder and multisectoral platforms are
common and interesting examples of governance
mechanisms. They can be successful when there
are: i) active and long-term engagement from the
government, ii) public resources to facilitate the
process, iii) a neutral facilitator to serve as checks
and balances and iv) the implementation of strict
accountability mechanisms. The facilitation of
the coordination among involved stakeholders
and groups and ensuring that all voices are heard
in transparent decision-making processes can
facilitate and ease the pressure from powerful
actors. 327,373,374

Civil society groups are important for agrifood
systems 367 and levelling the playing field for them
can also play a significant role in addressing the
equity aspect of policy support. For example,
farmer cooperatives could allow small-scale
producers to strengthen their bargaining position
in front of other agrifood systems stakeholders. 368
In Guatemala, a farmers’ organizations network
improved the agency capacities of producers

At the global level, an interesting multilateral
example is the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)
Movement, a global platform with 65 member
countries working in collaboration to end
all forms of malnutrition with an external
independent evaluation to assess SUN’s efforts.
The multilateral SUN Movement is supported

BOX 18 VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO TRANSFORM UNEQUAL

POWER DISTRIBUTION

Development in the Highlands and High Rainforest
Areas Project provided small-scale producers with
access to financial and nonfinancial services, including
technical assistance, market linkages and leadership
skills to develop business plans. Small-scale producer’s
market participation in crop and animal source
foods increased by 7 and 13 percent, while women’s
participation in local groups and decision-making of
income by 27 and 45 percent.363 In Argentina, the
Inclusive Rural Development Programme provided
funding to producer organizations and Indigenous
Peoples to engage in product development projects
and to invest in community needs. Project participants
were able to increase values of crop and livestock
production by 92 percent and 72 percent driven by
financial services provided to producer organizations
to allow investments in heavy agricultural machinery
for improving production practices, resulting
in a 15 percent increase in household income.
Further, female participation in leadership positions of
producer organizations increased by 10 percent.364
In Papua New Guinea, the Productive Partnerships
in Agriculture Project focused on forging direct
linkages between producers and off-takers.
It supported cocoa and coffee producers by providing
market linkages with agribusiness enterprises and
training in more efficient, market-responsive and
sustainable production practices between 2012 and
2019.365 Asset ownership by women increased by
3 percent and decision-making by women in crop
production increased by 4 percent. In the Solomon
Islands, the Rural Development Programme – Phase
II focused on agribusiness partnerships. It engaged
cocoa and coconut producers to sell their commodities
in value chains by linking them with enterprises
through agribusiness partnerships between 2015 and
2021. The project resulted in higher cocoa prices paid
to producers and higher volumes of cocoa sold, as well
as more workers hired by agribusinesses supported by
the project.366 These increases are mainly driven by an
increase in the total value of production (38 percent
increase), and in particular in crop production
(62 percent increase). Further, female participation
in decision-making on self-employment income use
increased by 6 percent.

Value chain development can be an effective tool to
transform the unequal power distribution currently
observed between small-scale producers, processors,
sellers and other stakeholders within agricultural
value chains.
Small-scale producers in LICs and MICs often face
high transaction costs when accessing markets to
sell their products.359,360,361 Market imperfections and
frictions related to limited access to credit, insurance
and information might further constrain access to
markets. Implementing policies to address these
constraints has been politically difficult, as small-scale
producers often face several obstacles to engage in
collective action, including to add their demands in the
political agenda. These constraints are often greater for
women, youth and Indigenous Peoples. Access to the
markets for small-scale producers is typically provided
by mid-stream SMEs involved in processing, packaging,
transport and final sales. This type of value chain has
been estimated to provide more than half of the food
consumed in Africa.362
Well-designed investments can reduce transaction
costs as well as market imperfections and frictions
by improving access to market information, providing
access to credit and productivity-enhancing inputs,
and potentially increasing small-scale producers and
downstream SMEs’ bargaining power in front of traders
and off-takers. In particular, agricultural value chain
investments operating through producer organizations
or agricultural cooperatives have been shown to be
an effective means to engage small-scale producers
and SMEs in value chains and to improve their market
access. Such investments can also help in “levelling the
playing field” for populations such as women, youth and
Indigenous Peoples, who face even more constraints
in accessing the agricultural value chain in equal
conditions. Greater market access among small-scale
producers, particularly in rural areas, can contribute
to a higher degree of competition in local markets and
higher prices received by producers.
Notable success stories of value chain development
have emerged even in difficult settings in Latin America
and the Pacific Islands, where access to the market
might be particularly challenging in remote and
mountainous areas. In Peru, the Strengthening Local

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

by civil society networks of more than 4 000
organizations, a business network including
SMEs, large enterprises, a SUN donor network
and a UN Network for SUN. With the platform,
member states can align actions around
common results with sectors and stakeholders
working at the subnational level. 375

Nevertheless, while participatory governance
mechanisms are key to developing and
implementing policy reforms, they are not
“silver bullets” for implementing them.
It has been observed in some cases when
implementing regulations in the food industry
to promote healthy diets, that the power of the
most important industry stakeholders has been
enhanced in the context of multistakeholder
governance arrangements, including
public-private partnerships. This is the result
of expanded corporate influence in policy
decision-making. For example, by procuring
in-house expertise, food companies have
expanded their capacity to engage in these
activities and thereby influence food policy and
regulation‑setting processes. As a result, some
structural policy changes have been omitted
from the policy agenda.196 It is important to
safeguard against conflicts of interest in policy
development and decision-making, and tools are
available to help countries prevent and manage
such conflicts of interest. an

There have been criticisms, however, that the
involvement of multinational companies in
the SUN business network undermines the
network’s efforts, for example, by contributing
to the increased influence of the private sector
on policymaking and redefining legal concepts
to accommodate the multi‑stakeholder model. 376
On a national and local level, instruments
that support policy repurposing should be
coordinated between several ministries or
departmental agencies. For example, the
Childhood Obesity Plan in England consists
of several components, the implementation
of each of which involved coordination
across different departments. To support the
development of healthy food environments
in the National Planning Policy Framework,
the coordination involved the Department of
Health and Social Care (DHSC) to develop
health policies and the Ministry of Housing,
Communities and Local Government
(MHCLG) to specify the decisions to support
the access to nutritious foods. In addition, the
Nutrient Profiling Model was set up with the
leadership of the national public health body at
the time, Public Health England (PHE). 377

On the other hand, participatory governance
arrangements can give voice and influence
to the often marginalized groups of the
population, such as people in rural areas,
to raise awareness and sensitize everyone
involved and build coalitions in favour of
more inclusive repurposing support efforts.
Strengthening collective action, capacities,
voice and bargaining power of rural
populations, including smallholder farmers,
can contribute to policy reforms and facilitate
their formulation and implementation, as
well as strengthen the legitimacy of the
reforms among all stakeholders. 303 In addition,
identifying key stakeholders in favour of the
policy reform that may act as “champions
of change” in coordination with the leading
government agency can facilitate the dialogue
among actors. 371 For example, countries such
as Brazil, Peru, Thailand and Viet Nam have
national nutrition leaders, which ensure strong
coordination among actors in government, civil
society and the private sector. In addition, they

Another well-known multisectoral case was
Brazil’s former National Food Security and
Nutrition Council (CONSEA), an advisory
body to the Brazilian presidency composed of
representatives of the government and civil
society, which during its years of existence
(1993–2019) served as a space of dialogue and
articulation among different stakeholders,
and turned into a key facilitator for the
formulation of policies as the National Policy
and Plan for Food Security and Nutrition, the
Food Acquisition Programme, the National
School Food Programme and Brazil’s Dietary
Guidelines. 378

an To help national policymakers, WHO has developed a draft
approach to prevent and manage conflicts of interest in the
development and implementation of nutrition programmes on a country
level. A roadmap for implementing this draft approach in the Americas
was recently launched. 374

CHAPTER 4 POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REPURPOSE POLICY SUPPORT TO FOOD AND AGRICULTURE <...>

are responsible for taking action and being
subjected to accountability during the policy
repurposing process. 379

to increase access to affordable healthy diets and
achieve nutritional objectives. The key issue is
to rely on multisectoral and multilateral policy
dialogues with all relevant stakeholders informed
by evidence on the potential impacts of alternative
policy support options.

Finally, governments should carefully
identify the trade-offs of the repurposing
of food and agricultural policy support and
anticipate the challenges that may arise during
implementation, including scenarios based on
evidence and potential. Governance mechanisms
allow for different actors to consider the
trade-offs of the policy changes and correctly
address them. 380 To this aim, as analysed in the
previous section, governments should implement
mitigation policies directed at the “losers” of the
policy reform, or those who are more vulnerable
to being negatively affected by it. At the same
time, repurposing policy support may threaten
power interest groups, who may resist the
reform or prevent its implementation. As noted
before, the impacts of current policy support on
the availability and cost of nutritious foods and
the affordability of healthy diets are complex
and, thus, need to be determined through a
systemic approach that relies on historical data
and/or model-based scenarios.

Monitoring and evaluation of the
repurposed policy support
Repurposing food and agricultural policy
support does not end after policy formulation
and implementation. The assessment of agrifood
systems interventions has been increasingly
recognized as a key element for the success
of transformation processes; 382 it ensures
accountability and points to the need to adapt. 383
For instance, in 2011 the New York City Council
in the United States of America established the
obligation to monitor and report the initiatives
related to the Food Local Law. 384 To this aim, the
Food Metrics report has been published since
2012, following five policy goals with a total
of 37 indicators, providing useful information
to monitor the progress of the city’s agrifood
policies for both policymakers and citizens. 385

Developing and validating model-based
scenarios should not be purely desk work.
The engagement of key stakeholders is essential,
not only for transparency and accountability
but also to improve the modelling itself given
data uncertainties. In integrated climate impact
assessments, for example, researchers have
interacted with stakeholders such as farmers to
explore and design alternative sets of plausible
future scenarios and climate change adaptation
packages for integrated modelling, to improve
the accuracy and transparency of the results,
compared to similar exercises without farmers’
engagement. 381

Commitments made by governments and
other stakeholders during the high-level
discussions on agrifood systems and nutrition
can be used to monitor and support the
implementation of repurposing support strategies.
Following the Food Systems Summit, convened
by the UN Secretary General in September 2021,
110 countries have published details of their
strategy towards food system transformation
within national shaping pathways, 92 percent of
which featured healthy diets from sustainable
agrifood systems as a priority topic. 386
This priority issue was also taken up by
Coalition of Action on Healthy Diets from
Sustainable Food Systems For All which unites
global actors and countries to align, mobilize
and support action towards this shared vision. 387
At the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit in
2021, 181 stakeholders in 78 countries made 396
new nutrition commitments. 388 Going forward,
the development of solid databases that inform
us about system transformation action including
food and agricultural support in regions
around the world will be essential to see if

However, model-based scenarios need to be
designed and validated by government experts
using official data. Several recent studies showcase
this practice, in which the government advises how
much it is willing to invest and finance agriculture
to enable recovery. Modelers then use that
information to determine the agricultural sectors
that must be prioritized given the results on
GDP growth, agrifood output growth, household

commitments have translated into policy actions.
Closing the data and research gaps in the areas
of the current policy support estimates and the
evidence of the impact of food and agricultural
support1 is crucial to enable a monitoring
framework to better track the progress of these
commitments and to ensure accountability.
For example, WHO’s Global database on the
Implementation of Nutrition Actions (GINA)
monitors and publishes updates on policy
actions on nutrition. 238

Having comparable indicators of the effectiveness
of repurposing support efforts on the different
actors and stakeholders that are involved
throughout the value chain also increases
transparency and enables comparisons of reforms
across countries. 391 On the community level,
tracking can take the forms of participatory
monitoring, evaluation, reflection and learning
(PMERL). This method enables the voices of the
more disadvantaged groups in communities to be
heard to take part in the process. 392 Policies that
promote open data access enable transparency and
accountability when evaluating the performance
and impact of repurposed policies and reduce
the potential of dominant agrifood industries’
influence over the reshaping policy process. 393

Developing the needed database infrastructure
will require collaborating with relevant
stakeholders in international organizations,
governments and research think tanks. The data
collection process of tracking repurposed
policies should be institutionalized 389 with
defined objectives.

For example, the Agricultural Science and
Technology Indicators (ASTI) has an online
interactive data platform that tracks key data and
information on agricultural R&D across LICs
and MICs. This tool provides transparent and
accessible mechanisms to track the impacts of
repurposed measures. 389 Finally, communicating
the impacts of the repurposed changes to
agricultural producers and consumers and
relevant stakeholders throughout the value
chain is important to ensure that the changes
have support and can be sustained. This can be
done by developing a shared understanding and
knowledge through networks and communications
among the stakeholder groups. This is seen as an
important aspect in the process of development
and spreading change in the agrifood system. 367

To start with, it is key to promote the adoption
of a set of consistent definitions that are
internationally recognized to allow precise
measurement of support to food and agriculture.
This should go along with the strengthening
of the database developed by the Consortium
for Measuring the Policy Environment for
Agriculture (or Ag-Incentives Consortium,
which was introduced in Chapter 3) in
several ways: i) first by closing the data gap
on policy support estimates by improving
data on consumer subsidies, collecting data
on subsidies and expenditures targeting
climate-smart practices, as well as natural
resource conservation and resilience to have a
better picture of the public expenditures and
investments that are the most conducive to
agrifood systems transformation; and ii) second,
by expanding the country coverage of policy
support estimates to countries, which have a
specific profile of policy support and/or regional
agrifood systems challenges.

Data development and maintenance will be
key for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
Furthermore, model-based scrutiny helps to
identify whether the repurposed support has
the intended consequences. In this regard,
model-based monitoring should show whether
the cost of nutritious foods and unaffordability
of healthy diets were reduced during
implementation, in a sustainable and inclusive
manner. Synergies with other development
planning processes and related investments,
particularly SDGs (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12 and 13)
should also become evident. The evidence
generated should be the basis through which
evaluation helps identify potential areas for
improvement delivered to governments. n

Other databases and networks can be important
for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
The International Network for Food and
Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases Research,
Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) is a
global platform set up to monitor and benchmark
food environments, government policies and
private sector actions across countries. 390

Caribbean. Furthermore, the latest available
nutrition estimates are based primarily on data
collected prior to 2020 and do not fully account for
the anticipated global setbacks due to the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

his year’s report should dispel any
lingering doubts that the world is
moving backwards in its efforts to end
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all
its forms. We are now only eight years away from
2030, the SDG target year. The distance to reach
many of the SDG 2 targets is growing wider
each year, while the time to 2030 is narrowing.
There are efforts to make progress towards
SDG 2, yet they are proving insufficient in the
face of a more challenging and uncertain context.

Things did not improve much in the first half
of 2022. The lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic continue to impede progress and
create setbacks, contributing to a slow and mixed
picture of economic recovery among countries
that also weakens efforts to end hunger, food
insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms.
The war in Ukraine is also disrupting supply
chains and affecting global grain, fertilizer and
energy prices. Global food and energy prices
are soaring and have reached levels not seen in
decades. Global economic growth prospects for
2022 have been revised downward significantly.
The growing frequency and intensity of extreme
climate events continue to be major disrupters
of agricultural production and supply chains,
affecting food security, nutrition, health and
livelihoods in many countries.

As shown in Chapter 2, between 702 and
828 million people in the world faced hunger in
2021. This is about 180 million more people since
the beginning of the 2030 Agenda, with much of
the increase (150 million) since 2019, before the
COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, nearly one
in three people in the world, around 2.31 billion
people, were moderately or severely food insecure
in 2021. This is around 350 million more people
than in 2019, the year before the COVID-19
pandemic unfolded. Healthy diets, crucial for
enhancing food security and preventing all forms
of malnutrition, are also now further out of reach
for people in every region in the world. In 2020 –
the most recent year for which data are available,
almost 3.1 billion people could not afford a
healthy diet, which is 112 million more people
compared to 2019.

The intensification of the major drivers behind
recent food insecurity and malnutrition trends
(i.e. conflict, climate extremes and economic
shocks) combined with the high cost of nutritious
foods and growing inequalities will continue to
challenge food security and nutrition. This will be
the case until agrifood systems are transformed,
become more resilient and are delivering lower
cost nutritious foods and affordable healthy diets
for all, sustainably and inclusively.

Of the seven 2030 global nutrition targets, only
exclusive breastfeeding and stunting among
children under five years of age have improved
since 2012. No region has exhibited progress in
lowering the prevalence of adult obesity, and
overweight prevalence in children under five
years of age is increasing in more than half of
countries representing Southern Africa, Oceania,
South-eastern Asia, South America, and the

This year’s report is cognizant of the fact that the
current recessionary context makes it even more
challenging for many governments to increase
their budgets to invest in agrifood systems

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION

transformation. At the same time, the report has
argued that much can and needs to be done with
existing resources. A key recommendation is
that governments start rethinking how they can
reallocate their existing public budgets to make
them more cost-effective and efficient in reducing
the cost of nutritious foods and increasing the
availability and affordability of healthy diets,
from sustainable agrifood systems and leaving no
one behind.

in Section 3.2. The distortions that border
measures, market interventions and fiscal
subsidies generate affect trade, production and
consumption decisions, with repercussions for
the environment, food security and nutrition.
Border measures affect the availability,
diversity and prices of food in domestic
markets. While some of these measures target
important policy objectives including food
safety, governments could do more to reduce
trade barriers for nutritious foods, such as fruits,
vegetables and pulses, in order to increase the
availability and affordability of such foods to
reduce the cost of healthy diets.

Chapter 3 shows that worldwide governments
allocated almost USD 630 billion a year on average
over 2013–2018 to the food and agriculture
sector. Support targeting agricultural producers
averaged almost USD 446 billion a year in net
terms, accounting for both price incentives and
disincentives to farmers. About USD 111 billion
were spent yearly by governments for the
provision of general services to the sector,
while food consumers received USD 72 billion
on average every year through fiscal subsidies.
Altogether, the USD 630 billion a year is not
a small amount if one compares it with other
important sources of finance. For example, as
measured in the Global Landscape of Climate
Finance 2021 report, total climate finance –
which has been growing considerably – reached
USD 632 billion in 2019–2020, 394 which is close
to this report’s estimate of support to food and
agriculture. While governments are spending
similar amounts of public resources to support
food and agriculture, agrifood systems are not
delivering on what is needed to achieve food
security and nutrition objectives.

In LICs and MICs, market price controls such
as minimum or fixed price policy to consumers
overwhelmingly target commodities like wheat,
maize, rice, as well as sugar, with the objective
of stabilizing or raising farm incomes while
ensuring supplies of staple foods for food
security purposes. However, these policies could
be contributing to the unhealthy diets that one
observes all over the world.
Fiscal subsidies allocated to some specific
commodities or factors of production have
significantly contributed to increasing
production and reducing the prices of cereals
(especially maize, wheat and rice), but also of
beef and milk. This has positively impacted
food security and farm incomes. They have also
indirectly supported the development and use
of better technology and of new agricultural
inputs, which enhance the productivity of the
subsidized commodities. On the other hand,
these types of subsidies have also resulted in
important market distortions within and across
borders that do not usually exist in a competitive
market. In a way, they have de facto created
(relative) disincentives towards producing
nutritious foods. They have also encouraged
monocultures in some countries, ceased the
farming of certain nutritious products, and
discouraged the production of some foods
that do not receive the same level of support.
The resulting changes in production have had
direct implications for the price and availability
of unsubsidized or less subsidized commodities
and their derivatives, creating negative
incentives for people to diversify their diets.

Agricultural producers take the lion’s share
of all this support globally – about 70 percent.
Governments, particularly in HICs and UMICs,
are providing price incentives to farmers
through border measures (i.e. import tariffs
and NTMs) and market price controls as well as
fiscal subsidies (often tied to the production of a
specific commodity or the use of a specific input).
In contrast, LMICs and LICs have more limited
fiscal space and tend to use trade policies to
protect consumers, rather than producers.
Not only is the amount of public support
significant but depending on how it is allocated,
it can either support or hinder efforts towards
sustainable development – as highlighted

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

reforms will be found in most countries, given
the internationally agreed SDG 2, and in some
cases, well-coordinated multilateral actions will
be needed to enable reforms. Thus, analysing
the effects of potential options for repurposing
support to food and agriculture is also of strategic
importance at the global level. In this regard, an
analysis of model-based scenarios developed in
Section 4.1 provides some important insights to
keep in mind:

Public support through general services benefits
actors of the food and agricultural sector
more collectively, which is in principle good
for small-scale farmers, women and youth.
But as noted, this type of support is significantly
lower than the support provided to individual
producers through price incentives and fiscal
subsidies, and it is more widely funded in
HICs. In some cases, services such as R&D
are biased towards producers of staple foods.
Nonetheless, this alternative form of support, if
allocated for example to research, development
and knowledge transfer, infrastructure,
inspection, food and agricultural marketing
services, and so forth, can be strategic to bridge
productivity gaps in countries at lower-income
levels. More expenditure on general services
and more support decoupled from production
is essential for ensuring food safety and food
availability and can significantly contribute
to lower food prices – including for nutritious
foods. Yet, important gaps exist in the provision,
implementation, design and coherence of such
types of support in many countries.

 A general empirically grounded observation
is that repurposing existing public support to
agriculture in all regions of the world, with
the objective of promoting the production
of nutritious foods (whose production and
consumption is low relative to the dietary
requirements) would contribute to make a
healthy diet less costly and more affordable,
globally and particularly in LMICs and UMICs.
 Most improvement towards this specific
objective would be seen through repurposing
fiscal subsidies, particularly if these were
to be shifted from producers to consumers.
Fiscal subsidies to products whose consumption
must increase to bridge dietary gaps can
result in the most diversified healthy diet
consumption pattern with GHG emission
reductions, especially when targeted at
consumption rather than production level.
However, the benefits could be at the cost
of poverty reduction, farm incomes, total
agricultural output and economic recovery,
particularly if the reallocation of these subsidies
were to be targeted at production level.
 Repurposing support through border measures
and market price controls would also help to
move towards the objective of making a healthy
diet less costly and more affordable, although
relatively less so than in the case of fiscal
subsidies. This alternative policy shift would
however contribute to cutting GHG emissions
in agriculture without the trade-offs seen with
the repurposing of fiscal subsidies.
 Globally, the trade-off between increasing the
affordability of a healthy diet and reducing
GHG emissions in agriculture would be more
apparent should fiscal subsidies to producers
be repurposed to target nutritious foods.
This is because, in this case, dairy production
in particular would have to increase to
enable meeting certain dietary requirements,

This report, while acknowledging data limitations,
has also shown that subsidies to consumers
represent the lowest share of all the support to
food and agriculture. The evidence also shows
that policies and programmes supporting
consumers have the potential to contribute to
increasing consumption of nutritious foods.
This is especially the case of interventions that
are well targeted (e.g. to the poorest households
or the most nutritionally vulnerable people),
explicitly designed to have nutritional impacts
(i.e. nutrition-sensitive programmes) and are
accompanied by nutritional education.
Having taken stock of support to food and
agriculture worldwide and by regions, and on how
the evidence suggests this support affects agrifood
systems and diets, another significant contribution
is Chapter 4. It provides evidence that repurposing
existing food and agricultural support has the
potential to play an important role in delivering
healthy diets at lower costs and more generally
contribute to people’s ability to afford them.
While governments will need to develop
tailored repurposing strategies based on their
country context and evidence, the need for such
| 131 |

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSION

To take advantage of the opportunities that
repurposing support offers, countries will
have to get together at the multilateral table.
The repurposing of border measures, market
price controls and fiscal subsidies will have to
consider countries’ commitments and flexibilities
under current WTO rules, as well as issues in the
ongoing negotiations. Importantly, repurposing
agricultural subsidies, if undertaken by many
countries, could even open a new chapter for
agricultural trade negotiations at the WTO.
Countries could find new ground for discussion
on how to discipline trade-distorting domestic
support. Options could include increasing the
flexibility for providing product-specific subsidies
to producers of nutritious foods, and in the
context of the negotiations on market access that
includes tariffs, countries could consider reducing
the bound level of tariffs on fruits, vegetables,
legumes and other products important to healthy
diets, to foster trade in these products.

particularly in LICs and MICs. More generally,
such type of trade-off may be offset if
countries shift towards technologies that are
relatively lower in emission intensity and,
more generally, production and consumption
become more sustainable.
 Whether through border measures and market
controls or fiscal subsidies, policymakers will
have to repurpose their support considering
the potential inequality trade-offs that may
emerge if small‑scale farmers (including
women and youth) are not in a position to
specialize in the production of nutritious foods
due to resource constraints.
 Moreover, to avoid other trade-offs,
policymakers may choose not to shift fiscal
subsidies from producers to consumers.
Instead, they may phase out fiscal subsidies
to producers that are tied to the production
of a specific commodity or the use of
specific inputs and are proven distorting,
environmentally harmful and not promoting
of nutritious foods. The resources should be
redirected to fiscal subsidies to producers
that are decoupled from production
but whose design is nutrition‑sensitive,
promotes the adoption of low-emission
intensity technologies, and includes other
environmental conditionalities.
 Policymakers may also want to take advantage
of the evidence emerging from this report,
which indicates that a fiscal subsidy to
commodities whose consumption needs
to increase in adherence to the country
dietary guidelines is a very efficient policy.
Subsidies to consumers generally form the
tiniest share of all the support being provided
to food and agriculture in the world; hence,
governments will have to allocate significant
additional resources to them.
 Where agriculture is still key to the economy
and job generation, particularly in LICs and
also some LMICs, support through government
services will have to be scaled up. This needs to
be done, though, with careful prioritization to
ensure that both productivity gaps are bridged
where most needed and that agricultural
transformation effectively helps increase
incomes, resilience and the availability of
nutritious foods, all of which will contribute to
reducing the cost of such nutritious foods for
the consumer.

Policymakers in LICs and perhaps also some
LMICs will need to overcome two challenges.
First, they will need to reach compromises in
repurposing food and agricultural support
to achieve several inclusive agricultural
transformation objectives in alignment with the
objective of reducing the cost and increasing the
affordability of healthy diets. Second, considering
their low budgets, they may also have to mobilize
significant financing to step up the provision
of general support services to effectively bridge
productivity gaps in the production of nutritious
foods. In this regard, international public
investment support (e.g. from International
Financial Organizations [IFIs], regional
development banks, the Global Agriculture and
Food Security Programme [GAFSP], and so forth)
will be key to ease the transition towards higher
general support services, especially in LICs.
This report also acknowledges that making
nutritious foods more widely accessible and
affordable is a necessary albeit insufficient
condition for consumers to be able to choose,
prefer and consume healthy diets. Thus the link
to complementary policies that promote healthy
diets is critical for success. Within agrifood
systems, Section 4.2 pointed out the importance of
policies that promote shifts in food environments
and consumer behaviour towards healthy eating
| 132 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

through which to channel the repurposing
efforts. The engagement of SMEs and civil society
groups – as well as transparent governance and
safeguards to prevent and manage conflicts of
interest – will be key to balancing out unequal
powers within agrifood systems.

patterns. These could include implementing
mandatory limits or voluntary targets to
improve the nutritional quality of processed
foods and drink products, enacting legislation
on food marketing, and implementing nutrition
labelling policies and healthy procurement
policies to ensure that food served or sold
in public institutions contributes to healthy
diets. Combining land-use policies with other
complementing policies to address food deserts
and swamps can also be very important.

To conclude, the need to realign food and
agricultural policy support is not a new issue;
however, it has gained impressive momentum
as a specific issue in the run-up to, during and
now after the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit,
which triggered country pathways towards
agrifood systems transformation and further
called for a coalition for action in this area. As a
result, the Coalition to Repurpose Public Support
to Food and Agriculture is also being formed with
the participation of international organizations,
non‑profit organizations, governments, farmers
and other organizations. 395 The objective of
the coalition is to support countries who have
indicated a desire to repurpose their public food
and agricultural support. An important aspect is
that priorities of this coalition are being defined
according to science‑based evidence.

As shown in Section 4.1, repurposing can lead
to trade-offs that may negatively affect some
stakeholders. In these cases, social protection
policies may be necessary to mitigate possible
trade-offs, particularly short-term income losses
or negative effects on livelihoods, especially
among the most vulnerable populations.
Environmental policies, health system policies,
and transportation and energy policies are
necessary to enhance the positive outcomes of
repurposing support in the realms of efficiency,
equality, nutrition, health, climate mitigation
and the environment. Health services that
protect poor and vulnerable groups whose
diets do not provide all the nutrients to meet
dietary requirements are particularly relevant
in the context of repurposing support efforts.
Not adequately addressing inefficiencies and
problems in transportation would also undermine
and render ineffective such efforts.

There have been vast recent research and reports
on the benefits of realigning and repurposing
agricultural policy support to transform
agrifood systems to improve their efficiency and
environmental sustainability, as discussed in
this report. However, the association, synergies
and links between food and agricultural policy
support and the cost of nutritious foods that
constitute a healthy diet were under‑researched
before this edition of the report. The need to
bridge this knowledge gap was the motivation
for this year’s theme analysis, hoping that the
new evidence that has been presented and the
policy recommendations made will contribute
to featuring healthy diets more prominently
in the global agenda of repurposing food and
agricultural support to achieve SDG 2 and
generate impacts in favour of SDG 3 (Good Health
and Well-Being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities),
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and
Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action),
among other SDGs. n

The success of repurposing food and agricultural
policy support will also be influenced by the
political context, the interests of stakeholders,
market power concentration, and the governance
mechanisms and regulatory frameworks in place
to facilitate the reform process, an important
discussion at the centre of Section 4.3. Given the
diversity of each country’s political context,
strong institutions on a local, national and
global level will be crucial, as well as engaging
and incentivizing stakeholders from the public
sector, the private sector and international
organizations to support the repurposing support
efforts. For many countries, agrifood systems
transformation pathways provide a framework

NOTES:
1. Regional estimates were included when more
than 50 percent of population was covered. To
reduce the margin of error, estimates are presented
as three-year averages.
2. FAO estimates of the percentage of people in the
total population living in households where at least
one adult has been found to be food insecure.
3. Country-level results are presented only for those
countries for which estimates are based on official
national data (see note c) or as provisional
estimates, based on FAO data collected through the
Gallup World Poll, Geopoll or Kantar for countries
whose national relevant authorities expressed no
objection to their publication. Note that consent to
publication does not necessarily imply validation of
the estimate by the national authorities involved and
that the estimate is subject to revision as soon as
suitable data from official national sources are
available. Global, regional and subregional
aggregates are based on data collected in
approximately 150 countries.
4. The estimates referring to the middle of the
projected ranges for the years 2020 and 2021 were
used to calculate the three-year averages.
5. For regional estimates, values correspond to the
model predicted estimates for the year 2020. For
countries, the latest data available from 2014 to
2020 are used.

6. The collection of household survey data on child
height and weight were limited in 2020 due to the
physical distancing measures required to prevent
the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys
included in the database were carried out (at least
partially) in 2020. The estimates on child stunting,
wasting and overweight are therefore based almost
entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not
take into account the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.
7. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
8. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2014 to 2020 are used
with the exception of China where the latest data are
from the year 2013.
* Wasting under 5 years of age and low birthweight
regional aggregates exclude Japan.
** The Northern America wasting estimates are
derived applying mixed-effect models with
subregions as fixed effects; data were available only
for the United States of America, preventing the
estimation of standard errors (and confidence
intervals). Further details on the methodology are
described in De Onis, M., Blössner, M., Borghi, E.,
Frongillo, E.A. & Morris, R. 2004. Estimates of
global prevalence of childhood underweight in 1990
and 2015. Journal of the American Medical

Association, 291(21): 2600–2606. Model selection
is based on best fit.
a. Consecutive low population coverage; interpret
with caution.
b. Based on official national data.
c. For years when official national data are not
available, the values are projected using FAO data or
estimates. See Annex 1B for further details.
d. The food insecurity estimate for 2019 in South
Africa is based on the GHS 2019 national survey
(prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), pointing to a
prevalence of severe food insecurity of 7 percent
and a prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity of 17.3 percent of the national population.
e. Data informing the 2020 food insecurity estimates
come from a national COVID-19 impact assessment
survey with a reference period of 3 months;
therefore, comparability with the rest of the series
may be affected.
f. Based on official national data collected in 2019
and 2020 through EU-SILC.
g. Most recent input data are from before 2000,
interpret with caution.
h. Pending review.

<2.5 = PoU less than 2.5 percent; <0.5 = prevalence
of severe food insecurity less than 0.5 percent.
n.a. = data not available.

NOTES:
1. Regional estimates were included when more
than 50 percent of population was covered. To
reduce the margin of error, estimates are presented
as three-year averages.
2. FAO estimates of the number of people living in
households where at least one adult has been found
to be food insecure.
3. Country-level results are presented only for those
countries for which estimates are based on official
national data (see note c) or as provisional
estimates, based on FAO data collected through the
Gallup World Poll, Geopoll or Kantar for countries
whose national relevant authorities expressed no
objection to their publication. Note that consent to
publication does not necessarily imply validation of
the estimate by the national authorities involved and
that the estimate is subject to revision as soon as
suitable data from official national sources are
available. Global, regional and subregional
aggregates are based on data collected in
approximately 150 countries.
4. The estimates referring to the middle of the
projected ranges for the years 2020 and 2021 were
used to calculate the three-year averages.
5. For regional estimates, values correspond to the
model predicted estimates for the year 2020. For
countries, the latest data available from 2014 to
2020 are used.

6. The collection of household survey data on child
height and weight were limited in 2020 due to the
physical distancing measures required to prevent
the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys
included in the database were carried out (at least
partially) in 2020. The estimates on child stunting,
wasting and overweight are therefore based almost
entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not
take into account the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic.
7. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2005 to 2012 are
used.
8. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2014 to 2020 are used
with the exception of China where the latest data are
from the year 2013.

to be lognormal and thus fully characterized
by only two parameters: the mean dietary energy
consumption (DEC) and its coefficient of
variation (CV).

Definition: Undernourishment is defined as the
condition of an individual whose habitual
food consumption is insufficient to provide, on
average, the amount of dietary energy required to
maintain a normal, active and healthy life.

Data source: Different data sources are used to
estimate the different parameters of the model.

How it is reported: The indicator (denominated
as “prevalence of undernourishment” [PoU])
is an estimate of the percentage of individuals
in the population that are in a condition of
undernourishment. National estimates are
reported as three-year moving averages, to control
for the low reliability of some of the underlying
parameters, such as the year-to-year variation in
food commodity stocks, one of the components
of the annual FAO Food Balance Sheets for
which complete, reliable information is very
scarce. Regional and global aggregates, on the
other hand, are reported as annual estimates, on
account of the fact that possible estimation errors
are expected not to be correlated across countries.

Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER): Human
energy requirements for an individual in a given
sex/age class are determined on the basis of
normative requirements for basic metabolic rate
(BMR) per kilogram of body mass, multiplied by
the ideal weights that a healthy person of that
sex/age class may have, given his or her height,
and then multiplied by a coefficient of physical
activity level (PAL) to take into account physical
activity. ao Given that both healthy BMIs and PALs
vary among active and healthy individuals of the
same sex and age, a range of energy requirements
applies to each sex and age group of the
population. The MDER for the average individual
in the population, which is the parameter used
in the PoU formula, is obtained as the weighted
average of the lower bounds of the energy
requirement ranges for each sex and age group,
using the shares of the population in each sex
and age group as weights. Similar to the MDER,
the average dietary energy requirement (ADER)
is estimated using the average values of the PAL
category “Active or moderately active lifestyle”.

Methodology: To compute an estimate of the
prevalence of undernourishment in a population,
the probability distribution of habitual dietary
energy intake levels (expressed in kcal per person
per day) for the average individual is modelled
as a parametric probability density function
(pdf), f(x). 396,397 The indicator is obtained as the
cumulative probability that the habitual dietary
energy intake (x) is below the minimum dietary
energy requirements (MDER) (i.e. the lowest
limit of the range of energy requirements for the
population’s representative average individual) as
in the formula below:

Information on the population structure by sex
and age is available for most countries in the
world and for each year from the UN Department
of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Population
Prospects, revised every two years. This edition of

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

Estimates for the per capita average DES in 2020
(for countries other than the 63 countries listed
above) and in 2021 (for all countries), compiled on
the basis of the short-run market outlook exercises
conducted by FAO to inform the World Food
Situation, 5 are used to nowcast the 2020 and 2021
values of DEC for each country, starting from the
last available year in the FBS series.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World
uses the 2019 revision of the World Population
Prospects. 398
Information on the median height in each sex and
age group for a given country is derived from a
recent demographic and health survey (DHS) or
from other surveys that collect anthropometry
data on children and adults. Even if such
surveys do not refer to the same year for which
the PoU is estimated, the impact of possible
small intervening changes in median heights
over the years on PoU estimates is expected to
be negligible.

Coefficient of variation (CV): When reliable data on
food consumption are available from nationally
representative household surveys, the CV due to
income (CV|y) can be estimated directly. Since the
last edition of this report, 18 new surveys from
the following 15 countries have been processed
to update the CV|y: Côte d’Ivoire (2018), Ethiopia
(2019), Iraq (2018), Kyrgyzstan (2018), Malawi
(2019), Mali (2018), Myanmar (2017), Niger (2018),
Philippines (2018), Senegal (2018), Sri Lanka (2016,
2019), Togo (2018), Uganda (2018), United Republic
of Tanzania (2001, 2007, 2017) and Vanuatu
(2019). That makes for a total of 118 surveys from
60 countries for which the estimate of CV|y is
based on data from surveys.

Dietary energy consumption (DEC): Ideally, data on
food consumption should come from nationally
representative household surveys (such as Living
Standard Measurement Surveys or Household
Incomes and Expenditure Surveys). However, only
very few countries conduct such surveys on an
annual basis. Thus, in FAO’s PoU estimates for
global monitoring, DEC values are estimated from
the dietary energy supply (DES) reported in the
Food Balance Sheets (FBS), compiled by FAO for
most countries in the world (see FAO, 2021).90

When no suitable survey data are available,
FIES data collected by FAO since 2014 are used
to project the changes in the CV|y from 2015
(or from the year of the last food consumption
survey, if more recent) up to 2019, based on a
smoothed (three-year moving average) trend in
severe food insecurity. The estimates are based
on the assumption that recent changes in the
extent of severe food insecurity measured with
the FIES might closely reflect unobserved changes
in the PoU. To the extent that such changes in
PoU cannot be fully explained by the effect of the
observed or estimated changes in average food
supplies, they can thus be attributed to likely
unobserved changes in the CV|y that might have
occurred in the most recent year. Analysis of
historic PoU estimates reveals that, on average,
and once differences in DEC and MDER have
been controlled for, differences in the CV|y
explain about one-third of the differences in
PoU across time and space. Therefore, for each
country for which FIES data are available, the
change in the CV|y that may have occurred from
2015, or from the date of the last available survey,
is estimated as the change that would generate
one-third of a percentage point change in the PoU
for each observed percentage point change in

Since the last edition of this report, the new FBS
domain on FAOSTAT has been updated up to
2019 for all countries. In addition, at the time of
closing this report, the FBS series were updated
for the following 63 countries that have the largest
number of undernourished people, bringing them
up to date through 2020: Afghanistan, Algeria,
Angola, Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State
of), Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Chad, China (mainland),
Colombia, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic

estimates of each of the parameters in the model,
the precision of the PoU estimates is generally
low. While it is not possible to formally compute
margins of error around PoU estimates, they
are expected to likely exceed 5 percent in most
cases. For this reason, FAO does not consider PoU
estimates that result to be lower than 2.5 percent
as sufficiently reliable to be reported.

the prevalence of severe food insecurity. For all
other countries, the CV|y is kept constant at the
estimated 2017 value. As in last year’s report, the
nowcast of the CV|y for 2020 and 2021 – the years
when access to food was heavily conditioned by
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic – required
special treatment (see Annex 2A).
In the FAO PoU parametric approach, the CV due
to differences in body weight and lifestyle, a.k.a.
CV due to requirement (CV|r), represents the
variability of the distribution of dietary energy
requirements of a hypothetical average individual
representative of a healthy population, which
is also equal to the CV of the distribution of
dietary energy intakes of a hypothetical average
individual if everyone in the population were
perfectly nourished. The distribution of dietary
energy requirements of such a hypothetical
average individual is assumed to be normal,
and therefore its standard deviation can be
estimated from any two known percentiles.
We use the MDER and the average dietary
energy requirement (ADER) mentioned above to
approximate the 1st and the 50th percentiles. 399,400
The value of CV|r is then derived as the inverse
cumulative standard normal distribution of the
difference between the MDER and the ADER.

Definition: Food insecurity as measured by this
indicator refers to limited access to food, at the
level of individuals or households, due to lack of
money or other resources. The severity of food
insecurity is measured using data collected with
the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey
module (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions
asking respondents to self-report conditions
and experiences typically associated with
limited access to food. For purposes of annual
SDG monitoring, the questions are asked with
reference to the 12 months preceding the survey.
Using sophisticated statistical techniques based
on the Rasch measurement model, the information
obtained in a survey is validated for internal
consistency and converted into a quantitative

measure along a scale of severity, ranging from
low to high. Based on their responses to the
FIES-SM items, the individuals or households
interviewed in a nationally representative survey
of the population are assigned a probability of
being in one of three classes: i) food secure or
only marginally insecure; ii) moderately food
insecure; and iii) severely food insecure, as
defined by two globally set thresholds. Based on
FIES data collected over three years from 2014
to 2016, FAO has established the FIES reference
scale, which is used as the global standard for
experience-based food-insecurity measures, and
to set the two reference thresholds of severity.

Gallup traditionally uses telephone surveys in
Northern America, Western Europe, some parts
of Asia, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries. In Central and Eastern Europe, much
of Latin America, nearly all of Asia, the Near
East and Africa, an area frame design is used for
face-to-face interviewing.
In most countries, samples include about
1 000 individuals, with larger samples of
3 000 individuals in India, 3 500 in China
(mainland) and 2 000 in the Russian Federation.

SDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated
probability to be in the two classes of moderate
and severe food insecurity. A separate indicator
(FI sev) is computed by considering only the severe
food insecurity class.

In addition to the GWP, in 2021 FAO collected
data in 20 countries through Geopoll® and
Kantar® with the specific objective of filling data
gaps on access to food. The countries covered
were: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,
Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Djibouti, Dominica, Eswatini, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar,
Maldives, Niger, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis,
Sao Tome and Principe, Suriname, Trinidad and
Tobago, and Zambia.

How it is reported: In this report, FAO provides
estimates of food insecurity at two different
levels of severity: moderate or severe food
insecurity (FI mod+sev) and severe food insecurity
(FI sev). For each of these two levels, two estimates
are reported:
 the prevalence (percent) of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure; and
 the estimated number of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure.

government survey data were used to calculate the
prevalence estimates of food insecurity by applying
FAO’s statistical methods to adjust national results
to the same global reference standard, covering
more than a quarter of the world population.
Countries are considered for the year or years
when national data are available. For the remaining
years, the following strategy was followed:

Data source: Since 2014, the eight-question FIES
survey module has been applied in nationally
representative samples of the adult population
(defined as aged 15 or older) in more than
140 countries included in the Gallup © World
Poll (GWP), covering more than 90 percent of
the world population. In 2021, interviews were
conducted by both telephone and face-to-face
modalities. Telephone interviews were
maintained in some countries already covered
with this modality in 2020 given the high risk
of community transmission from conducting
face-to-face data collection during the COVID-19
pandemic. By evaluating Dual Frame coverage

 When more than one year of national
data is available, the missing years are
linearly interpolated.
 If only one year of data is available, missing
years are informed as follows:
– using FAO data if considered compatible
with the national surveys;
– imputed using the trend suggested by FAO
data if national data are not compatible;
– imputed using the trend of the subregion if
no other information is available; and
– considered constant to the level of the
national survey if the subregion cannot
be computed or the trend of other surveys
or the subregion is not applicable to the
country-specific situation considering
evidence found in support of the trend (for
instance, evolution of poverty, extreme
poverty, employment and food inflation,
among others).

As only individuals aged 15 years or more are
sampled in the GWP, the prevalence estimates
directly produced from these data refer to the
population aged 15 years and older. To arrive at
the prevalence and number of individuals (of all
ages) in the population, an estimate is required
of the number of people living in the households
where at least one adult is estimated to be food
insecure. This involves a multistep procedure
detailed in Annex II of the Voices of the Hungry
Technical Report (see link in the “References”
section, below).
Regional and global aggregates of food insecurity
at moderate or severe, and severe levels, FI L,r, are
computed as:
FI L,r =

Methodology: The data were validated and used
to construct a scale of food-insecurity severity
using the Rasch model, which postulates that the
probability of observing an affirmative answer by
respondent i to question j is a logistic function of
the distance, on an underlying scale of severity,
between the position of the respondent, 𝑎 𝑖, and
that of the item, 𝑏𝑗.
Prob(X i,j = Yes) =

∑ c FI L,c × Nc
∑ c Nc

where r indicates the region, FI L,𝑐 is the value
of FI at level L estimated for country c in the
region, and N c is the corresponding population
size. When no estimate of FI L is available for
a country, it is assumed to be equal to the
population-weighted average of the estimated
values of the remaining countries in the same
region. A regional aggregate is produced
only if the countries for which an estimate
is available cover at least 50 percent of the
region’s population.

exp(ai – b j)

1 + exp(ai – b j)

Universal thresholds are defined on the FIES
global standard scale (a set of item parameter
values based on results from all countries covered
by the GWP in 2014–2016) and converted into
corresponding values on local scales. The process
of calibrating each country’s scale against the FIES
global standard can be referred to as equating
and permits the production of internationally
comparable measures of food insecurity severity
for individual respondents, as well as comparable
national prevalence rates.

By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it
is possible to estimate the probability of being
food insecure (𝑝 i,L) at each level of severity of food
insecurity L (moderate or severe, or severe), for
each respondent i, with 0 < 𝑝 i,L < 1.
The prevalence of food insecurity at each level
of severity (FI L) in the population is computed as
the weighted sum of the probability of being food
insecure for all respondents (i) in a sample:
FI L = ∑ ip i,Lw i

The problem stems from the fact that, when
defined as a latent trait, the severity of food
insecurity has no absolute reference against
which it could be evaluated. The Rasch model
enables identification of the relative position
that the various items occupy on a scale that is
denominated in logit units but whose “zero”

indicate the proportion of individuals or
households in the national population represented

IN CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE

is arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to the
mean estimated severity. This implies that the
zero of the scale changes in each application.
To produce comparable measures over time and
across different populations requires establishing
a common scale to use as a reference and finding
the formula needed to convert measures across
different scales. As is the case for converting
measures of temperature across difference
measuring scales (such as Celsius and Fahrenheit),
this requires the identification of a number of
“anchoring” points. In the FIES methodology,
these anchoring points are the severity levels
associated with the items whose relative position
on the scale of severity can be considered equal
to that of the corresponding items on the global
reference scale. The “mapping” of the measures
from one scale to the other is then obtained by
finding the formula that equates the mean and the
standard deviations (SD) of the common items’
severity levels.

Definition of stunting (children under 5 years of
age): Height/length (cm) for age (months) < -2 SD
of the WHO Child Growth Standards median.
Low height-for-age is an indicator that reflects
the cumulative effects of undernutrition and
infections since and even before birth. It may be
the result of long-term nutritional deprivation,
recurrent infections and lack of water and
sanitation infrastructures.
How it is reported: The percentage of children
aged 0–59 months who are below -2 SD from
the median height-for-age of the WHO Child
Growth Standards.
Definition of wasting: Weight (kg) for height/length
(cm) < -2 SD of the WHO Child Growth Standards
median. Low weight-for-height is an indicator
of acute weight loss or a failure to gain weight
and can be a consequence of insufficient food
intake and/or an incidence of infectious diseases,
especially diarrhoea.

Challenges and limitations: When food-insecurity
prevalence estimates are based on FIES data
collected in the GWP, with national sample sizes of
about 1 000 in most countries, confidence intervals
rarely exceed 20 percent of the measured prevalence
(that is, prevalence rates of 50 percent would have
margins of error of up to plus or minus 5 percent).
Confidence intervals are likely to be much smaller,
however, when national prevalence rates are
estimated using larger samples and for estimates
referring to aggregates of several countries.
To reduce the impact of year-to-year sampling
variability, country‑level estimates are presented
as three-year averages, computed as averages of all
available years in the considered triennia.

How it is reported: The percentage of children aged
0–59 months who are below -2 SD from the
median weight-for-height of the WHO Child
Growth Standards.
Definition of overweight: Weight (kg) for height/
length (cm) > +2 SD of the WHO Child Growth
Standards median. This indicator reflects
excessive weight gain for height generally
due to energy intakes exceeding children’s
energy requirements.

Methodology:

estimates which serve as the official JME estimates
(i.e. the stunting prevalence from a household
survey for a given country in a given year is not
reported as the prevalence for that country in that
year; rather, it feeds into the modelled estimates
described in the next section below).

Country-level estimates
The UNICEF/WHO-World Bank Group Joint Child
Malnutrition Estimates (JME) country dataset

The UNICEF/WHO-World Bank Group JME
dataset of country estimates requires the
collection of national data sources that contain
information on child malnutrition – specifically,
data on the height, weight and age of children
under 5, which can be used to generate national
level prevalence estimates for stunting, wasting
and overweight. These national-level data sources
are mainly comprised of household surveys (e.g.
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, Demographic
and Health Surveys). Some administrative data
sources (e.g. from surveillance systems) are also
included where population coverage is high. As of
the latest review closure on 31 January 2021, the
primary source dataset contained 997 data sources
from 157 countries and territories, with nearly
80 percent of children living in countries with at
least one data point within the past five years on
stunting, wasting and overweight. This suggests
that the global estimates are highly representative
of the majority of children across the globe for
the most recent period. The dataset contains the
point estimate (and where available, the standard
error), the 95 percent confidence bounds and the
unweighted sample size. Where microdata are
available, the JME uses estimates that have been
recalculated to adhere to the global standard
definition. Where microdata are not available,
reported estimates are used, except in cases where
adjustments are required to standardize for: i)
use of an alternate growth reference from the
2006 WHO Growth Standards; ii) age ranges that
do not include the full 0–59-month age group;
and iii) data sources that were only nationally
representative for populations residing in rural
areas. Further details related to data source
compilation, re-analysis of microdata, and data
source review are described elsewhere. 401

Country-level model for stunting and
overweight estimates
The technical details of the statistical models are
provided elsewhere. 401 Briefly, for both stunting
and overweight, prevalence was modelled at logit
(log-odds) scale using a penalized longitudinal
mixed-model with a heterogeneous error term.
The quality of the models was quantified with
model-fit criteria that balance the complexity
of the model with the closeness of the fit to
the observed data. The proposed method has
important characteristics, including non-linear
time trends, regional trends, country-specific
trends, covariate data and a heterogeneous
error term. All countries with data contribute to
estimates of the overall time trend and the impact
of covariate data on prevalence. For overweight,
the covariate data consisted of linear and quadratic
socio-demographic index (SDI), ap and data source
type. The same covariates were used for stunting,
plus an additional covariate of the average health
system access over the previous five years.
Annual country-level modelled estimates from
2000 to 2020 aq on stunting and overweight were
disseminated by the JME in 2021 for 155 countries
with at least one data point (e.g. from a household
survey) included in the JME country dataset
described above. Modelled country estimates
were also produced for an additional 49 countries,
used solely for generation of regional and
global aggregates. Modelled estimates for these
49 countries are not shown because they did not
ap SDI is a summary measure that identifies where countries or other
geographic areas sit on the spectrum of development. Expressed on a
scale of 0 to 1, SDI is a composite average of the rankings of the income
per capita, average educational attainment, and fertility rates of all
areas in the Global Burden of Disease study.

The JME country dataset serves different purposes
for different indicators. For wasting, the JME
country dataset serves as the country estimates
themselves (i.e. the wasting prevalence in the
JME country dataset from a household survey
for a country in a given year is the wasting
prevalence reported for that country in that year).
For stunting and overweight, the JME country
dataset is used to generate country‑modelled

aq The collection of household survey data on child height and weight
were limited in 2020 due to the distancing measures required to prevent
the spread of COVID-19. Only four national surveys included in the JME
database were carried out (at least partially) in 2020. The JME
estimates on child stunting, wasting and overweight are therefore based
almost entirely on data collected before 2020 and do not take into
account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one of the
covariates used in the country stunting and overweight models takes the
impact of COVID-19 partially into account.

have any household surveys in the JME country
dataset or because the modelled estimates
remained pending final review at the time of
publication. The results for the 204 countries can
be used to calculate estimates and uncertainty
intervals for any group of countries aggregated.
The uncertainty intervals are important in
monitoring trends, especially for countries with
sparse data and where primary data sources
present large primary data source sampling
errors. When only sparse data are available in
the most recent period, the inclusion of a survey
can affect a substantial change in the predicted
trajectory. For this reason, uncertainty intervals
are needed to enhance trend interpretability
in terms of the caution level employed.
The uncertainty intervals for the new JME method
have been tested and validated with various
data types.

estimate from any survey may be at a high or
a low; or it may fall somewhere in between if
data collection spanned across several seasons.
Thus, the prevalence of wasting captures the
situation of wasting at a specific point in time
and not over an entire year. Variations in seasons
across surveys make it difficult to draw inferences
on trends. The lack of methods to account for
seasonality and incident cases of wasting are
the main reasons why the JME does not present
annual trends for this form of malnutrition.
Generation of regional and global estimates
Different methods were applied to generate
regional and global estimates for stunting and
overweight compared to wasting, as described
below. In short, results from the new country-level
model were used to generate the regional and
global estimates for stunting and overweight,
while the JME subregional multilevel model was
used to generate the global and regional estimates
for wasting.

Regional and global estimates
Regional and global wasting estimates are only
presented for the most recent year, 2020, unlike
stunting and overweight estimates for which
an annual time series is available from 2000
to 2020. ar This is because the JME are based
on national-level country prevalence data,
which come from cross-sectional surveys (i.e.
a snapshot at one point in time) that are collected
infrequently (every three to five years) in most
countries. Since stunting and overweight are
relatively stable over the course of a calendar
year, it is reasonable to track changes in these two
conditions over time with these data, whereas
wasting is an acute condition that can change
frequently and rapidly. An individual child can be
affected by wasting more than once in a calendar
year (i.e. can recover but then become wasted
again in the same year), and the risk of wasting
in many contexts can be driven by seasonal
variations, which can result in seasonal spikes
in prevalence. For example, wasting prevalence,
in some contexts, may double between the
post‑harvest season (often associated with higher
food availability and weather patterns that are
less likely to cause disease) and the pre-harvest
season (often associated with food shortages,
heavy rains and related diseases that can affect
nutrition status). Given that country surveys can
be collected during any season, the prevalence

For the prevalence of wasting, as surveys are
generally carried out during a specific period
of the year, the estimates can be affected by
seasonality. Seasonal factors related to wasting
include food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods)
and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria,
etc.), while natural disasters and conflicts can
also show real shifts in trends that would need to
be treated differently than a seasonal variation.
Hence, country year estimates for wasting
may not necessarily be comparable over time.
Consequently, only estimates from the most recent
year (2020) au are provided.

EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING
Definition: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for infants
<6 months of age is defined as receiving only
breastmilk and no additional food or drink,
not even water. Exclusive breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child survival and is the best food
for newborns, as breastmilk shapes the baby’s
microbiome, strengthens the immune system and
reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases.

LOW BIRTHWEIGHT
Definition: Low birthweight is defined as a weight
at birth of less than 2 500 g (less than 5.51 lbs),
regardless of gestational age. A newborn’s weight
at birth is an important marker of maternal and
foetal health and nutrition. 403
How it is reported: The percentage of newborns
weighing less than 2 500 g (less than 5.51 lbs)
at birth.

Challenges and limitations: While a high proportion of
countries collect data for exclusive breastfeeding,
data are lacking in high-income countries in
particular. The recommended periodicity of
reporting on exclusive breastfeeding is every three
to five years. However, for some countries, data
are reported less frequently, meaning changes in
feeding patterns are often not detected for several
years after the change occurs.

int/nutrition/publications/UNICEF-WHO-lowbirth
weight-estimates-2019

Methodology: Nationally representative estimates of
low birthweight prevalence can be derived from
a range of sources, broadly defined as national
administrative data or representative household
surveys. National administrative data are those
coming from national systems including Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems,
national Health Management Information Systems
(HMIS) and birth registries. National household
surveys which contain information about
birthweight as well as key related indicators

Regional and global averages may be affected
depending on which countries had data available
for the periods considered in this report.
Using the previous day’s feeding as a basis may
cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed
infants to be overestimated, as some infants
who may have been given other liquids or foods
irregularly may not have received these on the
day before the survey.

 Hierarchical regression: Data for countries not
meeting requirements for b-spline but with
≥1 low birthweight data point from any source
meeting inclusion criteria are fitted into a
model using covariates to generate annual low
birthweight estimates, as well as uncertainty
ranges, using a bootstrap approach. The model
includes natural log of neonatal mortality
rate; the proportion of children underweight
(weight-for-age z score below -2 SD from
median weight for age of reference population);
data type (higher quality administrative, lower
quality administrative, household survey); UN
region (e.g. Southern Asia, Caribbean); and
a country-specific random effect. These low
birthweight estimates may vary substantially
from estimates reported by countries in
administrative and survey reports, especially
given that the household survey estimates
are adjusted for missing birthweights and
heaping, while survey reports often present a
low birthweight estimate just for the children
with a birthweight and with no adjustment for
data heaping.
 No estimate: Countries for which low
birthweight input data were not available
and/or did not meet inclusion criteria are
indicated in the database as “no estimate”.
A total of 54 countries in the current country
database were reported as having “no
estimate”. Despite not presenting an estimate
for these individual 54 countries, annual low
birthweight estimates were derived for them
using the hierarchical regression methods
detailed above but were used only to input into
regional and global estimates.

including maternal perception of size at birth
(MICS, DHS) are also an important source of low
birthweight data especially in contexts where
many births are unweighted and/or data heaping
is a problem. Prior to entry into the country
dataset, country data are reviewed for coverage
and quality and adjusted where the source is
a household survey. Administrative data are
categorized as: i) high coverage, if representing
≥90 percent of live births; ii) medium coverage,
if representing between 80 and 90 percent of live
births; or iii) not included, if covering <80 percent
of live births. To be included in the dataset,
survey data need to have:
i.

a birthweight in the dataset for at minimum
30 percent of the sample;
ii. a minimum of 200 birthweights in
the dataset;
iii. no indication of severe data heaping
– this means that: a) ≤55 percent of all
birthweights can fall on the three most
frequent birthweights (i.e. if 3 000 g, 3 500 g
and 2 500 g were the three most frequent
birthweights, when added together,
they have to make up ≤55 percent of all
birthweights in the dataset); b) ≤10 percent
of all birthweights are ≥4 500 g; and c)
≤5 percent of birthweights fall on tail ends of
500 g and 5 000 g; and
iv. undergone an adjustment for missing
birthweights and heaping.12
Modelling methods were applied to the accepted
(and for household survey data, accepted and
adjusted) country data to generate annual country
estimates from 2000 to 2015, with methods
varying by availability and type of input data
as follows:

Modelled annual country estimates are used
to generate regional and global estimates from
2000–2015. Global estimates are derived by
summing the estimated number of live births
weighing less than 2 500 g for 195 av countries
with an estimate in the United Nations regional
grouping for each year, and then dividing by all
live births in each year in those 195 countries.
Regional estimates are similarly derived,

 b-spline: Data for countries with ≥8 data
points from higher coverage administrative
sources ≥1 point prior to 2005 and ≥1 point
more recent than 2010 are smoothed with
b-spline regression to generate annual low
birthweight estimates. A b-spline regression
model was used to predict the standard error
and calculate 95 percent confidence intervals
for the country-level low birthweight estimates.
These low birthweight estimates follow very
closely those included in the countries’ own
administrative reports.

av While the world comprises 202 countries (as per the full set of
countries in the regional grouping with the largest set of countries – i.e.
the UNICEF regional grouping), seven countries did not have low
birthweight input data or covariate data. It was therefore not possible to
generate any estimates for these seven countries, and they are not
included in the regional and global estimates.

based on countries in each regional grouping.
To obtain the global and regional level estimates
of uncertainty, 1 000 low birthweight point
estimates were made for each country for each
year using either b-spline (by randomly sampling
from a normal distribution plotted using the
calculated standard error) or hierarchical
regression approach (using a bootstrap approach).
The country low birthweight estimates for each
of the 1 000 samples were summed at worldwide
or regional level and the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles
of the resulting distributions were used as the
confidence intervals.

ADULT OBESITY
Definition: BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m 2. The body mass index
(BMI) is the ratio of weight-to-height commonly
used to classify the nutritional status of adults.
It is calculated as the body weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the body height in
metres (kg/m 2). Obesity includes individuals with
BMI equal to or higher than 30 kg/m 2.

Challenges and limitations: A major limitation
of monitoring low birthweight globally is
the lack of birthweight data for many of the
world’s children. There is a notable bias among
the unweighted, with those born to poorer,
less-educated, rural mothers being less likely to
have a recorded birthweight when compared to
their richer, urban counterparts with more highly
educated mothers.13 As the characteristics of
the unweighted are risk factors for having a low
birthweight, estimates that do not well represent
these children may be lower than the true value.
Furthermore, poor quality of available data
with regard to excessive heaping on multiples of
500 g or 100 g exists in the majority of available
data from lower-middle-income countries
(LMICs)13 and can further bias low birthweight
estimates. The methods applied to adjust for
missing birthweights and heaping for survey
estimates in the current database 404 are meant
to address the problem; however, there were a
total of 54 countries for which it was not possible
to generate a reliable birthweight estimate.
In addition, the confidence limits of the regional
and global estimates may be artificially small
given that about half of the modelled countries
had a country-specific effect generated at random
for each bootstrap prediction, some of which
were positive and others negative, making the
relative uncertainty at the regional and global
level tend to be less than that at the individual
country level.

Methodology: A Bayesian hierarchical model was
applied to selected population-based studies
that had measured height and weight in adults
aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from
1975 to 2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalence
of BMI categories (underweight, overweight
and obesity). The model incorporated nonlinear
time trends and age patterns, national versus
subnational and community representativeness,
and whether data covered both rural and urban
areas versus only one of them. The model
also included covariates that help predict
BMI, including national income, proportion of
population living in urban areas, mean number
of years of education, and summary measures
of availability of different food types for
human consumption.

Challenges and limitations: Despite a high proportion
of countries having nationally representative
survey data available for anaemia, there is still a
lack of reporting on this indicator, especially in
high‑income countries. As a result, the estimates
may not capture the full variation across countries
and regions, thus tending to “shrink” towards
global means when data are sparse.

A. Methodology for 2020 and 2021
PoU nowcasts

assumption. Because of that, the changes between
the 2017–2019 average and the 2020 annual values
of FI sev were used to nowcast the 2020 values of
CV|y, and the changes between the 2020 and 2021
annual values of FI sev were used to nowcast the
2021 values of CV|y.

As in previous editions of this report, due to
lack of detailed information on the most recent
values of each of the elements that contribute
to computing the PoU and NoU (see Annex 1B),
estimates referring to the most recent year are
nowcasted; in other words, they are predictions of
the very recent past.

Adjustments in the proportion of change in FIsev
that is attributed to CV|y
Another parameter that needed attention last
year to nowcast the 2020 value of PoU was the
percentage of change in FI sev (used as a proxy for
the expected change in the PoU) that is attributed
to CV|y. Normally, this has been assumed to
be equal to one-third, based on an econometric
analysis of past values of PoU, DEC and CV|y.
The exceptional nature of 2020 (and now of 2021)
calls into question that regularity. As no national
household consumption and expenditure survey
collected data in 2020 or in 2021, we still lack any
empirical basis to determine how to properly
modify it. The solution last year was to conduct
a sensitivity analysis modifying the percentage
of change in FI sev that is attributed to CV|y
from a minimum of one-third to a maximum
of one. The same approach was followed this
year. The result is a range of possible values of
CV|y, and hence of PoU, in 2020 and in 2021.
For completeness, Table A2.1 presents the lower and
upper bounds of the PoU in 2020 and 2021 at the
global, regional and subregional levels.

As already noted last year, 2020 was unique in
many respects due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
which imposed unprecedented restrictions on
people’s ability to work and move. This demanded
special considerations when nowcasting the
values of the PoU, especially with respect to
estimating the likely change in the CV and to
modelling the way in which inequality in access
to food contributes to rates of undernourishment.
Both aspects required special treatment.
It is now clear that the COVID-19 pandemic
has had effects on people’s ability to access
food lasting into 2021, a reason why the special
treatment to nowcast the CV is applied to
nowcasting values for both 2020 and 2021.

Estimating changes in FIsev from 2019 to 2021
While it was possible to nowcast the values
of DEC in 2020 and 2021 using the traditional
approach based on information provided by
the Markets and Trade Division of FAO, used
to inform FAO Agricultural Outlooks, it was
necessary to modify the traditional approach
used to nowcast the CV. Normally, changes in
CV|y (the component of the CV associated with
differences in households’ economic conditions)
are derived from differences in three-year
averages of the prevalence of severe food
insecurity based on the FIES (FI sev) that are not
explained by changes in food supplies. Use of
the three-year average addressed the need to
control for possible excess sampling variability
in country-level estimates of the FI sev (which,
for most countries, is based on relatively small
samples of FIES data) and is consistent with
an assumption that CV|y follows a relatively
stable trend. The exceptional nature of 2020
and 2021 makes it difficult to maintain this last

B. Methodology for projections of PoU
to 2030
To project PoU values to 2030, we project the
three fundamental variables that enter in the
PoU formula (DEC, CV and MDER) separately,
based on different inputs, depending on the
scenario considered.
The main source of information is the output of
the MIRAGRODEP recursive, dynamic computable
general equilibrium (CGE) model, which provides
series of projected values, at country level, for:
 real per capita GDP (GDP_Vol_pc);
 income Gini coefficient (gini_income);
 an index of real food price (Prices_Real_Food);

where Curr_AARR aw is the AARR based on recent
years ax and Req_AARR is the required AARR ay to
reach the country target if the 2030 global target
is adopted. Note, progress towards the exclusive
breastfeeding target (EBF) was done based on the
reduction of non-exclusive breastfeeding rate, that
is, 100 minus EBF rate.

C. Methodology for inequality analysis
on nutrition outcomes
An inequality analysis in Section 2.2 was carried
out according to urban and rural residence,
household wealth, education level and gender
as applied to six nutrition indicators using
Equiplots. This type of chart depicts mean
prevalences for subpopulations within each
category of the respective inequity dimension
(e.g. rural and urban within type of residence,
wealth quintiles). Equiplots allow visual
interpretation of prevalence levels and distance
between groups, which represents absolute
inequality. The analysis was performed across
regions based on data availability for countries
within each region. Unweighted analysis was
applied using the latest available data from
national surveys between 2015 and 2021. The list
of countries contributing to each region is
presented in Table A2.3; data sources are included
in table notes.

Country progress ratios represent the amount of
progress made up to the latest year for which data
are available (in terms of reduction), compared to
the total required to reach the target. For example,
a country that has reduced the number of children
who are stunted by 30 percent by 2020 (the latest
year for which data are available), when compared
to the target of 50 percent reduction by 2030, will
have a ratio of 30/50, or 60 percent. This means
that country has achieved 60 percent of the
progress needed to reach the target between
baseline year 2012 and 2020, having still to attain
40 percent of the needed progress in the last
10 years before 2030.
For summarizing progress in each region,
countries’ progress ratios were categorized into
five categories:

dietary guidelines (FBDG) for a representative
person within energy balance at 2 330 kcal/day.
The FBDGs analysed explicitly recommend
food quantities for each food group and provide
a wide regional representation. Although it
is not selected based on nutrient content but
is determined by FBDGs, this diet meets on
average nearly 95 percent of nutrient needs, so
it can therefore almost always be considered as
nutrient adequate.

or more recent. Important also to note when
interpreting progress achieved is that progress
ratios are based on exponential functions, in
contrast to changing linearly across time, as
indicated in the above equation.

E. Methodology for the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet
FAO continues to systematically monitor and
report annually on these new indicators in this
report. Estimates are updated for year 2020 (see
sections below, Updating the cost of a healthy diet
and Updating the affordability of a healthy diet).
In addition, periodic revisions to the entire data
series will be carried out to refine and improve
the accuracy of the estimations as new data
become available and methodologies advance.
The revision to the cost and affordability of a
healthy diet this year accounts for new income
distributions, a revised average share of income
that can be credibly reserved for food, and a
methodological refinement to estimate the cost
of the diet that is more robust, provides greater
transparency, and supports long-term monitoring
utilizing annually reported price data. Box 6 in
Section 2.3 provides a brief summary of these
revisions and implications (see Herforth et al.
[forthcoming]54 for a full description of data
sources and methodology).

The availability and prices of items in each
food group needed for a healthy diet were
obtained from the ICP as national averages
for 2017. Item definitions are internationally
standardized, allowing classification by food
group and calculation of the least-costs to reach
FBDG requirements in each country, representing
an average across markets and throughout
the year. 412 For a detailed description of the
healthy diet and related methodology, see the
background methods paper to this report. 54

Affordability of a healthy diet
In this report, to determine affordability,
the cost of a healthy diet is compared with
country-specific income distributions that
are derived from the World Bank’s PIP.51 The
resulting measures of affordability include the
percentage and number of people who cannot
afford a healthy diet in a given country, in 2020.
A healthy diet is considered unaffordable when
its cost exceeds 52 percent of the income in a
country. This percentage accounts for a portion
of income that can be credibly reserved for food,
based on observations that the population in LICs
spend, on average, 52 percent of their income
on food, as derived from the 2017 ICP national
accounts household expenditure data.

The cost of a healthy diet
A healthy diet provides not only adequate
calories but also adequate levels of all essential
nutrients and food groups needed for an active
and healthy life (see Section 2.1). The cost of
a healthy diet is defined as the cost of the
least expensive locally available foods to meet
requirements for energy and food-based
| 181 |

ANNEX 2

Based on this threshold and comparing the cost
of the diet with country income distributions, we
obtain the percentage of people for whom the cost
of the diet is unaffordable. These proportions are
then multiplied by the 2020 population in each
country using the World Development Indicators
(WDI) of the World Bank, to obtain the number
of people who cannot afford a healthy diet in a
given country. For a detailed description of the
affordability indicators and related methodology,
see Annex 3 of FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and
WHO (2020). 3

The cost of a healthy diet is first updated in LCU
and then converted into international dollars
using the WDI PPP for private consumption
conversion factors, to compare the cost across
countries and political entities. For a detailed
description of the methodology, see Bai et al.
(forthcoming). 414

The cost of a healthy diet was computed for 169
countries in 2017 and updated for 2018–2020
for all countries except Anguilla, Montserrat,
and Taiwan Province of China that have neither
information on CPIs nor on PPPs. Out of the
remaining 166 countries, there are 22 countries

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

Updating the affordability of a healthy diet

coefficient estimates of per capita GDP and/or
per capita expenditures. The ARIMAX computes
the predicted values on the best specification
selected for each country.

In this report, affordability was updated for years
2018–2020. Through continuous updates based on
incoming national surveys and data imputations,
the income distributions in the PIP database 51
are now available and updated for the 2017,
2018 and 2019 reference years in all countries.
Income distributions in year 2020 are not
available at the time of writing. Thus, the percent
of people who cannot afford a healthy diet in
2020 was computed using the 2020 CPI-inflated
cost of the diet described above, as well as
the corresponding 2019 income distributions
available in PIP. 51 These proportions were
multiplied by each country’s population in 2020
using the WDI of the World Bank, to obtain the
number of people who cannot afford a healthy
diet in this year.

For one country with missing information on
CPIs (Turks and Caicos Islands), cost imputations
were applied using the average diet cost in the
country’s subregion (s):
Imputed 2018 Diet Cost = (2017 Diet Cost/ Avg
2017 Diet Costs) × Avg 2018 Diet Costs
Imputed 2019 Diet Cost = (Imputed 2018 Diet Cost/
Avg 2018 Diet Costs) × Avg 2019 Diet Costs
Imputed 2020 Diet Cost = (Imputed 2019 Diet Cost/
Avg 2019 Diet Costs) × Avg 2020 Diet Costs

Income distributions in PIP51 are not available
for all the countries. Thus, of the 169 countries
with cost information in 2017, the affordability
indicators were computed for 143 countries.
This information was updated for all countries
for years 2018–2020, except for Taiwan Province
of China. For this country, the unavailability of
food CPI did not allow to compute the cost and,
therefore, affordability.

Subregional cost averages in 2017, 2018 and
2019 were computed excluding Turks and
Caicos Islands.
A limitation of this method used to update the
cost of a healthy diet in 2018–2020 is that changes
in the cost depend on (food) CPIs and do not
reflect item-specific changes in food prices, nor
any differential changes in the price of different
food groups, due to the lack of new item-level
food price data for more nutritious food items.
FAO is exploring how to expand reporting of
item-level prices to allow more frequent and
robust monitoring of the cost of a healthy diet.

The latest estimates of the affordability
indicators were performed on 24 May 2022.
As the PIP database is currently undergoing
continuous updates of income distributions,
affordability estimations after this date may
marginally change. n

UPDATED DATA
SERIES OF THE COST
AND AFFORDABILITY
OF A HEALTHY DIET,
2017–2020

The cost and affordability of a healthy diet, and
the change of these indicators from 2019 to 2020,
are reported in Table 5 by region, subregion and
country income groups, following the World
Bank classification of countries by income level
for 2021, 33 based on per capita gross national
income (GNI) in 2020. Income classification is
provided for all countries except Anguilla and
Montserrat. In FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and
WHO (2021),15 results were presented using
the 2019 income classification. Therefore, the
composition of countries by income groups may
have changed between 2019 and 2020.

may not thoroughly reflect the severe currency
devaluation and economic instability that the
countries have experienced.
Ranges of the affordability indicators, showing
the percentage and number of people unable
to afford a healthy diet in 2020, are presented
in Table A3.2 by region and development status.
Lower-bound estimates assume that 80 percent
of income available is spent on food, where
80 percent represents the largest expenditure
share on food observed in the ICP 2017 data
(for Guinea-Bissau). Upper-bound estimates
assume that the share of income reserved
for food varies by country income group.
Following ICP 2017 national accounts data, food
expenditures represent, on average, 14 percent,
27 percent, 38 percent and 52 percent of total
expenditures in HICs, UMICs, LMICs and LICs,
respectively. For example, if the cost of a healthy
diet is USD 3.00 in a LIC with an average food
expenditure share of 52 percent, income would
need to be USD 5.77 for a person to afford a
healthy diet as well as non-food needs. For a full
description of the methodology for determining
the ranges, see Herforth et al. (2020). 86 n

Cost and affordability are also reported at the
country level in Table A3.1 for the reference year
2017 when the ICP data were released, as well as
for 2018, 2019 and 2020 when the two indicators
are updated using the methodology described
in Annex 2E. In 2018–2020, the cost indicator
was updated for 166 of the 169 countries
with information available in 2017, while
affordability was updated for 142 of the 143
countries. For two countries, Argentina and
Zimbabwe, cost and affordability in 2018–2020
are used to estimate aggregate indicators
shown in Table 5 but are not reported in Table A3.1.
To update the costs in 2018–2020, PPP exchange
rates for both countries are imputed, but they

NOTES: The cost of a healthy diet is the benchmark 2017 USD cost per person per day, published in the 2020 edition of this report and revised as
outlined in Box 6. The benchmark cost is updated in years 2018–2020 using FAOSTAT for country-level (food) CPI and WDI for PPP. For each
region, subregion and country income group, the unaffordability estimated as the percent of the population unable to afford a healthy diet is
population-weighted. The 2021 World Bank classification of countries by income group is used for all years from 2017 to 2020 and for all countries
except Anguilla and Montserrat, for which income classification is not provided. See Annex 2E for a description of the methodology.
n.a. = data not available. n.r. = data not reported because of insufficient or unreliable data to update cost and affordability. * Cost and affordability
of a healthy diet include Zimbabwe. ** Cost and affordability of a healthy diet include Argentina. a PPP was imputed in this year.

COUNTRY INCOME GROUP

NOTES: Lower-bound estimates are calculated assuming that 80 percent of income is spent on food. Upper-bound estimates account for the fact
that a portion of income can be spent on non-food items and are computed using average food expenditure shares that vary according to the
World Bank’s classification by income group. They represent, on average, 14 percent, 27 percent, 38 percent and 52 percent of total expenditures
in HICs, UMICs, LMICs and LICs, respectively.

POLICY SUPPORT
INDICATORS:
SOURCES, COVERAGE
AND METHODOLOGY

DATA SOURCES AND COVERAGE

countries for which agriculture and agricultural
support are very relevant are not included in
the dataset (e.g. Bangladesh, Egypt, Malaysia,
Morocco and Thailand): this, together with
the data gaps in the most recent years, must
be taken into consideration in the analysis of
the indicators.

The indicators of policy support to food and
agriculture presented in Section 3.1 are compiled
from the data assembled by the Consortium
for Measuring the Policy Environment for
Agriculture, or “Ag-Incentives Consortium”,
whose partner institutions are FAO, IDB, IFPRI,
OECD and the World Bank.

Within the Ag-Incentives Consortium, OECD
produces policy support indicators for OECD
countries, non-OECD EU Member States, and
some emerging economies, namely, Argentina,
Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, India,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Russian
Federation, South Africa, Ukraine and Viet Nam.
IDB covers most of the remaining countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean, FAO monitors
selected sub-Saharan Africa countries, while the
World Bank produced indicators for Sri Lanka
and Pakistan, in the past. IFPRI harmonizes
and aggregates data provided by the various
partner organizations.

The NRP and NRA indicators presented in
Section 3.1 are included in the Ag-Incentives
database (available at http://ag-incentives.org) 415
as the core indicators on public support provided
to agricultural producers. These indicators
cover the period of 2005–2018 for a total of about
63 countries (considering all European Union
members as a single country) that together
account for close to 90 percent of the global value
of agricultural production in the years with the
greatest coverage, such as in 2012. Table A4.1 reports
countries covered in the dataset and their income
group. Given that some countries changed
income level and group over the period analysed
in the report and for which Ag-Incentives
data are available, the specific income group
as specified in Table A4.1 was determined based
on the predominant income status over the
2005–2018 period. The country coverage of the
dataset varies every year and particularly at the
beginning and end of the period due to data
availability for some countries. ba Moreover, some

Indicators of support for general services
and for consumers presented in Section 3.1
are calculated by IFPRI and analysed by FAO
based on data made available by the member
organizations of the Ag-Incentives Consortium.
These indicators are not yet published in the
Ag-Incentives website.

Methodology
ba This is mainly the case of Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Nigeria,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka for which policy support indicators are not
available for the most recent years (from 2013 onwards in most of the
cases) and Peru that has data only for the period 2010–2013.

The policy support indicators analysed in
Section 3.1 refer to a set of policy instruments
that form together the total support to food and

Computation of general services support

Second, along the policy dimension, the NRA
can be disaggregated by type of policy support,
and therefore by support provided by trade and
market measures (captured by the NRP), by fiscal
subsidies linked to output (A2 category), to inputs
(B category), and to other factors of production
(C, D, E, F and G). bc

The GSS indicator measures monetary transfers
(i.e. public expenditure) provided through
policies and programmes that target agricultural
producers collectively, rather than individually.
These policies create enabling conditions for
the primary agricultural sector through the
development of private and public services,
institutions and infrastructure regardless of their
objectives and impact on farm production and
income, or consumption of food and agricultural
products. As such, GSS does not directly alter
producer receipts or costs, or consumption
expenditures. 55

For computation of the NRA, the various datasets
provided by Ag-Incentives Consortium partner
institutions have been reconciled to the OECD
methodological framework in order to ensure
no omission of data and no double counting.
To obtain the same “scope” for fiscal subsidies
and price incentives, an NRA indicator was
constructed also for “non-NRP commodities”, i.e.
those not targeted by trade and market measures
that generate price incentives and for which an
NRP was not available in the dataset. For the NRP
computed at the country level, this is equivalent to
considering that non-NRP commodities have the
same NRP as NRP commodities; across countries,
the average for NRP commodities is used to
compute support on non-NRP commodities.bd

As reported in Table A4.2, GSS is broadly
categorized into six subcategories (GS1 to
GS6), which add up in the final aggregate
GSS estimate compiled for all years available
based on the data provided by the various
Ag-Incentives Consortium partners.
GSS indicators are provided in monetary value
(USD) and as a share of value of production by
country and by income group.

Computation of subsidies to consumer

The NRA by food group presented in Section 3.1
in Figure 21 was computed accounting also for
non‑product-specific subsidies, which are those
that target a broader food group (e.g. crops or
livestock products) or the agricultural sector as
a whole. These are allocated at the food group
level based on the share in value of production
in the relevant aggregate (e.g. share of wheat in
staple foods’ value of production for subsidies
going to all cereals, or share of wheat in total
value of production for subsidies going to all
agricultural commodities).

The indicator of subsidies to consumers
(CS) measures annual budgetary transfers
from taxpayers to consumers of agricultural
commodities. These transfers (or public
expenditure) are provided to: i) intermediary
consumers of food (processors, millers, etc.) as
a means of compensating them for the higher
prices they pay for agricultural products that
result from policies that support producer prices
(category CS1 in Table A4.2), or ii) final consumers
to improve access to food via increased income
(e.g. cash transfers) or in-kind food transfers
(category CS2 in Table A4.2).
Subsidies to consumers were compiled and
harmonized from the data provided by the
various Ag‑Incentives Consortium partners.
CS indicator is provided in monetary terms (USD)
and as share of value of production by country
and by income group. n

bc The NRA is conceptually very similar to the OECD Producer
Support Estimate (PSE), with two differences: i) valuation of the price
support component of NRA through the use of the NRP differs from
the “market price support” concept used by OECD as it does not
include other levies and it is not corrected for Excessive Feed Cost;
and ii) the denominator used in most OECD indicators expressed in
percentage is the gross farm income, i.e. value production at farm
gate price, so including distortions. At the opposite, in Ag-Incentives,
the “undistorted” reference price is used to value production.
bd This assumption of filling data gaps by using the average NRP for
NRP-commodities to compute support on non-NRP commodities across
countries diverges from the data currently published in the Ag-Incentives
database, where no data gap filling assumption is applied.

TARIFF DATA AND FOOD
GROUP DEFINITIONS
be

For this analysis, data on “effectively applied
tariffs” were taken from UNCTAD-TRAINS
as hosted in the World Bank’s WITS database
(2021). 416 The data include Ad Valorem Equivalents
for “specific tariffs” which are levied as fixed
monetary amounts per imported quantity unit.
The “effectively applied tariff” is the lowest duty
that a country might apply to a specific imported
product from a specific origin country after
considering all preferential trade arrangements
or trade agreements with that origin country, in
addition to the country’s Most Favored Nation
(MFN) tariffs (or simply “tariffs” in case the
importing country is not a WTO member).
To reflect that some product/country-of-origin
combinations matter more in a country’s import
basket than others, the “effectively applied tariffs”
for product/country-of-origin combinations are
weighted by their corresponding import value.
The resulting import-value weighted tariff
corresponds to the average tariff a country levies
on the import value of an item within a food
group. Finally, country-level tariff means per food
group are averaged across countries included
in the four income groups as defined by the
World Bank. bf

identified as “ultra-processed” and include,
for example, “(…) pre-prepared ready-to-heat
products including pies and pasta and pizza dishes;
poultry and fish ‘nuggets’ and ‘sticks’, sausages,
burgers, hot dogs, and other reconstituted meat
products; and powdered and packaged ‘instant’
soups, noodles, and desserts”. 417
 Sugar and confectionary have received
considerable policy attention due to potential
ramifications for public health, and WHO
suggests limiting intakes of free sugars. 30
To curb their consumption, many governments
have introduced nutrition-based taxes
sometimes explicitly targeting imported
foods.98 These products are identified through
the HS headings 1701 and 1702, capturing
sugar for various uses, as well as 1703
(“Molasses”). Additionally, products under
heading 1704 are included, covering sugar
confectionary and candy.
 Fruits and vegetables, by contrast, are a major
source of dietary fibre, essential vitamins and
minerals. Evidence suggests that consumption
can reduce risk of some types of cancer and
cardiovascular disease and prevent weight gain
and FAO/WHO recommend consumption of
at least 400 g of fruits and vegetables per day
(excluding starch roots and tubers).93,420,421,422
Fruits and Vegetables are identified in the
tariff data as HS2 chapters seven and eight,
which are “Edible vegetables and certain roots and
tubers” and “Edible fruits and nuts; peel of citrus
or melons”, respectively. From these chapters the
HS4 headings covering nuts (0801 and 0802) as
well as dried leguminous vegetables (0713) and
starchy roots and tubers such as potatoes (0714)
are dropped, since they are not considered
“Vegetables” as per the definition used for the
report at hand (see Box 10, footnote 2).
 Food and beverages are identified through all
HS6 codes subsumed under Category 1 of the
United Nations Broad Economic Categories
(Rev. 4): “Food and Beverages”. To this, the
commodities included under HS headings
1004 (“Oats”) and HS heading 1005 (“Maize”)
are added. n

 Highly processed foods are foods that have
undergone multiple stages of processing and
that are rich in sugars, salt, oil, or fats or in
substances like high fructose corn syrup. 417
Excessive consumption of these foods has been
found to have detrimental impacts on human
health. 418,419 To identify these Foods in the
tariff data, the analysis employs a mapping
provided in Boysen et al. (2019), 97 where
products included under group four of the
NOVA classification developed by Monteiro
et al. (2019) 417 are matched to individual
food items in the Harmonized System at the
6-digit level of the HS. Group 4 in the NOVA
classification encompasses products that are

RESULTS FROM
SELECTED GLOBAL
MODEL-BASED
SCENARIOS

Methodology and country groups

Results from removing support

The analysis of Section 4.1 uses the
MIRAGRODEP CGE model – a global simulation
model capturing multiple regions, sectors
and international economic linkages. A full
description of the MIRAGRODEP model, how
it was expanded for this report and the data
used are found in the background paper to this
report. 230 The classification of countries by income
group is reported in Table A6.1 following the World
Bank classification of countries by income level
for 2021. 33 It should be noted that the list of
countries in Table A6.1 differs from the list provided
in Table A4.1. In Section 4.1, the 2021 income
classification is used as the analysis of policy
scenarios focuses on recent years, from 2017 up to
2030. On the contrary, Section 3.1 takes a historical
perspective on stocktaking of policy support, so
it uses the most frequent income group category
over the 2005–2018 period for each country.

Results from two scenarios whereby support
to agriculture is partially removed from the
baseline scenario help reinforce the case for not
eliminating such support. The discussion of the
results of these two scenarios is presented in
Section 4.1 of the report.

Results from fairly reallocating fiscal
subsidies to producers
An alternative scenario measures what would
happen if, instead of repurposing public support
to agricultural producers to specifically support
healthy diets, governments more fairly distribute
fiscal subsidies to producers. More specifically,
fiscal subsidies at the aggregate level would not
be affected, but all commodities would receive
the similar same level of support on a percent
of value of production (VoP) basis. The biases of
the model-based baseline scenario are removed.
No changes to border measures or support
through general government services are applied.
The results are presented below and are discussed
in Section 4.1 of the report. n

The “Americas” region in Tables 8–13 of Section 4.1
includes HICs in Latin America and the
Caribbean (Chile, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago,
and Uruguay), plus Canada and the United States
of America. Latin America and the Caribbean
includes all countries in this region except HICs
which are included in the group Americas.

ANNEX 7

GLOSSARY
Acute food insecurity

Climate change

Food insecurity found in a specified area at
a specific point in time and of a severity that
threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless
of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance
in providing strategic guidance to actions
that focus on short-term objectives to prevent,
mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity. 449

Climate change refers to a change in the state of
the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using
statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the
variability of its properties, and that persists for an
extended period, typically decades or longer.423

Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event)
The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed
values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme
weather events and extreme climate events are
referred to collectively as “climate extremes”. 424

Affordability
Affordability refers to the ability of people to
buy foods in their local environment. In this
report, cost refers to what people have to pay
to secure a healthy diet, while affordability
refers to the cost relative to a person’s income,
minus other required expenses. Affordability is
determined by comparing the cost of a healthy
diet with income distributions available in the
PIP of the World Bank. This allows to compute
the percentage and number of people in each
country who are not able to afford a healthy
diet (see Annex 2E for the full description of the
methodology).

Climate resilience
An approach to building and/or strengthening
resilience (see resilience definition below) that
addresses current or expected climate variability
and changing average climate conditions.

Climate shocks
Climate shocks include not only those
disturbances in the usual pattern of rainfall
and temperatures but also complex events like
droughts and floods. Equivalent to the concept
of a natural hazard or stress, they are exogenous
events that can have a negative impact on
food and nutrition security, depending on the
vulnerability of an individual, a household, a
community, or systems to the shock. 425,426,427,428

Agrifood systems
Agrifood systems, a term increasingly used in
the context of transforming food systems for
sustainability and inclusivity, are broader as they
encompass both agricultural and food systems
and focus on both food and non-food agricultural
products, with clear overlaps. Agrifood systems
encompass the entire range of actors and their
interlinked value-adding activities involved in the
production, aggregation, processing, distribution,
consumption and disposal of food products.
They comprise all food products that originate from
crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries
and aquaculture, as well as the broader economic,
societal and natural environments in which these
diverse production systems are embedded.

Climate variability

Animal source foods

Refers to variations in the mean state and
other statistics (SD, the occurrence of extremes,
etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal
scales beyond that of individual weather
events. Variability may be due to natural
internal processes within the climate system
(internal variability), or to variations in natural
or anthropogenic external forcing (external
variability). 423

All types of meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk,
cheese and yoghurt, and other dairy products.

Commercial marketing
As defined by the 2010 WHA, marketing refers
to “any form of commercial communication
or message that is designed to increase, or has
the effect of increasing, the recognition, appeal
and/or consumption of particular products
and services. It comprises anything that acts
to advertise or otherwise promote a product
or service“. 262 Commercial marketing is part of

Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as
the average weather, or more rigorously, as the
statistical description in terms of the mean and
variability of relevant quantities over a period
of time ranging from months to thousands or
millions of years. 423

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

Economic downturn

what in this report is called promotion which,
in addition to branded advertising, includes
a wider set of tools to reach consumers (e.g.
from promotion campaigns, participation in
international fairs, to activities promoting food
quality).

Refers to a period of decline in economic activity
or negative growth as measured by the growth
rate in real GDP. It is a synonym for economic
recession, a temporary or short-term downturn
in economic growth, usually occurring over at
least two consecutive quarters of decline. In the
analyses and figures presented in this report,
an economic downturn is identified using the
year as a period of reference.

Conflict
Conflict as used in this report is defined as
struggles between interdependent groups that
have either actual or perceived incompatibilities
with respect to needs, values, goals, resources or
intentions. This definition includes (but is broader
than) armed conflict – that is, organized collective
violent confrontations between at least two
groups, either state or non-state actors.

Economic shock

Budgetary transfers (fiscal subsidies) to
producers that are tied to the production of a
specific commodity, the use of variable inputs or
of specific factors of production (e.g. area planted
or animal numbers).

An unexpected or unpredictable event that
is external to the specific economy and can
either harm or boost it. A global financial crisis
causing bank lending or credit to fall, or an
economic downturn in a major trading partner
of a country reflect demand-side shocks that
can have multiple effects on spending and
investment. A steep rise in oil and gas prices,
natural disasters that result in sharp falls in
production, or conflict that disrupts trade and
production, are examples of supply-side shocks.

Diet quality

Economic slowdown

Comprised of four key aspects: variety
and/or diversity (within and across food groups),
adequacy (sufficiency of nutrients or food groups
compared to requirements), moderation (foods
and nutrients that should be consumed with
restraint) and overall balance (composition of
macronutrient intake). Exposure to food safety
hazards is another important quality aspect.

Refers to economic activity that is growing
at a slower pace compared with the previous
period. An economic slowdown occurs when
real GDP growth declines from one period of
time to another, but it is still positive. In the
analyses and figures presented in this report, an
economic slowdown is identified using the year
as the period of reference, although it is usually
measured in quarters of a year.

Coupled subsidies

Dietary energy requirements

Energy-dense foods

The amount of dietary energy, measured in
kilojoules or kilocalories (often referred to as
calories), required by an individual to maintain
body functions, health and normal activity.
Dietary energy requirements are dependent
upon age, sex, body size and level of physical
activity. Additional energy is required to support
optimal growth and development in children
and in women during pregnancy, and for
milk production during lactation, consistent
with the good health of mother and child.

Food with a high content of calories (energy)
with respect to its mass or volume.

Export prohibitions and restrictions
Export prohibitions and restrictions are
export measures that have a limiting effect
on the quantity or amount of a product being
exported. They can take the form of a tax or a
quantitative restriction. The latter is generally
prohibited with some exceptions, notably those
applied to prevent or relieve critical shortage of
foodstuffs. 429

Drought
A period of abnormally dry weather lasting
long enough to cause a serious hydrological
imbalance. 423

Exposure
The presence of people; livelihoods; species or
ecosystems; environmental functions, services
| 201 |

ANNEX 7

for food and agriculture – it includes all the
stages of a product value chain, from farm inputs
supply to retail markets. For example, these
services may include commodity grading schemes
or agricultural machinery services. They may
be services related to post-harvest losses, lower
transaction costs, facilitating market exchange
and trade, and strengthening or expanding
supply networks.

and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social
or cultural assets in places and settings that could
be adversely affected. 423

Extreme poverty
Refers to the percentage of people living on less
than USD 1.90 a day (2011 PPP prices) in a country
in a given year.

Extreme weather or climate event

Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)

The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed
values of the variable. Many weather and
climate extremes are the result of natural climate
variability, and natural decadal or multi-decadal
variations in the climate provide the backdrop
for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there
were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide
variety of natural weather and climate extremes
would still occur.

An experience-based food security scale used to
produce a measure of access to food at different
levels of severity that can be compared across
contexts. It relies on data obtained by asking
people, directly in surveys, about the occurrence
of conditions and behaviours that are known to
reflect constrained access to food.

Food security
A situation that exists when all people, at all
times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that
meets their dietary needs and food preferences
for an active and healthy life. Based on this
definition, four food security dimensions can
be identified: food availability, economic and
physical access to food, food utilization and
stability over time. The concept of food security
is evolving to recognize the centrality of agency
and sustainability. See below for the definition of
these two additional elements.

Fiscal subsidies
Fiscal subsidies are budget transfers made by
governments in the context of policy measures,
projects and programmes to individual actors
of the food and agriculture sector, such as
farmers (fiscal subsidies to producers) or
consumers (fiscal subsidies to consumers).
Fiscal subsidies to producers aim to reduce
production costs or increase farm income and
can be granted depending on output, input
use or use of other factors of production.
Fiscal subsidies to consumers include transfers
under social protection programmes (given to
final consumers) and food subsidies to lower
the cost of food (provided to intermediaries, e.g.
processors, traders, transporters, etc.).

Food security dimensions
In this report, food security dimensions refer to
the four traditional dimensions of food security:
a. Availability – This dimension addresses
whether or not food is actually or potentially
physically present, including aspects of
production, food reserves, markets and
transportation, and wild foods.
b. Access – If food is actually or potentially
physically present, the next question is whether
or not households and individuals have
sufficient physical and economic access to
that food.
c. Utilization – If food is available and households
have adequate access to it, the next question
is whether or not households are maximizing
the consumption of adequate nutrition and
energy. Sufficient energy and nutrient intake

Flood
The overflowing of the normal confines
of a stream or other body of water, or the
accumulation of water over areas not normally
submerged. Floods include river (fluvial)
floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial
floods, sewer floods, coastal floods and glacial
lake outburst floods. 423

Food and agricultural marketing
This includes collective schemes for
post-production facilities and other services
designed to improve the marketing environment

environmental, political, societal and security
– and measures each through the accumulation
and combination of risks and capacity.
See OECD (2016). 431

by individuals is the result of good care and
feeding practices, food preparation, dietary
diversity and intra-household distribution of
food, and access to clean water, sanitation and
healthcare. Combined with good biological
utilization of food consumed, this determines
the nutritional status of individuals.
d. Stability – If the dimensions of availability,
access and utilization are sufficiently met,
stability is the condition in which the whole
system is stable, thus ensuring that households
are food secure at all times. Stability issues
can refer to short-term instability (which can
lead to acute food insecurity) or mediumto long-term instability (which can lead to
chronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic,
social and political factors can all be a source
of instability.
The report also refers to two additional
dimensions of food security that are proposed
by the High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) of
the Committee on World Food Security (CFS);
however, they are not formally agreed upon
by FAO or others, and there is not a negotiated
agreed upon language. However, due to
their relevance in the context of this report,
they are included here. These two additional
dimensions of food security are reinforced in
conceptual and legal understandings of the
right to food and are currently referred to and
defined as follows:
e. Agency refers to the capacity of individuals
or groups to make their own decisions about
what foods they eat; what foods they produce;
how that food is produced, processed and
distributed within food systems; and their
ability to engage in processes that shape food
system policies and governance. 430
f. Sustainability refers to the long-term ability
of food systems to provide food security and
nutrition in a way that does not compromise
the economic, social and environmental bases
that generate food security and nutrition for
future generations. 430

General services support (GSS)
Refers to public expenditure (or budget
transfers) for the provision of public or collective
goods and services that aim to create enabling
and environmentally sustainable conditions for
the food and agricultural sector. These services
connect all economic actors of food supply
chains and support the nexus between producers
and consumers. The most common services
part of GSS include R&D and knowledge
transfer, inspection services, agricultural related
infrastructure, public stockholding, and food
and agricultural marketing, and promotion.

Governance
Governance refers to formal and informal rules,
organizations, and processes through which
public and private actors articulate their interests
and make and implement decisions. 330

Hazard
A process, phenomenon or human activity that
may cause loss of life, injury or other health
impacts, property damage, social and economic
disruption or environmental degradation. 432
Natural hazard is synonymous with “climate
shock” in this report.

Healthcare
The organized provision of medical care to
individuals or a community. This includes
services provided to individuals or communities
by health service providers for the purpose
of promoting, maintaining, monitoring or
restoring health.

Healthy diets
Healthy diets: 1) start early in life with
early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive
breastfeeding until six months of age, and
continued breastfeeding until two years of
age and beyond combined with appropriate
complementary feeding; 2) are based on a great
variety of unprocessed or minimally processed
foods, balanced across food groups, while
restricting highly processed food and drink
products; 3) include wholegrains, legumes, nuts

Fragility
Fragility is defined as the combination of
exposure to risk and insufficient coping
capacities of the state, system and/or
communities to manage, absorb or mitigate those
risks. The new OECD fragility framework is
built on five dimensions of fragility – economic,
| 203 |

ANNEX 7

Macronutrients

and an abundance and variety of fruits and
vegetables; 4) can include moderate amounts of
eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, and small amounts
of red meat; 5) include safe and clean drinking
water as the fluid of choice; 6) are adequate (i.e.
reaching but not exceeding needs) in energy
and nutrients for growth and development and
meet the needs for an active and healthy life
across the life cycle; 7) are consistent with WHO
guidelines to reduce the risk of diet‑related
NCDs and ensure health and well-being for the
general population; and 8) contain minimal levels
or none, if possible, of pathogens, toxins and
other agents that can cause foodborne disease.
According to WHO, healthy diets include less
than 30 percent of total energy intake from
fats, with a shift in fat consumption away
from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and the
elimination of industrial transfats; less than
10 percent of total energy intake from free sugars
(preferably less than 5 percent); consumption of at
least 400 g of fruits and vegetables per day; and
not more than 5 g per day of salt (to be iodized).

Macronutrients are needed in larger quantities
(in gram range) and are the major source
of energy and bulk (volume) in our diets.
They include carbohydrates, protein and fats.
They are a main source of dietary energy, which
is measured in calories. Getting sufficient energy
is essential for everyone in order to maintain
body growth, development and good health.
Carbohydrates, protein and fats, in addition
to providing energy, each have very specific
functions in the body and must be supplied in
sufficient amounts to carry out those functions.

Malnutrition
An abnormal physiological condition caused
by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake
of macronutrients and/or micronutrients.
Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child
stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral
deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.

Micronutrients
Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals
and are required in very small (micro) but
specific amounts. Vitamins and minerals in
foods are necessary for the body to grow,
develop and function properly, and are essential
for our health and well-being. Our bodies
require a number of different vitamins and
minerals, each of which has a specific function
in the body and must be supplied in different,
sufficient amounts.

Highly processed foods
Highly processed foods are foods that have been
industrially prepared, including those from
bakeries and catering outlets, and which require
no or minimal domestic preparation apart from
heating and cooking (such as bread, breakfast
cereals, cheese, commercial sauces, canned foods
including jams, commercial cakes, processed
meats, biscuits and sauces). 433 Highly processed
foods can contain very high quantities of salt,
free sugars and saturated or transfats and these
products, when consumed in high amounts, can
undermine diet quality.

Moderate food insecurity
Refers to the level of severity of food insecurity,
based on the FIES, at which people face
uncertainties about their ability to obtain food
and have been forced to reduce, at times during
the year, the quality and/or quantity of food
they consume due to lack of money or other
resources. It thus refers to a lack of consistent
access to food, which diminishes dietary quality,
disrupts normal eating patterns, and can have
negative consequences for nutrition, health and
well-being.

Hunger
Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical
sensation caused by insufficient consumption of
dietary energy. In this report, the term hunger is
synonymous with chronic undernourishment and
is measured by the PoU.

Input subsidies
Government transfers to agricultural producers
arising from policy measures based on farm use
of inputs, or measures related to the provision
of inputs.

Nominal rate of assistance (NRA)
The NRA indicator measures transfers made to
farmers individually arising from price incentives
generated by trade and market policies and fiscal
subsidies. In other words, the NRA accounts for
| 204 |

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2022

the price gap at the farm gate (i.e. the difference
between the producer price and the undistorted
reference price) and the fiscal subsidies
provided to producers, which are usually
commodity specific.

foods, the presence of nutrients of public health
concern including saturated fats, free sugars,
and salt/sodium is minimized, industrially
produced transfats are eliminated, and salt
is iodized.

Nominal rate of protection (NRP)

Output subsidies

The NRP indicator measures the extent to
which trade and market policies raise or
lower the producer price of a commodity
above or below the international reference
price. As such, it measures how such policies
incentivize (i.e. protect) or disincentivize (i.e.
penalize) producers. It is therefore the measure
used to estimate price incentives provided to
agricultural producers.

Government transfers based on the level
of the production (output) of a specific
agricultural commodity.

Overweight and obesity
Defined as body weight that is above normal for
height as a result of an excessive accumulation
of fat. It is usually a manifestation of expending
less energy than is consumed. In adults,
overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or
more, and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or more.
In children under five years of age, overweight
is defined as weight-for-height greater than
2 SD above the WHO Child Growth Standards
median, and obesity as weight-for-height
greater than 3 SD above the WHO Child Growth
Standards median. 435

Non-tariff measures (NTMs)
NTMs have been broadly defined as “(…) policy
measures, other than ordinary customs tariffs,
that can potentially have an economic effect on
international trade in goods, changing quantities
traded, or prices or both”. 434

Nutrition transition

Political economy

As incomes rise and populations become more
urban, diets high in complex carbohydrates and
fibre give way to more energy-dense diets high
in fats, sugars and/or salt. These global dietary
trends are accompanied by a demographic
transition with a shift towards increased life
expectancy and reduced fertility rates. At the
same time, disease patterns move away from
infectious and nutrient-deficiency diseases
towards higher rates of overweight and obesity
and diet-related NCDs including coronary
heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types
of cancer.

The social, economic, cultural and political
factors that structure, sustain and transform
constellations of public and private actors,
and their interests and relations over time.
It affects the type of political and institutional
reforms needed to enable and facilitate policy
support. 327,328

Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU)
An estimate of the proportion of the population
that lacks enough dietary energy for a healthy,
active life. It is FAO’s traditional indicator used to
monitor hunger at the global and regional level,
as well as SDG Indicator 2.1.1.

Nutritional status
The physiological state of an individual that
results from the relationship between nutrient
intake and requirements and the body’s ability
to digest, absorb and use these nutrients.

Public food stockholding
Public food stockholding refers to the
procurement, storage and release of food stocks
by governments through state-owned enterprises
or other public agencies. Expenditure on
public food stockholding covers the costs of
maintaining and managing these food stocks
created through market purchase interventions,
as well as strategic reserves built for food
security purposes.71

Nutritious foods
Are referred to as safe foods that contribute
essential nutrients such as vitamins and
minerals (micronutrients), fibre and other
components to healthy diets that are beneficial
for growth, and health and development,
guarding against malnutrition. In nutritious

Resilience

Undernourishment

Resilience is the ability of individuals,
households, communities, cities, institutions,
systems and societies to prevent, resist, absorb,
adapt, respond and recover positively, efficiently
and effectively when faced with a wide range of
risks, while maintaining an acceptable level of
functioning and without compromising long-term
prospects for sustainable development, peace and
security, human rights and well-being for all. 436

Undernourishment is defined as the condition in
which an individual’s habitual food consumption
is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary
energy required to maintain a normal, active,
healthy life. For the purposes of this report,
hunger is defined as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment. The PoU is used to
measure hunger.

Risk

The outcome of poor nutritional intake in
terms of quantity and/or quality, and/or
poor absorption and/or poor biological use
of nutrients consumed as a result of repeated
instances of disease. It includes being
underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s
age (stunted), dangerously thin for one’s height
(suffering from wasting) or deficient in vitamins
and minerals (micronutrient deficiency).

Undernutrition

The probability or likelihood of occurrence
of hazardous events or trends multiplied by
the impacts if these events or trends occur.
Risk to food insecurity is the probability of food
insecurity resulting from interactions between a
natural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress
and vulnerable conditions.

Severe food insecurity

Vulnerability

The level of severity of food insecurity at which
people have likely run out of food, experienced
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for
days without eating, putting their health and
well-being at grave risk, based on the FIES.

Refers to the conditions determined by physical,
social, economic and environmental factors or
processes that increase the susceptibility of an
individual, community, assets or systems to
the impacts of hazards. 432 Vulnerability to food
insecurity is the range of conditions that increases
the susceptibility of a household to the impact on
food security in case of a shock or hazard.

Staple food
A staple food is one that is eaten regularly, and
in such quantities as to constitute the dominant
part of the diet and supply a major proportion
of total dietary energy. The main kinds of staple
foods are cereals (e.g. rice, maize, wheat, rye,
barley, oats, millet, sorghum), roots and tubers
(e.g. potatoes, cassava, yams) and legumes (e.g.
beans, lentils, soybean). 450

Wasting
Low weight-for-height, generally the result of
weight loss associated with a recent period of
inadequate dietary energy intake and/or disease.
In children under five years of age, wasting is
defined as weight‑for‑height less than -2 SD below
the WHO Child Growth Standards median.

Stunting
Low height-for-age, reflecting a past episode or
episodes of sustained undernutrition. In children
under five years of age, stunting is defined as
height-for-age less than -2 SD below the WHO
Child Growth Standards median.

Weather
Weather describes conditions of the atmosphere
over a short period of time (minutes to days),
whereas climate is how the atmosphere
behaves over relatively longer periods of time
(the long-term average of weather over time).
The difference between weather and climate is a
measure of time (see above definitions for climate,
climate change, climate variability and climate
extremes). 438 n

Tariff
A tariff is a tax imposed on a good imported
into a country. A tariff may be specific, when it
is levied as a fixed sum per unit of the imported
good, or ad valorem, when it is applied at a
percentage rate with reference to the value of the
import. 437

THE STATE OF

FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
IN THE WORLD
REPURPOSING FOOD AND
AGRICULTURAL POLICIES TO MAKE
HEALTHY DIETS MORE AFFORDABLE

This year’s report should dispel any lingering doubts that the world is moving backwards in its efforts to
end hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms. We are now only eight years away from
2030, but the distance to reach many of the SDG 2 targets is growing wider each year. There are indeed
efforts to make progress towards SDG 2, yet they are proving insufficient in the face of a more
challenging and uncertain context. The intensification of the major drivers behind recent food
insecurity and malnutrition trends (i.e. conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks) combined with
the high cost of nutritious foods and growing inequalities will continue to challenge food security and
nutrition. This will be the case until agrifood systems are transformed, become more resilient and are
delivering lower cost nutritious foods and affordable healthy diets for all, sustainably and inclusively.
Early in the report, the latest updates of the food security and nutrition situation around the world are
presented, including updated estimates on the cost and affordability of a healthy diet. The report
acknowledges the current recessionary context, which makes it even more challenging for many
governments to increase their budgets to invest in the agrifood systems transformation that their
countries need to achieve SDG 2. Hence, the report then takes a deep dive into how governments are
supporting the food and agriculture sector through policies, and based on evidence, it provides
recommendations.
A stocktaking of the most predominant food and agricultural policy support currently in place around
the world is presented to better understand the amount of support, the activities and actors mostly
supported (or, on the contrary, penalized), and the pathways through which this support is pushing up
the relative cost of nutritious foods and promoting unhealthy diets. Then guidance – based on analysis
and evidence – is provided on alternative combinations of food and agricultural policy support that can
help to reduce the cost of nutritious foods, as well as on how the resulting trade-offs need to be
managed to ensure agrifood systems are not only more efficient, but also more sustainable and
inclusive. A key recommendation is that governments must start rethinking how they can reallocate
their existing public budgets to make them more cost-effective and efficient in reducing the cost of
nutritious foods and increasing the availability and affordability of healthy diets, sustainably and
leaving no one behind. Lastly, the report takes a close look at the complementing policies, within and
outside agrifood systems, that are important to support repurposing efforts and at the political
economy factors and dynamics that hamper or facilitate repurposing efforts.
